NTARY   1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE HOME SECRETARY said that a group of Ministers, under his chairmanship, had given preliminary consideration to the report ofan interdepartmental working group on human rights and had decidedto recommend to their Cabinet colleagues that it should be published as a consultation document.    The report was neutral in tone andraised questions for discussion, without making any proposals.    Hehad however since heard that the Opposition in the House of Lordsintended to move a Motion that afternoon to refer to a SelectCommittee Lord Wade&apos;s Bill of Rights Bill.    This would be undesirable and could probably be avoided if the Government couldstate an intention to publish a consultation document of their own.He therefore sought the Cabinet&apos;s agreement In principle to thepublication of such a document, the text of which he would circulate toMs colleagues for any comments they might have.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle to the publication of a consultationdocument on human rights and that this intention could be mentioned inthe debate on Lord Wade&apos;e Bill.    The Home Secretary would circulate the proposed text of the document to Cabinet for consldera-tion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister &apos;summing up of their discussion.1
eslaffaferencetConclusions,2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatfavourable reactions to the statement he had made in the House ofCommons had come in from such diverse sources as the SouthAfrican Government, President Nyerere of Tanzania and the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger.    The South Africans had said that Rhodesia would rapidly feel the effect of the economicstranglehold on her.    The South African railway capacity available to rhodesia was not being increased: the Rhode elans would be hard hit by a 40-50 per cent reduction in their traffic, combined with a 30 percent increase in their transport costs.    The two who had rejected his statement were Mr Smith and Mr Nkomo: the former was to beexpected, but the latter had reacted foolishly.    The four AfricanPresidents might by now have calmed him down.    Our tactics wouldbe to maintain pressure on Mr Smith.    There would be no moreoffers to him from us and he would be left to face his growingdifficulties.   Either the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, Mr Ennals, or a senior official might go outsoon to Tanzania to discuss the situation with President Nyerere.via the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSoviet Union was continuing to play a helpful role.    The soviet foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko, had admitted that he was having some difficulties in Mb relations with the Angolans and he had not yet beenable to extract from them the assurances the South Africans had asked for, but he had given his own &quot;Informal&quot; view that the Angolanswould accept South Afrlca&apos;s requirements.    As this amounted to a pledge of Soviet intentions to use their influence on the President ofthe Peoples Republic of Angola, Mr Neto, he had recommended to theSouth Africans that they should withdraw their troops even withoutconfirmation of the assurances.    Meanwhile the Russians werejoining with us in efforts to defer a debate in the United Nations.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatdisturbing reports had recently come in that there was a possibility of intervention by regular Syrian forces.    The danger was that this might prompt an Israeli reaction.    In that case the situation in the lebanon might be even worse than the anarchy it was at presentsuffering.    He had discussed the problem with the Soviet ForeignMinister, Mr Gromyko, whose presence in London at this time hadbeen very valuable.    Mr Gromyko had been ill-informed about thesituation but after contacting Moscow he had promised that the soviet union would use its influence in Arab capitals to caution moderationand had asked us to give similar advice to the Israelis,
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSoviet side were deliberately playing the visit of the Soviet ForeignMinister, Mr Gromyko, in a low key; for instance by reacting verymildly to representations on certain of their internal policies whichthey could have treated as provocative.    On the commercial front, hehad warned Mr Gromyko that the British economy was beginning topick up and that order books were beginning to lengthen.    This meant that the Soviet Union might find themselves faced with capacityconstraints in British industry if they deferred placing orders here.Mr Gromyko had assured him that Soviet orders would be placed inthe very near future to make maximum use of British credit availableto them.    It was clear that this Soviet decision stemmed from theimprovement there had been In British-Soviet political relations.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the nigerian Federal Commissioner for External Affairs, Colonel Garba,had brought to London a letter from the Nigerian Head of State to thePrime Minister,    It was eleverly worded to avoid the wordextradition, but ft was clear nevertheleaB that the Nigerians wantedGeneral Gowon extradited.   He had explained to Colonel Garba thelegal procedures stemming from the Fugitive Offenders Act and had warned him that, while the decision was nothing to do with him, it seemed very doubtful whether a request for extradition would have any chance of succeeding.    His hope was that in the light of thisColonel Garba would return to Nigeria and advise against extraditionproceedings.    It had been evident from his talk with Colonel Garbathat the Nigerian Government were now satisfied that Britain had hadno part In the attempted coup, but he thought them unscrupulousenough to suggest otherwise if It suited their purpose.    From theevidence available to us, it seemed that General Gowon had beenindiscreet In his meetings with those involved In the plot, although wehad no proof mat he had himself been involved in It,    hi the light of this,we might find It necessary to restrict his future activities through some kind of gentleman&apos;s agreement with him.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
3.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(76) 34) to which was attached a memorandum by theTreasury and the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) on public expenditure priorities.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, in setting theguidelines for the forthcoming Public Expenditure Survey, he proposedthat the Cabinet should maintain the general priorities betweenprogrammes agreed in December and embodied In the recently published White Paper (Cmnd 6393),    This would not precludeadjustments being made at a later stage of this year&apos;s  exercise.    Inparticular, it would be necessary to consider - and as far as possibleto quantify - the cost of the Governments industrial strategy.    Inthis connection, he noted that the results of the sectoral studies whichwere being carried out under the aegis of the National economic development Council (NEDC) would not be available until June: thatthere were serious problems ahead in the shipbuilding industry; andthat a Programme Analysis and Review was in train on regional policy.    It was necessary for officials to consider the financial implications of all of these.    On local authority expenditure,Ministers might have to look afresh at the open -end edness of suchcommitments as that on housing, as well as absorbing the outcome ofthe decisions arising from the Layfield Report.    In the centralGovernment field, there was difficulty - as had been foreseen - in achieving the reductions in Civil Service manpower which had formed part of the cuts agreed at the end of 1975, and this too would need to betaken into account.    Although the 1976 Survey was based on themaintenance of existing priorities, the Cabinet might wish to reviewpriorities in the course of the 1977 Survey and there were a number of major reviews under way which would help focus these discussions.hi discussion there was general agreement that for the time being a continuation of existing priorities was the right course, but it wasnoted that there would be both scope and need for various adjustmentslater in the year.    On the industrial strategy, the hope was expressed that it might be possible to get rather more precision into theestimates of cost, but it was recognised that inevitably there would remain some potential demand on the Contingency Reserve.    It waspointed out that the shipbuilding industry was not the only place whereserious trouble was in prospect, and that the heavy electrical industry,suffering from the reduced need for generating equipment following the increase in energy prices, was also likely to be in serious difficulty.    It was to be hoped that the sectoral studies coming up fromthe NEDC would be something more than a series of calls for moreGovernment money, and it would be important to hold the situation there.    In thiB connection a critical look should be taken at the automatic assistance which was given under regional policy, some ofwhich might perhaps be more beneficially devoted to assistance to particular industries.
In the course of further discussion the following points were made -a. At the Cabinet meeting on 4 August 1975 it had beenagreed that high priority should be accorded to dealing withthe problems of inner city areas.    The formula cuts appliedto the Urban Programme ran counter to this idea and had meta good deal of criticism.    This question would have to bere-examined in the light of the forthcoming report by officials.b. The charts attached to C(76) 34 were misleadingbecause they were expressed in volume terms and not in costterms, and thus took no account of the relative price effect.One consequence of this was to make the Social Securityprogramme appear to be expanding much more rapidly inrelation to other programmes than was in face the case.Fresh charts on a cost basis should be prepared and madeavailable.c. The Social Security figure in Chart A in any case neededinterpretation.    Of the increase of  1,800 million between the1973 and 1976 White Papers,  400 million was directlyattributable to the higher level of unemployment; and 1,100 million to the special upratlng in July 1974; so that only 300 million was left for further improvements.d. At their meeting in December 1975 the Cabinet had agreed that work should be done to identify potential policy changes which could only come to fruition in the longer term.This aspect of the Public Expenditure exercise must be pressed ahead with some energy otherwise useful savingsmight be missed and the present unsatisfactory tendency tomake adjustments across the board would be perpetuated.e. The expenditure priorities in Northern Ireland werenot necessarily identical with those in the rest of the UnitedKingdom.   At the present time, for example, expenditure on industrial regeneration would rank higher than that on housing, and due flexibility must be allowed in setting public expenditure figures,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that there should be no change in public expenditure priorities at the present stage and that the 1976 public expenditure Survey should be based on the priorities which had beendecided in December and embodied in the White Paper published InFebruary.    They noted the difficulties on industrial expenditure, and agreed that local authority current expenditure and expenditure onopen-ended programmes such as housing, would need to be closely5
monitored.    The charts attached to the paper were interesting butthe Treasury and CPRS should prepare a version in cost terms so thatthe consequence s of applying the relative price effect could be seen.The Cabinet had already agreed that potential policy changes coming to fruition in the longer term should be identified in order to produce amore effective discussion of priorities; this work should be pressedahead energetically.    In addition, a number of major reviews were already in hand and the results of these would be available for thediscussion of priorities In the course of next year&apos;a Survey.    any minister who had suggestions for further reviews should put them tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up.2.        Agreed that the forthcoming public expenditure Survey should be based on theexpenditure priorities embodied in the recently published White Paper, Cmnd 6393.3.        Agreed that, while Industrial expenditure should be quantified as far as possible and includedin the relevant programme, much of it mustnecessarily remain a potential claim on the contingency Reserve.4,        Agreed that local authority current expenditure and open-ended programmes, such ashousing, would need to be very closely monitoredby the Departments concerned.5.        Took note that a number of policy reviewswere in hand, and invited any Minister who wishedto make suggestions for further work to send themto the Chancellor of the Exchequer.6,        Agreed that the work on potential policy changes which would come to fruition in the longer term should be pressed ahead.6
: PUBLIC5 Expenditurev JJRVEYdeviousence:^(76) 9thdelusions,Minute 44.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(76) 35) about the basis on which the1976 Public Expenditure Survey should be conducted,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that for the years upto and including 1979-80, the ground rules which were set out in the annex to his memorandum made provision for the figures in theforthcoming Survey to be essentially the same as those embodied inthe February White Paper, subject to any agreed policy or estimatingchanges and to revaluation to 1976 Survey prices.    They also provided for Departments to specify, as possible options, what theeffect would be ef reductions of l\ per cent in 1977-78 and 5 per centIn the later years.    Material of this kind was essential if ministers were to have any scope later in the year, when they came to take thenext round of decisions, for adding to some programmes while maintaining the overall objective of no change.    For 1980-81, which came into the Survey for the first time, he proposed that. In view ofthe great uncertainties In the medium-term economic outlook, the1979-80 figures should be used as a base but he did not rule out thepossibility that the situation might be reviewed later this year.    the annex suggested the possibility of starting the Survey on 26 March,but it would probably be better to start It on 6 April, so that theeffects of the Budget could be taken Into account.    The aim would beto complete the Survey by the end of June so that Ministers couldconsider the results in July and take decisions in time for publicationof the White Paper in November,In discussion it was emphasised that it was important to agree that the objective of the exercise was to achieve a standstill in total public expenditure.    There was a danger, judging from past experience, thatthe l\ per cent and 5 per cent options would all too easily become firmcommitments.    It was argued that the proposal to display further reductions was unreasonable, since Departments had yielded up in thelast round of cuts every penny which could be offered.    This was particularly true of Education and Defence where even cuts of 21 percent could produce options that were politically unacceptable.In further discussion it was pointed out that the timetable proposed wasbo compressed as to be almost unmanageable.    It was understood thatthe Treasury were asking for the standard figures by 15 April and forfigures for the illustrative reductions by 30 April.    There was agreat risk that figures produced so hurriedly would be veryunreliable; and there was the serious difficulty that the result of theexercise designed to reduce Civil Service numbers would not be knownuntil after the date when the figures for options should be submitted.It was, however, recognised that completion of the exercise by the endof June was a target which might in the event have to be adjusted.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that whatwas proposed was essentially a standstill exercise, and after theexperience of 1975 this was clearly not unwelcome to the Cabinet.The particular points which had been raised would be noted, but theCabinet were broadly content with the proposals which had been putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.2.        Approved the ground rules for the 1976Public Expenditure Survey as set out in the annex to the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper C(76) 35,iJlVATEJ^ACTICEJ*THE&apos;. J^TIONAL  JjpALTH-***VXCE^ ?*ViousJ*ference::JC(76) 6th,s illusions,Vte 65,        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (C(76) 40) containing proposals for statutory control of the private hospital sector.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that on19 February the Cabinet had agreed that a Bill embodying the&quot;Goodman&quot; proposals for phasing out pay beds should be introduced before Easter, and that she should publish at the same time a white paper on the control of developments in the private hospital sector.Subject to further consultations with the medical professions, an amendment providing for control over the private sector could then beintroduced at the Report Stage of the Bill.    She had subsequently been advised that it would be procedurally impossible to introduce such an amendment on Report, since the amendment would be outside the scopeof a Bill which contained no provision on the control of the private sector when introduced.    There had now been intensive andexhaustive consultations with the professions and representatives ofthe private sector by her and her officials and by Lord Goodman.Lord Goodman accepted that his package of proposals recognised theneed for the Government to be satisfied that private sectordevelopments would not damage the National Health Service (NHS) andthat this would involve statutory powers - either to support a voluntary agreement or in default of such an agreement.   He also recognisedthat, because of the procedural difficulty, some powers would have tobe Included in the BiH at the outset,    ft was clear that the british medical Association and the professions would not put forward a voluntary scheme, but the Independent Hospitals Group (IHG) wereprepared to consider the possibility of supervision of private sectordevelopments by the independent Board,    Last night Lord Goodmanhad met representatives of all the interests, who had been
accompanied by Dr Gerald Vaughan MP, which underlined the highlypolitical approach being adopted.    The proposed scheme of control setout In paragraph 6 of her paper might well prove acceptable to theZHG, though there might be difficulty in reaching agreement on the size of new developments which would be subject to control; and the consultants might then fall into line, although they had retained their freedom to oppose the Goodman package and in particular to ignore the key provision that the Government must be satisfied that privatedevelopments would not damage the NHS.    Her proposals would give to the independent Board the responsibility for deciding whether aparticular private development would endanger the service which the nhs gave to its patients, and developments outside the acute sector ofmedicine or which were for less than 75 beds would automatically be exempt.    There would be no control over the total size of the private sector.    These proposals would make considerable concessions to the professions, making It the more important not to make further concessions on the size of development subject to control.    75 bedshad been accepted by the Social Services Committee last November.-As Annex B of the paper showed, 19 out of 26 applications known toher Department were for fewer than 75 beds, and Lord Goodman had accepted this as a cogent argument, which he would be putting to theIHG in further discussion that morning.    In the light of later information, 75 beds was if anything too high; a hospital of this sizewould demand considerable skilled manpower, and 38 per cent of NHShospitals (nearly, 1, 000 in all) had 30 beds or less.    An alternative would be to exempt developments of less than 100 beds In London and less than 50 beds in the provinces.In discussion of whether detailed powers of control over the private sector should be Included in the BUI as Introduced, it was suggestedthat, although the medical professions were unwilling themselves toput forward a scheme of voluntary control, they might he willing totake part in discussion of such a scheme; and this possibility shouldbe explored before tabling a detailed scheme of control.    There wasa belief in the professions that the Government wished to squeeze outprivate practice completely.    Friction between the Government and the professions would cause mo re damage to the NHS, which had survivedhitherto In the absence of any control over the private sector, than theestablishment of a few private hospitals.    It was important that theGovernment should continue to show willingness to talk to the professions, however unreasonable their attitude or political theirmotivation.    On the other hand,  it was pointed out that Lord Goodmanhad not advised further consultations on the possibility of a voluntaryscheme.    The Bill had to be introduced by Easter and must containsome kind of provision on the control of the private sector If thismatter was to be dealt with during the present Session; there couldbe no question of introducing a second Bill on the private sector even
later in the Session; and if this Session&apos;s legislation wore restricted to the phasing out of pay beds there might then be a rush of applications for private developments.    If further discussions wereto indicate that a voluntary scheme might after all be possible, this possibility could be taken Into account at the time and the Billamended accordingly.    It had been made clear in Parliament thatthe future of private practice generally could be considered by theRoyal Commission.In discussion of the maximum sise of private sector development to be automatically exempt from the controls, it was suggested that the 75bed criterion would result in automatic approval for small hospitalswith poor facilities, whereas larger hospitals which could commandspecialist facilities and cater for the considerable and importantdemand from overseas, eg from the Middle East, for treatment inthis country might not be approved.    It was pointed out, however,that developments of 75 beds or more would only be refused if the/would be damaging to the NHS, and that access to NHS pay bedswould remain possible under the package in relation to specialistfacilities.    The suggestion was also made that it might be preferable to set a higher figure, such as 150 or 125 beds, and to say that this figure would be reviewed if there was an excessive number of applications.    Against this, it was pointed out that the NHS unions would regard the concessions already made as going too far, andany further concessions would lead to great difficulty with them.Another possibility would be to lay down a number of beds for an arearather than for each individual development.    It would be desirable toguard against the possibility of several developments of just under75 bedB in close proximity to each other in an area set aside by a planning authority for private hospitals.    The figure which definedwhether or not a development was subject to control would be a fundamental part of the scheme and would have to be specified in theBill Itself.Other points made in discussion were -a. Grounds of appeal and the avenue of appeal werematters of substance, not suitable to be dealt with by regulation rather than in the Bill itself.b. The controls were unlikely to have any practical effect in Scotland, where the largest private hospital had less than45 beds and there had been no applications for development,c. There might be difficulty in getting these proposalsthrough Parliament, where all the Opposition Parties were likely to vote against.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, in view of the technical advice which had beengiven on the scope of the Bill, and in the light of the consultations which had taken place since the last Cabinet discussion, the right course would be to include In the Bill to be introduced before Easterthe detailed proposals for control of the private sector set out in thepaper by the Secretary of State for Social Services.    The questionwhat size of development should be exempt from control was a difficult one on which Lord Goodman was still in consultation withrepresentatives of the private sector.    The view of the Cabinet wasthat developments of fewer than 100 beds in London, and fewer than75 beds elsewhere, should be exempt, unless the outcome ofLord Goodman18 latest consultations suggested otherwise.    TheSecretary of State for Social Services should report the outcome ofthese consultations to her Cabinet colleagues.    The Cabinet agreedthat an explanation of the control arrangements should be published at the same time as the Bill.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.6,        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Borne Department (C(76) 39) about the issue of medalson the occasion of The Queers Silver Jubilee.THE HOME SECRETARY said that The Queen*s Silver JubileeCommittee had decided against a general issue of Jubilee medals suchas had traditionally been made on occasions of this kind.    Thedecision had been taken mainly on financial grounds but also because there had been a feeling In the Committee that a general issue ofmedals was, in this day and age, no longer appropriate.    TheSecretary of State for Defence, however, had taken the view thatmedals should be issued at least to the Armed Forces.    TheOfficial Committee had therefore been asked to consider whether itwould be practicable and desirable to issue a medal to the armed forces without including civilian services, and, if not, at whatpoint in the range of civilian services a line could suitably be drawn.The Official Committee had recommended that it would be invidious,and cause a good deal of resentment, to issue a medal to the armed forces and some civilian services and not to others,    A clear majority of the Ministerial Committee had concluded therefore thatno medal should be issued.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he felt strongly that a Jubilee medal should be struck for the Armed Forces.    Thiswas a long established tradition which had been honoured at everycoronation and jubilee since 1887, and It was an appropriate recognitionof the special Hake of the Forces with the Crown.   The issue of, amedal would also have a special significance for the Forces sincemedal ribbons were worn daily on uniforms, and it was the case thatthe opportunities for earning a medal were nowadays very limited.At the Coronation the Issue of medals had extended to only 3 per cent of the uniformed strength of the Forces, and he could accept a similarlimitation for the Jubilee, at an estimated cost of  67,000 which hewas ready to meet from his Ministry^ vote.    In his view, it would bedifficult to justify the withholding of a medal for such a relatively small sum, particularly since the Armed Forces would be heavilyinvolved In carrying out ceremonial duties during the Jubileecelebrations,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up a briefdiscussion, said that a majority of the Cabinet agreed that a fobileemedal should be issued to the Armed Forces on the basis proposed bythe Secretary of State for Defence.   Difficulty was however seen inexcluding all the civilian services, in particular the police.    officials should therefore. In the light of the Cabinets decision on the issue of amedal to the Armed Forces, reconsider the feasibility of Issuingmedals to certain civilian services and not to others.    ministers would then decide whether medals should be distributed more widelythan to the Armed Forces and. If so, how far.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the Lord President ofthe Council&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office25 March 197612
