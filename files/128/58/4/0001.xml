1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Commission of the European Economic Community (e.c.)had issued its Opinion on Greece&apos;s application for membership ofthe Community.    The Commission recommended a clearaffirmative reply to the Greek request and the opening of negotiationsfor accession.    But it also referred to political problems inrelation to Turkey and Cyprus, and to the economic and financial difficulties that Greek accession would create.    It therefore proposed a preparatory pre-accession period.    The Greeks hadreacted strongly against the Opinion, especially in view of the reference to Turkey, and were lobbying hard in e.c. capitals.The French had supported them at once and subsequently theWest Germans and the Dutch had said that there should be nopre-accession period,    hi the circumstances, and given our publiccommitment to the principle of Greek accession, we should not put ourselves in a minority of one by opposing the opening of negotiations for accession, though we coold envisage a long periodof negotiation.In discussion it was argued that the question of Greek membership of the e.c. could not be decided without proper study of the wholequestion of the further enlargement of the e.c., including the implications of accepting Greek membership for considering laterapplications from such countries as Turkey, Spain and Portugal.There seemed to have been no study so far of me enlargementproblem in general, either by the British Government or by the eec.   As regards Greek membership, there were of coursearguments for it but the economic consequences for us could beadverse, and it could strengthen the protectionist and inward-lookingelements in the Community,    These adverse consequences wouldbe reinforced if Greece were followed by a number of southernEuropean countries, whose economic and social structure differed from that of existing members of the e.c..    In his report on european Union M Tlndemans had suggested a system of two-tiermembership of the Community,   Although there weredisadvantages in that concept as applied to existing members, itmight be inevitable if the e.c. were enlarged.    This aspect shouldbe further considered, as should the position of countries such asIran, who were seeking something more than a trading andco-operation agreement with the Community but less than full membership.1
It was pointed out however that, while there would be advantage in the Cabinet considering, on the basis of a properly-preparedanalysis,, the whole question of the enlargement of the e.c., itwould be important to avoid appearing publicly to take the leadagainst enlargement.    Any discussion with the Foreign ministers of other Member States on this matter would have to be on aprivate basis.    The economic disadvantages of Greek accessionwere generally recognised, and had been brought out in theCommission&apos;s Opinion, but no Member State would wish toemphasise this aspect publicly, and in the end many of them would decide their policies on this matter on political, rather thaneconomic, considerations.Spain THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a recent speech by the Spanish Prime Minister, Senor Arias, onSpain&apos;8 constitutional future had not gone beyond generalities, but other Spanish Ministers had spoken out more clearly about suchessential reforms as universal suffrage.    We must not expectmiracles overnight, but if the programme went forward as plannedthere was a real possibility that in about 16 months&apos; time Spainmight have something approaching a respectable democraticstructure, with a bicameral legislature based on universal suffrage.The Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Areilza, who was regardedas a &quot;liberal&apos;! was paying visits to Western European capitals:and would be coming to London on 2 March.    This could providethe opportunity for a valuable discussion.    He would himself raisethe questions of universal suffrage and the position of trade unions in Spain and would also mention Gibraltar.    In the european economic Community he would not oppose negotiations with Spainon tariff reductions but would work for them to take place on abasis which would suit the United Kingdom&apos;s interests.    He would report to Cabinet again after his meeting with the Spanish ForeignMinister.tcelandPreviousrence:CC(7fe) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad little to add to the report he had made to the House of commons on the previous day.    There had been a message through our ambassador from the Icelandic Foreign Minister, Mr Agustsson,requesting that our trawlers should continue to haul when soinstructed by the Icelandic coast guard.    He had sent a reply tothe effect that we would need a clear understanding of thecircumstances in which requests to haul would be issued.    Frankly,he did not expect a satisfactory answer; the purpose of his reply had been to put responsibility back on the Icelanders.    He had2
briefed all the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)Ambassadors and it was his hope that other NATO countries wouldadopt at least a neutral attitude to the dispute.    He thought that itwas inevitable that the Icelandic Government would soon break offdiplomatic relations with us, but he believed that they would seethe dangers of isolation and would therefore think hard before deciding to withdraw from NATO.    He considered that there wast. need for Minirters collectively to examine the long term problemsof our fishing industry.    He would circulate to the Cabinet, for theinformation of members, the details of the offer we had mada tothe Icelandic Government.Rhodesia THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA LTH SECRETARY said thatMr Nkomo. who had taken the initiative in a sking to come to London,had given him two documents tabled in his talks with Mr Ian Smith.Mr Nkomo was dubious about the prospects for these talks, butwanted to keep them going and had sought our help in bringing otherpressure to bear on Mr Smith.    He had asked us to transmit thetwo documents to Mr Vorster, the Prime Minister of South Africa,and the Prime Minister had agreed also to send a message toMr Vorster urging that he should press Mr Smith to make concessions to avoid dangerous guerilla activity.    At Mr Nkomo&apos;8request he had also agreed to send the two documents to dr Kissinger, asking him to apply pressure on South Africa.    Hewould be keeping in touch with Mr Nkomo.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that onthe previous day the unarmed Royal Research Ship Shackleton hadbeen accosted on the high seas by an Argentine destroyer, whichhad fired shots across her bows and threatened to fire on theShackleton if Bhe refused to heave to.    The captain of the Shackletonhad communicated urgently with the Governor of the falkland islands and both the Governor and the captain of the Shackletonhad handled the situation extremely well.    The Governor had instructed the captain, while not risking his ship, to avoid acceptinga boarding party and to steam towards Port Stanley.    This the captain had succeeded in doing: the destroyer had shadowed theShackleton until she reached Port Stanley and had then turned away.It was not clear whether the destroyer&apos;s action represented acalculated act of policy on behalf of the Argentine Government.He had made a vigorous protest to the latter, who had counter-protested alleging that the Shackleton was sailing through Argentinewaters without permission.    The Cabinet had earlier decided that3FalklandElandsPreviousReference:CC(76) 1stConclusions,Minute 3
he should not discuss the question of sovereignty over the falkland islands with the Argentine Government: but he might need to seeksome room for manoeuvre which would be consistent with our undertaking to the Islanders.    He would consider this further after he had received the report of Lord Shackleton who was on his wayback from his economic survey of the Falkland Islands,The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
3,        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(76) 6) seeking authority to publish a White Paper on public expenditure, a draft of which was attached to the memorandum,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had nopoints to put before tfce Cabinet on the substance of the white paper but the pioblems of presentation would be very difficult andhe wished to make one or two comments on these.    The draftingwas rather dull, but this might be no bad thing, since a lively andacceptable presentation to one audience might be provocative toanother.    He would be announcing on 12 February a package of measures  to help the unemployment situation; these were an essential part of the attack on unemployment but they did add to public expenditure and might be criticised on that score,   Afew days later he would be sending a reply to the First Report ofthe Select Committee on Expenditure (H.C.69 of 11 December 1975)to be followed on 19 February by publication of the White Paper.The Budget would be presented on 6 April.    The cuts in expenditure shown in the White Paper did not appear as large asthose made by Cabinet; this was the result of a number of factorsincluding the fact that it was not possible publicly to quantify theeffect of the agreed change in the method for uprating social security benefits.    Critics would claim that the increase in debt interest wiped out the cuts in expenditure programmes: there werecounter arguments to this claim.    It was a criticism made of all governments that these expenditure White Papers showed no cut inthe immediate future, but promised cuts later; and as far as 1976-77was concerned this was true of the present Government.    It wastherefore necessary in presenting the White Paper to emphasise the tighter control which was to be exercised.    The reply to theSelect Committee would spell out the new arrangements for eachlimits; and there would be a special White Paper, giving thefigures for the limits, to be published at about the same time as theBudget,    hi his view there was great need for better control overadditional expenditure proposals accepted as a demand upon the contingency Reserve.    If the Government failed to exercise bettercontrol there, they would again face the need for massive cuts ata later stage.He and some of hie colleagues most closely concerned were ininformal touch with the leading members of the Trades UnionCongress, and had kept them informed of the Governmentsexpenditure plans and the reasons for them.    It would be important,in carrying the trades unions and the Labour Party, to stress theneed to prevent large tax increases;  and to emphasise that theGovernment was still planning to spend over  50, ,000 million on public expenditure, and would be spending more than had been planned bytheir Conservative predecessors.5
In discussion, it was suggested that the passages headed &quot;Changesin Programmed Expenditure&quot; which appeared at the end of eachprogramme section in Part 2 of the draft White Paper representedsomething of a hostage to fortune, in that they would maximise the adverse reaction of the critic, and provided him ready-made withthe material he needed to attack the Government.    The mediawould be likely to seize upon this, as would critics of theGovernment among their own backbenchers.    There would be advantage if these sections were omitted; but since some of themcontained material which must be retained, they should bere-examined with a view to incorporating such material in themain programme texts.In the course of further discussion the following specific points were made -a. The argument in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the text of Part I should be toned down to say that the Governmentcould have gone further in cutting public expenditure and seeking an improvement in the balance of payments, butthey were concerned to take full account of the position ofemployment.    The drafting of paragraph 23 in particularsounded too much like a direct threat.    However, the drafting of this would need care, because there were risksin both directions.b. The second sentence of paragraph 8 of page 51 ofthe draft should be rephrased in vaguer language, ratherlike that in the fourth sentence of paragraph 2.    unless this were done there was a danger that the text would be interpreted to mean that reductions damaging to the mininginterests were in train.c. In paragraph 10 on page 91, the words &quot;moreselectively&quot; in the first sentence should be deleted, since they would be seized upon by such bodies as the ChildPoverty Action Group.d. If the section on changes under each programmesection were omitted, paragraph 8 on page 105 would disappear; but insofar as any part of that material mightbe incorporated in the main text, the reference to theintention to legislate to change the retirement pensionearnings rule should be omitted entirely,e. It was noted that in the table on pages 104 and 105 ofthe draft, figures were given for future years for numbersreceiving various benefits, including unemployment.    these might be difficult to justify, but it was pointed out that, as6
was made clear in footnote (3) to the table on pages 102and 103, the figures for future years represented a working assumption and not a forecast of unemploymentlevels,f. In any comment which might be made about the reductions referred to on pages 16 and 17 under Defence,care should be taken to avoid any suggestion, while theConstitutional Convention was meeting in Belfast, that thisimplied a withdrawal of British troopd from NorthernIreland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,said that, subject to certain changes, the Cabinet were agreedthat the draft White Paper circulated by the Chancellor of theExchequer should be published on 19 February.    There was generalagreement that the sections headed &quot;Changes in ProgrammedExpenditure&quot; at the end of each of the individual programme textsin Part II should be deleted; but it was recognised that there mightbe material in them which should be retained, and the treasury should consider this bilaterally with the individual departments with a view to incorporating the retained material in the main textunder each programme,   A number of other specific changes hadbeen suggested in discussion, and these too should be consideredby the Treasury and revised texts agreed with the Departments.If the printing difficulties created by these amendments were to be overcome in time fcr publication on 19 February, it was essentialthat the precise text of any proposed changes should be in the handsof the Treasury by close of business on Friday 6 February,    TheChief Secretary would announce the publication date later in the day.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, 0.*&apos; the PrimeMinister&apos;e summing up of their discussion,2,        Agreed that, subject to the changes whichhad been discussed, and any minor or draftingchanges which might be necessary, the White paper should be published on 19 Fsbruary; and that this date should be announced later in the day,3.        Invited all Ministers concerned to arrangefor any further amendments to the White paper to be put in the hands of the Treasury by Friday6 February,7
4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that authorising the publicationof the White Paper had been the last step in the prolongedprocedure of cutting  3, 500 million from the public expenditure programme, with all the attendant political and Departmentaldifficulties that had involved.    It would be most important for theGovernment to avoid getting into the same position again,particularly in the next two or three years which would be a run upto an election.    This meant they must avoid any erosion of thedecisions which had been taken.    This was essential both to make room for the economic upturn and to provide an answer to criticswho said that public expenditure was ou.1 of control.    The risklay in a series of ad hoc public expenditure decisions during theyear without reference to the state of the Contingency Reserve,which, year after year, had been more than swallowed up by such decisions.    It was therefore important that as far as possibleany new measures involving public expenditure should be accomodated within existing Departmental totals, by offsetting savings wherever that was necessary.    Where that was notpossible - and where Treasury Ministers, who were normally ina minority of one on policy committees, were not ready to acceptthe additional expenditure as e. charge on the Contingency Reserve -the matter would have to be referred by the appropriate Ministerialpolicy committee to the Cabinet.    This would mean that TrsasuryMinisters should not be overruled without reference to Cabinet.He hoped that such appeals would not be too frequent, but it wouldbe desirable for the Cabinet to take them in batches, and at thesame time to have a report from the Chancellor of the exchequer on the then state of the Contingency Reserve.    This strengthening of the decision-taking system for controlling public expenditure should not be operated in an unduly inflexible way or of itselfreduce the Cabinet&apos;s room for manoeuvre.    There could well betimes (eg when unemployment was high) when it would be rightsignificantly to increase the overall level of spending during theyear.    This however should flow from a conscious collectivedecision, taken in the light of the known situation, and not fromthe Treasury losing a series of individual arguments which theCabinet had not considered and which, in aggregate, might be inconsistent with the Governmenfs overall priorities.During 1975 the Cabinet had on a number of occasions discussedpublic expenditure, and its economic background, at some length in order to arrive at general attitudes through taking a deeper andlonger look at constraints and priorities before reachingparticular decisions.    He had put a paper to the Cabinet in May(C(75) 60) which set out a suggested sequence of the meetingsCabinet might hold on public expenditure, and a version of this -truncated because of the reduced time available then - had been successfully followed.    These arrangements were not intended to beimmutable but in 1976 he hoped that they could make an early startand follow the proposed sequence of meetings as nearly as possible.8
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;statement.9
5.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(76) 7), covering a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury, and a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science (C(76) 8) dealing with the relatedproblems of student support, social security benefits and the registration of students as unemployed.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that in June last year he had called for an early solution to the situation whereby theunemployment figures were inflated by students during theirvacations.   Although he recognised the practical difficulties, hewas most concerned that action might not now be possible untilthe Christmas vacation.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the note by Treasuryofficials which was attached to his memorandum dealt both with the short-term problem of keeping students off the unemploymentregisters in the Easter vacation and with the longer-term issues,concerning their future entitlement to unemployment and supplementary benefits, which he recognised were complex and,although requiring early decisions, could be considered separately.The central question was whether students should look to thestudents1 support system or to unemployment benefits for thenecessary financial help for theik* vacations.    There had been avery large increase in recent years in the enrolment of studentson the unemployment register and there was evidence that they hadbeen actively encouraged to register, without serious intention ofobtaining employment, in order to secure supplementary benefit.He recognised that an increase in the unemployment figures duringthe Easter vacation would present particular difficulties for theGovernments negotiations with the Trades Union Congress (TUC)in relation to the Governments counter-inflation policies.    It was with these considerations in mind that he had proposed, for urgent examination, an interim scheme designed to obviate the use bystudents of supplementary benefit in that vacation.    This wouldinvolve the payment to students of f 23 before the Easter vacation,but if, on examination, this proved to be impracticable, he wouldbe very ready to consider some alternative proposal.   At the sametime he proposed that the Government should announce as soon aspossible the intention to publish statistics of unemployment separately from statistics of students who registered for employment invacations and that this practice should be adopted not later than theunemployment count in March.    In addition, consistently with theprinciple that students should look to the grant system for any necessary financial support in their vacations, he thought it essential that the Government should announce their intention toamend the legislation in due course so that, in ordinarycircumstances, students would not be eligible for benefits in anyvacation.10STUDENTS&apos;FINANCE and unemployment
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat, while he was fully aware of the political need to avoid prejudicing in any way the forthcoming discussions with the TUCon future prices and incomes policy, he felt that this would be largely met, so far as unemployment figures were concerned, bytreating the student figures separately, as the Chief Secretary had proposed, and at the same time announcing that the interim schemefor obviating the use by students of supplementary benefits, as agreed by Social Services Committee, would come into effectbefore the Christmas vacation.    He was strongly opposed to theChief Secretary&apos;a proposal to announce in intention to abolish by legislation the entitlement of students to unemployment and supplementary benefits.    This would create real hardship in manycases: the average annual grant for students was  740 of whichthe weekly allowance for the vacations was  3.16; and it had been estimated that 52 per cent of students did not receive the fullequivalent of the grant because their parents refused to pay theappropriate contribution and that in about one-third of these casesthe shortfall was more than  50 a year.    Moreover, many studentswere entitled to unemployment benefits by virtue of thecontributions which enabled them to qualify.    He foresaw that theChief Secretary&apos;s proposal would be strongly resisted by the trades union, many of whose members, with children at universities,would be suffering the effects of unemployment and mat it mightwell result, by way of protest, in the mass registration of studentsin employment offices during the Easter vacation after theGovernments intention had been announced.    The Chief Secretary&apos;proposal for introducing an interim scheme before the Eastervacation in order to disqualify most students from receiving umemployment or supplementary benefits raised very seriouspractical difficulties, particularly in relation to the existingpressures on local authorities&apos; resources.    In the time available it would be impracticable to transfer the burden to the universities and other institutions who would in any case have no means ofknowing precisely what students were entitled to the additionalpayment.    Further complications would be raised by the division in local authority expenditure, which would be involved, between two financial years.    He was also advised that new regulations would be required to introduce the interim scheme.    He therefore recommended that the scheme should be introduced for the christmas vacation.In discussion, there was general support for the proposal thatstudents registered for employment should be shown separately from the unemployment figures.   The question arose, however,whether the student figures should be published separately and ata later date, notwithstanding the fact that they would be available at the same time as the unemployment figures, or whether they11
should be published simultaneously, possibly in the same documentbut relegated to another section, as was the case with the figuresof those who had temporarily stopped work.    In favour of the latter course it was argued that, although the numbers of studentsregistered as unemployed had greatly increased, there had been no obvious change in the principles which had led to the agreementbetween the political Parties in 1972 that students should beincluded in the unemployment figures.    On the other hand, it was now much more evident to public opinion that the figures wereartificially inflated by student registration ard there was lesslikelihood of serious criticism if the student element were removed from them altogether and, if this seemed desirable, publishedseparately.    The analogy of the treatment of figures of those whohad temporarily stopped work would be presentationally useful injustifying the case for taking students (who were in many wayscomparable) out of the unemployment figures.    There was alsogeneral agreement that the intention to separate the studentfigures should be announced at the same time as the publicationof the unemployment figures in February, which were expected toshow a drop compared with the figures for January.On the question of announcing an intention to legislate in due course in order to abolish students1 entitlement to unemployment and supplementary benefits, there was considerable support for theview that to exclude from benefit an entire category, which might include many who were in genuine ueed, would be widely regardedas inequitable and would create serious political difficulty; themain objective of policy should be to concentrate the student grant in the short vacations, when the incidence of registered studentunemployment was generally much higher, and to accept the needfor many students to supplement their income by working in thelong vacation.    On the other hand, it was pointed out that theCabinet1 a decision to make  15 million public expenditure savings in supplementary benefits for students would involve legislation as envisaged by the Chief Secretary since there was no otherassurance of securing the necessary savings.    It was agreed that further consideration would have to be given by the ministers concerned to this and other longer-term issues and that it wouldnot be practicable to contemplate any announcement of the government&apos;s legislative intentions at the same time as announce-ments were made on the separation of the employment statisticsand on the introduction of any interim scheme before the Eastervacation.As regards the proposed introduction of an interim scheme beforethe Easter vacation, there was considerable support for the view ofthe Secretary of State for Education and Science that this would present serious practical difficulties.    To the extent that additional12
financial and manpower resources of local authorities would be involved, there was a risk that, particularly in view of the smallsum payable to each student under the Chief Sec*etary&apos;p suggestedscheme, the Government would lose a good deal of credibility inits presently successful effortB to persuade local authorities ofthe extreme importance of reductions in staffing and expendituregenerally.    On the other hand, the view was strongly expressed that, because of the importance of reducing the numbers of students who registered for employment during the Eastervacation, a further attempt should be made by the ministers concerned, to see whether an interim s?Jieme, either of the kindsuggested by the Chief Secretary or some other, could not beagreed and implemented before that vacation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that student figures should be removed from theunemployment figures and published separately.    This decision should take effect from March but should be announced when theunemployment figures were published in February.    The analogywith the treatment of the temporarily stopped category would be useful presentationally.    It was however highly desirable that atleast an interim scheme to keep studentb out of unemploymentoffices should be operating by the Easter vacation.    officials should urgently review all the possibilities which had been mentioned, including one devised by the Prime Minister&apos;s PolicyUnit.   As regards the longer term issues there were powerfularguments against legislation and it would be wrong to announceany such intention when announcing an interim scheme.    But allpossible options should be further reviewed by officials and nonecould be excluded at this stage.    The Lord President, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, would oversee this work andensure that a report was made to Cabinet not later than their meeting on 19 February so that any decision on the interim scheme could be announced at the same time as the change in the presentation of the unemployment figures.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.13
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(76) 5) in his capacity as Chairmanof the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy, and amemorandum by the Minister for Planning and Local Government(C(76) 4) about two problems which had arisen on DevelopmentLand Tax.THE CHANCE I LOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the ministerial committee on Economic Policy had recently discussed DevelopmentLand Tax (DLT) and were unable to reach agreement on twoaspects - the initial rate of tax and whether or not roll-overrelief should be granted on DLT.    The White Paper &quot;Land&quot;(Cmnd 5730), published in 1974, said that the rate ofDLT when first introduced should be 80 per cent, rising eventually to 100 per cent.    The Treasury considered that the initial rate of tax should be 66f per cent, rising to 80 per cent after two years,and only at some later point of time rising to 100 per cent.    Themain argument in favour of a change was the risk that an 80 per concentrate would provide a continuing strong disincentive to the sale ofland for house-building and that this would cause the Governmentto retreat in a year or two when the change would be politicallymuch more embarrassing than it would be at the present time.There was also a risk that the total tax yield would be reduced byan 80 per cent rate and more peripherally the possibility of an awkward situation for the Government if the bond holders of the mersey Docks and Harbour Company were unable to selldevelopment land at profitable prices because of the high rate of tax.   Against this it had been argued that the Government waspublicly committed to the 80 per cent rate: the effect on the availability of land for house-building was much less than hadbeen suggested by the Treasury and the severity of the 80 per concentrate would be mitigated by the proposal to exempt the first  5000of development value from tax.    Roll-over relief was alreadygranted to farmers and industrialists under Capital Gains tax and Development Gains Charge.    The argument in favour of having a similar relief for DLT was that development gains were animportant source of capital for farming, and for industry in caseswhere a firm was considering moving from a valuable city centreto a development area.    On the other hand, granting relief would reduce the Exchequers receipts from DLT; it would be difficultto administer;  and there would be a period of uncertainty, perhapsprolonged, for local authorities in which they would not know whatthe price of the land they purchased would be.    These were the issues upon which the Cabinet now had to take a decision.THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT saidthat the Government&apos;s policy was that development land should be publicly owned by local authorities in order to facilitate satisfactoryplanning; and to this end it was agreed that they should be able to14Eve lopmentLAND TAX
buy land at Current Use Value- However, becausedifferent local authorities were in different positions, it was agreedthat there should be a transition period during which privatetransactions would continue but would be subject to DLT whichwould be introduced initially at 80 per cent with a view to movingto 100 per cent as soon as possible thereafter.    In the interim period, local authorities would buy at current market value lesswhatever DLT would otherwise have had to be paid.    The first 5, 000 of any sale was to be exempt from the tax.    This was theGovernments present publicly declared policy.    The proposal hadbeen made that, instead of 80 per cent, the tax should be introduced at 66f per cent, being raised to 80 per cent in 1978 and to100 per cent as soon thereafter as circumstances would allow.    Inhis view, if this were done, the public generally would cease tobelieve that the Government intended ever to move to landtransactions taking place at Current Use Value, and landownerswould hold back from putting land on the market in the belief thatthe Government was retreating from its policy and would subsequently be compelled to push the rate down further.    he accepted that a lower rate of tax could bring forward some land which might otherwise come cm to the market;   but he did not findthis argument ove r whelm inga   The big developers would buy their land in any case; and the small house-builders, buying half anacre or so - who accounted for 30 per cent of house-building -benefited very greatly from the  5, 000 exemption, which he wouldlike to raise to  7, 500 or even  10, 000 since this would increasethe availability of sites up to two acres.It was not only the prospect of development land tax at 80 per cent which would keep land off the market; the present low level of transactions was more probably due to low prices, which were only some 55 per cent of those prevailing in 1971-73,    Even if the tax did have an adverse effect, he was not of the opinion that this need be detrimental to the Governments housing policies.    Localauthorities had enough land in their hands already to meet public housing needs over the next four years - in some cases more.The land which was available could be put to better use by twochanges which might be made - increasing the density of houseson private housing plots; and the speeding up of planning procedures.If the housing programme were protected in this way, the DLTcould safely be introduced at 80 per cent.    It would in any case bedifficult to justify a lower rate to the Governments supporters,since such a rate would benefit most the big owners of land, for whomthe exemption provision was of least importance.    It would also mean that local authorities would have to pay more for their land, andthis was politically unacceptable.    He therefore proposed that theexisting policy of an initial rate of 80 per cent be retained.15
On the roll-over relief, his view was that such relief wasinappropriate for a flat rate tax such as DLT; and that theadministrative difficulties which would arise for local authoritiesmade the proposal to introduce such relief unacceptable.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that in his view the introductionof DLT at 80 per cent would lead to a serious shortage of land for housing, and might well kill the whole of the community landscheme.    This was the main argument against 80 per cent.    he recognised that it would be embarrassing for the Government togo back on its present public position on DLT, but they had to choose between Borne embarrassment now ot facing Berious landshortage difficulties in two or three years1 time.    It was a matterof judgment how far the higher rate would in fact lead to a landshortage; but it was true that the current level of land transactionswas exceedingly low.    The increased exemption which had been proposed would do nothing for the higher end of the land market;and he pointed out that it was in fact tantamount to a reduction inthe effective rate of tax (which was what he was hixnself proposing),although its effect would vary according to the size of thetiansaction.    In his view none of the other points put forward foreasing the housing position could outweigh the damage theGovernment might suffer if their housing policies, and thecommunity land scheme itself, were put in jeopardy by an initialrate of tax at 80 per cent rather than 66-f per cent.    If it werethe case that even a reduction to 66f per cent was not enough,then the Government faced a very serious problem on housing landindeed.Roll-over relief had been given on previous capital taxes and therewere strong economic and industrial arguments for giving similarrelief on DLT.    Development gains were an important BOurce ofcapital for the farming industry, and only more marginally for industrial firms.    In his view those considerations outweighed theadministrative difficulties for local authorities, which wouldcertainly result from introduction of relief, but which were notinsuperable.In discussion it was suggested that a lower rate of tax was not essential in order to make sufficient land available for housing.The local-authorities had large holdings, and in many placeshousing need was tapering off, so that land could be made availableto the private sector.    The current lack of transactions was the consequence of lack of demand, not lack of supply; and even ifsupply did become a problem, the proposals to increase the exemption allowance, increase housing densities in the private sector, and improve planning procedures, would go far to ease the situation.    In any case, the possible difficulty in prospect was16
not a new one, since any scheme to solve the land problem was likely to come up against a sellers&apos; strike at some point.    On theother hand, it was argued that there was a lesson to be learnedfrom the experience of the Capital Gains Tax.   At one time it hadbeen thought that this should be introduced at a high rate; but inthe event it was introduced at 30 per cent, and the conservative party had never repealed it: there was no doubt that the modestlevel at which i* had been pitched had contributed to its general acceptance.    If DLT were introduced at 80 per cent, theConservative Opposition would almost inevitably repeal it if they came into office: and the prospect of this would of itself cause the supply of land to dry up.THE prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thequestion of the initial rate of tax turned very much upon a judgment of the likely effect of that rate on the supply of land for house building.    It was true that land transactions were at present at a low level, but this might not be a guide to the future, and whenthe economy improved it would be a serious matter if there were a reluctance to sell the land simply because of the tax.   At itsextreme - if the supply largely dried up - this could be a disasterboth for the community land scheme and politically for theGovernment.    Nevertheless, the balance of view in the cabinet was that the initial rate of tax should be 80 per cent; that the exemption should be raised from  5, 000 to  10, 000; but that thereshould be a limited form of roll-over relief of the kind given underDevelopment Gains Charge.   In view of the concern felt by some members of Cabinet about this decision, Housing and TreasuryMinisters might consider whether there would be merit in analternative whereby a low rate of tax were charged on the firstlarge tranche of a sale - say  250, 000 - and the higher rate onthe remainder: if agreement on this could be reached between themthere was no necessity to refer this variation back to the Cabinet:but if no agreement was reached the Cabinet decision should stand.The Cabinet -L, Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion,2.        Agreed that Development Land Taxshould be introduced at 80 per cent, butthat the exemption should be raised from 5, 000 to  10, 000,17
3.        Agreed that the limited form of roll-overrelief given under Development Gains charge should be applied to DLT.4. Invited the Minister for Planning and LocalGovernment, in consultation with the paymaster general, to consider the merits of a two bandsystem of tax of the kind referred to in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.Cabinet office February 197618
