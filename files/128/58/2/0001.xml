a^entary   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    It was noted that itwas virtually inevitable that there should be a debate on employment,at the initiative of either the Government or the Opposition.    Thebalance of advantage seemed clearly to favour an initiative by theGovernment, who would then be able to determine the form of the motion before the House,    In his discussions with the Oppositionabout next week*s business, the Lord President of the Council should therefore indicate that the Government intended to provide time for a debate on employment.- ^j?1^ of        2. The Cabinet considered points relating to the appointment of a successor to the present Speaker, whose retirement on 3 Februaryhad recently been announced.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere appeared to be broad agreement amongst Labour Partysupporters that Mr George Thomas would be an eminently suitablesuccessor to the present Speaker; and this view seemed to be shared by the Opposition Front Bench,    Experience at the time of the election of the present Speaker in 1971 had however shown the importance of ensuring that backbench opinion throughout the House of Commons hadbeen thoroughly canvassed,    A meeting of the Parliamentary LabourParty had been arranged for the following week in order to considerthe matter;  and it was desirable that Mr Thomas1 candidature should then appear as originating from within Party supporters generally,rather than as coming from the Government.    There should also be full consultations with the Opposition, in the course of which stressshould be laid on the importance of backbench opinion on their side ofthe House being fully canvassed also.    The Cabinet noted that in theevent of Mr Thomas succeeding to the Chair the Conservative party had in mind that Mr Oscar Murton should succeed him as Chairmanof Ways and Means.    They had accepted that the third Deputy Speakershould be found from amongst Conservative Party supporters.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.1
3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Report of theCommittee of Privy Counsellors (the Radcliffe Committee) on ministerial Memoirs.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the Radcliffe Report dealt veryeffectively with the precedents and with the historical andphilosophical background.    It then went on to discuss two main topics -the conventions which should govern the publication of memoirs byex-Ministers and the arrangements for securing their observance.On the first a Minister should be able to give an account of hisstewardship^ provided he did so in terms which were not damaging.The main new proposal was that it should be overtly recognised that inrelation to confidential relationships between Ministers and between ministers and officials there should be a watershed 15 years after the events in question,    Before that the onus of proof for any disclosure of information about the views of other people should rest on the writer, whereas afterwards the reverse would be the case.    Inrelation to advice by officials, the period of protection would extend to the official&apos;a retirement if that were later.    In relation toenforcement, the Committee left observance of the conventions to the writer as a matter of honour and recommended against new legislationcreating a series of criminal offences.    In relation to national security and foreign relations, authors should regard as final thedecision of the current Prime Minister as to what would be damaging.On confidential relationships, they should consider very seriously anyviews put to them by the Secretary of the Cabinet or the PrimeMinister; but in the last resort responsibility for the decision whetheror not to publish should rest on the author&apos;s Bhoulders - though hewould of course have to take his chance in the exceptional case withthe existing sanctions of the criminal and common law.    A particular problem arose in relation to the publication of the memoirs or diariesof a deceased ex-Minister.    The Radcliffe Report recommended thatsuitable testamentary dispositions should be made; and this was particularly Important in relation to diaries, which if published couldbe extremely wounding to colleagues or former colleagues.    the radcliffe Committee had not recommended the establishment of a standing committee of Privy Counsellors.    An argument for thiswould be that it might spare the Prime Minister some embarrassment;but In his own view the Radcliffe Committee were right in notrecommending its use as a matter of course.    This would not however prevent the Prime Minister from occasionally seeking advice from such a panel in individual cases.The Report had been considered by a group of senior Ministers under his own chairmanship and their conclusion had been that it should beaccepted at once as it stood.    There were a few points which somemight have preferred to have seen put differently; but the Reportfollowed a thorough examination of the subject by an unusuallypowerful Committee and formed a carefully balanced whole.    He2
considered therefore that the right course would be for it to bepublished on the following day and for him to make a simultaneousannouncement of the Governments decision to accept it.    the ministerial group had considered the alternative of publishing butallowing a period of public debate before the Government announcedits decision.    Such debate was however unlikely to be helpful andwould in the main be conducted by vested interests, particularly themedia.    Furthermore if the Government decision were not announced on publication it would look as though the Government were irresoluteon the issue of collective responsibility.In discussion, there was general agreement on the importance of creating conditions which favoured full and frank discussion betweencolleagues in the knowledge that they could change their minds in private.    In favour of publishing the Report and allowing time for public debate before reaching a decision it was argued both that it wasinappropriate for the Cabinet to be devoting time now to an issue of minor importance compared with the economic situation and also thatthere were several matters on which the Report was unsatisfactory and where further thought was needed.    It did not, for example, dealwith the fact that since the Second World War a good deal more latitudeseemed to have been allowed to Conservative than to Labour PrimeMinisters in writing their memoirs.    Moreover, it was not clear whatwould be the application of the present criminal law if the RadcliffeReport were accepted.    During discussions about Volume I of theGrossman diaries there had been suggestions that the Official secrets act might be invoked.    Clarification was needed of whether it would continue to apply and if so in what circumstances; and also of the likely consequences of any decision to accept the recommendations bythe Franks Committee for the replacement of the Official Secrets Actsby a more liberal Official Information Act.    The recurring leakagesabout current inter-Ministerial discussions were much more damagingthan anything which might appear in memoirs, and it would behypocritical to deal with the latter without tackling the former.Moreover the kind of comments on colleagues which had appeared inthe Crossman diaries would in practice be widely discounted; in anycase, memoirs and diaries could easily contain malicious, and there-fore potentially damaging, material without revealing any confidential information to which the conventions recommended in the RadcliffeReport would apply.    The proposed 15-year period was too long:indeed it was doubtful whether any specific period could sensibly bedetermined and the right course might be to leave the matter entirely to the author&apos;s judgment.    And while it might be right in principle to preserve the confidentiality of advice given by civil servants, it mustbe remembered that civil servants were increasingly, in television and press interviews, revealing information about Government decisions and the methods of conducting Government business.    Finally althoughit was true that in any public debate the media as a whole might behostile to the Radcliffe Report, it would be wrong to assume that thecontrary view would not be effectively presented.
Against this it was argued that the Radcliffe Committee had beenprecluded by their terms of reference from dealing with some of thesewider issues.    The current leakages of information were serious and damaging; but this was not a reason for falling to take practical measures to see that the appearance of confidential information inmemoirs was inhibited.    The position under the Official Secrets Actswas quite clear.    They applied to Ministers as to everyone else, andthe same would be true of any replacement legislation.    This positionseemed entirely reasonable and there was no case for seeking to giveMinisters any kind of exemption from the legislation.    In general theReport was a weighty and carefully considered document which would command confidence.    It could be criticised in detail but as a wholeits recommendations were reasonable and should be accepted.Particular importance attached to paragraph 80, which established that while an author should give careful consideration to any views expressed to him by the Prime Minister or the Secretary of theCabinet he should in the last resort take upon his own shoulders theresponsibility for what he decided to say in the field of confidentialrelationships.   A further merit of the Report was that it ended thepre sent convention that more latitude should be allowed tomemorialists dealing with wartime than with peacetime events.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed by a large majority that the Radcliffe Report should bepublished on the following day and that he should make a simultaneousannouncement that the Government accepted its recommendations infull.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.4
[MUITTEESJSBes4.        The Cabinet discussed the question of Ministerial appearancesbefore Select Committees, which had been raised by the request bythe Trade wad Industry Sub-Committee (TISC) of the expenditure committee that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should giveoral evidence about the Chrysler affair.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a dangerous situation might be created by any departure from the established convention that only a minister with responsibilities relevant to the subject under enquiry should give evidence to a Select Committee or answer a parliamentary question.    It was right that those Ministers whose departmental responsibilities were directly affected should be available to give evidence; and the same principle applied to non-departmental ministers with specific responsibilities which had been publicly announced - for instance, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasteranswered Parliamentary Questions related to North Sea oilnegotiations.    But It would be another matter altogether forDepartmental or non-Departmental Ministers with responsibilities farremoved from the subject of an enquiry to give evidence.    Such a development might lead to the Opposition, and even some Governmentbackbenchers, seeking to divide the Cabinet by probing into the processes of collective decision-taking, which could cause even greater damage than Ministerial leaks.    The record of Ministers ofthe present Government in giving evidence to Select Committees wasremarkably good, and he wished to maintain the present rules on who should give evidence.    But it might be worth considering whether itwould be tactically useful to refer the issue to a Select Committee on procedure, so that the case for the existing arrangements could be stated and rules formulated which would command the widestacceptance.In discussion there was general agreement that it was essential tomaintain the position that evidence should be given only by ministers with direct responsibility for the subject under enquiry, whoseevidence should be in accordance with the collectively agreedGovernment position.    This was consistent with the Table Office rulesin relation to allowing Parliamentary Questions.    Even under present arrangements Select Committees were tempted to seek rifts in theGovernment ranks, or contradictions in the evidence of differentMinisters in cases where more than one Minister had some Depart-men t al responsibility.    One Select Committee had recently suggestedthat two Ministers from the same Department might give evidence onthe same subject - evidently in the hope of finding differences of view -and such requests ought to be resisted.    There was some danger ofChairmen of Select Committees seeing themselves as comparable tothe Chairmen of the powerful Senate and Congressional Committees inthe United States and, while this could not be wholly avoided, itshould certainly not be encouraged.    It was, however, argued that itwould be better not to refer this issue to a Select Committee on
Procedure, because of the risk that the Committee would make someembarrassing recommendations for relaxation of the existing rules.Those rules were well understood: it was clear that the PrimeMinister was the final arbiter on the question of ministerial responsibility, and that there was no power in a Select Committee toenforce attendance, but only in the House.In further discussion it was suggested that acceptance of the general rule should not necessarily imply rigid adherence to it in all circum-stanceB.    In the case of Chrysler there had been inaccurate Pressstories suggesting, in particular, that the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster had negotiated with Chrysler behind the back of theSecretary of State for Industry.    It might be desirable to make an exception in this case to enable the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster to rebut these stories in giving evidence to TISC.    Asagainst this, it was pointed out that the Press frequently printedstories, based upon information which they should not hav* beengiven or which was inaccurate, which were damaging to theGovernment.    A number of members of the Cabinet had been attacked in the Press for their supposed part in the Chrysler affair, and Pressattacks of such a kind were by no means uncommon.    The only safeposition for the Government, accordingly, was to adhere firmly to the established doctrine of Ministerial responsibility.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed on the necessity of maintaining firmly in allcases, including the present one, the position that only Ministers withdirect responsibility for the subject under enquiry should give evidence to Select Committees.    It was the general view that it would bebetter not to refer this issue to a Select Committee on Procedure.Mr Duffy, the Chairman of 1 ISC, had taken a helpful attitude in discussion with the Chief Whip, and it was doubtful whether theOpposition would wish to press the matter.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office21 January 1976
