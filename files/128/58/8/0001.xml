PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS10 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.Direct elections to the EuropeanAssemblyPreviousReference:CC(76) 5thConclusion sMinute 6It was agreed that the debate on the Green Paper on direct elections to the European Assembly should be postponed until the week beginning 22 March or possibly until after the Cabinet&apos;s whole-daydiscussion of European matters planned for 26 March provided itcould then take place before the European Council on 1-2 April,It was desirable to have the views of the Foreign and commonwealth secretary on whether or not to permit a free vote on the motion totake note, and it was in any case desirable to allow more time forconsideration of the issues involved.1
Foreign 2.      the minister of state for foreign andafpa3hs COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS said that on his return from Rhodesia-- Lord Greenhill had reported that Mr Smith had shifted his position to^lodesia some extent, but not far enough to warrant a British initiative.Lord Greenhill himself thought that Mr Smith might be ready toPrevious concede majority rule in three years1 time, although he had never saidTerence: so: the officials who went with Lord Greenhill were less optimistic. c(76) 7th Mr Nkomo had told Lord Greenhill that he would like to see a BritishConclusions, chairman in the talks between himself and Mr Smith, but this was a&quot;^nute 2 role which would involve a commitment we could not accept.    Therewere Press stories of some breakthrough in the talks between mr Nkomo and Mr Smith since Lord Greenhill left Salisbury: we hadno confirmation whatever of this, but Mr China ma no was due inLondon this weekend and should be able to enlighten us.    An important new development had been the decision by the MozambiqueGovernment to close their frontier with Rhodesia and impose economic sanctions.    Press accounts that this amounted to a declaration of warby Mozambique were exaggerated.    Mozambique had no potential forwar with EJiodesIa, but the closing of the frontier would certainly havea considerable effect although less now than would have been the caseat the time of Mozambique&apos;s independence.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had not yet reached a conclusion on lord Greenhill&apos;s report.    He would be studying several options, butwhichever option he chose would require the support, or at least the aquiescence, of the four African Presidents.    A message had juBtbeen received from Mr Smith that he wished to send two emissaries toLondon the following day: but the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had not yet decided whether to agree.   An early decision was required on aid to Mozambique against the background of the 15 million commitment made by the then Minister of overseas development following the Commonwealth Conference in Jamaica lastyear.    Although Mozambique had not taken up that offer at the time,there had been subsequent discussion in which the offer had been modified into a two-phase aid programme, the first to be madeavailable regardless of sanctions and the second only if sanctions1 were applied by Mozambique,   The sum of  5 million had been mentioned for the first phase.    The question of the second phase nowconfronted us and President Nyerere of Tanzania had pressed us to actvery quickly.    The Commonwealth Secretary General, Mr Ramphal,had called a meeting of the Commonwealth Sanctions Committee that day at which we would be represented,THE MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT said that for political reasons it was very desirable for our aid to be given underi the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretary General and with the participation of other Commonwealth countries.    What he envisagedwas not a multilateral Commonwealth aid fund, but a series of bilateral aid agreements for which the Commonwealth Secretary2
General would provide an umbrella.    The question of aid to othercountries in the region also needed to be considered.    He had inmind the provision of capital aid to Zambia, which would be aninnovation^ and an increase in the aid given to Zaire.    It was noteaey for him to find the considerable sums required, but he recognised the strength of the political case for doing so.In discussion the following points were made -a. The presentation of the Governments position to theHouse of Commons had been effective in dissociating theGovernment from any question of intervention in Rhodesia.There were signs that a deep split on this subject was developing in the Conservative Opposition,b. There was a likelihood of large-scale fighting in rhodesia, whether or not the Soviet Union and Cuba intervened.So far it seemed that only small numbers of Cubans had moved to Mozambique from Angola: some weapons had also beentransferred.c. There were some 80,000 citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies in Rhodesia who had an absolute right to travel tothe United Kingdom.    In addition there were some 75, 000white Rhode russians who had patrial status for immigrationpurposes.    If, say, 20, 000-30,000 of these arrived in theUnited Kingdom as refugees they could present a serious administrative problem.    Some discussion of this had already taken place between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office andthe Home Office and it was desirable that a contingency plan should be worked out.d. The aid to be given to Mozambique should not be presented publicly as being compensation to Mozambique forapplying sanctions against Rhodesia, on which Mozambique was merely coming into line with United Nations requirements: itshould be described as aid designed to strengthenMozambique&apos;s economy.    It would be very desirable for all commonwealth countries to participate in the arrangementsmade through the Commonwealth Secretary General, even if some of them made purely token contributions.The Cabinet -L, Took note of the statement by the Ministerof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.3
2D Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Minister for Overseas Development about hisplans for aid to Mozambique and other countries inthe region.3. Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Home Secretary, in consultationwith other Ministers as necessary, to preparecontingency plans for the reception of possiblerefugees irom Rhodesia,^ferencc:^(75) 42nd^elusions,^ute 2THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had held discussions with the SpanishForeign Minister, Senor Areilza.    Despite his bad record in theSpanish Civil War, Senor Areilza was one of the two members of thepresent Spanish Government who were working actively for apluralist democracy in Spain: he was in close touch with SpanishSocialists,    In the discussions with him the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and he had emphasised the importance of free elections in Spain at an early date and of freedom for the tradeunions.    They had also made it clear that Spain could achieve noclose relationship with the European Economic Community untilgenuine democratic institutions had actually come into existence.In this respect the same considerations would apply to Spain as hadalready been applied to Portugal.    Senor Areilza had given them the impression that the Spanish Government intended to continue to suppress the Spanish Communist Party but otherwise planned tomake early moves in the direction of freeing the political parties.The Cabinet -4, Took note of the statement by thePrime Minister.oIatementqtimates 19763.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Defence (C(76) 22) to which was attached adraft of the Statement on tha Defence Estimates 1976.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that in layoutthe draft attached to his memorandum was similar to previousDefence White Papers.    The main issues were treated in Chapter I,including relations between East and West, the military strength of the warsaw Pact, the North Atlantic Alliance and Britain&apos;s contribution toit, and progress in giving effect to decisions taken in the Defence
Review and in the recent review of public expenditure.    the objectives of the chapter were to explain our defence policy, to demonstrate to the North Atlantic Treaty organisation that britain s contribution to the alliance remained a major one and also to show that in accordance with the undertaking given bythe Labour Party in its Election Manifesto a substantial reduction was being made in the resources to be devoted to defence.    In1979-80 alone savings from the Defence Review and the expenditurereview would be more than  900 million at 1975 Survey prices.The remainder of the draft attached to his memorandum dealt withthe deployment and operations of the armed forces, defence equipment, the reserve and auxiliary forces, manpower, education and training, and support.    Subject to the approval of the Cabinet,he proposed that the Statement on the Defence Estimates should bepublished on 17 March.    There was expected to be parliamentary time for a two day defence debate before the Easter Recess.Debates on the individual services would take place after the Recess.In discussion it was suggested that in the section of Chapter I of theStatement dealing with East-West relations the references to theEast or Eastern bloc were unclear and should be replaced where possible by references to the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact.It was noted that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had proposed to the Secretary of State for Defence an amended version of paragraph 29 of the section of Chapter 2 of the Statementdescribing the operations of the Services in Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the text of the Statement on the Defence Estimates1976 subject to the points made in discussion and agreed that itshould be published on 17 March.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.5
NORTHERNPreviousReference-CC(76) 1stConclusionsMinute 44. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention was drawingto an ignominious close, having failed in its task of devising a stable form of devolved government for Northern Ireland.    Thepower-sharing executive established on the initiative of theUnited Kingdom Government after the Sunningdale Conference hadbeen destroyed by the action of the Ulster Workers Council inMay 1974.    With hindsight it was clear that, although that system was admirable in principle, it had had no chance of working inpractice.    We had then sought by means of the Convention to givethe people of Northern Ireland an opportunity to work out an acceptable form of government for themselves.    That approachhad also failed, largely because of the low level of politicalcompetence of the Convention members.    There was no othersimple solution.    Direct rule would have to continue and thestatutory powers would need to be renewed in July,    We would need to avoid any sense of crisis or drama and to make clear thatthere was no question of our withdrawing from our responsibilities.If the Convention made a report, it would be automaticallydissolved once that report was laid before Parliament,    Howevertheir present intention was not to make a report.    They had deliberately postponed their final debate in order to place the onusof dissolution on the Government.    But no useful purpose wouldbe served by delay.    The United Ulster Unionist Coalition (UUUC)Members of Parliament, Mr Craig, Mr Faulkner*s Unionist party of Northern Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party were at one in wanting an end to the Convention,    He therefore proposed to take action that evening to dissolve the Convention byOrder in Council and to make a statement to Parliament on thefollowing day which would be pitched in a deliberately low key.It would also make it clear that the proper channel for the peopleof Northern Ireland who wished to make approaches to theGovernment would be through their Members of Parliament at westminster,       The immediate reactions in Northern Irelandwere difficult to forecast.    There could be disturbances duringthe weekend:  and the UUUC might attempt to occupy the parliament building at Stormont,    He was however confident thatthe situation could be handled by the Royal Ulster Constabulary.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement bythe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.6SECRET
THE LAW ONCONSPIRACYPreviousCC(75) 42ndConclusions,Minute 35. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C(76) 23) about the report and draft Bill prepared by theLaw Commission on the law on conspiracy in England and Wales.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Law Commission^ report was due to be published on 11 March, and the Home Affairs committee recommended that the Government should announce on publicationtheir intention to introduce the Bill before Easter,    the praticability of this course depended on whether the Lord Presidentof the Council could find the necessary Parliamentary time.    Therewas considerable pressure for the reform of this branch of the lawand, while the Law Commission proposals were not perfect, they were generally acceptable.    Part I of the Bill, dealing with conspiracygenerally, including conspiracies relating to trade disputes, was likely to be substantially welcomed by the Trades Union Congress(TUC) and by Government supportersa    It was unlikely that theOpposition would vote against a Law Commission Bill on SecondReading.    Part II of the Bill, which dealt with squatting (and other aspects of trespass) was very different from the Law Commission^earlier tentative proposals which had aroused considerable opposition,and should not prove to be particularly controversial.    Part JJI would bring films within the Obscene Publications Acts and make other provisions to replace existing common law offences relating to publicmorals and decency.    This would undoubtedly be controversial and itwould be difficult to secure its passage through Parliament in the time available.    If, however, legislation this Session were restricted to part I, the problem would remain that legislation would be expectedbefore long on the matters covered by Parts H and m.    Moreover,this Session*s Bill would have to contain provisions to keep in force the existing law in the areas covered by Parts II and JH, so thatamendments on squatting and obscenity would be in order and the BUImight take as long in Committee as the whole Law Commission Bill.In these circumstances the best course would be to aim to get Parts Iand II on to the Statute Book this Session, and to deal with Part HI byreferring it for full examination to a Select Committee,    For thispurpose Part III might either be included in the main Bill as introduced and subsequently separated, or introduced simultaneously as aseparate Bill.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he agreed aboutthe importance of this legislation.    It was not, however, in this session,s legislative programme, and nothing had been said by theGovernment to arouse expectations that a Bill on conspiracy would beintroduced immediately following the publication of the law commission^ report in March.   As he had already told the Cabinet,the Government owed it to Members of Parliament to start the summer Recess earlier this year than last year, when Members had only two weeks - less in the case of Scottish Members - with their
families before the school holidays ended.    Between Easter and23 July there would be 54 or 58 sitting days in the House of Commonsdepending on whether the Whitsun Recess was for two weeks or forone week.    Unavoidable business would take 39 of these days, leavingonly 15 or 19 days to deal with all the Bills in the pipeline.    It was essential that all Bills starting in the Commons should have completed all stages well before the Summer Recess; otherwise theHouse of Lords would not have time to complete them this Session.Those Bills already introduced, or planned for introduction before easter, would take 22  days.    None of this business could be leftuntil the spillover.    Thus It was already unavoidable that the house should sit for three-and-a-half or seven-and-a-half days beyond23 July,    If the Conspiracy Bill were added to the programme, thiswould mean sitting once more into August,    There were accordinglythree options open to the Cabinet.    The first option was to introducethis Bill, to accept increased congestion in both Houses this summer and to accept the need to sit into August.    In view of the problems inthe House of Lords it would be preferable to restrict the Bill to Part I.The second option was to introduce the Conspiracy Bill and drop someother Bill to make the necessary room.    The major Bills not yetintroduced were those on New Towns, Energy, Agricultural TiedCottages and Private Practice, all of which were mentioned inThe Queen&apos;e Speech.    The third option was to announce, on thepublication of the Law Commission^ report, that legislation onconspiracy would be introduced at the beginning of next Session.In discussion it was pointed out that the Law Commission^ proposals would arouse great public interest and it would be assumed that theGovernment supported them as a whole, whereas in reality therewere a number of aspects which, given more time for reflection,Ministers might wish to see changed.    There would accordingly be advantage in publishing the report and the Bill now, announcing theGovernments intention to legislate next Session and reserving final decisions on the detailed content of the legislation until reactions tothe Law Commission^ proposals eould be assessed.    On the otherhand, it was argued that next Session was also likely to be verycrowded, and the TUC wanted early legislation on conspiracy.    the enactment of Part I would be helpful in the Governments relationswith the TUC, which were of cardinal importance to the Governmentseconomic strategy, unless it transpired that the TUC itself wouldlike more time to consider its attitude to the proposals.    Parts H andHI were the more controversial parts, on which there was a strongercase for awaiting reactions.    Considerable difficulties were,however, being experienced in the administration of the present lawon squatting and obscenity, and early legislation was desirable on both; though it might be preferable if the whole of the law onobscenity and public morals were to be reviewed, perhaps by an interdepartmental working party rather than by a Select Committee,before legislation was introduced,
In discussion of the problems of fitting in a Bill this Session, it waspointed out that despite all the Government&apos;s good intentions theposition in the House of Lords was likely to be worse this Session than last.    Major and contentious Bills which might not reach the Lordsmuch before July included those on Education, Dockworkers, private practice, Tied Cottages and Race Relations,    If a Bill on conspiracywere added to their number, it would be essential to drop some otherBill,    ft would, however, be possible to introduce the ConspiracyBill in the House of Lords now, though, owing to its contentiousnature, it would require protracted consideration and might be considerably amended in the Lords,    Introduction in the Lords wouldmean that only one day, for Second Reading, would be required on the floor of the Commons before the Summer Recess, with Report and third Reading taken in the spillover; but it seemed improbable thatthere would be time to complete the Commons Committee Stage, whichwould also be protracted, before the Recess.It was also pointed out in discussion that a considerable campaign hadbeen mounted in left-wing circles in favour of reforms in this fielddifferent from those which the Law Commission were nowrecommending; and that an announcement of the governments intention to introduce legislation reducing the maximum penalties forconspiracy would result in further pressure relating to persons nowimprisoned for conspiracy offences.    These political aspects of thematter would require careful handling,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed on the importance of early legislation onconspiracy, and it was to be hoped mat Part I of the Law Commissionsproposals could be enacted this Session.    On publication of the LawCommissions report it would be necessary for the Government to announce their intention to legislate on Part I with all reasonablespeed, but it might be desirable to await reactions to Parts H and HIbefore deciding on the form of legislation on squatting and obscenity.The Cabinet were not yet in a position, however, to reach a conclusion      on whether and how it might be possible to secure the enactment of Part I this Session and accordingly on whether theannouncement should promise legislation this Session or next.    TheHome Secretary should therefore arrange for the publication of thereport to be deferred until the Cabinet had reached a decision on thispoint.    The Lord President of the Council, in consultation with theLord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Lord Privy Seal, the chief whip and the Attorney General, should urgently consider by whatmeans it might be possible to enact Part I of the Bill this Session,including the questions whether the Bill should be introduced in theHouse of Lords rather than the House of Commons and what options,if any, there were for dropping other proposed legislation if thatBhould be found necessary.    The outcome of this examination should
then be reported to the Cabinet.    Meanwhile the Home Secretary andthe Lord Privy Seal should sound out the Opposition in both Houses ontheir likely reactions to a Bill on Part I this Session.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minis tor1 summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office4 March 197610
