fj^ME MINISTERS     1.        THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet in theWTENTION TO following terms of hie intention to resign ae Prime Minister as^SlGN soon as the Parliamentary Labour Party could choose a newLeader.&quot;I have just returned from the Palace where I had anAudience of The Queen.    I formally confirmed to her aa decision of which I had apprised her early in December,that in March of this year I would intend to make way for a successor, and that I would resign as Prime Minister assoon as the Parliamentary Party had completed thenecessary constitutional procedures for electing a newLeader.&quot;In March 1974 I decided that I would remain in office for no more than two years.    I have not wavered in this decision and it is irrevocable.    Indeed I had originally intended thatit should take effect last September, but decided to defer itbecause of the paramount Importance of ensuring thenational acceptance and Buccess of the counter-inflationpolicy the Government announced last July.&quot;I must, of course, inform my colleagues of my reasons:&quot;First. I have been Leader of this Party for over 13exciting and turbulent years - nearly eight of them inGovernment.    My period as Prime Minister has beenlonger than that of any of my peacetime predecessors inthiB century.    These years of office spanned a period whenBritain, nationally and internationally, had to face stormsand challenges without parallel in our peacetime history.&quot;But it is not only those last 13 years; In 31 years inParliament I have been on one or other Front Bench for nearly 30 years - for almost ll  years in Cabinet.    No oneshould ask for more.&quot;To have led four Administrations, dedicated not only tosolving the nation,s economic problems but also toachieving a higher level of social justice and equality than our people have ever known, is a privilege conferred on very few men.&quot;Second. I have a clear duty to the country and to the Partynot to remain here so long that others are denied the chance to seek election to this post.    This is the most experiencedand talented team in this century, in my view transcendingthat of Campbell-Banner man 70 yearB ago.    Iam proud ofthat.   A leadership election will do good in showing thecountry the wealth of talent in our ranks.1
&quot;The fact that I am leaving shortly after my sixtiethbirthday has no bearing on the choice to be made.    I havereached sixty after 13 years&apos; Party leadership, nearlyeight of these in Downing Street.    Some of my mostdistinguished predecessors were either just below or just over that age on becoming Prime Minister, includingClem Attlee, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan andAlec Douglas-Home in our own time.    The fact that I beganearly and have borne the responsibility of this office for solong means that sixty is the right age for me to promulgatea change.&quot;Third, it is my view that my successor should be in postnow, to impose his or her style and to work out the strategy for the remaining years of this Parliament.    But 1 amcertain that the new Administration will assert the sameh a termination and dedication in our counter-inflationpolicies in this country, as we have unitedly shown to theworld.   Equally I am totally convinced that no conceivablereconstruction of the Cabinet could in any way lead to a weakening in our resolve to fulfil in full measure our commitment to our allies and partners overseas.&quot;Fourth, there is, a danger, to which I have been alerted all my working life.    It is that, in times of rapid change, you may be faced with a decision which, perhaps in different conditions, you have faced before.    If, on the earlieroccasion you considered and rejected a particular course ofaction, there is a tendency to say you have been into that,so that you do not give the fresh consideration thecircumstances may require.    I am determined not tosuccumb to this danger.&quot;I want to make it quite clear, with the agreement of all myCabinet colleagues, that these reasons represent the totalexplanation of my decision.    There are no impendingproblems or difficulties - economic or political - known tothe Cabinet, which are not known to the country and whichare not already the subject of the political discussion of ourtimes.&quot;Now I want to express my warm thanks to my colleagues,not only for their work and. achievements, but  or the factthat in all my four Administrations these have been happyCabinets.    We have faced problems far more daunting than any Cabinet in our post-war history, and those problemshave been met with more courage, more determination,more imagination and more comradeship and unity than byany Cabinet of which I have knowledge.    I have in factpresided over 472 Cabinets and thousands of cabinet committees,    I have answered more than 12, 000Parliamentary Questions.2
&quot;I am proud of the achievements of these past two years.&quot;We remember what we faced when we were recalled to office a little over two years agd.    It was not only theeconomic paralysis.    There was a widespread anxiety inthe country that even the &quot;goverliability11 of Britain was in doubt.    It is not in doubt today, because the economic and social governance of Britain has been established on thebasis of the consent of the people.&quot;We have created a new relationship between Governmentand people to replace the clash and confrontation which twoyears ago almost brought this country to disaster.&quot;This is a far more united and determined people now than for many years.&quot;Our counter-inflation policies have been accepted by thegreat majority of the nation.    Our counter-inflationtarget for the end of this year is now in sight of achieve -ment.&quot;In 1975 the current account deficit on our balance ofpayments was less than half the deficit in 1974, even though we have had to meet - and had to meet in a period ofunprecedented world economic problems - the five-foldincrease in the price of the oil we import.&quot;The value of our exports is rising strongly - by 4 per centin the last three months compared with the previous threemonths - and at a much faster rate than imports.&quot;For two years we have had to face the consequences of world inflation and world unemployment.    But now the economy is beginning to revive.    Business confidence is higher than at any time since the autumn of 1973.    Thereare growing signs that the rate of increase in unemployment is running at a very much smaller level than last year,particularly the last three months of last year.&quot;We inherited a dangerously distorted and unbalancedeconomy.    We are beginning to get it right.&quot;For the first time, industrial problems are being tackledby relevant micro-economic action in place of an over-reliance on clumsy and often ineffective macro-economiclurches; through NEDC and direct action to restructureand modernise particular industries through not and specific sectoral actions to strengthen our economic base,which is manufacturing industry.3
&quot;We have embarked on the biggest programme of industrial jtraining and re-training in our history. jI&quot;We have carried through the greatest-ever improvements in the standards of pensioners and others dependent on thesocial services, particularly the disabled, previously soneglected.&quot;We inherited me lowest housebuilding figures Bince the1950s; we have restored the housing programme to over300, 0P0 houses a year.&quot;In world affairs our relations with the United States, with european countries, East and West, and with theCommonwealth, are better than for many years.    our membership of the European Community has been confirmed.    Our relations with the United States wererecently described by President Ford as being &quot;as good as they have ever been&quot;.&quot;Now, for the future.&quot;Later this morning I will meet the Chairman of theParliamentary Labour Party, and propose that he calls aspecial meeting of the Party this evening, to put forward the Liaison Committee&apos;s suggestions for the leadershipelection, so mat nominations may be invited forthwith.I would hope that they may be able to devise procedures which enable full consideration to be combined with all reasonable speed - certainly more expeditious than the somewhat leisurely weekly procedures of the past.j&quot;I shall play no part in that election apart from casting my own vote by secret ballot. Nor will I seek to influence asingle Member of the Party in his vote.&quot;I shall remain in Parliament as long as my constituencywill put up with me.    I haw not been inactive on behalf ofmy constituents.    I hope to see more of them and put inmore time on their behalf.    I am above all a Parliamentarian;I love Parliament and want to go on serving it and serving in it.&quot;I shall not go into industry or take paid employment.&quot;I shall not accept the headship or other office in any placeof learning, apart from my present relationship with theUniversity of Bradford.    I may give occasional lectures hereor abroad, as I have for many years, but not to the detriment of my Parliamentary work.4
&quot;I want to say this to my successor, whoever he or she maybe.&quot;This is an office to cherish; stimulating and satisfying.You will never have a dull moment; you will never getbored.   But it is a full-time calling.    These are not theeasy, spacious, socially-orientated days of some of mypredecessors.   Apart from quite generous holidays -when, thaakfl to modern communications, I have never been more than moments away from Downing Street - Z have hadto work seven days a week at least 12 to 14 hours a day.But the variety and interest - with, usually, at least 500different documents or submissions to read in an averageweekend after a busy week - means that you do not getbored; consequently, you do not get tired.&quot; very Prime Minister has his own style.    But he must knowall that is going on.   Even if he were tempted to be remissin this, the wide-open nature of Prime Minister&apos;sQuestions - entirely different from that of any departmental minister - requires familiarity with, and understanding of,the problems of every Department and every part of thecountry.&quot;More than that, the price of an Administration^continuance and success is eternal vigilance - on duty or oncall every minute of the day.    Yet you must find time enoughto stand back and think about the problems of theAdministration, its purpose, its co-ordination and Itslonger-term strategy.    Equally you have to watch for thatcloud no bigger than a manfs hand which may threaten nottomorrow^ crisis, but perhaps next month&apos;s or next year&apos;s.In all this you have got to think and feel politically as wellas in constitutional and administrative terms.&quot;It is not only the job here in Westminster, Whitehall and parliament.    It is the job in the country.    The leader of theParty, and no less the Prime Minister, has a duty to meetthe people, to address political and other meetings.    For13 years I have averaged well over 100 a year, coveringnearly every constituency, some of them many times.&quot;You will be able to count on my full support, especially whenthe going is rough.&quot;My advice and experience is available when you seek it: Ido not intend to offer gratuitous advice.&quot;I will give any help I can In any form you ask, inBide tha-House, in the Parliamentary Party, and in the country,apart from accepting a Ministerial appointment.5
&quot;In particular, I shall be guided by the letter and spirit ofthe undertaking which a pre-war predecessor gave when hestood down for a successor, who was in fact chosen - notelected as is our rule - &quot;Once I leave, I leave.    I am not going to speak to the man on the bridge, and I am not goingto spit on the deck&quot;.&quot;I am confident that this brief election period will becomradely and not divisive.&quot;In this period every Minister will be expected to put hisfull effort into his Departmental and Cabinet duties.    I will,of course, remain in full charge of the Administration untilthe electoral process is completed, exercising all the rightsand duties of a Prime Minister to take any action that is needed.&quot;I am confident that a new Prime Minister in taking over willenjoy from his Cabinet the same loyalty, support, under-standing and even, when required, forgiveness, that it hasbeen my privilege to enjoy.&quot;My only advice to him and the Cabinet he forms - and I amsun this advice is not necessary - is to get out into thecountry, meet the people, tell them, explain to them, listen to them; and above all remember the Party is the Party inthe country - not the Palace of Westminster, not SmithSquare.&quot;In return I would ask the Party everywhere - and I hopethat our Press  ciendt, all of whom I forgive, will allow meto say this to them as well - that in all circumstances allconcerned will comply with the spirit of the Speaker*sPetition to The Queen on behalf of the Commons when a new parliament meets: &quot;That the most favourable constructionmay be placed on all your proceedings&quot;.11The Prims Minister **id thtt fa* wished to emphasise that the timing of this matter was not related to any recent events.    Hehad considered resigning before the last Party Conference  andthen again at Christmas: but he had felt it necessary to remainin order to lead the campaign for acceptance of the pay policy set for the year from the end of July 1975.    If he had delayedany longer however this would have posed problems in relationto the negotiations for the second round of counter-inflationpolicy.    He had therefore decided as long ago as last december that middle or late March would be the right moment.    Thismarked in effect the turn of the hinge when the 1975 counter-inflation policy was fully established and the 1976 policy was about to be worked out.    He had not announced his intention on his6
sixtieth birthday because this coincided with two by-elections,and he had also bad to take into account the situation on theforeign exchange market.    The sterling rate had now steadied,but it would clearly be of the greatest importance to present very fully the reasons for bis decision and thus avoid any speculationthat it arose from anything other than the original decision whichhe had taken in March 1974 that he would not remain as PrimeMinister for more than two years.    He proposed therefore to release to the Press the text of the statement which he had justmade to the Cabinet.    Suitable messages were being sent to someforeign Heads of Government and to certain other persons,including the Governor of the Bank of England, who needed to beInformed without delay.    He proposed to absent himself from therest of the meeting in order to inform the Chairman of theParliamentary Labour Party and ask him to set in hand thenecessary constitutional procedures for electing a new Leader.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the cabinet had listened to the Prime Minister &apos;s statement, which to theirregret he had said was irrevocable, with very great sadness.They were indeed stunned: and at this stage he could only convey to the Prime Minister their very heartfelt thanks for everythingwhich he had done for them.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY agreedthat this was not the time for tributes to the Prime minister who would continue to direct their counsels until a new Leaderhad been chosen.    He wanted however to add that history would deal even more kindly with the Prime Minister than hiscontemporaries.    It was sometimes said that the Prime minister had displayed a unique facility in keeping the Labour Partytogether: but it bad also to be remembered that in maintaining a united Party, as with his succosb on other matters, the PrimeMinister had served the nation well.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with regret, of the statement by the Prime Minister.2.   Took note, with warm approval, of the statements by the Lord President and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Lord President of the Council, and invited the Home Secretary to proceed accordingly.8THE LAW ON Z. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the timing of the conspiracy Government legislation which would follow the Law Commissionsreport on the law of conspiracy in England and Wales, which wasPrevious to be published the following day.^ference;CC(76) 8th THE HOME SECRETARY said that on 4 March the Cabinet had conclusions, invited the Lord President and himself, with the other MinistersMinute 5 concerned, to consider urgently by what means it might be possibleto enact Part I of the Law Commissions draft Bill this Session.Before this discussion he had met representatives of the TradesUnion Congress (TUC).   This had been a very small, low-leveldeputation, whereas earlier TUC deputations on related matters had been large and high-level.    He had explained the position tothe deputation and asked them whether, given a choice, they would prefer legislation this Session or next.    They had recognised thatthe Law Commissions proposals were complicated, and appearedto be disposed to accept the need for further study with a view to legislation next Session.    The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General now took the view that it would be impracticable to limit the legislation to Part I of the Law Commissions proposals,dealing with conspiracy generally.    In the circumstances he thoughtit would be better not to proceed with immediate legislation, whichwould involve the risk of a botched Bill getting bogged down inParliament, although if the TUC were subsequently to urgelegislation this Session it would be necessary to have another look at the position.    He proposed that, after publication of the report,the Government should indicate their intention of legislating early next Session, at least on Part I.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he agreed with this course.In his view, it would be impracticable, almost to the point ofImpossibility, to reform the present law on conspiracy generally,as in Part I, while maintaining the corresponding law in relation tosquatting and obscenity by deferring action on Parts II and HI of theLaw Commissions proposals.    Ministers had not yet fully discussed the major points of policy which arose on Parts II and III, and public reaction to these proposals would be important.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up a briefdiscussion, said the Cabinet agreed that, about a week after thepublication of the Law Commissions report, the Home secretary should announce the Governments intention, following consultations with interested bodies, to legislate at the start of next SeBBion,certainly on Part I of the Law Commissions proposals and, subjectto public reactions, on Parts II and HI.    The Home Secretary wouldalso arrange for any guidance to the Press which might be necessarybetween publication of the report and the Government announcement.
3.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade (C(76) 30) on the interim report by the RoyalCommission on the Press.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the RoyalCommission on the Press had been asked in September 1975 toproduce an urgent interim report on the financial situation and prospects for the national newspaper Industry because of widespreadfears that one or more national newspapers might close while theCommission was pursuing its general remit.    The interim report was to be published the following day.    The essence of its recommendations was that reduction of costs by introduction of newequipment and agreed reduction of manpower was the only way tosecure an early improvement in the industry^ financial position.The Royal Commission saw joint discussions which were being held between management and unions as a major opportunity for promotingthese changes.    They rejected any general subsidy for the Press and considered that most national newspapers could borrow from theprivate sector to finance the capital investment and the redundancy payments which would be involved.    They had however recommendedthat newspapers unable to borrow from the private sector should be permitted to borrow from the Government and that, in addition, theGovernment should provide a measure of interest relief on allborrowing for this purpose from whatever source.    The interimreport had been considered by a meeting under the Prime Minister&apos;chairmanship which had agreed that the report should be broadlywelcomed.    The impetus provided by the report and by the agreement in principle already reached between the management and the trades union provided a unique opportunity for bringing about radical changeby agreement in an industry which had a history of failure to agree onsuch matters.    However the draft statement which he proposed tomake, and which was attached to C(76) 30, avoided any commitments on the Government to provide assistance.    These could not be givenuntil more details were available and a more detailed agreement hadbeen reached between management and unions.In discussion it was questioned whether it was necessary for anysubstantial statement to be made at the time of publication of thereport.    Agreement even in principle to provide public funds to the newspaper industry raised important issues, for example as to conditions which should be imposed, which needed to be fully considered.    On the other hand it was argued strongly that theGovernment had requested a report to be made as a matter of urgency and that it was incumbent on them to give some indication of their views as soon as it was published.9
In further discussion it was pointed out that the Commission hadenvisaged two distinct forms of assistance to the industry.    Firstlythey had recommended that newspapers which were unable to raiseloans from commercial sources should be provided with loans from public funds.   Secondly they had recommended mat all loans, from whatever source,  should receive an interest subsidy from theGovernment for 2 years.    The first of these raised problems inrelation to the Government&apos;s industrial strategy, for it required the Government to provide assistance to companies which were not sufficiently credit-worthy to borrow on the commercial market.The use of Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 would cause particular problems, and no commitment should be given on this.    Therewere still more serious objections to the second recommendation and there was a strong case for making clear from the outset thatthere was no question of the Government providing such a subsidy.On the other hand it was strongly argued that the provision of a loan from public funds to those newspapers unable to borrow from commercial sources was an essential element In the RoyalCommission^ recommendations.    Their objective had been toensure that all newspaper houses moved together: if some pursuedan independent course the failures to modernise which had beencharacteristic of the past were likely to be repeated.    Given the seriousness of the condition of the industry it was necessary to preserve the momentum which had been brought about by the work ofthe Royal Commission and to this end some call on public fundsmight be necessary.    The Commission justified the recommendation for an interest subsidy on similar grounds but on this issue their case was much less strong, and it would be right for the Governmentto be wholly non-committal.   The possibility of such a limited subsidy should not, however, be ruled out.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, summing upthe discussion, said that the Cabinet were agreed that it would be right for the Government to make a statement of their attitude to theRoyal Commission^ report at the time of publication on the lines ofthe draft attached to C(76) 30.    There was however a wide measureof agreement that no commitment should be given to the provision ofpublic funds, particularly for an interest subsidy.    The general view was that an appropriate amendment to the draft statement would beto delete the words &quot;but, above all, in present financial circumstances,when the availability of public funds must necessarily be very limited,it is imperative for all concerned to have the measures of the figuresinvolved.&quot;   from the second page of the draft statement.    TheSecretary of State for Trade should consider this proposal and advise the members of the Cabinet urgently in correspondence if he were notable to accept it.    If pressed on the question of an interest subsidy,the Secretary of State should take a negative rather than a positiveline: he should also avoid accepting that Section 8 of the industry act 1972 would be used if assistance were to be provided.10
The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Approved the draft statement attached toC(76) 30, subject to the amendment indicated in theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary^ summing upof their discussion.11
4.        During a brief further discussion, in the absence of thePrime Minister, about the Prime Minister&apos;s intention to resign thesuggestion was made that, while any formal tributes could more appropriately come later, the Cabinet during their present meeting should Issue a Bhort statement.    This was desirable on two grounds:firstly, to express the Cabinet&apos;e sense of loss and its profoundgratitude to the Prime Minister for the unique service he had givenover 13 years, and secondly to underline the point that this was a personal and Irrevocable decision of which the Cabinet had noforeknowledge.Following further discussion the Cabinet considered the following draft statement:-&quot;Cabinet thiB morning learned with deep regret of the whollyunexpected message which the Prime Minister had earlierconveyed to The Queen.    They would have wished It otherwise.They must respect what he has described as a personal andirrevocable decision.    The Prime Minister has carried the burdens of leadership with outstanding wisdom and dedication.The whole Cabinet wishes to place on record immediately itssense of loss and its profound gratitude to Harold Wilson forthe unique service he has given to his country and his Partyover the past 13 years&quot;.The Cabinet -Approved the statement and instructed the Secretaryof the Cabinet to arrange for its immediate releaseto the Press.12
rj, iiEjlL 5.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C(76) 24) by theV^BXJILDING        Secretary of State for Industry on the future prospects for thef^industry shipbuilding industry.t\ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy had recently considered the future prospects of the shipbuilding industryand had agreed that he should make a report to the Cabinet.   Inhis view this was the most severe industrial problem facing theGovernment.    Market conditions were extremely difficult with world demand for ships at present only 25 per cent of world capacity.As a result of the energy crisis no new tankers would be needed forsome years and as a result of the world recession the demand fordry cargo ships had fallen sharply.    The British industry wasuncompetitive - Japanese yards were quoting prices 50 per centbelow those of British yards while European prices were 20 per centbelow British.    The Japanese industry already had 50 per cent ofthe world market and on present trends would soon have 80 per cent.The British industry had secured only 1 new order since October 1975and Govan Shipbuilders Ltd, as an example, had taken no orders sincethe middle of 1974.    The industry at present employed some 70, 000directly and probably as many again indirectly.    The employmentwas heavily concentrated in areas already faced with serious unemploy-ment problems.    If no further orders were taken this employment would fall by a half by the end of 1977 and would bring unemploymentin the areas affected to 20 per cent.    The prospects were that it mightrun at this level well into the 1980s.    There seemed no prospect of alternative jobs being created at the next economic upturn Bince theareas affected would also be facing at the same time the rationalisation of the steel industry and the contraction of the aircraft industry.Those unemployed would be almost all males and the local problems would be the worse because the shipbuilding industry had traditionallybeen a major source of apprenticeships.   The Bill for the nationalisa-tion of the industry was making satisfactory progress through theHouse of Commons and was no longer being very strenuously opposed.However there was no point in continuing with the Bill unless steps were taken to secure further orders for the industry.    In any event the future contraction of the industry would be blamed on nationalisation.He proposed that, in a joint approach with the Secretary of State for trade, he should put the strongest pressure on British shipowners toplace more orders in British shipyards.    While proper regard needed to be given to the interests of the shipping industry It had to beremembered that they had benefitted in the years 1967-76 frominvestment grants of  586 million, of which  458 million had beentowards orders placed in foreign shipyards.    Although investment grants were being phased out a further   80 million had been paid theprevious year and even now the industry were able to chargedepreciation of 100 per cent in the first year for ships ordered abroad.If the voluntary approach he proposed did not bring adequate resultsmore drastic measures, such as legislation or fiscal measures would need to be seriously considered.    The alternative, that a major13
shipping nation should have its shipbuilding industry destroyed, wasintolerable.   Apart from measures to secure new orders work was already In hand on a special redundancy scheme, to be financeddirectly by the Government, to alleviate the social consequences ofthe contraction of the industry.    This did not however need to beconsidered at the present stage.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND Bald thatwhile the Secretary of State for lad us try&apos;a report did not cover theindustry In Northern Ireland the same difficulties arose.    consideration was being given to a reduction In the labour force at Harland and Wolfffrom 9, 000 to 4, 000 men.   He was wholly in agreement with theSecretary of State for Industry and considered it would be indefensibleto permit the threatened reduction of the industry.In discussion there was general agreement on the gravity of theproblems facing the shipbuilding industry and of the need for actionto ensure that it was maintained.    It was argued that it would be wholly against the national interest to allow the destruction of theresources of skill which had been built up in the industry and thatredundancies on the scale threatened were intolerable in the areasin which the industry was concentrated.   It was however pointed outthat the surplus of    - shipping capacity In the world would severelylimit the amount of new orders to be placed and the industry would be faced with very acute overseas competition for many years.    the shipbuilding industries in other countries, notably Japan and Sweden,were much more efficient.  Restrictive practices and poor management in the British industry had seriously damaged its prospects.   Therewould be advantage in a major effort being made to bring home to all those who worked in the industry, not merely the trades union leaders,the difficulties which the industry faced.While there was general support for the proposal for pressure to bebrought on the British shipping industry to place further orders itwas argued strongly that the scope for securing orders in this waywas limited.    The shipping industry now had a modern fleet and stillhad 3 million tons awaiting delivery from British shipyards.    Theycould not be forced to order ships they did not need.    There was nopoint in adopting measures to rescue the shipbuilding industry whichmight seriously damage the prosperity of the shipping industry.    Thedifficulties In shipbuilding were faced not only by the British but bythe European and indeed the whole world industry.    There was a case for action within the European Economic Community both to concertaction to deal with Japanese competition and also to deal with the structural unemployment problems faced in a number of member states.   A Community-wide approach could both be beneficial to theBritish industry and avoid the difficulties which would be faced ifBritain pursued a purely national approach.14
In further discussion it was pointed out that the Ministry of defence would need to place a substantial order for ships in coming years.Their planned programme, amounting to  120 million per annumincluded 2 large fleet tankers, an underwater research vessel,and fast patrol craft. -   It would be possible for these orders to be brought forward, and to be placed outside the specialistproducers, but this would depend on funds being made availableoutside the existing provisions for the Ministry of Defence.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, summing upthe discussion, said that the general view of the Cabinet was that action must be taken  to prevent the destruction of the shipbuilding industry.    It would be absurd for a major maritime nation tobecome wholly dependent on overseas suppliers of ships.    TheSecretary of State for Industry had proposed a variety of measureswhich might be taken and tills action should be kept under review bythe Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy.    Theproposal mat pressure should be put upon British shipowners tpplace further orders in British shipyards was approved but thepossibility that mis might be followed by further steps would need careful consideration.    The Ministerial Committee on Economic andIndustrial Policy should also examine the possibility of defence ordersbeing brought forward.
