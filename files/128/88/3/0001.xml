LEGISLATIVE

PROGRAMME

1987-88

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

(C(87) 4) outlining the recommendations of The Queen&apos;s Speeches and

Future Legislation Committee (QL) for the legislative programme for the

1987-88 Session of Parliament.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that,  in considering the

legislative programme for the 1987-88 Session, QL had had to allow for

various options in the timing of the General Election.    Although there

were clearly a number of possibilities,  it was possible for legislative

planning purposes to work on the basis of two options only.    The first

option assumed no Election in 1987 and a short final Session of the

present Parliament.    The second assumed an Election in 1987 to be

followed by the first Session of a new Parliament.    That Session would

be a long one if an Election were held early, but as some of the extra

time would be devoted to re-introduced Bills that had been lost at the

dissolution, QL did not believe that special planning was needed for

that eventuality.    There was clearly a lead time in the preparation of

legislation, and decisions needed to be taken now on the selection of

Bills on which work should be put in hand so as to place the Government

in the best position to face either option.    It was not practicable, or

indeed politically sensible,  to envisage two totally separate

programmes.    QL had therefore considered that the best approach was to

draw up a politically robust programme of Bills for a full (first)

Session from which a small selection could be made to provide a suitable

programme for a short (final) Session.    The list of recommended Bills

was included at Annex A to his memorandum:  this programme should not be

regarded as final.    It was an extremely heavy one, both in terms of the

size of the Bills and their political substance.    Any additions that

proved necessary would have to be accommodated by deletions of

corresponding weight.

There were two Bills to which QL had given particular thought. The

first concerned housing, where QL had concluded that there was a need

for a major Bill in the next Session, although the precise terms in

which it would be cast were still the subject of policy consideration.

The second concerned water privatisation.    QL had accepted the need in

the first Session of a new Parliament for a Water Powers and Metering

Bill which would pave the way for the main privatisation Bill by

clarifying areas of doubt about the powers of the water authorities.

They did not, however, consider it wise also to include the main

privatisation Bill in that Session.    There were a number of practical

and political reasons for this view.    First,  it would be a fourth major

Bill for Environment Ministers to have to steer through in that Session:

although that could doubtless be done if it was absolutely essential, it

was nevertheless a very heavy burden for any one Department to have to

bear.    Secondly,  it would be risky in terms of Parliamentary management

to attempt a paving Bill and a main Bill in a single Session; previous

experience of such devices had not been happy.    Thirdly,  the Secretary

of State for the Environment was now radically revising his proposals in

a way which many colleagues found attractive but which meant that the

resulting Bill could not be ready before January 1988 at the earliest.

QL had had serious doubts whether it was sensible to introduce a major

and contentious piece of legislation this late, particularly in a

programme of great political weight.    He sought the approval of the

Cabinet for these and QL&apos;s other recommendations.    He also sought their

agreement to apply stricter criteria for the award of advance drafting

authority in the future and that the main Water Bill should be first

choice for the award of such authority for the 1988-89 Session.    If the

Cabinet agreed,  the second choice might be remitted for QL to make in

the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.    Finally, he was grateful to the

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for his fuller explanation of

why his Financial Markets  (Clearing Arrangements) Bill was needed, but

he still thought it undesirable to give it a place until it was clearer

how long the measure would need to be and its timetable for preparation

had been mapped out.

In discussion the following main points were made -

a. It was essential to proceed with the Housing Bill in the first

Session of a new Parliament if it was to be implemented

successfully.    Policy on the various strands of the Bill needed to

be finalised as a matter of urgency if it was to be ready on time.

b. The policy changes that the Secretary of State for the

Environment was proposing for water privatisation were radical and

complex.    While they would meet many of the criticisms made of the

original proposals they would attract different criticisms for new

quarters.    The plans needed to be carefully thought through, with

further public consultation, and a January 1988 date of

introduction for the Bill might well prove optimistic.    This would

be a serious enough matter for the business managers in any event,

but would be all the more difficult given the fact that the main

Bill would need to be preceded by a paving Bill and carried forward

in a Session of unusual weight and controversy.    While timetable

Motions could undoubtedly be used to secure a satisfactory

timetable in the House of Commons,  this would be at the expense of

transferring the problem to the House of Lords.    Moreover it was

not certain that much advantage would be obtained by proceeding

with the main Bill in the first, rather than second, Session of the

new Parliament, given the advice the Secretary of State for the

Environment had received that flotation could not take place until

nine months after Royal Assent to the paving Bill.

c. Against this,  it was argued that a delay in water

privatisation would cause a significant gap in the privatisation

programme which would seriously damage its momentum.    In effect it

would mean that there would be no major privatisation between 1987

and 1990.    That would be a considerable political set-back. The

new proposals the Secretary of State for the Environment was now

comtemplating should remove much of the resistance to the Bill

amongst the Government&apos;s own supporters and assist its passage.

This suggested that, notwithstanding all the problems that had been

identified,  the balance of advantage lay with pressing ahead with

the main Water Privatisation Bill in the first Session of the new

Parliament.

d. The Alleviation of Human Infertility Bill dealt with moral

issues on which the opinions of Members of Parliament reflected the

divisions in the population at large.    Even though it was proposed

to allow free votes on the most sensitive points, within the

framework of a Government Bill,  the legislation would prove deeply

divisive.    There was a strong argument for deferring it to a later

Session of the new Parliament, where it would not conflict with the

Bills of mainstream political priority with which the Government

would be pressing ahead in the first Session.

e. There were, on the other hand, arguments that pointed to

dealing with the Alleviation of Human Infertility Bill as soon as

possible in the new Parliament.    Postponement of the Bill might

make it harder, rather than easier, to manage its devisive

qualities.    The situation on the ground was changing quickly, and

the need for proper regulation was becoming ever more apparent. If

the Government did not act itself,  there was every risk of another

Private Member&apos;s Bill that would cause exceptional problems. The

issue would fester until there was proper legislation, and the

Government should seize the initiative.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet had

agreed that Bills on the Abolition of Domestic Rates, Housing and

Education were measures of prime political importance that should

definitely be taken in the first Session of the new Parliament. The

Secretary of State for the Environment would shortly be bringing forward

his proposals on housing to the appropriate Cabinet Committee. Further

policy proposals were also being brought forward by the Secretary of

State for the Environment on the privatisation of the water industry.

Important arguments had been advanced in discussion both for pressing

ahead with the main water privatisation measure in the first Session of

the new Parliament and for tackling the matter in two stages, with the

paving Bill in the first Session and the main privatisation measure in

the second:  these questions of phasing could not be finally resolved

until the forthcoming reconsideration of policy had been completed in

the light of the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposals. A

difficult judgment would also be required on the timing of the

Alleviation of Human Infertility Bill, on which discussion had exposed

strong arguments pulling in both directions.

The final balance of the programme that would be needed, and the

considerations bearing on the more difficult measures, would become

clearer later in the year, and final decisions need not be taken now.

The programme proposed in Annex A to C(87) 4 was provisionally agreed as

the basis on which work on the preparation of Bills should be put in

hand and in June the Cabinet should resume their consideration of the

programme, on the basis of a further review by QL.    In the meantime, the

Secretary of State for the Environment should as soon as possible bring

forward his proposals on housing and his revised policy proposals on

water privatisation for consideration in the appropriate Cabinet

Committees.    Similarly,  the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

should bring forward for collective consideration his proposals for

approaching clearing arrangements in financial markets,  together with

any other matters relating to the City for which he discerned a clear

need for early legislation.
