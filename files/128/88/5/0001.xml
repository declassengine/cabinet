CC(87) 24th Conclusions

THE PRISON

POPULATION

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, although the Home and

Social Affairs Committee (H) had unanimously agreed to the Home

Secretary&apos;s proposals for reducing the number of prisoners, increasing

the number of prison places and temporarily taking over Rollestone Camp,

they had not been able to agree with his suggestion that military

personnel should be involved in running Rollestone for the prison

service.    There was doubt whether sufficient prison officers were

available to operate Rollestone.    Even if they could be found, to make

them available would prejudice the Fresh Start working arrangements

being introduced in the prison service.    But any use of the Army in

circumstances that were short of a manifest emergency was a matter that

should engage the Cabinet and could not be settled in one of its

Committees.    H had therefore asked the Home Secretary and the Secretary

of State for Defence to arrange for the options to be urgently explored,

so as to inform the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he did not claim that the present

situation in the prisons was a manifest crisis.    It was, however, on the

brink of crisis, and a full scale emergency might develop at any time.

The proposals that had been approved by H would bring the prison service

great relief.    Although Rollestone could not appropriately house either

remand prisoners or dangerous offenders,  its use as a prison was an

important part of the package.    The prison service had used Rollestone

before, and were familiar with it.    The sole remaining problem was on

staffing the camp.    The prison service was currently under severe strain

and he would welcome any possible relief.    He had already agreed with

the Secretary of State for Defence that military personnel should not be

used in duties that brought them into face-to-face contact with

prisoners.    What was at issue now was their deployment in back-up duties

of various kinds.    His assessment was that this use of military

personnel in a temporary prison environment would run less risk of

creating industrial trouble with the Prison Officers Association (POA)

than would the use of any other group of people from outside the prison

service.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that it would be a

completely new principle to use the military in aid of the civil power

in any circumstances short of a manifest crisis.    The face-to-face

custody of prisoners was clearly the most sensitive of the duties in

question, and he was grateful that the Home Secretary had agreed to find

prison officers for that.    Nevertheless, the deployment of military

personnel even on such tasks as catering and maintenance would breach

the point of principle, and he would have yet greater reservations about

their deployment on perimeter sucurity, which might bring them into

coercive contact with prisoners at any time.    He would very much prefer

that the Home Secretary could find his way to run Rollestone without the

involvement of any military personnel.    The Chief of the Defence Staff

fully shared his concerns.


The following main points were made in this part of the discussion -

a. The maintenance of perimeter security, at least insofar as

this involved external surveillance, seemed on the face of it to be

a not inappropriate task for police. If there was no legal problem

about such police deployment, then it seemed likely that sufficient

numbers of police officers could be found for the task. It had to

be accepted that any emergency staffing arrangements were likely to

be expensive, whatever service was involved.

b. The total number of staff involved in the whole Rollestone

operation would be in the low hundreds.    As custodial and security

duties were removed from the argument,  the number of residual jobs

that the military might be asked to discharge became very small.

The point of principle against military deployment thus loomed

disproportionately large against the small manpower requirement

that was in question.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up this part of the discussion, said

that while the Cabinet appreciated the difficulties for the prison

service,  they would not be willing to authorise the involvement of

military personnel in the running of Rollestone or any other temporary

prison accommodation until the fullest examination had been given to

every alternative method of finding the necessary personnel.    So far as

perimeter security was concerned,  it appeared on the face of it that the

police would be the most appropriate service on which to rely if prison

officers could not be made available.    A decision on this and other

matters raised was, however, clearly dependent on further consideration

of the legal issues.    The Home Secretary should make no public mention

of the possibility of using service personnel, and he should give

further thought to ways of running Rollestone without military

involvement.

The Cabinet -

Invited the Home Secretary to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their discussion.
