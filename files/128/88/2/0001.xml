ECONOMIC STRATEGY


MOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD

TO

CC(87) 5th Conclusions

ECONOMIC

STRATEGY

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

(C(87) 2) on Economic Strategy.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that economic performance during

1986 had been good.    Growth had been at 3 per cent,  inflation had

averaged 3.5 per cent,  the lowest since 1967,  the current account of the

balance of payments had been broadly in balance, and unemployment had

stopped rising and started to fall.

For 1987,  the prospects were also good.    Growth should again be about

3 per cent, and better balanced between consumers&apos; expenditure,

investment and exports.    Inflation, as measured by the Retail Price

Index should edge up towards the middle of the year, but fall back again

to 4 per cent by its end.    The trend of unemployment should be

downwards, although that did not of course mean that the total would be

lower in every single month.    The current account of the balance of

payments was expected to show a small deficit, but the United Kingdom&apos;s

large holding of overseas assets should ensure that it created no

problems.    Perhaps the most striking proof of the improvement in United

Kingdom economic performance was provided by international comparisons

of productivity.    In the 1960s and 1970s the increase in output per head

in manufacturing industry had been about the lowest for the major

industrialised countries.    Since 1979 it had been the highest.

There were of course risks.    The biggest was on inflation.    The United

Kingdom&apos;s position as an oil exporter meant that,    unlike most of its

competitors,  it had had to adjust to the change in oil prices by

allowing the exchange rate to fall, and this was leading to the slight

upturn in inflation.    But it was still very low by recent standards.

Another risk was on pay.    Pay increases were coming down, but only

slowly and not by as much as they should.    Finally, there were always

great uncertainties about future prospects for world trade and pressures

for protectionism.

As to fiscal prospects,  the fall in oil revenues and the increase in

public expenditure in the previous year&apos;s Autumn Statement had reduced

the scope for tax cuts.    He also believed that the following year&apos;s

Public Sector Borrowing Requirement  (PSBR) should be reduced below the

level,  1.75 per cent of Gross Domestic Product, projected in the

previous year&apos;s Medium Term Financial Strategy.    There should still be

room for some tax reductions, and the increase in the tax burden since

1979 showed the case for making them where possible.    But the overriding

need remained to maintain the prudent and consistent policies which had

brought about the present favourable position.


In discussion,  the following main points were made -

a. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was to be congratulated on his

economic management.    Sensible and prudent policies continued over

several years had led to a major improvement in economic

performance.    Their success had also led to a marked revival of

confidence in industry.    They must be maintained.

b. Table 2 in Annex 3 to C(87) 2 showed that since 1979 income tax

and National Insurance Contributions had risen as a percentage of

gross earnings for those on average earnings.    It was a major

objective to reverse that.    Another objective was to ameliorate the

poverty and unemployment traps which were created by the

interaction of the tax and benefit systems and had a depressing

effect on incentives.

c. The presentation of the case for tax cuts was important. The

Opposition would certainly attack them on the ground that they

would suck in imports and create jobs abroad rather than in this

country.    The Government must demonstrate that they were part of a

strategy for creating jobs by strengthening incentives throughout

the country.    The economic case for concentrating on cuts in the

basic rate rather than increases in allowances,  if that were

decided on, would also need to be strongly presented.

d. The Government had a good record on tax reform.    This also was

important to improving the performance of the economy, and the

Government should show that it intended to go further in that

direction in the longer term.    But it was probably not appropriate

to include proposals for major tax reform in a Budget which might

be followed later in the year by a General Election.

e. Interest rate reductions were also important, on one view as

important as tax cuts.    They would remove the only remaining

substantial grievance of industry, and help home buyers.    But the

effect on market confidence and possibly on inflation also had to

be borne in mind, and there could be no commitment as to the size

or timing of any reductions.    The Government&apos;s success in reducing

public borrowing meant that the relationship between the PSBR and

interest rates was not as direct as when they took office: private

sector borrowing was now larger than public sector borrowing by a

factor of several times.

f. The Government&apos;s policies on tax and expenditure needed to be

presented as a coherent whole: cuts in the Budget needed to be seen

in the context of the decisions on public expenditure the previous

autumn.    But the argument about the relative merits of expenditure

increases and tax cuts seemed to be attracting less attention than

the previous year.


g.      As part of further improving the performance of the economy,

consideration might be given, so far as resources allowed, to

measures to encourage small businesses and ownership of property

and shares, and to helping North Sea oil production.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet

congratulated the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his management of the

economy, which had produced very satisfactory results and prospects.

They fully endorsed the maintenance of the prudent and consistent

policies which had led to this outcome.

The Cabinet -

Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take

account of the discussion in preparing his

forthcoming Budget.
