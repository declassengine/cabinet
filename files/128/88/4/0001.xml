SERVICE

STRIKE

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the selective

strikes by some civil servants might make it impossible for the

unemployed in Scotland to receive any payments the following week. He

thought it important that the Government should make clear that the

effect of the strike was to harm the unemployed and others worse off

than the strikers themselves.    A further effect of the strikes would be

that the processing of the unemployment figures would be delayed and the

reliability of the figures affected.

In discussion it was said that -

a. The Department of Health and Social Security would be examining

whether any emergency arrangements might be needed for cases of

genuine hardship.    The selective strikes would be likely to affect

that Department&apos;s work on the development of schemes in the area of

family credit and personal pensions and would in effect be directed

at social security reforms.    Difficulties would be greater if the

strikes were directed at computer operations.

b. As the strikes were being undertaken in one region after

another,  it would be important to show that the first strikes had

not changed the Government&apos;s position and to mobilise public

opinion.    This could influence the willingness of civil servants to

strike in other regions.

c. The Ministers principally concerned should concert urgently the

presentation of the Government&apos;s case, as the public would be

increasingly aware of the effects of the strike.

The Cabinet -

1. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services and the

Secretary of State for Employment to consider urgently ways in

which any hardship created by industrial action in unemployment

benefit and social security offices for those dependent upon

benefits could be mitigated.

2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury (in the absence of the

Chancellor of the Exchequer) to co-ordinate with the Secretaries of

State for Social Services and Employment the presentation of the

Government&apos;s position in relation to the industrial action.
