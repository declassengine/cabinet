PRIMARY HEALTH CARE


MOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD

TO

CC(87) 27th Conclusions

PRIMARY

HEALTH CARE

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social

Services  (C(87) 15) about the need for improvements in the primary health

care services, and the scheme of dental charges for which he proposed to

take powers in the forthcoming Primary Health Care Bill.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Secretary of State for

Social Services had brought his proposals to the Home and Social Affairs

Committee (H) since they involved the contents of an early Bill, and since

they touched on important policy questions of health care.    The main point

at issue was whether charges should be introduced for dental examinations,

as well as for treatment.    H had now considered the matter on two

occasions, and the majority of the Committee were in favour of the scheme

of charges proposed by the Secretary of State, since they saw no other way

of meeting the challenging objectives that faced the Government in the

health field.    A minority of H, however, had felt that an issue of

principle was involved, and that the imposition of the proposed charges

would be a matter of the highest political controversy.    While it would

have been possible to sustain a ruling that H had settled the matter by a

majority,  it was clearly preferable that the full Cabinet should be

involved in the resolution of a question of such political importance.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he had inherited

various Public Expenditure Survey (PES) commitments,  including the sale of

the portfolio of the General Practice Finance Corporation,  for which he

needed to obtain the doctors&apos; agreement.    He would also need to impose a

charge on sight tests for the first time, which H had accepted.    But he

also had to find a way to respond to the disclosure by the Primary Health

Care Review of a number of lamentable defects in the primary health care

services.    Ninety per cent of public contacts with the National Health

Service (NHS) were with the primary health care sector, and improvements

here would be popular, as well as being long overdue.    Given his

commitments elsewhere in the health budget, he had to consider a

reallocation of resources within the primary health care sector. Since

there had been a great improvement in dental health,  it seemed clearly

right to seek to switch resources from that area to those identified by

the Primary Health Care Review, provided that the PES commitments were

honoured.    Dental charges were currently levied on the first  17 of

treatment, and 40 per cent of the balance up to a maximum of  115. He

proposed that,  for the first time, charges should be levied on

examinations, and that the charge should be at a simple rate of 75 per

cent of examination and treatment, up to a maximum of  150.    He proposed

to maintain the present exemption arrangements (under which about 46 per

cent of courses of treatment were currently provided free).    His proposals

would result in a very modest charge, somewhat below  3,  for examination

only.    Since the public were already well accustomed to dental charges, he

had no hesitation in seeking his colleagues&apos; agreement for his proposed


scheme of charges,  though it would be critical that their presentation

should be able to stress how the new charges had enabled additional

resources to be deployed in the primary health care field.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that he had no doubt that the proposed

charges were justified on merits.    Charging had already made a very useful

contribution to health service funding and there was no evidence that

charges had discouraged people from seeking the medical care they needed.

It seemed inconceivable that the proposed modest charges for dental

examinations,  from which vulnerable groups would be exempted, could have

that effect.    The PES commitments to which the Secretary of State for

Social Services had referred were substantial ones that stretched over the

whole survey period.    They represented offsets that had been agreed in

previous public expenditure rounds in order to enable increases to be made

in health spending.    They were not new reductions, and it was essential

that they should be met in full.    Whilst he recognised the presentational

arguments for the possible increases in primary health care expenditure to

which the Secretary of State for Social Services had pointed,  these would

have to be considered in the forthcoming public expenditure discussions

alongside other bids,  in the usual way.

In discussion,  the following main points were made -

a. The Government had always approached increases of charges in the

health service with the very greatest caution, but in the event the

political trouble had never been as great as had been feared.

Provided that the public could see improvements, they were unlikely

to see a great issue on the present occasion, since dental charges

were now familiar.    The proposed scale of charges would result in

lower charges for many minor courses of treatment.    The increases

were,  in any event, very modest and would not be levied on those most

vulnerable.

b. On the other hand, the medical professions would certainly

oppose the proposed charges and would argue that,  for the first time,

a charge was being required for diagnostic services.    This would be

represented as a major point of principle in itself, and it would be

argued that charges for dental examination were particularly

deplorable because dental examinations not infrequently disclosed

other medical conditions.    Fears would be worked up that the

Government had it in mind to introduce charges for visits to the

family doctor, and that the proposed charges were a foretaste of

other changes to come.

c. There was a particular difficulty, which the medical professions

would exploit, about imposing a charge on dental examinations at a

time when the Government wished to put the emphasis on preventive

medicine.    The improvement in the dental health of the country (which

was not shared in Scotland) was partly due to the increase in regular

visits to the dentist.

d. The difficulties noted in discussion would largely be avoided if

it were possible to raise the required amount of money from charges

for treatment.    This possibility had, however, been examined by H

which had concluded that the very high rate of charging that would

flow from it would not be practicable.    In particular, it was feared

that such rates of charging might lead to many dentists leaving the

NHS, although there was admittedly a surplus of dentists in the

Service.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the public were

well accustomed to dental charges, that the increases were modest, and

that the proposed charge for the examination only was extremely small.

The Cabinet accepted that it would be argued, particularly by sections of

the medical professions,  that charging for examination represented a

dangerous new principle, and the view had been expressed in discussion

that it would be a political mistake to incur that opposition. On

balance, however, the Cabinet believed that the proposed charges

represented a sensible and practical way of approaching the public

expenditure problems posed by the health service, and that they should be

implemented.    It was self-evident that the presentation of the charges

would be eased if it were possible to point simultaneously to improvements

in the primary health care services; but that was a matter that would have

to be resolved in the normal way in the forthcoming public expenditure

discussions,  in the light of all the relevant competing bids. No

announcement of the proposed charges need be made until after the public

expenditure round had been completed.

The Cabinet -

1. Approved the dental charges proposed in C(87) 15).

2. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services

to pursue the question of possible improvements in

primary health care in the forthcoming round of public

expenditure discussions.
