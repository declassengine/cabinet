LEGISLATION

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Queen&apos;s Speech on the

opening of the present Session had promised legislation &quot;to promote

further competition in order to secure greater efficiency in the

provision of local authorities&apos;  services&quot;.    It had been the intention to

include the very complex provisions that would be needed on this matter

in a Local Government Bill that would also have contained provisions to

prevent local authorities from including requirements of a

non-commercial nature in their contracts.    The Bill would also have

embodied the Government&apos;s original proposals on political advertising by

local authorities, which had been modified against the Government&apos;s

wishes in the previous Session by the House of Lords, where the subject

was very highly controversial.    Policy approval had also been given for

various other measures that might be included in the Bill, and two of

these were of paramount importance in controlling local government

expenditure.    The first,  to deal with the creative accounting device of

deferred purchase schemes, had been announced by the Secretary of State

for the Environment on 22 July 1986, and would take effect from that

date.    The second, which had been announced the previous week after

discussion in Cabinet and would similarly take effect from the date of

announcement, would regulate the use of a device pioneered by Sheffield

Council for subventions by local authorities towards rented housing

developments in the private sector.

In the event,  the preparation of this legislation had been massively

disrupted by the need to prepare and take through Parliament the Local

Government Finance Bill, which was required to repair a fundamental flaw

in the operation of the Rate Support Grant machinery.    That Bill had

proved to be far longer and more complex than had been envisaged, and it

had inevitably been the first preoccupation not only of Parliamentary

Counsel but also of the lawyers and administrators concerned in the

Department of the Environment.    It had now become clear that there was

no realistic possibility of the full Local Government Bill being

prepared until well into March.    The provisions on competition in local

government contracts were especially badly delayed.    If the Bill were

introduced on that very late timetable,  it would be apparent from the

start that it had little hope of reaching the Statute Book in the

present Session, and proceeding with it would become a charade that

would alienate the Government&apos;s supporters.    In these very difficult

circumstances,  the only practical option was for the Government to cut

their losses and introduce without delay a short Bill containing the two

provisions necessary to control local authorities&apos; creative accounting

devices,  together with whatever minor provisions the Secretary of State

for the Environment judged appropriate.    The provisions on local

authority contracts and on political advertising, however, would need to

be dropped for the present Session, and thought would need to be given

to the most effective way in which the Government&apos;s commitment to

competition in local government contracts might be restated.    If the


Cabinet agreed with his view, which was shared by the other business

managers, that there was no practical alternative to proceeding in this

way, then the shortened Bill should be taken to Legislation Committee

and introduced in the House of Commons in the following week, with the

Secretary of State for the Environment making a statement on the day of

introduction.    While this would be a difficult occasion, the

announcement would become yet harder to handle if it were delayed, and

the impact of the Local Government Finance Bill faded in Parliament&apos;s

memory.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he fully agreed

with the Lord President of the Council&apos;s analysis of the situation. He

proposed that in addition to the two measures to control creative

accounting devices (which would be retrospective to the dates of their

announcement and should not,  therefore, be postponed to another Session)

the shortened Bill should include a technical provision to cure a point

of vires on the power to wind up pools of education expenditure. The

only other measure that he proposed to include would be various changes

to the law on land registers, as a stimulus to the sale of unused land.

The inclusion of other, more minor, points would do no more than

irritate the Government&apos;s supporters, as it was no longer feasible to

proceed with the major provisions on local government contracts and

political advertising.    He would give careful thought to the way he

presented this decision as having been forced on the Government by the

emergence of the Local Government Finance Bill, and would stress the

vital importance of enacting the measures to control creative

accounting.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion,  said that the Cabinet

agreed that,  in the circumstances,  there was no realistic alternative

but to proceed as the Lord President of the Council and the Secretary of

State for the Environment proposed.    The Bill, reduced to the items

described by the Secretary of State for the Environment,  should be

brought forward as soon as possible.    The Secretary of State for the

Environment should make an oral statement in the House of Commons on the

day of the Bill&apos;s introduction and he should discuss the precise timing

of this, and other handling arrangements, with the Lord Privy Seal and

the Chief Whip.

The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of State for the

Environment to bring forward a Local Government

Bill, reduced to the items he had described,

for introduction in the House of Commons as

soon as possible, and to discuss timing and

handling arrangements with the Lord Privy Seal

and the Chief Whip.
