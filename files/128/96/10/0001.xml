the House of Commons and the House of lords in the following

week.



The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Budget Statement would be

taken in the Commons the following Tuesday.   In a brief

^^Siscussian, it was noted that the start of the Chancellor&apos;s



/Budget Statement the previous year had been disrupted by the

^Jkjattish National Party (SNP), one of whose Members had moved a

&apos;i.on writ.   The SNP had said that they had no intention

iting the ploy this year, but the business managers would

less be in touch with the Speaker of the House of

with a view to avoiding similar disruption on 20 March.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that perceptions

had changed since the policy on income support safeguards for

those in residential hemes had been decided.   Ihe provision of a

guaranteed support level had been intended as a safeguard, tut

that level was new seen as inadequate and the safeguard as a

-^threat.   There was concern among Government supporters about the

/aq^quacy of the guaranteed income support levels, the real value

^cjf^fchich had fallen, and the possibility of eviction of



&apos;s if these levels were insufficient to meet nursing heme

particular.   He was urgently examining possible ways of

this concern, although there were no simple answers.

For ^cample, it had been suggested that the guaranteed level of

support should be varied on a regional basis, tut the evidence

to back up such an approach appeared insufficiently strong.

residents who did not qualify for income support.   While the

case for some concession on the issue was accepted, this should

not add any more than was unavoidable to the cost of benefit for

residential care.   Any concession must be as targeted as

possible and must also avoid giving an incentive to elderly

people to transfer into nursing hemes by setting a forward

qualifying date.   The Secretary of State for Social Security

should have these points in mind in his discussions with the

/??ohief Secretary to the Treasury and other colleagues on the

Xffcbrther handling of the matter.   The prospect of amendments to

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

statistics to be published that day would shew a fall in

,unemployment in the previous month of only 2,000 on a seasonally

L 1 justed basis, to 1,610,000, the lewest level since October

  .   While it would be wrong to draw any firm conclusions on

basis of only one month&apos;s figures, the downward trend in

^loyment was slewing and might be levelling out. The

Btol&amp;vment rate of 5.6 per cent was one of the very lowest in

Community.   Ihe number of industrial stoppages in

January had been the lowest January figure for 55 years. The

Average Earnings Index for January, also published that day,

shewed that the annual underlying increase in average earnings

over the whoi^, economy had remained at 9.25 per cent for the

fourth consecutive month.   The underlying increase had been held

down ty the^rf^t of lower economic activity on earnings from

overtime andV^orMses.   It was likely to rise in the following

north as the r^1i/ta&gt;of further inflationary wage settlements

that the British Government had decided to recall its Ambassador

training of Iraqi military officers on courses in the united

Kingdom and to seek the support of the European Community Member

had decided not to break off diplomatic relations,

there were two other British citizens, Mrs Daphne Parish,

Mr Ian Richter, a businessman of high reputation, who were

  detained in Iraq.   It would be much more difficult to make

r ve representations on their behalf if diplomatic

cms had been broken.   Ministers had also concluded that

the &quot;imposition of trade and credit sanctions would not be

appropriate since such a move would be ineffective in

influencing the attitude of the Iraqi Government and would

inflict disproportionate damage on British industry.

In a brief discussion, it^wsis/pointed cut that although Mr

Bazoft had not behaved as ^i^^erienced journalist, there was

no justification for the sevdr^y^of the sentence. This

illustrated the brutal and ruwdes^ nature of the Iraqi regime,

!here was strong evidence that &lt;^J nuary 1988 an Iraqi

businessman visiting the United ,iCiina^m had been poisoned by

agents of the Iraqi Government.   In^Ke same month an Iraqi

citizen travelling frcm the United ^Mngdcm to Khartoum appeared

to have been assassinated by agents of the Iraqi Government.

The scope of the measures to be taken by the British Government



had been carefully weighed to take into a

the many British businessmen and British

present living in Iraq.   Although there



allegations that the efforts made by the Brit

Government had no alternative but to mobilise

    FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEACTH SECRETARY said that the first

meeting of officials of the two Germanies and the Four Powers

(the 2+4) had taken place on 14 March.   There had been useful

agreement on the procedural arrangements, and the key issues for

further discussion had been identified.   The process would now

gather speed.   A meeting at Ministerial level was likely to take

place in April.   By then his cwn visit to Mosocw would have

taken place, so that he would have had an  opportunity to probe

the position of the Soviet Government.   The recent flurry of

/^activity over the issue of Poland&apos;s borders with Germany had new

y^Sttled down.   It had been agreed that representatives of the

Government would be invited to an early meeting of the

order to discuss the border question.   Hence, the Polish

with the support of the British and French

had achieved their basic aims over substance and

procasjaure.   The German Government had been obliged to accept

that there would have to be a Treaty with Poland confirming the

Oder-Neisse line.   He had had useful discussions in Bonn on 12

on the whole been put on one side.   It had been accepted that it

was the quality of the water frcm the big rivers of mainland

Europe which had a decisive impact upon the North Sea.   The end

vOf the Conference had been overshadowed by a dispute on the
