1.    Ihe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons and the House of lords in the following

week.



LORD FKCVY SEAL said that the Government had been defeated

ier in the week on two amendments to the community care

ions of the National Health Service and Community Care

&apos;.ch had attracted very substantial cross-bench support.



f discussion it was noted that the first of these

its, deal ing with ring fencing of government grants to

local &quot;authorities in respect of their ccnmunity care functions,

might be difficult to overturn in the Ccnmons; while the second,

  of implementation of ccnmunity care reforms

of funding, was effectively a wrecking

!tary of State for Health would be



how best to handle these defeats at

of the Lords Amendments.   Amendments on

an issue on which the Government had

2.    THE HCME SECRETARY said that he had called in the football

authorities on 8 May to account in particular for their failure

to accept repeated police requests to re??sche3iu.e the

Bournemouth versus Leeds united fixture, wMchUral occasioned

football hooliganism over the May Bank HoiiaaV/^^k-end. The



Chief Constable of Dorset had advised the

consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers and

had said that they would in future accept the advice of the

police on such occasions.   In his view this was as satisfactory

an agreement as could have been expected, though it wculd be

essential to hold the football authorities to their undertaking,

and the Home Office would challenge any cases where they did not

seem prepared to take police advice.   Under present law the

police could inpose conditions on such events, but did not have

power to ban them.   Ihe Public Order Act 1986 provided power for

Heme Secretary to ban processions, if requested by the Chief

&apos;tie, but this did not apply to assemblies such as football

A general power of veto of assemblies wculd be

y to be acceptable to Parliament.

Soviet rights to garrison troops in the present

meeting on 7 May that he was initially attracted by this

proposal but the Federal German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, had

since dismissed the idea.   The disadvantages of such a proposal

would be that Soviet rights in Germany would be prolonged and

there would be scope for linking Soviet troop withdrawals with

reductions in Allied forces in Germany.   The next meeting of the

2+4 Ministers would take place in East Berlin in June, and would

be preceded by a meeting of the four Western Foreign Ministers,

1 axbably in the margins of the North Atlantic Council meeting at

iberry on 6 June, at which it would be important to concert

^Western approach,   !here was general agreement that Soviet

should not be forced to leave the GER in humiliating

would be required to allow them to remain.   The key

that Soviet troops would be remaining not under

Four Power rights and responsibilities, but under an

likely.    The attitude of the hostages&apos; families, Parliament and

the press was still reasonably favourable.    The Minister of

State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Waldegrave, had seen

the father of Mr John McCarthy on 8 May.   It was understandable

that the relatives should want to see faster progress. The

British Government would continue to do all it could to secure

the release of the hostages but would maintain its policy of not

paying ranscms or making major concessions.   Ihe claims

between the united States and Iran, which was

&gt;rted to be close to signature, was the result of

&apos;:iations which had been continuing for a long time.    It did

year to be connected directly with the hostage question,

possible that the Irish hostage, Mr Brian Keenan, might

&apos; in order to put further pressure on the British and

Governments.



In a bfrief discussion, it was noted that reported progress in

the claims negotiations between the United States and Iran, like

the settlement which the united Kingdom had concluded with Iran

on ccrpensatei^nXfor the destruction of their Embassies, might be

helpful to ttje Jjnited States Government in improving relations

with the Ir^^rf^cSvernment.   However, the Rushdie affair would

remain a sericx^&lt;x&gt;e acle in the United Kingdom&apos;s relations with

Iran.   Although |ra&amp;Ljan spokesmen had put forward different

interpretations of/jm b: policy, their basic aim was to extract

concessions frcm u^^^ish Government which it could not

properly mate.



THE PRIME MINISTER said tha

May with Mrs Prunskiene, the

Prunskiene was a remarkable

Prime Minister that she fully

Gorbachev.   The Lithuanians were

the importance of not

to work for a

interests of the Soviet



out that neither

President Gorbachev nor any of the major Powers had denied the

right of Lithuania to independence.   The problem was how

independence was to be achieved.   Presidenp(?GcH^chev was saying

that the Lithuanians must negotiate about

Lithuanians were saying that they wculd only

independent country.   Neither side was willing

give way to the other.   Seme way had to be f

blockage.   It would be better to put the positi

on one side for the moment and, accepting that ea

different view, concentrate an the practicalities

not by force.   Until talks between the Soviet Government and the

Lithuanians had begun, the position of Western governments would

remain difficult.   Lithuania had been a separate state long

before Estonia and Latvia.   It was important not to give the

impression that Western governments were not standing up for the

rights of a small nation, especially since the British

Government had never recognised Lithuania&apos;s annexation by the

Soviet Union.   Mrs Prunskiene had already had discussions with

&gt;the American President, Mr George Bush, and would subsequently

 !Id talks with President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl. It

essential for the four Western governments to keep closely

? on this question.    The Lithuanians had shewn



ty by announcing their readiness to suspend

itation of the laws and the decisions of the Lithuanian

to which the Soviet Union had objected, but they had

that they would never rescind the declaration of

nee itself.   Mrs Prunskiene had said that Lithuania was

perfectly prepared to take a conciliatory line and to appear to

THE POREIQi AND OCmDNWEALIH SECRETS^ said that reports on the

prospects for the Romanian elections, due to take place on 20

May, were not reassuring.   It sp ?mpri very probable that the

Interim President, Mr Ian Iliescu, and the NSilcnal Salvation

Front (SNF) would emerge as victors with a(large_rajority. They

might indeed be the most popular party.    Nevertheless, there

was disturbing evidence of pressure being exer^ed/0O the

Opposition.   There would be a large number

observers at the Romanian elections, including firi 3

of Parliament, Members of the European Parliament

local election returning officers.   The most likely c

a resounding victory for the SNF clouded by reports

would place a question marie over the European Community&apos;s

attitude towards Romania, notably on the question of an

Association Agreement.   Similar problems were being encountered

in Bulgaria although they had been given less publicity. A

group of international observers, on similar lines to the group

which would observe the Romanian elections, would also be

present at these elections,   it was helpful that the Prime

Minister would be seeing members of the Bulgarian Opposition.

In view of the doubts over the conduct of the Romanian and

garian elections, he hoped that his colleagues would be

&quot;?.icularly restrained in any public comments on these

ies in the weeks ahead.



THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation

over Kashmir remained tense.   The Indian and Pakistan Foreign

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, after

negotiations, agreement had been reached among

(G7) and Group of 10 (G10) and thai at the Interim

Meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to

general level of quotas by 50 per cent.   Pressures fo:

in 1993, although in practice it would take place later.   As a

condition of the increase in quotas the IMF had, for the first

time, been given a power of suspension to deed with countries in

arrears; it presently had the power of expulsion, which was a

weapon that had never been used. This represented the most

effective means yet of dealing with the problem of arrears.

Agreement had also been reached on the IMF rankings. The

Federal Republic of Germany and Japan would jointly occupy

)second place; and the United Kingdcm had reached an



modatian with France under which the United Kingdom wculd

France a share of quota so that the two countries jointly

&apos; fourth place. If at a later stage the French moved ahead

Id lend quota to the United Kingdcm and so maintain the
