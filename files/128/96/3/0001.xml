MENTARY      1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the following

week.



THE LORD PRESIDEOT OF THE COUNCIL said that, in the absence of

Private Notice Questions or Ministerial statements, there was an

increasing tendency for members to seek to take advantage of the

television transmission period after Prime Minister&apos;s Questions

the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoons by disrupting the

iness with bogus points of order.   This did no credit to the

ic image of the House and could become a habit which spread

er days.   Ihe business managers would be talcing this into

it in the future planning of Government business. For

le, it was for consideration whether the Minister for

^culture, Fisheries and Food should make a statement on the

new&apos;Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances on the following

Tuesday afternoon.

misbehaviour at football matches, the extensr

In discussion with the Prime Minister and interes

he had concluded that the Government shculd accept

Taylor&apos;s findings and move swiftly to implement a pa

measures based on his recommendations.   The enabling

Part I of the 1989 Act should, however, remain on the

Book in case it became desirable to proceed with a



je by local

such as the

(confidential)



scheme at a later date.



In discussion the following points were made:



a.    Ihe findings and conclusions in the report were open to

question.    For example, the thesis that poor behaviour was the

result of poor facilities at grounds was not consistent with the

fact that behaviour at matches had been perfectly satisfactory

en facilities at grounds had been much less developed than

y were new.



A number of the recommendations in the report were of



value.   For example, the proposed new criminal offences

add little of substance to the existing law and would be

diSJicult for the police to enforce.   Ihe recommendations

differed in seme respects from those of Mr Justice Popplewell

following the Bradford fire disaster, in part no doubt because

of the di  3^ent nature of the events involved. Further

considermri  ()might well suggest that a different view would be

accepted H9M^3Nlonger term and it was noteworthy that the

report ccmnH^tee/favourably cn the membership arrangements at

Luton Footbc&amp;^^Su. Nevertheless the recommendations would be

initially attra^jp^^to the public.



c.    Ihe shot

of the proposed fc

Government should

be practicable to pi

Lord Justice Taylor&apos;s

that, before a national&quot;

would be further cppoi

ground.   Nevertheless, it wculd not

id with the scheme in the face of

the statement which the Heme Secretary

however, constrained by the need to have

THE HUME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said

clear that Lord Justice Taylor&apos;s report was flawed in

of respects.   There could, however, be no question of  

with the National Membership Scheme in the face of Lord

Taylor&apos;s findings.   Nevertheless, these findings related



!confidential!




[confidential)



a particular form of the scheme: Part I of the Football

Spectators Act 1989 was an enabling provision and it should

remain on the Statute Book for later vise if necessary. To

proceed in this way would be consistent with the undertakings

given during the passage of the 1989 Act.   The remainder of Lord

Justice Taylor&apos;s findings endorsed the Government&apos;s argument

that the primary responsibility for the present situation lay

? with the football clubs, and his recaratendations built on

/^J^acticn already put in hand or urged by the Government.   While it

&lt;^X*vbuld not be right to anticipate the Heme Secretary&apos;s statement

yersity of the problems facing the Soviet President, Mr

il Gorbachev.   It was generally agreed that seme use of

had been unavoidable to prevent ethnic bloodshed.



the result was likely to be a long term requirement for

e Soviet military presence in the area.   Ihe ethnic

^ lict was likely to remain a substantial problem for

President Gorbachev, who was now preparing for the Plenum of the

Central Ccranittee of the Communist Party which was due to meet

on 5 arri^pSsbruary.     Each meeting had now beccme a hurdle for

PresiderKfGc^Dachev.   His critics were multiplying as the

Social Democrats were monolithic.   Meanwhile, pressure for

reunification was being stepped up in West Germany through the

Republikaner Party.    In East Germany, the demonstrations which

took place in Leipzig every Monday were increasingly devoted to

calls for reunification, rather than for democracy as in the

past.   Western political parties ought to respond positively to

approaches by democratic parties in Eastern Europe asking for

help and assistance in operating in a free society. Ihe

nservative Party was contributing to this, in conjunction with

\e West German Christian Democratic Union and the European

ratic Union in Vienna.   The top priority was to help the
