the House of Carrions and the House of Lords in the following

IHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he would be making

a statement to the House of Gannons later that day on



legations surrounding Mr Colin Wallace.   ?Ihe Minister for the

Forces had given a full written answer on the facts of the

on the previous Tuesday.   Briefly these were that in 1975

allace had been dismissed from his post as a Senior



it ion Officer attached to the Armed Forces in Northern

for passing a classified document to a journalist

_!out authority.   During his appeal to the Civil Service

Appeal Board against his dismissal, Mr Wallace had argued that

he had been_authorised to release sensitive information to



m



that



part of his duties, which had included an

Calcutt QC to investigate the pZ&amp;ars^nd to advise him on

whether an injustice had been ddra^o Mr Wallace as a result of

the manner in which his case had V&amp;en presented to the Civil

Service Appeal Board.   He had been^advised that it would not be

possible to publish Mr Calcutt&apos;s report because it involved

investigation of classified material, butihat Mr Calcutt should

be enabled to show the report to Mr WaluXreT^He would wish to

the politicians concerned liable to blackmail by the Security

had been the result of a plot to discredit him by the Security

Service.   These matters had already been the subject of several

separate investigations and none of the new information which

had cane to light offered any support for the allegations which

had been made.   Nor did it call into question previous

statements by the Prime Minister and other Ministers on these

iters.   The allegations were bound to be pressed, and the fact

t the papers of a previous administration and essential

ity matters were involved made it difficult to answer them



y as he would wish.   Nevertheless he could assure

igues, as the House had already been assured, that it had

since the mid-197Os been the policy to disseminate



ormation in Northern Ireland in ways designed to denigrate

individuals and/or organisations or for propaganda purposes.

The Government could take credit for having correcrted previous

inaccuratepifratements and for having established Mr Calcutt? s

THE ERIME MINISTER, summing

information which had emerged

The events in question and the papers

those of a previous administration; the

Minister for the Armed Forces had acco:

Lord Mason and Mr Merlyn Rees, as well as

and Whitelaw.   The convention that Ministers

access to the papers of a previous administrati&apos;

justified but created difficulties in responding

of this sort.   It raised the question whether it

administration to the papers about which they could

access.   The Secretary of the Cabinet should consider and advise

further on this point.   The Government could rightly take credit

for the fact that it had been far more open than its

predecessors in dealing with security matters, and had brought

forward major legislation on official secrets and the Security

Service.   In considering the various allegations new being made

so irresponsibly in Parliament and the media, colleagues would

have in mind the nature of the problems in Northern Ireland and

that there were those whose real purpose was to denigrate the

^&apos;CSactivities of the security services and damage their vital role.

when they had approved the rules of coverage.   There was clearly

a danger that the decision to permit group shots in particular

could enable directors to present the reactions of Members in an

artificial way, which might discredit the public image of the

House.   On the other hand, it was in the nature of an experiment

that situations might arise which would require modifications to

be made.   The rules of coverage allowed the Select Committee to

modify the guidelines if they considered it appropriate. The

only way of establishing whether certain shots were acceptable

to see them in operation.



HUME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that given

ecision to proceed with the experiment, the arrangements

evising its proceedings agreed by the House had generally

well.   There would inevitably be more pressure from

broadcasters for further relaxation of the rules of coverage.

Once concessions were made it wculd be very difficult to

reinstate the original safeguards at the end of the experimental

period. /2J53N30int made in discussion should be borne in mind

3.         FOREIGN AND CCMMONWEAITH SECRETARY said that he had

visited Washington on 29 and 30 January, where he had had talks

with the President, Mr George Bush, the Vice-President, Mr Dan

Quayle, the Secretary of State, Mr James Baker, and General

Brent Sccwcroft, Assistant to the President for National

Security Affairs.   It had been useful that he and the Secretary

of State for Defence had been in Washington at the same time.

Ihe principal issue for discussion had been the announcement,

,about which the British Government had been informed in advance,

President Bush&apos;s State of the Union message on 30 January



ing mutual reductions in American and Soviet forces

tioned in Europe to 195,000 troops in the central zone and

in Europe as a whole.   When the President&apos;s special

ntatives had discussed this matter with the Prime

in London on 29 January, the Prime Minister had said

the figures for United States force levels should

constitute a floor level and should not be followed by further

reductions.   The Prime Minister had also urged that the

proposalsj E2&amp;ld be fully integrated into the negotiations on

conventicFfal (prce reductions in Europe (CFE) and that in future

the leveP^S/pSited States forces should not be linked directly

to the leveJ(o $gyiet forces.   It was important that the United



significant presence in Europe

jit to Washington he had detected strong

to take advantage of the so-called

warmly welcomed. I^^n

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had also visited

Washington from 29 to 31 January.   He had been encouraged by the

warm reception which he had received.   He had been impressed by

the professionalism of the Embassy in Washington, and its access

to key political figures and officials in the Administration.

Like the Foreign and Ccranonwealth Secretary, he had been struck

by the atmosphere of secrecy.    He had put forward the same

arguments as the Frime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary cn the need to avoid further reductions in united

tes force levels in Europe after the present round. During

talks with members of Congress he had noted that, while many



wished to reduce military spending, they were

ctant to see units closed in their own constituencies. This



f thinking might create pressure for further closures of

ign bases, including in Europe.



In a brief discussion of the two visits, it was noted that the



British

presence cn mainland Europe

under the Brussels Treaty of

troop withdrawals frcm Warsaw

States force levels should be

levels.    Moreover, United States

Europe by invitation under freely negotiated agreements, while

the Soviet troops were basically there bvfQrce.   It was

essential to present a sound case to pul^rCybinion for the

maintenance of adequate force levels in      J3G  of arguments

that the threat had diminished.

THE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEAIHH SECRETARY said that events in the

German Democratic Republic were moving quickly.   The date for

free elections had new been brought forward.   In return the

opposition parties had moved into a Grand Coed it ion with Prime

Minister Modrcw&apos;s government.   Ihe Social Democratic Party was

currently in the strongest position.   Meanwhile in Moscow,

President Gorbachev had changed his position from outright

opposition to German reunification to stating that no one was

placing the principle of German reunification in doubt. Within

jx^jCSWest Germany the main political parties were preparing for the

^^Vlections in December.    Ihey were concerned not to be

^^^latflanked on the issue of German reunification, especially by

&lt; &gt;  ^ extreme right wing Republikaner party.   Within the Alliance,

ted Kingdom was well placed to set the broad policy

rk for the months ahead.   Ihe United Kingdom had

rted the principle of self-determination for Germany for

many years.   The key issue new was to ensure that any changes

took place in a context of stability and peace.    The principal

PAY REVIEW

BODY REPORTS



Took note.



5.    The Cabinet considered a note by the

Cabinet (C(90)l) about the Pay Review Body



of the

1&gt;r 1990.



IHE PRIME MINISTER said that the paper was the

discussion among the Ministers most directly co:

Review Body reports and the report of the Interim

Committee (IAC) cn teachers&apos; pay.   Ihe Review Bodies&apos;

recommended increases which in current circumstances

unacceptably    .   The conclusion reached was that the

implementation of the recaimendations should be staged, so that

the increase in the pay bill in 1990-91 could be reduced while

still allowing for the new recanmended rates to be generally in

payment by the end of that year.   This wculd have the

disadvantage that future increases would start fran a higher

base, but permanent abatement would have created bigger

problems.   The general approach proposed, the Top Salaries

Review Body (TSRB) apart, was that an increase of 7 per cent

iculd be paid frcm 1 April 1990, with the remaining increases,

luding most additional payments, caning into effect on 1

1991.   Seme additional payments would hewever take

from 1 April 1990, including the increases in the pay of

t nurses and the changes to London pay for nurses,

essions allied to medicine, and teachers.   ,Ihe average



in the pay bill for all the Review Body groups and the

teachers as a whole in 1990-91 would be just belcw 8 per cent.

As to financing, the recommendations affecting National Health

staff could not be met from within existing NHS

contribution to meeting the extra costs would be

In discussion the following main pmnts were made:



a.    Ihe Review Body car Doctors&apos; and

Recommendations had put forward a

made last year, and rejected then,

the top of the consultants&apos; scale and

highest awards for consultants. Those&apos;

would have increased by about 15 per

highest paid consultants in the NHS. It

reject them again.   The Government&apos;s reasa

them last year was that the Review Body&apos;s obj

improving the long-term career structure for

doctors could be best achieved by the creation

additional 100 consultants&apos; posts which had alrea

agreed.   This argument was still valid.   Moreover, it was

inportant to discourage any presumption that Review Body

recommendations could not be rejected.



b.    There was bound to be a hostile reaction to the

Government&apos;s decisions fran all the NHS groups. In

particular, the General Practitioners would catplain that

they were not being remunerated adequately for the extra

work the new contract would impose on them, even though the

Review Body had decided substantially against them in the

y     argument on that point.   The Government&apos;s reply must

?     emphasise that nearly all the Review Body recommendations

 ^  would be in effect by the end of 1990-91.   The staging

^y^decision would also help to expose the unreasonable nature

Y^?of the ambulancemen&apos;s pay claim, especially bearing in mind

     that it related to 1989-90, when the nurses&apos; increase had

been 6.8 per cent.
