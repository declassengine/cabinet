IDRD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Ministerial and

educed in the House of Commons after the Whitsun Recess,

deal inter alia with the long-standing problem that, an

office, lords Ministers lost their eligibility for the

it subsistence allowance which all backbench peers were

to claim.   lords Ministers whose first heme was outside

&quot;would receive a night subsistence allowance of  14,088

per annum which would be taxable.   Their current London

supplement of  1,222 would no longer be payable.    They would

have a net gain after tax of around  7,700 per annum.

Lords amendments carrying unacceptable public expenditure

2^^^^E HCME SECRETARY said that in the early hours of Tuesday

22 iW^tfie police had stopped a car driving recklessly at high

speed^in lordship Lane, Tottenham. They had discovered in the

car t&amp;ro Kalashnikov rifles with loaded magazines. The driver of

the car, Mr Kevin O&apos;Donnell was from Northern Ireland, but was

presently a student at the Harper Adams College of Agriculture

in Shropshir^TA^He had been charged with firearms offences and

said that the trade figures for

In discussion it was noted that high inflationary expectations

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that

speculation in the media and by individual scientists about the

cattle disease Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) continued.

He was quite clear that the only course open to the Government

was to continue to emphasise that their policy was based an

sound scientific advice.   The task of conveying to the public

the realities of the snail risk perceived by scientists was

his visit Mr Baker had consulted



short notice on a package of new idea  which he had put to the

Soviet Government during his discussions in Moscow. These

ideas were intended to break the current impasse an a number of



outstanding CFE issues, particularly

no sign of any corresponding movement from(

the prospects of achieving an early CFE

said during the informal meeting of European Community Foreign

Ministers at Parknasilla in the Irish Republic an 19-20 May that

a definite decision would not be taken on the timing of the

elections until September.   Ihe uncertainty aver the timing of

unification was likely to create difficulties in the 2+4 talks

which would continue during the summer.   The present lack of

.ty on all these questions reflected the uncertainties



Soviet policy and the situation in the Soviet Union.

First Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Yuri Maslyukov, had



at a press conference an 23 May that there would be a

an Prime Minister Ryzhkov&apos;s plan to transform the

y planned economy to market principles.   This appeared

.gh risk policy,   !here was considerable evidence of



popular dissatisfaction with the Soviet Government&apos;s

policy. President Gorbachev&apos;s own popularity was at a

low level, largely as a result of discontent about the economy.

Prime Minister^Ryzhkov&apos;s plan was extremely complicated,

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that

frcm his visit to the Soviet Union from 14-17

those of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary

there was extremely worrying.    He had had useful

inciting private conversations, with Marshal Dmitri

Soviet Minister of Defence, who had expressed deep

for Prime Minister Ryzhkov and his economic plans,

hand, General Mikhail Moiseyev, the Chief of the Soviet

Staff, had taken a harder line.    The Defence Secretary

especial importance bearing in mind her excellent personal

relationship with President Gorbachev.   He had been struck

during his own visit by the powerful memories which the wartime

Alliance with the United Kingdom evoked among the Soviet people.

Many Russians had told him that they wculd never forget the

courage of the British sailors in the conveys to Murmansk and

Archangel.   The application lists for medals for taking part in

)these conveys had now been reopened.   By contrast, the Soviet

)le still felt a deep hatred towards Germany, coupled with

of the United States and distrust of France.   In these



it was natural for the Soviet leadership to look

British Government to understand their problems. His

interlocutors had expressed appreciation for the



way in which the British Government had handled the

of Lithuania.   He had met the Lithuanian Prime

, Mrs Pruneskiene, when she had visited a number of

Western Embassies at the time when he was in Moscow.   He agreed

with the Foreiqn and Commonwealth Secretary that little progress

timescale.   He had also noted the way in

interlocutors were now focussing their a

closely an the debates in the Supreme Savi

towards a more democratic system.   A Soviet

the Defence Secretary&apos;s attention to the deba

Soviet the previous day in which a speaker had

loudly applauded.   There was already a non-Ccmmunist

council in Leningrad.   He had asked Marshal Yazav

assurances there were that members of the Armed Fa

redundant as a result of arms reductions could find

in the Soviet economy.   Marshal Yazov told him that th&lt;

be no real problem.   Nevertheless, the Defence Secretary had

found this show of confidence unconvincing.   In general, he had

the agression that there was deep cynicism in the Armed Forces

about present trends in the Soviet Union but no disposition at

this stage to take any action.



In discussion, it was pointed out that if Mrs Pruneskiene had

)put forward the proposals for suspension of the laws an



which she had discussed with the Prime Minister,

British Government and a number of other Western



ought to express their support.   The Foreign and

Lth Secretary would ensure that the necessary action

,   It was noted that there was growing apprehension in

the ;international business community about the failure of seme

Sc^ie^enterprises to meet their payment obligations.   This was

the result of the changes in the Soviet system from a centrally

managed economy, in which the State took overall responsibility

for payment, to a pseudo-private system where no one appeared to

have ultiira^rjesponsibility for payment.   This problem also

highlighted(^the^present shortage of foreign exchange in the

Soviet Union. / fiate were indications that the Soviet Government

planned to ina^e^^exports of gas in order to maximise foreign

exchange earningg^/rampanies were increasingly being asked to

THE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEAIHH SECRETARY said that the situation

subsequent deaths in clashes between Pale

Israeli Defence Forces in Gaza and inside

,FOREIGN AND CCMM3NWEAITH SECRETARY said that the situation

  found apart frcm military rule, which had proved

ineffective.   These problems were likely to persist unless a new

4.     THE FOREIGN AND CCMfOWE2&amp;H*^CREIARY said that, at an

of the Community had discussed xx^tes&amp;bifc towards political union

an a less philosophical level thanNK^h^rto, with the emphasis

upon practical steps that might beT^ken.    It was clear that

no-one envisaged early movement to political union in the true

sense of that term.   The French Minister, Monsieur Dumas, had

been noticeably cooler on the issue.   It seemed that increased

concern in France about immigrants was one/^a&amp;pn far his

emphasis on nationalism.    This did not me&amp;1  ujat the caning

negotiations on institutional changes in the CpSmriity would be

with those of other Member States, many of whcm&lt;T^ottl2j1ued to

favour, for example, increased powers for the

Parliament.   But there was reason to hope that di

now take a more pragmatic form.   The Foreign Mini

reviewed the situation in South Africa, and had g&lt;

favoured the idea of progressive encouragement for

African Government&apos;s steps towards reform.   It was unci!

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that it was now



possible to form a clearer picture of the

Action Programme.    The Commission would

Commission envisaged that those engaged in night

In a brief discussion it was pointed out that the Treaty of Rome

required unanimity for measures dealing with workers&apos; rights.

Attempts by the Commission to evade this requirement must be

~ngly resisted.   It would be important to mobilise objections

other Member States.    At a time when the countries of

Europe were re-discovering the benefits of free markets,

.d be absurd for the Community to impose greater
