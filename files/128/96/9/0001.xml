FARY      1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken

in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the

following week.

HOME SECRETARY said that the War Crimes Bill would be

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF     COUNCIL said that it would be

helpful if colleagues could consider in good time whether

proposed announcements were suitable for oral statements in

the House.   Such statements could be helpful in gaining

positive coverage for Ministerial decisions.   The business

managers should be consulted as long in advance as possible

about such announcements.

National

Health Service

and Community

Care Bill



THE !SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the House of

Commons would debate the remaining stages of the National

Health Serviee and Community Care Bill over two and a half

days in tlMf^fMlowing week.   The Opposition had tabled a

new clausd^e&amp;jered to link income support payable to

elderly perqmsJJLving in residential hemes to the actual



cost of

Government ba!

clause.   He and

would simply

charge excessive

  automatically be met



be a nonsense if

elderly people in receipt of income support had a better

standard of living as a result than those who were not

eligible.   The pressure on the issue in

fact that higher residential heme fees in

were being used as justification for natioi

the income support arrangements.   He was coi

the Social Security Secretary hew the support

might be geographically differentiated and in

the new clause, would be emphasising that the

levels of income support for those in residential

in nursing hemes were in any event to be increased

April to  150 and  200 respectively.



Continuing, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that

College of Health, a pressure group once associated with

the Alliance Parties, had earlier that day issued a &quot;Guide



2



!confidential!


(confidential]



to Hospital Waiting Lists, 1990&quot;.   Ihe publication was not

inconsistent with the Government&apos;s views in its analysis of

waiting lists, nor in its conclusion that a patient&apos;s

chances of early treatment depended on the nature of his

illness and where he lived.   Hcwever, while the College of

Health had argued that the proposed National Health

Service (NHS) reforms would exacerbate patients&apos;

difficulties, the publication in fact presented a

^^cmpelling case in their favour.



v&apos;lr^ brief discussion, it was noted that the Minister for

? s announcement during the previous week of 65 new

it posts in the NHS had been extremely well

in the areas concerned.

Decisions by the House of Lords on other measures had

undoubtedly added significantly to public i^KMDditure. The

Lord President of the Council should cons(,fi r^together

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the

report of the Companies Act Inspectors into House of Fraser

Holdings pic had been published the previous day. In a

short statement to the House, he had confirmed his decision

not to seek a disqualification order under Section 8 of the

Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 on the grounds

that to do so would not be in the public interest.



though he was being pressed to give further reasons for

decision, to do so would lay that decision open to

&quot;ijijti.cial review.   This would not be desirable.   The primary

of a disqualification order was to protect

lders.   The share capital of House of Fraser

HaQflu^s pic was entirely owned by its present directors:

th^e were therefore no other shareholders to be protected.

The grounds for an order would normally relate to the

running of a company, not the circumstances of a takeover.

So far as tha^takeover was concerned, all the previous



sharehold

none had

the takeovi

was no advan&apos;

on the issue.



In discussion,

any loss.   Although the circumstances of

1?ued to rankle with those involved, there

be gained frcm prolonged public debate



ing points were made:



a.    The Secre

try on the issue



b.    Disquiet had been expressed vy seme Government

supporters as well as by the Opposition about the issues

raised by the report, and there might well be pressure



early

the



for it to be debated, although there

opportunity for this. Critics were cla

report called into question the credibi

system of self-regulation under which the

operated.   The Select Committee on Trade

were, however, already looking into the De]

Trade and Industry&apos;s investigatory powers und!

Companies and Financial Services Acts and it

perfectly reasonable to argue that any debate sh&lt;

postponed until after they had reported.   If the

Opposition wished the report to be debated earlier,

was open to them to devote one of their Supply Days

this.

    ERIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the

discussion, said that the decision on a disqualification

order reached by the Secretary of State for Trade and

Industry had been quasi-judicial in character. If

questioned on the issue, Ministers should not go beyond

what the Secretary of State had said in the House, !here

would be no advantage in an early Parliamentary debate on

inspectors&apos; report, which would simply be used by those

tile to the City to try to undermine its credibility.

^Apressed for a debate, the business managers should

&apos;^jra.cate that it would be desirable to await the views of

&lt;^Mj2aelect Committee on Trade and Industry.     If the

CMOSJXion wished for an earlier debate, they could use one

ol&amp;jmeir Supply Days for the purpose.

had contributed  50,000 to the disaster fund set up by the

Mayor of Colwyn, and the Eurcpean Commission were expected

to make a generous donation.   In addition^SE^re had been a

good response to his appeal to firms to provl household

furnishings from surplus stocks to those irr^ime^iate need.

His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who tL&amp;dlplted the

In a brief discussion it was suggested that, given

first example of a Government contribution to a disast

fund in a case where no loss of life had occurred. The

    HUME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that

while it was right to have in mind the important precedent

set  by the Welsh Office contribution to the Mayor of

Colwyn&apos;s disaster fund, and the need to encourage others to

give assistance, the seriousness of the flood damage for

^???^Sr&gt;dividual home-owners should not be diminished.   It would

sy*^ unfortunate if the Government were seen to be ungenerous

V^^their response to this major disaster.   Ihe Secretary of

for Wales should consider with the Chief Secretary to

what further contribution should be made to

    &amp;   Community (EC) countries, but lower than in Japan

anafeie United States of America.   In April 1989,

engineering employers had offered in national negotiations

In a brief discussion it was noted that, although there was

3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that

progress towards German unification continued. Elections

in East Germany were due to take place on 18 March. The

British Government had succeeded in obtaining agreement

that the first meeting of Political Directors of the two

Germanies and the Four Powers (the 2+4) should take place

before the elections.   Ihe French Government had supported

this move, which had also been welcomed by the Soviet

^*tenion.   The discussions would cover the external aspects of

^^a^man unification,   !here would be a special European

V&apos;CiiShcil at the end of April to discuss the EC aspects of

Soviet Union remained highly uncertain, although there was

no clear evidence that an alternative personality with a

different set of policies was emerging who might challenge

Mr Gorbachev.   In Lithuania the first meeting of the new

Republican Supreme Soviet was due to take place on 10-11

March.   The Congress seemed certain to demand independence,

but was likely to agree to a negotiated settlement rather

.than attempt to take precipitate unilateral action. The

f^fejongress was expected to insist on a clear timetable

^^3^ding to genuine independence.



Drief discussion on Baltic gold, it was noted that the

jitish Government had used most of the  5.8 million

frcm the sale in 1967 of the Baltic gold reserves,

territories, to meet in part the claims of British

creditors who had lost assets in the former Baltic States

in 1940. /pieJlssue was likely to be revived by the three

    MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND POOD said that

he had recently discussed issues of mutual interest with

his Spanish opposite number.   Ihe sharp reduction in

allowable catches of fish, imposed for scientific reasons,

was already causing severe problems for communities heavily

dependent on fishing.   Ihey had both agreed that the

  ^/  integration of East Germany into the Community could only

//^feuce matters worse, since they would bring with them a



i fishing fleet but little in the way of extra fishing

It was highly unlikely that any Member State would

red to give up part of its share of the overall

quota and so East German fishermen would have to be

I to sharing the present German quota together with

itch from their existing fishing grounds.
