1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Commons and the House of Lords in the following week.



    LORD FRIVY SEAL said that the Education (Student Loans) Bill

was due to receive its second reading in the House of Lords on

 he following Tuesday.   On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, Earl

11 had tabled an amendment that the second reading debate

d be adjourned until the House had been given sufficient



tion to judge whether the proposals in the Bill were

le of being put into effect.   Every effort was being made

 / ri hre that this amendment was defeated and that there was a

goMspread of Conservative speakers in support of the Bill.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the

amendment was designed to wreck the Bill.   In fact there was

ample inftf^maJsaon already available to the House about hew it

was interred (gajput the proposals in the Bill into effect, and

more waulche^^mvided.   It appeared that the motion reflected

Drug Abuse



2.   IHE HCME SECRETARY said that he had

visit to look at the drug abuse problem in

the measures being taken to deed, with it. Ihe

found was very disturbing.   It differed frcm

Kingdom in a number of respects, not least the mul

involvement of organised crime, the greater use of

crime, and the virtual economic and social collapse

inner city areas.   Together these produced a lethal

lessons to be learned frcm the American experience with other

Ministerial colleagues.



FOREIGN AND OCMMONWEAIIH SECRETARY said that he had

in New York the previous day.   He had found that the

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that following

discussions at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration

Service, the National Health Service (NHS) Management Side and

the trade unions involved in the ambulance dispute had the

previous Monday agreed a basis for a settlement.   A formal offer

was to be made at the Ambulance Whitley Council that afternoon.

The agreement achieved all management&apos;s objectives.   It involved

^^.repackaging of their final 18 month offer, made in December,

y^t^h an additional 6 months increase of 7.9 per cent to

v^ jp2hs1ate it into a two-year deal.   In cash terms, this



ited a 13 per cent increase, 9.1 per cent in the first

3.9 per cent in the second.   This was well below the

cent aver 12 months that the unions had originally

clcb&amp;ned.   The package included an additional  500 in the second

year for staff with paramedical skills, thus further widening

the differential between skilled and unskilled staff. Most

Continuing, THE SECRETARY OF STATE MR HEALTH said that he was

hopeful that the Whitley Council Staff Side would agree to

recommend the package to their members.   Thetrade unions had

that seme local branches would almost certainly be disappointed

at the outcome.   Any such continued action would, however,

rapidly lose public support.   If, in the event, the offer was

not accepted, this would be the second collapse of a supposed

agreement between the Management Side and the trade unions. In

these circumstances, the offer would have to be immediately

withdrawn, and the Management Side would find it extremely

difficult to agree to open further negotiations.



had circulated a brief on the main points of the agreement.

the ban on new investment and on tourism promotion. This

entailed written replies to Parliamentary Questions by,

respectively, the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry

and Employment.   No formal action was required with Parliament

to change the policy of discouraging academic, scientific and

cultural contacts with South Africa,   !here would inevitably be

a price to pay in terms of political co-operation for the

unilateral action taken by the British Government.   Those Member

fates who wanted EC restrictions to be eased on Libya and

ia would try to exploit the united Kingdom&apos;s attitude



South Africa as a precedent.   Nevertheless, the United

had acquired a unique position of influence over events

h Africa by virtue of its past history and the policies

ij ttrtented by the Prime Minister and his cwn predecessors as

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.   It had been possible to



progress on Namibia for that reason.   The United

Unless Mr Mandela and the ANC abandoned statements in.support of

his release, companies would be reluctant in practice to place

new investment in South Africa.   Many opposition figures in

South Africa were opposed to sanctions, including Mrs Helen

Suzman, Chief Buthelezi and Chief Minister Mabuza.   The attitude

of the West German Government at the Dublin meeting had been

^?^Sisappointing.   The West German Chancellor, Herr Helmut Kohl,

unification, and his Foreign Minister, Herr Hans Dietrich

Reference: press speculation.   In February 1988 the then

Paper, that 10 seats out of the 60 in the Legislativ^0^K:il

should be filled by direct elections in 1991. AfterCtjra^Sraents

in Tiananmen Square in Peking, there had been strong pfes^ttpe

from the more articulate sections of the Hong Kong ccmmdSnafwi

favour of a faster pace of constitutional development.    ^?

(confidential]



consensus that the number of directly elected seats in 1991

should be 20.   After a series of intensive discussions with the

Chinese authorities through several channels, he had decided

that the number of directly elected seats in 1991 should be 18,

which the Chinese Government was now prepared to support. As

part of this agreement, there would be a steady increase in the

number of directly elected seats through 1997 and beyond. If

agreement with the Chinese Government had not been reached, the

P^^Xhinese would have denounced the arrangements and there would

^^^ve been a confrontation with China which would have severely

j^ermined confidence in Hong Kong.   There was a substantial

of opinion among businessmen, and seme members of the

itive Council, against a confrontation with China. The

on to this decision in the British press had been highly

vaurable but  he had received a useful measure of support in

one of relief that confrontation had been avoided. Ihe conduct
