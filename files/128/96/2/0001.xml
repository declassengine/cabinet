1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the following

week.



CHIEF WHIP said that five Orders implementing the

ernment&apos;s decisions on the local Government Revenue Support

were to be debated in the House of Commons later that day.

hopeful that a sustained exercise by Department of the



it (DOE) Ministers and the Government Whips would

in majorities in favour of each of the Orders, although

ize of these would depend cn the actions of the minority

parties.   It might be necessary to call cn Cabinet Ministers

during the day to help in the task of convincing wavering

backbenchfi^^wD support the Orders.   Press speculation about

the irtpermngwotes had been relatively restrained, in part

perhaps be bd!5^*f the united approach which DOE and Treasury

Ministers haAjdko on the issue.



FOR



THE ENVIRONMENT said that together

Ministerial team he had been working

order to maximise the Government&apos;s

had seen a large number of

Shooting

Incident in

West Belfast,

13 January



Ihe Cabinet discussed the Parliamentary handling of reports of

alleged homosexual activities by senior members of the Scottish

judiciary.    Ihe discussion is recorded separately.



2.     TOE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he

had made a statement to the House on 15 January, in response to

Private Notice Cuestion by the member for Kingston Upon Hull,

about a shooting incident in West Belfast the previous

ly.   Two members of the security forces had seen two

men, one of whom was armed with what appeared to be a

line gun, run from a car into a betting shop at the

ion of Falls Road and Whiterock Road.   Subsequently, both

iver of the car and the two men who had entered the

betting shop had been shot and killed.   In the House, and in

subsequent discussion of the affair, he had deliberately

on what had happened after the soldiers had

the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). There

its since his statement.   First, there was

of the incident and a man had now been

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said th^tP erdttitudes of

union members involved in industrial action xbjdjhilartce staff

shewed signs of polarising.   In London and th&amp;?Jra  counties,

where the membership tended to be more militantfiwjwa were

calls for stronger action to be taken.   In otherMasw^vSthe

position was mixed.   In the South West, for example,

minimal industrial action at present.   The only p;

settling the dispute was for the unions  representat

resume negotiations with the National Health Service

on the basis of the management&apos;s pay offer.  Although p:



!confidential]




{CONHPENTIAl)



contacts between the two sides continued, he was not optimistic

that this would happen quickly. He had however been encouraged

ty his meeting with Conservative backbench Members of Parliament

the previous Tuesday, which had demonstrated strong support for

the Government&apos;s stance, !here were also signs that the press

were beginning to understand that the Government&apos;s position was

fully justified.

The Economy



THE &quot;SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

and earnings figures for December would be published that day.

united Kingdom unemployment had fallen by 17,100 to 1,635,000.



This was

The number of people in work was

earnings for November had increased

the bunching of pre-Christmas sal(

concern as to whether consumer

down sufficiently.    The level of _



(PSER) for December had been only  400 million instead of the  2

billion which the market had been expecting.   This was probably

due to a variety of factors, including delatf^Na tax payment

because of high interest rates.   Even so, {tldgJsed likely that

the PSER figure for 1989-90 would turn out Dt^iw^pectatian.

The effective index of sterling was somewhat hfe3s l)$s lew point

This had implications for the future rate of

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the

value of exports in the third quarter of 1989 had shown a

remarkably sharp increase of 13 per cent in real terms compared

with the same quarter of 1988, and the volume of imports was

falling.



In a brief discussion it was noted that the net surplus on

invisibles had fallen to only about  100 million per month



with a normal previous figure of around  500 million,

was partly due to an inevitable outflow of dividends on the

level of inward investment and on sterling bends held

Our contribution to the European Community was a

factor, and there happened at the moment to be

:ial receipts due to us from the Community which had not

The number of directly elected members was likely to be higher

directly due to the reaction in Hong Kong

been returned to Vietnam on 12 December.   Although their report

was not entirely uncritical, their most important conclusions

were that none of the 51 had been a genuine refugee and none had

been maltreated.   Ihe Vietnamese Government were unlikely to

agree to further repatriations of non-volunteers until after the

resumed third meeting in Geneva of the International Conference

on Indo-Chinese Refugees Steering Ccrrraittee, which was new fixed

for 23/24 January, and at which the British representatives

!here were indications that the United States

camps for Vietnamese in Hong Kong;   while one appeared

of acceptable standard, the other was seriously

was offered.   Responding to the FNQ would provide an

IconfidentTaU)



opportunity for the Secretary of State to explain the

constitutional position to the House without volunteering

a Statement.



b. On the other hand, for the Secretary of State to make

any statement, whether in response to a FNQ or otherwise,

would invite a host of supplementaries and weaken the

constitutional position which he had described.



c. If the Secretary of State were to make an immediate

statement outside the House simply clarifying the

,constitutional arrangements, this would lead to immediate



est ions as to why that statement had not been made to the

ouse itself.



d. ?Ihe story was likely to run for seme time.   It was

important that in standing firm on the constitutional

position*, the Government shculd give no roan for

alloi/iicms that it too was involved in an attempt to cover

up juJfe&gt;et^ru.sbehaviour.



summing up the discussion, said that it was
