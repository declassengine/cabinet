House of Cannons and the House of lords in the following week.

It was noted that the legislative programme was generally making

satisfactory progress in both Houses.



OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he would be making a

following week an four matters corK:erning

privatisation.   First, the draft licences for the

electricity companies were to be published, giving a

indication that the Government were on target for vesting

an 31 March.   Secondly, he would be announcing the

level of the fossil fuel levy.   This wculd be lower than had

recently bee^oredicted in media reports and was forecast to

decline.   H^Ssuld also refer to the considerable interest which

had been expcggsad in new generating projects vising renewable



environmental point of view, this was a

elapment.   Finally, he wculd give an

Government had formally

about their exclusion from

the Nan-Fossil Fuel Obligation, ^fti&amp;cugh this would inevitably

attract press interest, he had beett^avised that the ccnplaint

was unlikely to be upheld.   Electrwate de France were not in a

position to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity in

the united Kingdom.   A finding in favour of the French

Government wculd plainly be inconsistent wUJjsthe Commission&apos;s

decision that the fossil fuel levy must befaotified as a state

aid.



In a brief discussion it was noted that the

levy, which derived from the Electricity Act

careful presentation.   Whereas prices charged fo

electricity reflected the costs of decommissioning

stations and of nuclear waste disposed., the equival

coal generation, in terms of derelict land reclamati

environmental pollution, were not taken into account.

2. Uffi SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that on the previous

Thursday the Scottish labour Party had published their proposals

for a property tax based an capital values, intended as an

alternative^testhe community charge.   The proposals for the

tax - whiciviiaia rapidly been dubbed the &quot;roof tax&quot; - had been

attacked frc /aiis quarters.   For example, they would have

serious financial1) implications for council hcuse tenants as well

as for former^uvi&amp;l tenants who had bought their cwn hemes,

In a brief discussion it was reportm^that the Shadow cabinet

had recently considered proposals ^ror an alternative to the

community charge in England and Walej^.   These were understood to

be similar to the property tax proposals published in Scotland,

except that they were intended to take into account in a

different but hitherto unclear way the financial means of those

paying the tax.   Considerable unease had a^snUgxpressed about

the proposals by seme Shadow Cabinet nenbeti^am\ it was new

would be the third set of proposals for a local gave

to emerge from the Opposition in less than 2 years.

to 7 February, heralded a significant shift in political

Congress, which was scheduled for June or July, and

THE FOREIGN AND CCMMONWEAIIffl SECRETARY said that he had had

discussions in Bonn on 6 February with the West German

Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, and the Foreign Minister, Herr Hans

Dietrich Genscher.   It was clear that the West German leadership

was preoccupied with reunification to the exclusion of the

implications.   Ihey were especially worried about the present

flew of emigration from East Germany.    70,000 emigrants had

Left since 1 January, and thousands more were ready to leave if

situation deteriorated further.   The West German Government

ite negotiations on currency union when the East German

Prime Minister, Herr Hans Modrow, visited Bonn on 13/14

standpoint, namely a neutral, unified Germany, now

be receding.   According to newspaper reports, Mr SI

Soviet forces remaining in East Germany for the time being. At

his meeting with the Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union,

Herr Volker Ruhe, the latter had argued that economic

considerations were a powerful factor in the strong desire for

reunification an the pari: of the East German population. At

the same time, there were no illusions an either side about the

significant short term cost of reunification for West Germany.

 linked to the CM through the Exchange Rate Mechanism of

form economic and monetary union wculd take.   The most

Legitimate Soviet anxieties shculd be taken fully into account.

One possible forum for discussion might be the Four Powers plus

the two Germanies, despite West German reluctance to accept Four

Power involvement.    An important objective must be to maintain

a substantial United States presence, comprising stationed

forces and nuclear weapons, in Europe.    It was important to

strive for a period of transition between any announcement of

reunification and its implementation in order to manage the



carefully.   The German Government needed to be reminded

legal and treaty obligations and also of the need to pay

heed to the interests and views of the major powers. At

only the United Kingdom was prepared to take a

t position towards the West German leadership. ?Ihe
