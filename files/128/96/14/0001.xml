the House of Commons in the three days following the return of

the House after the Easter Recess.



IDRD  PRESIDENT  OF  THE  CCUNCEL  said  that the strategic

!roach taken by the Government to handling debates in the



of Commons on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill

far achieved broad acceptance. On Monday 2 April the

had approved the motion under Standing Order 61(3)

that the major issues of conscience on embryology

on abortion should be debated in a committee of the

and a timetable motion relating to those debates and

the r^aining proceedings on the Bill. It was intended that the

debate on embryo research should take place on Monday 23 April,

on the basis of amendments he had tabled as Leader of the House

of Commons wttic&amp;\ would provide the House with the same choice as

He planned to table a new clause which

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR     ENVIRONMENT said that he had made

a Parliamentary statement on 3 April announcing his decision to

cap the community charge of 20 local authorities. Hie

Opposition, in responding to his proposals, and the media had

? predictably concentrated on the fact that no Conservative

ontrolled   councils   had   been   selected   for charge-capping.



should take every opportunity to emphasise that the

for this was that the biggest overspenders were labour-

COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that recently

    of   the   North   Atlantic Treaty

Germany,  and an a number of arms

the  Open  Skies   initiative and

forces  in Europe   (CFE). This

icularly noticeable in relation to

&quot;a.   The Soviet leadership was

independence.     All Moscow-

tening   their   grip over

to begin secession procedures, at least three-quarters of the



adult population must vote,  of wham at

vote in favour of secession, and a vote of

two-thirds majority must be taken in the

Deputies.   After this a cooling-off period

would be required followed by a further vote

People&apos;s Deputies.   The law was unlikely to sa

Affairs Council on 2 April and a further statement

issued by European Community Foreign Ministers.    The staJ

situation should be resolved by dialogue and discussion and not

by the use of force. Ihe Lithuanian authorities appeared to

recognise that the only sensible way forward was through

discussion. If President Gorbachev authorised the use of force

in Lithuania this would be a major setback to East/West

relations and could jeopardise the progress which President

Gorbachev and Western leaders had achieved over the past year.

United States Secretary of State, Mr James Baker, would put

mania at the top of the agenda in his discussions with the

Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, in Washington

April. There were also signs of a tougher Soviet

aver specific aspects of British/Soviet relations. The

.on of profound economic problems and nationalist

had created a difficult situation for President

, which was reflected in the prickly and defensive mood

y detectable in Moscow. He wculd be grateful if

colleagues would let him know if they detected any similar

hardening of positions in their dealings with the Soviet

authorities./^?He\ would be visiting Moscow and Leningrad from 9-

12 April anajrapai that the discussions wculd throw further

light on the a^^S^le of the Soviet leadership.

It should be borne in

in Lithuania raised complex

ies of Lithuania before

new. In particular, parts

ed to Byelorussia and

the provisions of the

Helsinki Final Act afforded a po^iffife mechanism for dealing

with the question of Lithuania. \\ The Helsinki Final Act

contained the important provision that existing borders should

not be changed without the agreement of the countries concerned.

When the United Kingdom had signed the Helsinki Final Act this

meant that it had acknowledged de facto the^exjsting borders of

the Soviet Union. On the other hand, th^UiSijsd Kingdom had

never given de jure recognition to the incorporation of the

Baltic States.

pursuing two other possible Iraqi attempts to procure sensitive

technology, including the purchase of Armadale Foundry in

Edinburgh. Departments would need to remain alert to such

possibilities. Iraq&apos;s chemical weapons capability was

particularly disturbing, especially in the light of President

Saddam Hussein&apos;s speech on 2 April in which he had threatened to

retaliate for any Israeli attack on Iraq by using chemical

&apos; reapons. Ihe United Kingdom and other Western countries

itained export controls on the sale of chemical precursors

Iraq. These  arrangements  were  now being tightened.

4. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND POOD said that

the Agriculture Council the previous week on price fixing had

been very discouraging, although the final package on the table

had provided what the United Kingdom had wanted for the Green

Pound. There had been opposition to the package from the

French, the Germans, the Greeks and Spaniards, and from the

Danes whose opposition was based on similar reasons to those of

e United Kingdom. The Agriculture Council wculd revert to the

tter on 25 April. Meanwhile the existing arrangements would

rolled forward. There were two particularly dangerous

first, the Dutch Government had ceased to support

of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and had instead

to pressure from their cereals producers for greater

and, secondly, it appeared that the French had reached

with the Germans in which each would support the

demands. There was a risk of a settlement which would

have very bad implications both for the General Agreement on

Tariffs and Trade (GAIT) Round and for the stabilisers regime.

long or short. All other delegations supported the objective of

price stability for a central bank, though some had suggested ?

widening its responsibilities to include, for example,

promotion of growth and employment. The general view was that a

central bank should be independent of political authority; that

responsibility for exchange rate policy should be for the

political authorities; and that intervention should be for the

itral bank. Several delegations had proposed that the central

should be responsible to the European Parliament and the

Council. He had argued that accountability to national

Laments ought to have primacy. The French Minister had

sssed concern about the importance of democratic

ac^rtanphbility. The meeting had taken no decisions and the

atirosm^e had been constructive. Further work would continue

in  ufflrrelevant Committees. EMU was unlikely to feature at the

Informal European Council on 28 April, although discussion on

the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference might be

impossible to^ayoid. In his comments to the press afterwards the
