flooding was ewer.   It would also be important for the

Government tpefcteure that local authorities were fully aware of

their entitiggepfe-&lt;to extra financial assistance, and that the

public was infqfm^} of the Government help being made available.

In discussion, the following main points were made:



a.    Seme local authorities would face extensive additional

costs as a result of the recent storms.   In the case of a

small district, this might impose an excessive burden on

local finances.   In the event of a major disaster, there

/^/&gt;ras an obligation on the taxpayer to finance part of the

*//jx^ts, of repair.



The range of assistance available to local authorities

wide and involved a number of departments. The

2tary of State for the Environment should send details

of the relevant grants to Cabinet colleagues so that they

were prepared to respond to allegations that the costs of

repairing~^orm damage were contributing to high community

charges;

 done by the Minister of

    CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the United Kingdom

balance of payments had shewn a current account deficit of  1.9

billion in January.   This compared with a revised estimate of

 0.8 billion the previous December.   The worsening in the month-

on-month position reflected two factors. First, the December

deficit figure had been substantially reduced on revision,

deficit.   These included exceptionally large imports of

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVJ$$JMENT said that an the

previous day 18 Conservative councillors on West Oxfordshire

District Council had resigned the Pa&amp;y Whip to sit as

independents in a protest over the community charge and changes

in housing subsidy.   The move, which wculd make little

which represented a 27 per cent increase in

increase of 33.4 per cent, and Aggregate External

ending of resource equalisation.   As regards housing, the

councillors were angry about a proposed 34 per cent council rent

rise which they attributed to the new housing subsidy

arrangements.   A delegation frcm the council had met the

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State responsible for housing

matters earlier that week, but had given no indication of the

intended resignations.   When he had first heard of the



elcpments the previous afternoon, he had offered to meet a

.tion frcm the council himself, but this offer had been

ined.   ?Ihe former leader of the Conservative group on the

had been trying to encourage councillors in other

ties to folic*/ his group&apos;s example, but without success,

opment would, hcwever, be bound to attract considerable

at the Conservative Local Government Conference the

Saturday.   In an initial canment, he had said that he

saddened by the councillors&apos; decision, which was

misguided not least because their quarrel should be with the

County Ccunciij^which had enormously increased its expenditure

d.    !here was no doubt that much of the reason for the

substantial community charge to be levied by the district

council was the massive precept imposed by the County

Council.   It was to be hoped that the reason for the level

of charge would be made apparent to charge-payers on the

face of the Community Charge Bill.   Ihe position would have

been easier for charge-payers to understand had only a

single authority been involved.



County Councils were required to set their precept

iture levels would be adopted by Labour-led councils.



MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENC?&apos;said that the Amalgamated

Union of Engineering Workers had forborne time been campaigning

for a reduction in the working week in the engineering industry

number of particularly vulnerable ccmpani
