In discussion the following points were made



a. Although there was considerable public

ambulance staff, this was not generally refl

among the Government&apos;s supporters in the coun

very small number of Conservative Members of

expressed concern about the continuation of the

they were not representative of opinion in the

Parliamentary Party.   Their claims to be ready to



!confidential)




!confidential]



intermediaries were unhelpful, and unnecessary in that

there were already substantial informal contacts between

the two sides.



b. Ihe briefing material issued to the Government&apos;s

supporters about the dispute had been very helpful, not

least in emphasising the consequences of conceding the

ambulance unions&apos; claim.   This central argument would bear

constant repetition.   Ihe difficulty lay in finding new

ways of conveying it to which the media would respond.



c. !here had been seme criticism of the description of

ambulance staff as &quot;professional drivers&quot;.   The fact



JA^emained that most ambulance staff only had a six-week

\f training in first aid: nationally, only one in ten was

  trained in paramedical skills and the number with such

skills in the London ambulance servioe was particularly

low. JJhere was a prospect that the dispute would speed up



tion of the service so that more staff

acqLUfet ^nese skills, while routine tasks were contracted

out.



d.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said&quot;

laying before Parliament that afternoon the orders

provide the basis for the revenue support grant (R;

for 1990/91.   They were to be debated on Thursday 1

Parliamentary colleagues who had expressed concerns about the

settlement.   Concern focussed on three main issues. Seme

colleagues argued that the settlement should be more generous.

This was in large part because local authority treasurers were

briefing constituency members on the unacceptable premise that

an authority&apos;s outturn expenditure in one year should form the

baseline for the following year&apos;s grant.   The settlement was in

fact, a generous one: total standard spending was projected to be

11 per cent higher in 1990/91 than in the current financial

ear, and aggregate external finance 8.5 per cent higher. A

nd concern was about the effect of moving to the new

[enents for needs assessment, which involved 13 standard

assessments (SSAs) rather than 63 grant related

ture assessments (GREs) under the present system: these

lements were to the disadvantage of sane authorities and to

advantage of others.   The third major concern related to the

financial impact on individual constituents of moving from

that other colleagues would

reassure those who remained

ens on individual constituents were the result of

spending decisions rather than the introduction

charge.   Many local authorities were

tening to place the blame for increased



an the change to the new system rather than

decisions.   He would continue to meet

In discussion the following ma



were made:



i. local Authorities were typically spending between 15 per

cent and 17 per cent more in the current financial year

than in 1988/89.   These increases we3?e&gt;teflected in the



proposed spending levels for 1990/

they had been financed from bal

depleted, or through other creative a

The impending new arrangements for con

expenditure had also spurred seme autho

excessively.   In the case of authorities

from the ending of resource equalisation,

charge-payers could be cushioned, although

authorities were taking advantage of this,

the losses of which county treasurers ccmpla

fact offset by gains at district level.

A number of local authorities were forecast



!confidential!

high ccmnunity charges in the hope of attracting extra

Government resources.   Others appeared to be proposing a

high expenditure in 1990/91, placing the blame on the new

system, in order to gain electoral advantage.   It was

important to bring out the assumptions being used by

authorities cn increased spending and success in collection

cn which authorities were basing projections of high

community charges and, in the case of Conservative

authorities, to mobilise local political pressures for

restraint cn spending.



iii. Given the forecast high levels of community charge,

the powers to cap the charge of individual authorities



A^^ould probably need to be used in about twenty cases. Ihe

\f precise criteria for capping remained to be decided.



iv. It was important to act quickly to change any

of the revenue support grant arrangements which



le local authorities artifically to increase

t entitlement.   One council had sought to do this

authority spending.   This was not, however, justified.   It was

clear that many local authorities were forecasting levels of

community charge for 1990/91 which represented a year on year

increase in spending far higher than inflation, which they were

reluctant to accept was a consequence of their own spending

decisions.   Ihe Secretary of State for the Environment had

worked assiduously to deal with the concerns of local

authorities, and of individual Members of Parliament, and would

continue to do so.   In general, it was important for all



!leagues to ensure that high levels of spending were exposed

that Conservative-control 1 ed authorities were pressed to

in their plans.   Local accountability was at the heart of

ty charge regime.   It appeared that realisation of

behind the concerns which many authorities were

The process of dialogue with the political parties would

continue in the weeks ahead.   He hoped to have a meeting with

the Social and Democratic Labour Party at the end of the week,

and would then be visiting the United States.   During his

absence, Dr Mawhinney was hoping to have discussions with one of

the smaller parties, and he envisaged further discussions with

the two Unionist parties cn his return from the United States,

definitive judgement about the cause of the fire, which

In a brief discussion, it was pointed out that while substantial

progress had been made towards establishing democratic

governments in Czechoslovakia and Poland, the situation in

Romania and East Germany was much less clear cut since Ocranunist

wParty and military elements in the current administrations were

?ing to hold on to power.   Nevertheless, there were good

that free elections would take place.   It was also

that decisions taken on assistance to East Eurcpean

:res would have a direct effect an British industry and

tally on agriculture, since these countries were mainly

.cultural economies.   It would be essential to keep in close

with the French Government so that British interests could

more favourable attitude from the United States Government and

access to United States funding.   ,Ihe United States Government

had asked for a postponement of the meeting for a week or so,

and was new examining ways of being more helpful to the British

position, most particularly in the light of the British



support for the United States intervention in

Panama.   The United States Government was moving towards

abandoning its opposition in principle to mandatory

repatriation but there was still a problem over the timescale
