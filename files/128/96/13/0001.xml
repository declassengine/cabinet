He would be making an announcement in answer to a Written

Parliamentary Question as soon as possible.   The scope of the

Bill would be very tightly drawn, in order to avoid attracting

amendments not relevant to the holiday caravan issue.

AFFAIRS   3.     IHE FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEAIIH SECRETARY said that the



situation in Lithuania remained precarious.   It was clear that

neither the Soviet leadership nor the Lithuanians wanted to

provoke a confrontation.   Nevertheless, there had been a marked

rise in tension with the arrest of deserters, the occupation of

buildings and the exclusion of foreigners.   Although in many

ways the tactics of the Soviet Government were understandable,

the effect had been to create a situation which could lead to

iolence.   By the same token, the Lithuanian leaders needed to

scanscious of their responsibility to handle the pace of

^de^kLopmerrt in such a way as to minimise the risk of conflict.

?^/ ^   to urge calm and restraint, he had summoned the Soviet

ior an 28 March, and the Prime Minister had spoken an the

to the Soviet President, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. Ihe

twely6 European Community Member States had made similar

representations in Moscow.   Ihe United Kingdcm had taken the

initiative with the Irish Presidency to propose a further

statement an^b^half of the Community.    Ihe statement would

stress the /responsibility of both sides not to put at risk the

achievemenrs-a5^?kAernatianal relations over the past year.



d that she had had a full discussion with

28 March.   It was clear that tension in

more, after a period in which it



President Gorbachev evidently felt

e calm and sensible response frcm the

ich he felt entitled.    He had

t pressure both from his

e other Republics.   They were

rebuffed by the

e necessary spirit of co-

an a major campaign to

secure changes in the Soviet constitution and legal framework

which would permit self-determination for the Republics,

possibly leading to secession.   But, President Gorbachev

reiterated, these important issues, where faSdamental Soviet

interests were at stake, could not be sett^d gj^ a show of hands

for a peaceful solution and to rule out force, but

their public statements to avoid adding to his difficulties.

The United Kingdom had never accorded de jure recognition to the

annexation of the Baltic States.   Ihe British Government would

continue its efforts through the Eurcpean Community, and in

consultation with the United States, to encourage a solution to

the problem through dialogue and discussion. Western

Governments were well aware of the incalculable costs of



lire.   She had also had a detailed discussion with the United

President, Mr George Bush, an 28 March following her

.tion with President Gorbachev.   The United States had a

.tic mission in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. The

appeared to be inproving.   The United Kingdom had a

le to play as a safety valve to defuse tension, since

had excellent access both to President Bush and

Gorbachev.    She hoped that the efforts which were now

being made would have a calming effect.

breach of the Treaty.   In any event, the Iraqi action was

certainly a breach of the spirit of the Treaty.   Hence, the

United Kingdom, which was the convener of the Western Group of

NET partners in Geneva, had called a meeting of the western

Group to assess the implications of the Iraqi action and to

consider further measures to minimise the risk of proliferation.

The intention was to call a full meeting of NET partners in the

light of the discussion within the Western Group.   Second, the

itish Government was taking action to strengthen and expand

Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) which covered the

of equipment and technology for strategic missiles. The

an was to try to involve the Soviet Union in the MTCR.

set up to analyse the possibilities and make specific proposals.

It was unlikely to be possible to prevent such issues being

discussed.



In a brief discussion it was pointed cut that an increasingly

centralized system of the sort which the French Government

apparently had in mind was the opposite of the United Kingdom&apos;s

? of a Community based upon the co-operation of sovereign



It would be likely to increase the already large

possessed by the European Commission, and thus to

ite the lack of democratic control.     It would be ironic

this direction at the very time when the countries of

Europe were moving away from centralized planning and

greater democracy.    On the other hand, the fact that

Government strongly opposed the European Parliament

from Strasbourg to Brussels suggested that there were

limits to their desire to centralize.

If the scope of the Bill could be limited, it should be

possible to avoid the submission of amendments an a wide

range of social security matters which had became a regular

feature of proceedings an each year&apos;s Social Security Bill

and was encouraged ty the fact that expenditure charged to

In considering the selection of &apos;eu^^rlt ies for capping, he had

been particularly concerned that %t3g&lt;^ riteria should, as far as

possible, be robust enough to withsrareKfche legal challenges



that would undoubtedly ensue.   Select(tt$n was therefore to be

based on two criteria, as had previously been the practice in

select:ing authorities for rate capping.   An authority&apos;s budget

would be judged excessive if it exceeded its Standard Spending

Assessment by more than 12.5 per cent (the l^re^t criterion

which had been used for rate capping) and bxvDp} ^than  75 per

The cap for each individual authority would need to reflect

In the case of the eleven authorities, his preliminary view was

that the maximum possible budget reduction suggested by the

selection criteria was reasonably achievable, and he intended to

propose community charge caps accordingly.   For the remaining

uthorities, his preliminary conclusion was that smaller



ctions should be proposed.   No authorities were to be capped

his proposals would save  250 million of General

concerned.   There would inevitably be criticism, however,
