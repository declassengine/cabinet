He saw no option for the Government but to continue to stand

firmly an the best scientific advice available to them. The

Government&apos;s record cn the matter was good.   They had banned the

practice of feeding ruminant protein to herbivores, which had

led to the initial development of the disease.   They had also

responded quickly and positively to the Report of the Working

Party on BSE chaired by Sir Richard Southwood; indeed, they had

beyond the recommendations of the Southwood Report in



precautions to ensure that specified bovine offals did

enter the food chain.   He kept closely in touch with the

iform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee chaired by Doctor

1, and their earlier recommendations on matters for

THE SECRETARY OF STATE PCR SCOTLAND said

announced their intention to close the

Ravenscraig steelworks, Motherwell, in 1991,

770 jobs.   This matter had been selected by

debate an Monday 21 May.   The closure had much

implications, making it virtually certain that

the Scottish steel industry wculd close dawn wi

years.   This would lead to serious economic probl

Central Scotland.   It was entirely right that Brit

should take their decision an commercial criteria,

notable that in the previous day&apos;s exchanges in the Hod

Commons there had been no calls for Government subsidy  

nationalisation.   He felt it was essential for the

standing in Scotland for him to emphasise his concern aver

issue and to press British Steel to give a full explanation to

the workforce of why the closure was necessary particularly in

view of the successful record of operation of the plant over the

last 3 years.



In discussion it was noted that the Government had no authority

to intervene in such matters and indeed European Ccnrmanity rules

militated against  assistance to the steel industry. Contrary

to sane press reports, the closure of the hot strip mill was not

istent with undertakings given at the time of

vatisatian.   It would be unwise to give too strongly the



ion, particularly to those considering inward investment,

?rtrialists in the United Kingdom taking ccranercial

which involved closures or job losses would face

frcm the Government.   It would be particularly

to emphasise the contribution which new industry,

inward investment, could make in replacing jobs lost

in older industries such as stee!making,   !here was an

encouraging reqord of success in areas such as Corby and



investment was also contributing substantially

works had been announced earlier in the week,

OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

employes in manufacturing industry in Great Britain in the

period had fallen by 18,000, the largest monthly fall since

early-1989. /-&quot;The unemployment figures reflected some regional

variations  faftvQe unemployment had increased in London and the

in every other(ragh.cn.   ihe United Kingdom unemployment rate was

well below the^JHrroean Community average.   The Average Earnings

annual underlying Cireiirease in average earnings over the whole

economy was 9.5 peroajpfor the third consecutive month. Ihe

3.     THE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEAIHH SECRETARY said that he had had

useful discussions in Bonn on 15  May with the West German

Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, and the West German Foreign

Minister, Herr Hans-Dietrich Genscher.   It was clear that while

the results of the Laender elections in North Rhine-Westphalia

and Lower Saxony on 13 May had not been disastrous for the

coalition, they were a setback.   They had caused

lor Kohl, and to a greater extent, Herr Genscher, to

ude that there was a strong case for accelerating the

of German unification, with the aim of holding all-

ections in December in place of the scheduled West

ections.   They believed that it was not possible to

have^^wo Germanies in which one Germany was paying out large

suns of money to the other Germany.   The attitude of the Social

Democratic Parties (SPD) was contradictory.   The SPD in East



Germany was

while the Sfjl

to apply for t

West Germany was arguing that they were

not clear whether it would be possible to

of unification to the extent envisaged. It

the East German Government was willing

under Article 23 of the Constitution

Kohl had said that he was not prepared

to finance the costs of helping East

Governments establi

together in time for all-German el

current 2+4 talks would need to



progress.   One of the crucial factors affecting the Soviet

attitude was likely to be the cost to them of^staticning and

then withdrawing the Soviet forces at

Herr Genscher had stated for the first

personally in favour of British, United Sta

remaining in Berlin for as long as Soviet

former East Germany.   It seemed probable that

Governments would be asked to retain sane forces

THE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEAIHH SECRETARY said that the situation

in Kashmir remained tense, and the prospects were not

encouraging.   The united States President, Mr George Bush,

would be sending his Deputy National Security Adviser, Mr Gates,

to visit India and Pakistan on 19-21 May as his Special Envoy.

He would be carrying messages urging restraint on both sides.

The Pakistan Prime Minister, Miss Benazir Bhutto, had asked the

British High Ccnmissianer in Pakistan on 10 May whether the

Commonwealth could play a mediatory role.   The united Kingdom

 ent Representative to the united Nations, Sir Crispin

LI, had arranged an informal meeting of Ambassadors of the

Permanent Members of the Security Council on 17 May. Ihe

would enable the Ambassadors to have a confidential

don on the present situation and, in particular, on what

action might be taken if fighting broke cut.   It was

cleeft^that the Indian Government would react badly to any overt

action in the United Nations.    Meanwhile, the British

Government continued to urge restraint on both sides.

deficit to zero, to increase tt^Krate of savings and to reform

whether either side would be preparM^Bo make any reed changes.
