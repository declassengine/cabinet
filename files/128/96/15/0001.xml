Business



1.    Ihe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons and the House of lords in the following

week.



g^tish THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY said that the



nationality British Nationality (Hong Kong) Bill was due to receive its

(Hong Kong) second reading in the House of Commons later that day. Ihe



Opposition had tabled a procedural motion, to be debated after

second reading, to seek to take the Committee stage of the Bill

on the floor of the House.   He was hopeful that, with the help

of seme support from the Opposition and minority parties, the

Government would secure majorities in favour of the Bill and

against the procedural motion, although the size of these wculd

depend on the number of abstentions and adverse votes among the

Government&apos;s backbenchers.



Legislative THE LORD PRESIDENT OF IHE COUNCIL said that the pressure on the



Programme legislative programme in the present session in both the House



1989-90 of Commons and the House of Lords was considerable.   Subject to



any unforeseen factors, it should be possible to cope with the

Previous present very full programme.   It was crucial, however, for



Reference: colleagues to resist the temptation to add new material to



CC(89) 30.1        Bills, especially when this opened up new fields of discussion.



Careful handling at Commons Report stage was particularly

important.   So far as possible commitments given in Committee in

the Commons should be honoured at Report stage in the Commons,

but it would be necessary to avoid excessive numbers of

Government amendments on Report, which might lead to timing

difficulties and give grounds for obstructive tactics by the

Opposition.   It would be helpful if colleagues responsible for

Bills presently before Parliament could take a close personal

interest in their progress.   Every effort should be made to

expedite instructions and drafting in order to give the business

managers the maximum flexibility in planning the business for

the remainder of the Session.



THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the pressure on the legislative

programme in the House of Lords was very heavy.   Ihis pressure

was manageable, but additions to Bills could lead to significant

handling difficulties.   It was already clear that a substantial

spillover would be needed in order to complete the programme.

THE FKEME MINISTER said that colleagues should bear in mind the

need for full and effective liaison with backbench Government

supporters on matters of interest to them.   For example, early

discussion of new policy initiatives, with backbench Committees

and with individual Members of Parliament, could be helpful. It

was particularly important to ensure that Members of Parliament

were alerted to forthcoming announcements affecting their

constituencies and that regional interests were taken fully into

account.

2.    THE HCME SECRETARY said that the serious events at

Manchester Prison were continuing.   Home Office records showed

that at the start of the disturbance there had been 1647 prison

inmates, of whan seven had not yet surrendered.   Ihe situation

was far from satisfactory.   The remaining prisoners had been

publicly flouting authority, and continued to attract media

attention.   At this stage, however, it would be difficult to

defend a change of tactics which resulted in fatalities. Ihe

main damage to the prison had been done in the very early stages

of the disturbance when it had not been possible to contain

events because of the extensive resources which would have been

required.   A series of other events in prisons across the

country had been dealt with effectively.   Recent attempts to

regain control of the prison were being hampered by the

dangerous state of the interior fabric of the prison. An

attempt by four officers earlier in the week to take control of

part of the buildings had resulted in personal injury, in two

cases requiring hospital treatment.   Living conditions inside

the prison were clearly becoming unpleasant.   Three prisoners

had given themselves up earlier that week, having fallen

seriously ill as a result of food poisoning.   There was a risk

that the remaining prisoners might also suffer harm.   In his

judgment, however, the present tactic of seeking to take over

the prison by stages, and taking any opportunity which became

available to regain control, was preferable to alternative

options, such as storming the prison, which might lead to loss

of life.



In a brief discussion, it was noted that the remaining prisoners

appeared to have ample food and were taking full advantage of

the media attention focussing on events at the prison.   It was

important to ensure that plans were made to bring the

disturbance to a close at the earliest opportunity, in order to

avoid criticism that the Government had responded indecisively

to the defiance of a handful of individuals.

Ihe Cabinet -

Took note.



public THE CHANCELLOR OF     EXCHEQUER said that the minute of 17 April



jj^enditure: 1990 on prospects for the 1990 Survey frcm the Chief Secretary

ppspects to the Prime Minister, which had been copied to members of the



for the 1990 Cabinet, emphasised the importance of maintaining firm control

Survey of public expenditure.   He thought it would be helpful to draw



this to the attention of colleagues at the start of the Survey.

Ihe fiscal surplus, which had been the result of higher growth

than forecast, was now more than accounted for by privatisation

proceeds and local authority asset sales, and could be expected

to fall, with the possibility of a borrowing requirement

emerging.   Ihe public expenditure planning total had been

overspent in 1989-90, and a further overshoot must be avoided,

despite pressures in the current and future years. The

Government&apos;s economic strategy was under pressure for a number

of reasons: in particular the immediate prospects for increases

in the Retail Price Index (RPI) were unpalatable and the markets

had reacted badly to the public expenditure overspend, causing

uncertainty about the exchange rate which had already

depreciated significantly against the basket of currencies over

the last year.   If the markets saw evidence of any relaxation in

the Government&apos;s fiscal policy the result could be higher market

interest rates or a lower rate for sterling, or both.   It was

therefore important that the Government should very clearly

stick to the public expenditure plans for the current and future

years already made.   He acknowledged that there were particular

pressures, for example in local authority expenditure, but the

approach in the survey must be that any increases in spending

plans should be offset by reductions elsewhere: as part of this

overall approach the Chief Secretary would, in the forthcoming

Public Expenditure Survey, be looking for reductions below

baseline in programmes where this was possible.



THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO     TREASURY said that for 1990-91 the

Reserve within the public expenditure planning total was already

almost fully committed, as a result of additional costs of

community charge benefit owing to higher charge levels,

together with a large number of other significant in-year

claims.   I.ds meant that the position for the remainder of the

year wculd be extremely difficult.   The knock-on effects of

these additions to public expenditure in the Survey years would

be substantial, and taken together with the effects of changed

economic assumptions would very substantially commit the Reserve

provision for those years even before account was taken of other

possible claims such as pressure for a more generous local

authority grant settlement.   His conclusion was that bids to

increase public expenditure beyond the planned level could not

be afforded and that spending Ministers must look to savings



3


(SECR



within their existing baseline provision as a way of financing

new policy initiatives.



In discussion the following main points were raised:



(a) It was essential that firm control should be

maintained over public expenditure.   Where appropriate,

existing levels of expenditure should be challenged, so

that any increases necessary in particular areas should be

offset by reductions elsewhere.   ?Ihis would require

Ministers to decide their priorities in the context of a

comprehensive view of all the pressures upon them.



(b) High wage claims were a cause for concern.   Unit wage

costs were rising very sharply compared with our

international competitors, and the effect on productivity

was damaging,   !here was particular concern about the

public sector, especially if a &quot;going rate&quot; became

implicitly established, since pay costs formed the major

part of many public expenditure programmes.   There was a

need for a properly co-ordinated overall approach to public

sector settlements and it might be necessary to take a firm

stand in particular cases, even to the extent of enduring

strike action.   Ihe public sector would have to accept that

budgets available for pay were limited, and that higher

wages could mean fewer jobs.



(c) Local authority overspending had contributed

substantially to the overspend of the planning total in

1989-90, while further increases in local authority

spending had led, particularly through the gearing effect,

to much higher than expected community charges for 1990-91.

This was of the highest priority in political terms.

Further consideration  of ways of bringing local authority

expenditure under control would clearly be required.

Comparisons between authorities suggested that some were

very inefficient, and the Audit Commission had identified

possible savings of  0.5 billion per annum, though this was

a small sum by comparison with the expenditure increases

coming through and the Commission acknowledged that they

could not be fully achieved in one year.   It was not always

easy to convince even Conservative-controlled local

authorities that there was scope for savings and reductions

in their level of exp^*xliture, and more detailed

information from the Government in such cases would be

helpful to local Members of Parliament wishing to argue the

case for lower community charges.



(d) There was a case in terms of the balance of payments

for improved co-ordination between the Departments most

closely involved in the attraction of inward investment,

for which competition within Western Europe was going to be

increasingly strong.

(e)   It was important that the pressures faced by the

Government on expenditure should be properly understood

more widely.   Such presentation should emphasise the

Government&apos;s determination to remain in firm control of

public expenditure, adhering to the present planned level,

as a means of realising the prospects which the Chancellor

of the Exchequer had held out in the Budget.   It was also

essential that, throughout the Public Expenditure Survey

Ministers should speak with one voice, doing nothing to

undermine confidence in the Government&apos;s firmness. It

would be important for the Chancellor and Chief Secretary

to take an early opportunity to explain matters to

Government backbenchers, and to seek to remove the widely

held view that there was scope for significant increases in

public expenditure in areas of particular difficulty. It

might be emphasised in particular that the current fiscal

surplus cwed a lot to one-off items, whereas public

expenditure increases tended to have ongoing effects.



    HUME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

Cabinet agreed that strict control of public expenditure must be

maintained, that bids to increase planned levels of public

expenditure could not be afforded, and that the approach must be

to offset any necessary increases in particular areas by savings

elsewhere.   Ihe Chancellor and Chief Secretary should, as

appropriate, ensure that the need to keep public expenditure

down to its planned levels was widely understood, and that the

Government&apos;s commitment to this was not in doubt.



Ihe Cabinet -



Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing

up of their discussion.



3.     IHE FOREIGN AND CCMMONWEAIIH SECRETARY said that he had

paid a useful visit to Moscow and Leningrad from 9-12 April,

during which he had had two long sessions of discussion with the

Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, and a ninety

minute meeting with the President, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. He

had cane away frcm the Soviet Union with two strong impressions.

First, the degree of disintegration of the SmHet political

system had gone much further than was often rt^ilised in the

West.   Hie disintegration was not limited to the pressures of

secession in a number of Republics.   It had also spread to the

Russian Republic itself.   In Leningrad the City Council had been

taken over by representatives of the reform section of the

Communist Party, the Democratic Platform.   There was much talk

about splits within the Communist Party.   He had found the same

atmosphere of disintegration in Moscow, particularly over

accusations of corruption among senior Party officials. It

seemed virtually certain that the one party system would



5 :


collapse at the Communist Party Congress in July. President

Gorbachev had cleverly changed his power-base so that he was

now much more reliant upon his position as President and as

Chairman of the Presidential Council.    By doing this he had

managed to free himself frcm the party structure as it began to

collapse.   Nevertheless, he would find it very difficult to

maintain a strong position and to keep control as the one party

system began to disintegrate.



His second principal impression was that President Gorbachev was

under increasing pressure from the military on matters of vital

concern to them, including the future of a united Germany in the

North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), planned force levels

for manpower, equipment and aircraft, and on Lithuania. This

explained the stiffening in the Soviet attitude which the Prime

Minister and the United States President, Mr George Bush, had

discussed at their meeting in Bermuda on 13 April.



It was difficult to predict the outcome on  the Lithuanian

situation which remained chaotic, partly because of mishandling

by both the Soviet and Lithuanian authorities, and partly

because of deliberate coercion by the Soviet Government.   It was

not easy for Western Governments to judge hew best to handle

these developments.   There had been suggestions that Western

countries should assist the Lithuanian authorities who were

experiencing shortages of oil and gas.   Hewever, the Lithuanian

authorities had very little available foreign exchange and had

only a small port which was in the hands of the Soviet

authorities.   In the circumstances it was important to adhere

firmly to the strategy and statements agreed by the Eurcpean

Community and the United States.   It was clear that if Lithuania

was subjected to extreme pressure Western countries could not

fail to take same action.   Discussions were in train in the

United States Government about the kind of action which it would

be suitable to take.   This would be limited to the economic and

cemmercial fields, including multilateral contacts.   It was

essential to preserve the achievements of the past few years

and not to jeopardise the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Moscow in

June, the Soviet-American Summit in Washington, and the Defence

Secretary&apos;s visit to the Soviet Union in May.   Hence, the

signals which Western governments would give the Soviet Union on

Lithuania would be confined to the economic, commercial and

diplomatic spheres.



In a brief disussion, the question was raised as to the extent

to which the Lithuanian authorities were able to make contact

with Western countries.   It was pointed out that the Baltic

States maintained close links with the countries of the Nordic

Council, in particular with Finland.   It was also noted that the

Baltic States were relatively recent creations in historic

terms.   Latvia had been a Dukedom of Russia, Estonia had been

created as part of the settlement after World War One and

Lithuania&apos;s boundaries had changed several times in the recent

past.   The United Kingdom had never given formal de jure



(Cl


recognition to the annexation of the Baltic States.   This meant

that it would be difficult for British Ministers to receive

representatives of the Lithuanian authorities without appearing

to recognise these countries.   But consideration was new being

given to establishing informal contacts with the Lithuanian

authorities in a way which would be helpful to the achievement

of a solution to the Lithuanian problem by discussion and

dialogue.   President Gabachev had introduced new laws on

secession for Republics which he insisted were designed to allow

Republics to leave the Soviet Union under certain, strictly

defined conditions.   These conditions were very stringent, but

the balance of evidence was that President Gorbachev was looking

for a peaceful settlement based on observance of the present

Soviet constitution.



Prime



Minister&apos;s

!feeting with

President Bush

in Bermuda

13 April



THE ERIME MINISTER said that she had had a very successful

Summit meeting with the United States President, Mr George Bush,

in Bermuda on 13 April.    The President had been accompanied by

Secretary of State Baker, General Scowcroft and Governor Sununu

in addition to Ambassador Blackwill and the United States

Ambassador in London.   President Bush had been determined to

make clear that the special relationship with the United Kingdom

remained intact, and he obviously enjoyed talking openly and

comfortably with the British Government.   President Bush made

clear his firm commitment to keeping a united Germany as a

member of NATO, and to retaining United States forces and

nuclear weapons in Europe.   Congress was likely to withhold

funds for the development of the follow on to Lance.   This meant

that the modernisation of short range nuclear forces would then

become focussed upon the future stationing of tactical air-to-

surface missiles in Germany as well as the United Kingdcm.

President Bush was keen to give NATO a larger political role,

which she fully supported, since this would help to emphasise

that the Atlantic community remained at the centre of the

defence of freedom.   At the same time, there must be closer

contacts between the European and North American members of

NATO.   She had also discussed the Lithuanian situation with

President Bush.   She agreed with the Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary that there had been a hardening in the attitudes of

the Soviet Government on political and military matters.

President Gorbachev was under extremely heavy pressure at home

but in the past he had appeared to be relatively relaxed about

German unification:   he was now much more worried.   He was also

concerned about the precedent which Lithuanian secession would

set for other Republics.   His main concern was that the

Lithuanian authorities should find a solution which would be in

line with the Soviet constitution.   The problem was that both

sides were setting preconditions.   The Lithuanian authorities

had recently taken three measures to which President Gorbachev

had objected:   they had issued identity cards which appeared to

discriminate between ethnic Lithuanians and resident Russians;


I CUKHutu Hal J



s,_1-----?



they had stopped conscription for the Soviet army;   arid they had

taken over buildings belonging to the Communist Party.

President Gorbachev had demanded that these measures should be

rescinded but had not specifically demanded that the Lithuanian

authorities should disavow their declaration of independence.

The armed forces were becoming an increasingly important factor

in the Soviet situation.   They appeared to be disillusioned with

the treatment which President Gorbachev had meted out to them in

terms of lowering the prestige of the armed forces, reducing

their equipment and declaring a large number of officers

redundant.   General Akhrameyev, the former Chief of the General

Staff, appeared to be gaining increasing influence.   The Soviet

Government was slowing down progress in all the main fora for

arms control discussions and was withdrawing equipment beyond

the Urals to maintin strong reserves.   She and President Bush

had considered that the Lithuanian situation could only be

solved by discussion and dialogue and that, if at all possible,

these developments should not put at risk the achievements in

East-West relations over the past few years.



Continuing, the Prime Minister said that President Bush appeared

to be concerned about the attitude of the French President, M.

Francois Mitterrand, on NATO and defence issues.   The United

States Government was also beginning to understand that the kind

of European Community which the United Kingdom advocated was

much closer to the kind of Europe which the United States

preferred.   President Bush attached great importance to avoiding

protectionism and to achieving successful negotiations on

agriculture in the Uruguay Round in the General Agreement on

Tariffs and Trade.    He anticipated considerable problems with

both France and Germany.   President Bush reacted sympathetically

to the British approach on the review of the COCCM regulations

based on maintaining a core list of restricted items. The

United States Administration had been attracted by the

possibility of differentiating in its attitude towards East

European countries and the Soviet Union, depending on the degree

of reform in these countries, but she had pointed out that such

a policy was difficult to implement in practice.   There had also

been discussion about Cyprus, the Middle East and the supply of

gun components to Iraq.     She and President Bush had agreed that

the situation in Kashmir was very serious.    President Bush

shared the British approach on South Africa.   It was helpful

that the President would meet the South African President, Mr F

W de Klerk, in June.   There had also been discussion of the

Economic Summit, where views were close.   She had urged

President Bush to agree to making London the site for the

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development rather than

Prague which the United States Government had initially

favoured.   She had also had a useful discussion on the

Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe Summit. The

only question on which there had been disagreement had been

Vietnamese boat people.   After the visit. President Bush had

sent her a message saying how much he had enjoyed their

discussions.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation

in Kashmir was even more serious than had been generally

realised, although it appeared that neither side wanted to drift

into war.   The British Government was in touch with both the

Indian and Pakistan Governments and was urging restraint.



j^q THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY explained the



background to the seizure by HM Customs and Excise of 8 large

previous steel tubes destined for Iraq and the subsequent legal enquiries



Reference: by the Customs authorities.   He described the investigations
