In discussion the following main points were made:



a.    There was great public concern about the incre^^f^.

number of attacks by certain breeds of dog, such as \&gt;yy/

Rottweilers and Pit Bull Terriers, on members of the _/  

public.   A number of recent incidents had involved young/ /

children.   It was particularly worrying that seme

irresponsible owners appeared to have such dogs solely in

order to intimidate others.   Ihe Government had a

responsibility to protect the public against the

possibility of attacks by dangerous dogs. Consideration

should therefore be given to the possibility of prohibiting

the ownership of certain breeds.



b.    Members of the public might perceive a ban as a

disproportionate response to recent attacks; on the other

hand there might be pressure to extend it to relatively

xtmon breeds such as Alsatians.   In addition it had to be

that many owners of potentially dangerous dogs

a wholly responsible attitude, and would react

avourably to any suggestion of a ban which might involve

dog being destroyed.   One option might be to

introduce new controls on the existing cwners of dogs of

specified breeds, together with a ban an their ownership in

enforce. Jjhere might be advantage in floating alternative

3.     THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND CCMMONWEAITH OFFICE (MR

WALDEGRAVE) said that the Foreign and COranonwealth Secretary had

made a successful visit to Poland from 29 April-2 May. The

Polish Government&apos;s efforts towards currency stabilisation

appeared to be working reasonably well, and they seemed to be

sticking bravely to the programme of economic reform which they

had set in hand.    Mr Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, had

itions to be President.   Success in achieving his aim could

unhelpful, since he was a populist who would be reluctant to

t the incidental effects of economic reform.   The primary

rn of the Foreign and Ccranonwealth Secretary&apos;s hosts had

jth the discussions between the two Germanies and the Four

security issues were under discussion. This

request would be difficult to meet in full, and Polish

participation in the 2+4 talks should be limited principally to

discussion of border issues.



FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that

in the 2+4 forum would take place

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN A^P^OC

the American hostage, Mr Frank

Beirut on 30 April, had criticised

Governments for not doing more to

the British Government to take a further initiative in the

matter, and this pressure would intensify further if, as seemed

likely, Belgian hostages were to be releaseirsmrtly.    He would

be putting proposals to the Prime Minister ^f^/jxjs^easing

In discussion, it was pointed out that the Syrian*

played a significant role in securing the release

his fellcw American Mr Polhill, inciting advising

States Government on tactics.   This suggested that

of advantage had new swung in favour of re-opening

the Syrian Government, which had been cut off as a

account of the conditions in which the hostages were held was

distressing, although Ministers should refrain from commenting

an them lest reprisals were taken against the remaining

hostages.   Relatives and friends of the British hostages, who

had hitherto been supportive of the Government&apos;s policy, were

beginning to break ranks.    The Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s

spokesman, Mr John Lyttle, had publicly urged direct contacts

the Iranian Government; and Mr Patrick McCarthy, the father

hostage Mr John McCarthy, had indicated privately that he

not continue for nuch longer to support avoidance of

Government contacts with the Governments concerned. The

fSmpy of Mr Brian Keenan would lose no opportunity to criticise

the^Br tish Government.   Public opinion wculd appreciate that

French, Italian and German Ministers and a representat

to resolve the dispute.    It was accepted by the four

Governments represented and by the Commission that there

be no restrictions cn output or sales from Japanese-owned

factories in the United Kingdom;   that eight Member States,

the terms of a voluntary restraint agreement to protect the

markets of the other four Member States (France, Italy, Spain

and Portugal).   Ihe duration of the agreement was for subsequent

decision, but the degree of restriction would presumably

decrease annually.   In discussion on wider Community issues, it

could be tactically useful to be able to point cut that an
