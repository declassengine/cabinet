in the House of Cannons and the House of Lords in the

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that the

rt Stage of the Social Security Bill would be taken in

of Cannons the following Wednesday.   As well as a

of important Government proposals, a series of



onnew clauses was to be expected covering such

ersial matters as residential care^far Crown

^ affected by radiation, and ccnmunity charge

it.   Proceedings on Wednesday might well

programme, although they had expressed the

    FKCME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said

the Cabinet noted the difficult issues which would

during the later stages of consideration of the Social

Security Bill in the House of Cannons, and the business

managers&apos; proposals far handling them.   Hewever, there

difficulties to which this regularly gave rise.   The lord

President of the Council should consider with the Secretary

of State far Social Security whether it was possible to

avoid including a Social Security Bill in the 1990/91

legislative programme (and, if possible in the programme

for subsequent sessions), by dealing with some of the items

intended to be covered by that Bill in the present



don&apos;s Bill, by greater use of secondary legislation or

other means.

IHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that^th^ Human

Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which h^comLeted its

passage through the House of Lards earlier

raised a number of sensitive issues on which

strong personal views inside and outside Pari

therefore proposed to make arrangements to

House of Commons could take decisions on these

matters in a structured and orderly way.  To provide

necessary framework, he intended to bring forward a

procedural motion to provide for the two key issues,

research and abortion (which he was advised wculd fall

within the scope of the Bill), to be debated by a Ccmmi

of the whole House.   Ihe remainder of the Bill wculd be

remitted to a Standing Ccnmittee in the usual way. This

split Ccnmittee procedure was precedented in the case of

and the Chief Whip had begun a series of informal soundings

through the usual channels and with the key groups of

interested Members in an effort to achieve a consensus on

the handling arrangements.   So far there seemed to be

general acceptance of his planned approach.   He would be

informing the House of the Government&apos;s handling proposals

created a calmer and mare sensible approach in West Germany

on Alliance issues such as stationed forces^and nuclear

the Warsaw Pact countries the Hungarian, PoItsnTam Czech

representatives had all argued that a united GJaaajs^ny shculd

the United States and British Governments had been

disappointed by the extent to which the two recent

directives issued by the Soviet President, Mr Mikhail

Gorbachev, in which he had demanded that the Lithuanian

authorities should respond to the decision of the Congress

of Deputies within three days and that Lithuanians should

^ hand in all the weapons in their possession, had created a

&quot;^/^confrontational situation.   There was a danger of disorder

X/llacpa. physical conflict between Lithuanians and Russians

(Jyip^g in Lithuania.   The KGB might also try to foment



? in order to create an excuse for using force. The

States Government had sent a clear message to



Gorbachev underlining the importance of sticking

&apos;.tmerrt not to use force.   On present evidence,

it ajsp^ared that the Soviet Government did not intend to

use force, but the sabre-rattling by both the Soviet and

Lithuanian authorities could get cut of control. The

British Government&apos;s position should continue to be to urge

both sides t^rosolve their problems by negotiation.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE PCR TRACE AND INDUSTRY

had visited the Soviet Union and Poland from 10

March.   He had been struck by the pressure for

which had been evident even in Leningrad.   It was

that secessionist tendencies were becoming increasi

strong not only in the Baltic States but also in the

Western Ukraine and the Southern Republics.   During his

discussions with Soviet Ministers, they had shown less

concern aver the economic and political aspects of

Lithuania&apos;s independence, but had laid great emphasis an

the legal aspects on the grounds that the Soviet Union was

difficult problem relating to Lithuania&apos;s demand for

independence concerned the Kaliningrad region which was

new cut off frcm the rest of the Soviet Union by Lithuania.

In Poland, remarkable economic changes were new under way.

14,000 enterprises, previously cwned by the State, had now

been ordered to behave as if they were private companies.

)Yet they had no balance sheets, no boards of directors, no

system and no proper companies&apos; legislation. This

the !mediate task much more difficult far British

Les involved in the Polish market.   Nevertheless, in

jer * *art&quot; it was clear that Poland would be a

Die market for British companies.   In these



there was growing concern at the implications of

singly powerful and united Germany.   There was a

;ire for British and other Western investment to

counterbalance German influence.
