SECRETARY OF STATE FOR IHE ENVIRONMENT said that the Report

of the Environmental Protection Bill would be taken in the

of Cannons during the following week.   There would be a

cult debate on a new clause, tabled with all party support,

for a national dogs registration scheme.   The debates

of the Nature Conservancy Council and the

ide Ccranission could also stimulate lively exchanges.

100 inmates remained, it had been concluded, following

discussions with the Deputy Director of the Prison Servioe,

that this would be too hazardous a course.     particular

difficulty which had faced the prison authorities throughout had

been to identify a means of securing a position above the

prisoners on the roof.   This had been done only at a late stage

in the disturbance following consultation with a specialist

architect.   In his view, criticism would have been much stronger

if as a result of public pressure he had taken an excessively

approach which had resulted in fatalities.   Since the

j.ous damage to the prison building had been done in the first

of the disturbance, the risks of such an approach had

justified.   He was satisfied that the strategy of

complete control of the prison at the earliest moment

consistent with incurring as few casualties as possible, had new

been\^indicated.   In his statement, he would be emphasising the



which would need to be considered, in advance of the

outcome of lord Justice Woolf ,s inquiry to prevent a recurrence.

had been issued by the Irish Presidency on behalf of

pressure at azmeeting which began on 25 April.   There was

Archbishop of Canterbury nor the relatives of the hostages were

pressing for a change of policy.   The role of the Syrian

Government in the release of the American hostage, Mr Robert

Polhill, appeared to be that of facilitator rather than

initiator.   No fresh information had been revealed about the

fate of the British hostages.   The United Kingdom&apos;s relations

with Syria were also difficult, particularly in the light of the

Lockerbie investigation and the Hindawi case.   The Government

&apos;.d firmly maintain its policy of not negotiating on the



of hostages, but would try to see that it was positioned

advantage of any opportunities which arose for making

towards release.

the Greek authorities while transporting a consignment of

hydraulic parts associated with the Iraqi gun project.

Departments accepted that he had not been aware that the

consignment was intended for an armaments project.   He had gone

to Britain earlier to renew his documentation and had then

to Greece.   Ihe British Bnbasasy in Athens had informed

authorities of the Government&apos;s view.   Ihe Greek

ties were being co-operative, though the decision on



release Mr Ashwell was a matter for the Greek courts,

suggested that an important factor in the case was

wculd not have been possible for the Greek Government to

To these items, France and Germany had added a proposal for

institutional changes within the Ccnraunity designed to lead to

what they termed &apos;,political union&quot;.    Discussion on this had

been difficult.   The Irish Chairman, Mr Collins, had suggested

that Heads of Government should merely have an initial informal

discussion, but France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands had

urged that discussion should lead to a decision to call a second

inter-governmental conference with a view to changing the Treaty

Rome.   It was uncertain how Mr Haughey, chairing the Heads of

no doubt reflecting the fact that Luxembourg would

Carraunity meetings during the first half of 1991, had

any decision at this stage, pointing out that, while a

all, including national Parliaments.   Ihe Danish Government was

THE CHANCELLOR OF IHE EXCHEQUER said that the fomal agenda of

the meeting of Finance Ministers on 23 April had comprised minor

items.   In addition the German Finance Mini^&amp;r, Herr Waigel,

had reported the German Government&apos;s conclusion 00 the terms of

repercussions on interest rates and public expenditure in the

Federal Republic, and perhaps on the Cccmunity budget as well,

!here had been an informal discussion about the European Bank

for Reconstruction and Development.   The Irish Presidency

confirmed that there were only two candidates for the President

of the Bank, Monsieur Attali from France and the former

Netherlands Finance Minister, Mr Ruling.   He had also announced

that Paris and London were the only serious candidates for the

ite of the Bank.   This had dismayed other Ministers who had bid

sites in their own countries, and it was likely that smaller

States would press for a conmitment about the siting of

Ocnmunity institutions.   The matter could well be

at the Dublin meeting on 28 April.   In response to

the French Minister had said that his Government&apos;s

majfafc^ebncern was to have Monsieur Attali as President: they

had not bid for Paris as the site but would re-consider the

position if someone else were chosen.

In a brief discussion it was noted that, if the Cccraunity could

arrive at a cannon view on the President arri. site of the

European Bank, it was likely to be accepted^&amp;$\the other

participants.    But there was a suspicion th^pthe French were

the Bank came to London in return for our accepting Monsieur
