THE SECRETARY OF STATE PCR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the

kHouse of Commons would be talcing the remaining stages of the

!cation (Student Loans) Bill that afternoon.   ?Ihe issue did

excite wide interest among the Government&apos;s supporters in

kcountry and he did not expect difficulties in the House of

He had, however, taken a number of steps designed to

the passage of the Bill when it reached the Upper House,

Luding meeting Conservative peers who had expressed concerns

its provisions.   A major demonstration by students was

planned to coincide with the Commons debate.   It was clear,

hcwever, t ^t students would alienate what little support they

had if tt n3vW ion got out of hand, as it had done cn a

this process to be completed before the local government

elections in May, to avoid the risk that local authorities

provisionally selected for charge-capping would claim an

electoral mandate for their budget decisions.   Until then,

colleagues should continue to mate it clear that the Government

would not hesitate to cap the charges of local authorities which

budgeted excessively, whichever political party was in control

of them.

istering the transitional relief scheme, seme  300 million,

In discussion, the following main points were made:



was clear that the general public, and seme Members

lament, had not fully grasped the details of the new

avoid being forced to do so in a few months tine; !here

might well be pressure to cap a large number of authorities

when charge levels became known, although in practice the

number of authorities capped would have to be limited.



    IRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

uncertainty among charge-payers about the new system and their

financial liabilities was likely to continue for several weeks.

yr/tyary local authorities would see it as in their interests to

^?^^hoourage this.   It was to be hoped that the good example of a

&lt;^ jjjber of Conservative-controlled authorities in setting their

ity charges at a realistic level would have a restraining

on those councils tenpted to set excessively high

gets.   It would be important to take every opportunity to

r^jlain to the public the basis of the new arrangements, and the

extent to which high community charges resulted from local

authoriti*&lt;&apos; spending decisions.

the rise in productivity in manufacturing industry, which was

largely due to the fall in employment in that sector, was very

welcome.



THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that figures for capital

investment in industry to be published that day would shew a

fall in the final quarter catpared with the third quarter of

989.   This was, however, a fall frcm an exceptionally high

the figure was still 2 per cent higher than in the fined.



of 1988 and, overall, capital investment in 1989 had

5 per cent higher than in the previous year.   A substantial

ion of this capital investment had been financed by

profits made by industry.



PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that

capital investment in industry had been at a record level for

In discussion, the following points were made -



a. The announcement had been preceded by seme speculation

about possible rises in German interest rates. This might

have encouraged the Abbey National decision: it would be

helpful if that speculation could be daitped down.



b. The announcement had come only a few days after the

ending of an offer designed to encourage mortgage borrowers

to switch to the Abbey National from other lenders because

the rates offered by those other lenders were too high.

This reflected discreditably on Abbey National.



 ^^     Ihe move would acme as a serious blow to many

\\ hemebuyers, particularly in the South East where house

prices were already depressed.   It wculd add to pressure

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that informal talks were

talcing place between the two sides in the Ambulance Service

dispute.   These might identify a basis for a settlement of the

dispute, although this appeared unlikely because of the

unrealistic aspirations still held by the trade unions.   A two-

year pay deal could well be one element in a settlement, but the

trade unions were continuing to press for sane kind of pay

formula, linked to the pay arrangements for nurses if not to

those for firemen.   A meeting of shop stewards the previous day

instructed ambulance crews in all regions to ignore orders



yfoxm Chief Ambulance Officers and assume responsibility

&lt;$^enselves for running an accident and emergency service. It

to be seen what effect this instruction would have in

ice.   In a meeting with the Chief Executive of the National

th Service (NHS), Chief Ambulance Officers had, however,

br5adly supported the position taken by NHS management in the

dispute.   He would be seeking to draw more public attention to

this.

foreign policy.   He no longer had any clear idea of what line

the East European Foreign Ministers were likely to take. On

German unification, the Soviet Union had adopted the familiar

position that a united Germany should be neutral.   By contrast,

the Polish, Czech and Hungarian Foreign Ministers had argued

that it was important for a united Germany not to be neutral.



^^-QPontinuing, THE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEAIIH SECRETARY said that the

^&quot;\^&amp;ctent of the present drift in Soviet foreign policy was

&lt;$^5fc1strated by the second important result achieved at the Open

Conference.   Agreement had been reached cn the manpower

The United States President, Mr George Bush, had

prtposea a limit of 195,000 United States and Soviet troops in

forces to -ise stationed within Europe but outside the central

It was clear that the Soviet position was much less relaxed than

had been presented by the West German Chancellor, Dr Helmut

Kohl, and his Foreign Minister, Herr Hans Dietrich Genscher,

after their recent visit to Moscow.   Ihe Soviet President, Mr

Mikhail Gorbachev, had stated that it was not possible to ignore

the military realities of the past, and that a security

^^arrangement was needed now.   It was still not entirely clear

&gt;^1$*ether the Soviet Union would eventually be prepared to accept

THE FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEAIICH t^ESfDtRY said that the release of

Mr Nelson Mandela had been wide^yV^eJ.cored.   The move had

created enormous expectations vnv^r&apos;it would be very difficult

for Mr Mandela to fulfil.   His fu$t speech and same subsequent

remarks had been a reiteration of standard African National

Congress (ANC) policy.   The South African Foreign Minister, Mr

Question Time cn 13 February.    It was irrportant for Western

governments to make a measured response to the steps taken by

the South African President, Mr F W de Klerk.   It was not

proposed at present to end the ban on arms sales or the binding

European OcmnLinity (EC) measures on Krugerrands.   Nor was there

any proposed to dismantle the Gleneagles Agreement on sporting

links with South Africa.   Nevertheless, further steps were

required to encourage President de Klerk to maintain the present

^^pncmentum.   Ihe Prime Minister had invited the President to visit



Foreign



cn 20 February, he would argue in favour of lifting the

new investment, which was voluntary in the case of the

Kingdom.    Although a number of other EC Member States,

including Belgium and Spain, would ideally like to take measures

to encourage President de Klerk, the Caranunity were unlikely in

of the United Kingdom.   Nevertheless, the United

&apos;s response was inevitably different since

limited by Congressional legislation. Ihe

Altogether the United Kingdom would be contributing  40 million

improve the conditions for black South Africans.   It was for

consideration whether at the EC Foreign Affairs Council meeting

emphasise this substantial programme of United Kingdom

reported on the situation in East Germany with particular

The cost to the Federal German Government of dealing

with the situation in East Germany was 211 ready very high

and rising.     Big expenditure would be needed on
