MENTARYAIRSctlttee ongationstbars oflament^oua^ 27thWone,e 11. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the recent publication in thePress of a letter written by Mr Cordle MP to Mr Poulson, of whosecontents he had previously been unaware, provided further confirma-tion of the wisdom of the Cabinefs conclusion at their last meeting thata Select Committee should be appointed to conduct a full investigation into the allegations which had been made against certain Members ofParliament acting In their Parliamentary capacity.    In view of the continuing Press Interest It was now important to table an earlyMotion to set up the Committee.    The proposed terms of reference,which had been drawn up by the Home Secretary in consultation withother Ministers, were &quot;to inquire into the conduct and activities ofMembers of this House in connection with the affairs ofMr JGL Poulson and of companies associated with him; to considerwhether any such conduct or activities amounted to a contempt of theHouse or an abuse of that freedom of speech and debates orproceedings In Parliament which Is immune from impeachment orquestion in the courts or was beneath the standards which the house is entitled to expect from its Members; and to report and make recommendations&quot;.    The terms of reference were linked specifically to the Poulson case but they went rather wider than proceedings inParliament itself.    This seemed essential in view of more recentallegations and the reference to standards which the House was entitled,to expect from its Members followed the precedent of a comparableinquiry relating to Lord Boothby in 1940.   As regards composition hethought that the Select Committee should number about 10 so as toInclude some members who were not Privy Counsellors.    It shouldhave power to send for persons and papers and would have such assistance as it required from the Attorney General who would not however be a member.    He also felt that the Committee should sit in private In order to avoid the great damage which could be done to individuals against whom unsubstantiated allegations might be made which were subsequently found to be groundless.    The question whethercounsel should be allowed to appear before the Committee was onewhich it seemed right to leave to the Committee to settle; it was hoped that if this were unavoidable any appearances would be for thepurpose of advising witnesses before the Committee rattier thanacting on their behalf.In discussion the point was made that the recent mention in TheSocialist Worker of the names of a Minister and others was based ona letter which had been exposed two years ago as a forgery; and itwas quite wrong that  he Press should have given further currency tothe story without disclosing that fact.    It was important to strike a proper balance betwf en the need to avoid any suggestion of a cover-up and the need to give adequate protection to individual reputations; andthe proposal that the Select Committee should sit in private washelpful in this respect.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should pursue his discussions with the Opposition on the terms of reference and composition of theSelect Committee as proposed, with a view to the Government puttingdown a Motion the following day.    This might necessitate a debate forwhich time would be allowed, probably on Thursday.The Cabinet -1. Took note,, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Home Secretary to proceed accordingly.The Cabinet had before them copies of minutes dated 25 October fromthe Home Secretary and the Lord President of the Council about theproblems associated with completion of this Session&apos;s legislative programme,THE HOME SECRETARY said that, after consultation with the lord privy Seal, the Chief Whip and the Chief Whip, House of Lords, he had concluded that the difficulties in the House of Lords were such that thebest chance of getting all the Governments major Bills throughrelatively unscathed and of depriving the Lords of their excuse for anywrecking of the programme lay in extending the Session to 23 or 24November; and this was the course he recommended.    If the Sessionwere not extended, there seemed no possibility of getting all five majorBills to Royal Assent; indeed, it would not even be possible to take the health Services Bill through Committee in the Lords.    Time had to beallowed not only for commons consideration of Lords&apos; amendmentsbut also for further consideration in each House of any amendments onwhich disagreement persisted.    In order to confine debates onCommons&apos; consideration of Lords&apos; amendments, three supplementaltimetable orders would be needed; and these orders could not be taken until Monday 8 November, and then only if the Government were successful in the by-elections on 4 November.    There was a serious risk that, apart from losing a major Bill, the Government would haveto choose between letting other Bills proceed to Royal Assent in amutilated state or losing them this Session and proceeding under the parliament Act next Session.    The annexes to his minute set out indetail the background information relevant to these problems.    Theother side of the argument, which had also been put forward by theLord President of the Council who doubted whether the attitude of theOpposition would be altered by an extension of the Session and whoattached particular importance to securing a Second Reading of the devolution Bill before Christmas, was that to extend the Session wouldmean cutting down still further the legislative programme for the
following Session, perhaps at the cost of the first priority Bills onConspiracy and Homelessness and certainly at the cost of secondpriority Bills.    It would also delay the passage of a number of urgentBills and would put at severe risk the Governmenfs intention to givea Second Reading to the Devolution Bill before Christmas.    Therewas therefore a balance  of argument.   But in his view, the overridingaim should be to ensure that the Lords were clearly seen to carry theresponsibility for the loss or mutilation of any Bills; and this couldnot be secured without an extension of the Session.In discussion it was argued that the reasons put forward in the lord president of the Council&apos;s minute for not extending the Session had considerable force.    The attitude of the Lords could not be regarded in Isolation from the general political difficulties faced by theGovernment, which the Opposition were anxious to exploit, and itwould be unrealistic to suppose that the Opposition would allow thatattitude to be altered by a short extension of the Session.    The riskof mutilation or loss of Bills would still be present, and it would be preferable for the Government to reintroduce Bills next Session than to allow them to be enacted in an unacceptable form.    On the otherhand, it was argued that, although there could be no certainty aboutthe effect which an extension of the Session would have on the attitudeof the House of Lords, past experience suggested that they would see it as being in their own interest to act with regard to constitutionalproprieties.    The plain fact was that they had been landed with moremajor Bills than they could cope with in the latter part of the Session,and if in consequence a major Bill were lost, the Government wouldbe on weak ground in attributing this to a lack of co-operation whenthey themselves had refuoed to extend the Session.    Moreover, theloss of any major Bill would deal a serious blow to Party morale whichwould be hard to sustain if the public generally, in the light of the congestion of business in the Lords, were ready to attribute this loss and the mutilation of other Bills to mismanagement by the Governmentof their legislative programme.    The Government should thereforedemonstrate that they had done their utmost to secure the passage ofall the major Bills.   But before a final decision was taken to extend the Session, it would be important to see what understandings could bereached with the Opposition in the Lords about the effect which thiswould have on their attitude to future consideration of the remainingBills.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that a large majority of the Cabinet were in favour of extending the Session to23 or 24 November.    The Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, Houseof Lords, should seek to establish with the Opposition the best possibleunderstandings that, if the Session were extended, they would co-operate in securing the passage of all the Governments majorBills and would not pursue wrecking amendments to the limit.    If the
Opposition&apos;s response was unforthcoming the Cabinet would need toconsider the matter further and take a final decision at their meetingon Thursday,    hi the meantime, it was important that no publicindication should be given, in briefing the Press or otherwise, of theGovernment^ readiness to extend the Session,   Against the likelihood that the Session would be extended, Ministers would need to consider further how the Governments business for the next Session might best be arranged In order to secure a Second Reading of the Devolution bill before Christmas and to bring forward at the earliest possible opportunity those Bills which were of high priority or urgency.Consideration Bhould also be given to the possibility of increasing thetime available in the next Session, for example by reducing stillfurther the time allowed for the short Recesses or by reducing thenumber of days normally allocated to major debates.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2,        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(76) 91) covering a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, on the Public Expenditure Survey 1976.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there had beenheavy pressure for panic cuts in public expenditure in the context ofthe recent further fall in the exchange rate, but he was resisting these.It would however be necessary to consider the new short-term economic forecast which would become available in the next day or so,and to agree upon a negotiating position with the international monetary Fund, who were due to arrive the following week.   For theCabinet&apos;s present discussion it was essential that the Governmentshould not exceed the limits laid down in the White Paper of theprevious February (Cmnd 6393) as amended by his statement of22 July last.    Decisons were needed on the public expenditure figuresfor the years 1978-79 to 1980-81 so that work on the next White Papercould proceed with a view to its being published in January,THE CHIEF SECRETARY,  TREASURY, said that the position was setout in the tables appended to the report by the Treasury attached to Msmemorandum.    Tables 1A and IB set out the comparison with theCmnd 6393 figures and showed that the margin between the last white paper and the present position was very narrow - only  105 million in1978-79 and  61 million in 1979-80,   He recommended agreeing to additional expenditure of  94 million in 1978-79 and  117 million in1979-80, but no more.    For 1980-81 there was of course no comparison
with Cmxid 6393.    Table 2 summarised the additional bids, and thefollowing tables categorised those bids under various heads.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider each of the tables 3-7 in turn.Table 3 -Itemsremainingas claims on theContingencyReserve andOtherContingentItemsTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that expenditure on dispersal featured both here and under the last entryin Table 6,    To reverse present dispersal policy would be an importantstep, with repercussions in various partB of the country, and any minister wishing to suggest such a course should put in a paper.    TheTreasury position was that the cost of dispersal should be absorbed inDepartmental spending programmes.   For the moment It was agreedthat the items in Table 3 should be left as a claim on the contingency reserve.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.Table 4 -MajorProgrammeswhere Outturnis relativelyuncontrollableTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would be reportinglater on the two items covered by this table.   He would himself lookwith particular interest at what was proposed on export creditre-finance, on which he was sure something should be done.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.Table 5 -LocalAuthorityCurrentExpenditure(excludingHousing)In discussion it was noted that the major problem on this area of spending was how best to keep the overall total in line with theCmnd 6393 figures.    Current expenditure of the local authorities wasnot under the Governments control, although the Government could offer guidance.    For the purposes of the next White Paper it must beassumed that the figures in Cmnd 6393 would be made to stick,    jheconventions under which the exercise had to be conducted were not always conducive to making the best policy choices.   Thus, in thelast year there had been an additional 50, 000 pupils in further5
education and sixth forms, the total cost of which was some 35 million, offset in part by some  15 million of saving insupplementary benefits.    On the net basis of  400 a head the cost ofproviding further education for these young people was lower than thecost of any alternative scheme for providing employment.    There was however no way under the public expenditure exercise as now set up inwhich Cabinet could form a view on this kind of priority.    However,it was pointed out that education expenditure was in the hands of localauthorities and under the rate support grant system it was notpossible for the Government to dictate the purposes on which the money should be spent.In further discussion ft was noted that the figures in Table 5 for law,order and protective services might be misleading, and there mightbe some incompatibility between the figures in the White Paper andthose in Estimates.    The point should be dealt with bilaterallybetween the Treasury and the Home Office.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Government could only express in the next White Paper ageneral intention to keep local authority current expenditure within thelimits laid down in Cmnd 6393.    The figures to go into the next white paper should therefore be prepared on this basis.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that thefigures in Table 6 for housing were not really additional bids at all,being merely the increased cost - arising from higher interest rates -of maintaining the same housing policies.    He accepted that if more money had to be paid out in interest charges, other public expenditure had to be cut; but he did not accept that those cuts shouldbe concentrated on the housing programme.    The principle went rightacross the board, and he saw no reason why housing should be treatedspecially on this account just because It happened to be possible toincrease the charges (in the form of rents) accruing to the programme.He warned Cabinet that this could mean an addition of  2 a week tocouncil rents.    Were cuts being proposed in other programmes to offset the increase in other public debt?   The matter should be,considered as a broad issue and not as one especially related to housing.
THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he sympathised withthe view which had been put forward; but the truth was that theadditional coetB on the housing programme must be offset either in thehousing programme or elsewhere.    Of the addition of some 450 million a year, about  350 million was attributable to increasedinterest rates, and  100 million to a lower assumption about rent increases.    The figures in Table 6 took no account of the most recent increase In interest rates, since there was no way of telling how longthey would remain at such a high point.    It was reasonable to findwithin the housing programme the savings needed to offset theincreased interest charge; and the logic of the line propounded by theSecretary of State for the Environment was that the remainder of debt interest should be attributed to all other programmes, which should then be cut pro rata.    To transfer the increase in debt interest on housing from the housing programme to the general debt interest linewould cast doubts on the Government&apos;s credibility and the resultantincrease in the public sector borrowing requirement would have to bemet by increased taxation.    He did not accept that it would benecessary to increase council rents by  2 per week.    Instead the savings needed could be made In the following ways,    If rents wereassumed to be increased by 8Op a week, instead of 60p a week, from1 Apjil 1978, this would save about  30 million and only have an effectof 0.08 per cent on the Retail Price Index.    If new housebuilding were kept to the same level in 1978-79 and later years as had been agreed for 1977-78, this would save  150- 200 million a year; and adopting the same principle, savings could be made of  160 million inmortgage lending,  40 million in improvement grants,  20 million inimprovement investment,  40 million in municipalisatlon, and 20 million in housing associations.    This would yield the full amountneeded.In discussion of the possible increase in council rents, it was argued that the maximum increase tolerable was a matter of judgment.   Anincrease of 8Op would be much smaller than that which house ownerswith mortgages would face; but to do more would probably needlegislation.    It was more difficult to know what would be acceptable inthe context of the counter-inflation policy prevailing in 1978.    In anycase, the Government could encourage but could not compel localauthorities to increase rents.    In Scotland no change in rents was likely to be necessary since it was expected that savings would comefrom a reduction in local authority housebuilding programmes as aresult of higher interest rates.    An Increase of more than 8Op inrents could lead to difficulties with the trade unions; but unless theGovernment were seen to be sticking to the White Paper figures thewhole of their economic policies could come apart.    It had to berecognised that an increase in rents could make the negotiation of a third pay round more difficult, although it was unlikely to wreck theprospects of a successful negotiation,
In discussion of the housebuilding programme it was argued that theprogramme was already near to collapse.    If expenditure on house-building were held to the 1977-78 level it would be possible to protect the priority areas but the rest of the programme would be reduced to20 per cent of its level over the past two or three years.    It was notedthat the construction Industry had the highest unemployment of any industry in the country; and that housebuilding was a very sensitiveissue with Labour local councils.    There was a case particularly inScotland for reducing expenditure on roads rather than housing.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the additional expenditure of  450 million ayear on housing had to be offset in some way.    On balance, they were agreed that an increase in council rents of 80p from 1 April 1978 wouldbe acceptable, and this would save some  30 million.    It should not however be annourced in the White Paper.    The Secretary of State forthe Environment had indicated in discussion that he would be preparedto reduce mortgage lending by  150 million a year gross, but onlyproviding it would be possible to agree to amend the presentation ofpublic expenditure figures in such a way as to exclude lending by thebuilding societies to local authorities.    In Scotland housebuilding was already falling, and the Secretary of State for Scotland wouMprefer to take cuts on roads expenditure rather than reduce housingfurther; but the responsible Secretary of State in England could not commit himself to this alternative.   He did not think that the Cabinetconld usefully pursue the question of finding other offsetting savingsfurther at that meeting; and he noted that there was still outstandingthe question of an excess in 1977-78.    He suggested that the chief secretary, Treasury, should consider what other proposals he might bring forward for offsetting the excess housing expenditure; and thatthe Secretary of State for the Environment should consider further theproposals which the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had put forward attheir meeting.    The Cabinet would then consider the matter further on a later occasion.The Cabinet -4.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he was prepared to withdraw that part of his additional bid which related to public holidays, nurses&apos; training (the Briggs Report) and improvementin methods of treatment.    But he did not feel able to withdraw his bidfor  93 million in 1980-81 which was the product of demographic8%
change. To erclude it from the provision for 1980-81 would be to imply that the Government intended to bring about a decline in thelevel of services for old people.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that any figures which were entered for 1980*81 werenecessarily highly provisional.    The best solution would be to enter the lower figures for 1980-81 tor this programme, but to add a footnotethat they were subject to increase in the light of the demographicprojections.The Cabinet -5.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that some minoramendment of the figures had been agreed between officials in his department and the Treasury, covering mineworkers&apos; pensions and theneed for coke-stocking aid.    In his view the provision for the JointResearch Centre should not rest upon Department of Energy Votes, but should be carried elsewhere.    The expenditure was something towhich the Government was committed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that the expenditure on the Joint Research Centre, onpit closures, and on the Redundant MineworkerB&apos; Pensions Scheme,would all have to be accepted as additions to the figures.    The other items under this heading should all be treated as claims on the contingency Reserve.    The Secretary of State for Energy should giveparticular attention to the expenditure on fuel efficiency to ensure matit was well spent.The Cabinet -6.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.9
This item was not discussed because of the absence abroad of theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet h a c  opted that the expenditure on the Maternity Fund wasunavoidable and would have to be accepted.The Cabinet -7.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that provision should be made of  10 million a year onaccount of the items in this table, which would then be left to bediscussed separately.The Cabinet -0.        Took note, with approval^ of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had now covered most ofthe ground in the Chief Secretary, TreasuryS memorandum; but theywere still lacking sufficient savings to offset the increased expenditureon housing; and they had yet to deal with the fulfilment of theGovernments commitment to finding more money for the national enterprise Board and for selective assistance to industry, which wouldbe discussed the following week in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic and Industrial Policy.    The Cabinet would have to resumeconsideration of these matters at a later meeting.    The Cabinet had also noted that the depreciation of sterling made it difficult for theSecretary of State for Defence to keep Me estimates for 1977-78 in line with the Cmnd 6393 figures.    However the Secretary of State for defence should proceed on the basis that this must be done.
The Cabinet -9, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.3.        The Cabinet discussed public expenditure in 1977-78.    This!&quot;URE        discussion is recorded separately.Cabinet Office26 October 197611
document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government copy no        *JfcabinetLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 28th Conclusions, Minute 3Tuesday 26 October 1976 at 10.00 am the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that Cabinet had been discussing ways of keeping the public expenditure figures for 1978-79and later years within those laid down in Cmnd 6393.  In his view there was need for contingency work to be done on a possible furtherpackage affecting also 1977-78, in a way which would leave theGovernment some room for choosing priorities.    In the next day or so he would be receiving the latest short-term economic forecasts, andIt was possible that these might point to the need for some further expenditure cuts in the near future. If only to relieve the strain on industrial policy from the present high interest rates.    Furthermore,the team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would bearriving the following week.   He proposed to put suggestions to the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy about new measures matmight be needed and about the way in which the negotiations with theIMF should be conducted, including the concessions we might make and what our sticking points should be.    In the course of the next month Cabinet would need both to complete the consideration of public expenditure they had begun that day and to take any further decisionsneeded to stem the pressure on the pound and to meet whatever termsmight be negotiated with the IMF.    To this end it would be useful Ifofficials of the Treasury and the spending Departments could discussthe possible scope for further public expenditure savings, preferably in areas not previously explored.    The aim would be to identify whatwas technically feasible, leaving decisions to be taken later by ministers.    He was not at present able to say what scale of reductionsmight be required.In discussion it was argued that, in any further reductions, regardwould have to be had to the credibility of the Governments industrial policy.    The Government laid great emphasis on priority for industrial investment, but were in fact supporting industry less than their predecessors.    It was likely that the next investment intentions surveywould show a fall, because of high interest rates.    The Department of;*k*ture^-78
Industry programme had been cut by  160 million in July; and therewere now ruggeetions that there should be reductions in such areas asRegional Development Grants,    Unless the Governmenfs industrial policy were really given priority, there was little hope for providing the new jobs which were essential if the Government was to stick by thesocial contract.    On the other hand, it was argued that it would be wrong to isolate industrial strategy from the Governments totaleconomic strategy.    Industry would get the advantage of massive tax relief and the massive depreciation which had taken place in theexchange rate.    The main reason why further cuts in public expenditure might be needed was because a slowing down of the economy would lead to an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement; on the other hand more deflation would increaseunemployment and produce a ratchet effect,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that officials should undertake an exercise to identifyareas in which reductions in public expenditure in 1977-78 mighttechnically be possible.    Ministers would be in no way committed bythis exercise and it would be for Cabinet to take the policy decisions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister fssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office27 October 1976
