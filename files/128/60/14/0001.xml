^RLUmEntARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.1
^ElGN 2 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said*AXRg that a compromise agreement had been reached at Geneva on thes question of the independence date.    Although it would be necessaryAf^i  rn to return to this subject later, the compromise had made it possibleto move on to discussion of the form and structure of the interimadministration.    Mr Richard had held a round table meeting onthis subject with all delegations on 1 December and there was to be another today.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said hewould be announcing in the House on 2 December our willingnessin principle to play some direct role in Rhodesia during the interim period, but that we could not determine exactly what that roleshould be until we saw what emerged from the negotiations.    he proposed to leave open until early next week a decision on what moreshould be said about this, in order to see first what came out ofthe discussions in Geneva over the next four days.    At present thesigns were relatively good.    The two main questions however stillwere whether Mr Mugabe really wanted a settlement and whether mr Smith would be prepared to settle on any basis which the nationalists could accept.    In the wider context of Southern Africa,a Rhodesia settlement was one of three elements.    The secondwas Namibia which he had expected would go better than Rhodesia,but on which there was little sign of movement so far.    Butprogress on Namibia was a pre-condition of any progress on thethird and main problem of South Africa itself.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the dinner for Heads ofGovernment at the European Council President Giscard d&apos;Estaingof France had pressed him to agree that Britain should take a muchmore active part in Rhodesia In view of the importance of reaching a settlement,    Herr Schmidt, the Federal German Chancellor, had asked whether a Rhodesian settlement would buy time for SouthAfrica or result in South Africa coming under increased pressure;Herr Schmidt himself thought it would buy time.    The Prime minister had said, and President Giscard bad agreed, that he believed itwould result in increased pressure.    The Prime Minister had suggested that the European Economic Community should work out an agreed position on South Africa.    This would be particularly important in view of the fact that France, Germany and the UnitedKingdom would all be members of the Security Council next year.It had been agreed that officials Bhould be asked to work out a jointstrategy for consideration by Foreign Ministers,The Cabinet -1.       Took note of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had little to add to the statement  which he had made in the House of Commons the previous day onCo., the meeting of the European Council in The Hague onfyT011 29-30 November.    He had been able successfully to deflect0 November     criticism of the Green Pound to criticism of structural agriculturalsurpluses.    On the North/South Dialogue there had been divergentviews with the French in particular sympathising with the developing countries but Herr Schmidt had insisted cn a hard line.    agreement had been reached on a declaration by the Council on trade betweenthe European Economic Community and Japan and it was to be hopedthat constructive discussions could start soon with the Japanese.The Tindemans Report had been given a decent burial.    And the review of the Commission had been set in hand.    But beyond these particular points what had struck him most about the operation ofthe Council in this and in previous meetings was the fact that at itspresent stage of development, and with the strong anti-interventionistviews in particular of Herr Schmidt, who probably seemed mqreconfident about the development of the German economy than he infact was, the Community was not in a position to deal with theeconomic and monetary problems which faced it.    This was a problem to which the Cabinet might at some future stage return.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.3
3.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord President of the Council (CP(76) 120) to which was attached the draft ox a consultative document on devolution and England.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the immediatepurpose of the document was to help with the passage of the Scotlandand Wales Bill by making it clear that the Government were aware that devolution to Scotland and Wales had implications for Englandand that they were ready to listen to views about future arrangements in England.    The draft before the Cabinet did not containcommitments but aimed to remove misconceptions about the scopeof the proposals for Scotland and Wales, to expose the options forchange in England and to test English opinion generally.    TheGovernment were committed to issuing the document before SecondReading of the Scotland and Wales Bill and publication should therefore take place the following week.In a brief discussion, it was pointed out that the only two possibleforms of change that were ruled out in the document - an EnglishAssembly and regional assemblies with legislative powers on theScottish model - had few adherents and were open to clear andporsuasive objections.    Possibilities discussed included regional assemblies on the Welsh model; regional authorities as a tier oflocal government; improved regional advisory bodies; and somereform of local government within the existing structure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the draft contained no Government proposals orcommitments.    The question of what action, if any, shouldultimately be taken would come back to them later.    They approved the draft for publication before Second Reading of the Scotland andWales Bill.    Any minor drafting amendments should be sent to theLord President by 10. 00 am on the following day.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2,      Invited the Lord President of the Councilto arrange publication accordingly.Solution * E^Hshfusion

The next step was to seek an agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to obtain the loan.    Theyhad to consider what adjustments should be made in their existingstrategy; and whether those adjustments would satisfy the IMF andthe markets.    The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)must be cut below the forecast level, not only because this was whatthe IMF wanted, but because it would be impossible to finance it without either severe inflation - which could cause a collapse ofconfidence - or a level of interest rates so high as to cripple Britishindustry.    A high PSBR was inflationary, and all foreign government and many friends of the United Kingdom overseaswould reject the view that to cut it was to take deflationary action.Our potential creditors regarded the present PSBR ae inconsistent with credit-worthiness.    In his view what was needed was an adjustment in 1977-78 of  l  billion, of which  500 million would befound by the sale of British Petroleum (BP) shares and the balanceby a net reduction of  1 billion in public expenditure, composed of a
larger gross cut offset by some additional expenditure! to assistindustry and stimulate employment.    The nature of the reduction should be such as to produce a cut of  l  billion in 1978-79, whichwould then leave a further      billion to be found in that year either from tax adjustments or from further public expenditure cuts.    Suchaction would produce a PSBR. in 1977 -7 8 of   8.7 billion; would reduce the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1977 byone half per cent below the forecast, while allowing GDP to increase by 3^ per cent in 1978; it would add one-half per cent to the RetailFries Index; and would reduce the balance of payments deficit in1977 to  1 billion, and lead to a surplus in 1978 of  2f-fi3 billion.Its effect on unemployment would be to increase it above the presentforecast by 30, 000 by the end of 1977, and by 110, 000 by the end of1978, but he would propose that these effects should be offset bymicro-economic measures.    In tfca view of the IMF, if an adequatepackage were agreed and announced, its effect upon interest ratesand upon confidence would be such as to mean that the net effect ofthe package would not be deflationary, remembering that interest rates affected levels of stock-building, investment, house-building and the sale of consumer durables, as well as the whole tone of the economy - there could, for example, be a fall in personal savings.He did not necessarily go all the way with the IMF on this, but was satisfied that mere would bo some such effect.    Certainly anythingless than his proposal would not restore confidence, even if it were possible to persuade the IMF to accept it.    He appreciated that anyforecasts contained great uncertainties, and if the Treasury forecastwas shown by events to be too pessimistic, he would be ready to feeddemand back into the economy through income tax reductions in thenext two budgets.    It was his opinion that in any case there wouldhave to be income tax cuts, at least at the top and bottom ends of thescale, in 1977, financed if necessary by increases in indirect taxationor by some cuts in public expenditure with little demand content.There was much resentment among the low paid over the narrow gap between pay in work and social security benefits.    It was by nomeans certain that the IMF would agree to his proposals, but hehopad that agreement might be rtas.cb.ed through negotiation.    He was clear that there was no hope of selling any lesser package.    If anagreement could be reached, then the United Kingdom would not onlyget the loan but would also almost certainly get the benefit of aninternational arrangement to cover the sterling balances, and perhapsalso international acquiescence in the introduction of import depositsif that was what Cabinet wanted.    He had doubts about the value ofthe last, particularly because of the effect upon the PSBR when it came to be unwound.    If imported goods required for United Kingdommanufacturing industry were excluded, it might be possible to persuade the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) reluctantly toaccept such a scheme, the inclusion of which in the package wasattractive for political reasons.    He reminded Cabinet that the risks2
arising from a failure to reach, an agreement with, the IMF were far greater than the small economic advantages which would flow froma smaller package.    It was essential for the Government to providethsmeieJvcs with some leeway in order to avoid any risk of the need of a further package later.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he believed that the country was better informed about the nature of the problems they faced than was sometimes thought.    He himself had earlier been uncertainwhzit was the best course to adopt and had profited from thediscussions they had had; but the time had now come to take decisions , and he hud been asked to make his position clear.    the issues involved political, economic and financial judgments of a difficult character.    The package proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would probably have an adverse effect both on theGovernment&apos;8 supporters in the House of Commons and on the tradeunions; but not, he would judge, on the public at large.    the reaction of Labour MPs would, however, be important: the chief whip had advised him that it was imperative to refrain from public expenditure cuts which involved legislation since the passage ofsuch legislation through the House of Commons could not be guaranteed.    Nevertheless he himself supported the proposal tofind cuts of  1 billion in public expenditure.    This would lead toan early reduction in interest rates which was psychologicallyimportant.    He also agreed that income tax rates should be cut at both the top and bottom of the scale and believed there would bosupport in the country for that.   He drew attention to the fact thatif Cabinet agreed to cuts of  1 billion they would later have tosettle the composition of such cuts and this could mean difficultchoices, eg between reductions in capital spending which would killthe construction industries or taking action to reduce future increases in social security benefits.    The statutory requirement thatupratings of benefits should be in line with movements in eitherwages or prices, whichever was the highor, had meant that the pensioners had improved their position relative to the workers inthe last two yearB, and there was a good case in logic for treatingthe pensioner no better than the worker in future upratings; but ithad to be appreciated that in putting such a proposal to the House ofCommons the Government would be putting their own life to the test.No agreement had so far been reached with the IMF.   He and theChancellor had met Dr Witteveen, the Director General of the IMF,who had come to London the previous day in a somewhat unyieldingframe of mind, still adhering to the view that there should be a cut of  l - 2 billion in public expenditure in 1977-78.    There wastherefore still some way to go before agreement could be reached.He had, Bince the Cabinet last discussed the matter, been in touchboth with the Chancellor of West Germany and with President Ford3
of the United States, and had received assurances that anarrangement on the sterling balances would be likely to benegotiable if agreement could ba reached with the IMF on the loan.He had mentioned to both of them, without any commitment, thepossibility of Introducing a scheme of import deposits because,aVchough he recognised the strength of the argument against such ascheme, it could be politically very helpful domestically.    He notedthe importance of finding ways of strengthening the industrialstrategy.    Finally he emphasised to his colleagues the gravity ofthe decision confronting them.    If the Government agreed upon apackage, presented it to the House of Commons, and foiled to carry it there, the life of the Government would be at an end.    On theother hand, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposal was rejected, then in his view the attitude of even friendly overseas governments and the effect on the market would be such that therewas no chance of the Government surviving anyway.    Both the life of the Government and the very heart of the Labour movement were involved in the decision which they now had to take.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that in his view theproposal put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not acceptable.    In the summer the Cabinet had agreed to certainpolicy changes on the grounds mat they would avoid the need to goto the IMF for a loan.    The Cabinet must certainly not be preparedto accept the need for a loan at any price.    For a Labour Governmentthe whole perspective had been altered by the Treasury forecastthat unemployment would rise to l  million by the end of 1977.This meant increases in unemployment month by month throughoutthe whole of the coming year unless some policy changes were adopted.    Yet the proposals put forward by the Chancellor of theExchequer would actually add to this forecast of l  million.    Thiswas politically quite intolerable and even if the Cabinet were ableto win the acceptance of the Party in the near future, they would undoubtedly lose it at a later stage.   Equally he found unacceptablethe proposal that income tax should be cut at the top end of the scaleat a time when the uprating of social security benefits was to be cutback and unemployment allowed to rise.    This would run contraryto the egalitarian basis of the pay policy and the leaders of thetrade unions would either reject it or would themselves be destroyedby their own members.    On the proposal to reduce the uprating of social security benefits, he was in no doubt that a large section ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party would oppose it, and there couldbe no greater humiliation than either to be defeated on such an issueor to carry it with the help of Opposition votes.    In his view therewas no hope of carrying Buch a proposal and it should be dropped.It might be true that the country would take a different view from theParty, but the country was being misled by a Press which wasbitterly hostile to the Labour Government.    It was more important4
that the Labour movement should hold together than that they shouldstay in Government although he wanted also to do the latter.    InhiB view a new package of proposals should be worked out, on thebasis of those which had been put forward in the minute from theSecretary of State for Education and Science, which might include some cuts in roads expenditure and some saving from tax relief on mortgage interest.    This should then bo put to the IMF andargued for strongly.    If agreement could not bo reached theGovernment would then have to consider contingency measures,such as import controls (on which no final decision had been taken the previous day).    Even if the IMF turned it down, a non-deflationary programme at least put the Government in a reputablesituation in the coming months, so that even if they found themselves in opposition they would not have conceded the case for higher unemployment or lower social security benefits.    Ir.his view the Government could not possibly survive on the basisof the proposals before Cabinet,    They should sustain policies which were related to their beliefs, even if this meant they did not get the loan.In the ensuing discussion all the other members of Cabinetexpressed their views on the proposals which had been put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    In the course of this, thefollowing additional points were made -a. The Prime Ministers statement was an important new factor, both because it reflected his own judgment of thesituation and because the consequences for the Party andfor the country would be very serious if it became known that proposals supported by both the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had been rejected by theCabinet.b. The purpose of any adjustments would be to ease the problem of financing the large PSBR; but since misinvolved the risk of deflation, it should be made clear atthe time an announcement was made that any excessdeflation which emerged would be offset by tax reductions,assistance to industry or measures to combat unemployment.It was also suggested that in such circumstances there mightbe a reversal of some of the public expenditure cuts: but against this it was argued that if the IMF aim of a PSBRof  6j billion in 1978-79 were to be achieved it would notbe open to the Government to make such easements in1977.5
c. The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom at. 9 per cent wat higher than that in Germany, France orSweden and was only one-half per cent behind that of theUnited States and Canada.    Since the Government took office unemployment had increased by 2. 8 per cent - the biggest rise in any industrialised country.    The proposals in the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment(CP(76) 119) had been designed with the forecast of a rise to million in mind; they would be inadequate if theChancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals wero adopted,leading tc even higher unemployment.    Any possibility of persuading the TUC and the CBI to adopt such arrangements as work sharing would vanish.d. An uprating in 1977 related to the movement in earnings rather than prices might be welcomed by trade unionists, but the Government could well be defeated on itin the House.    Not all social security benefits were as high as was sometimes imagined.    For example, if earnings-related benefit and tax refund - which were available onlyto about one in four of unemployed persons - were put on one side, unemployment benefit for a single man was only 12 a week, for a married man  21 a week, and for a married man with two children  27 a week.    These werenot large payments, and with inflation going up over thenext year it would be appalling to contemplate restricting the uprating.e. It was suggested that the difference between theproposal put forward at the previous meeting by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and that now put forward bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer was not a fundamental one.On the other hand it was argued that the extra      billionwould involve doing things which were socially intolerable.The Labour Party was a party of high taxation, high public expenditure and high transfer payments: and it should notbe assumed that the Government&apos;e supporters would beprepared to abandon these basic beliefs in order to makecuts which were economically unjustified.    Income taxreductions at the top end of the scale would also meanreversing the egalitarian element in the social contract.The Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals were a crisisplan, based on Treasury forecasts which had consistentlybeen wrong, and founded on a monetary theory which theLabour Party did not accept.6
f.       The Cabinet thought that they had made sufficientreductions ir July in order to restore external confidence,and it was a matter of deep regret that they were now facing the need for doing more.    This must however be the finalsuch package of the Parliament or the Government would beplaced in a hopeless position.    It was therefore essentialto err on the side of doing too much rather than too littlewith the prospect of easing up later on if they had done too much.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that onimport deposits a number of doubts had been expressed by membersof Cabinet and there was no question of taking a decision on mat atthe present meeting.    He had himself taken soundings on this withcertain Heads of Government so that, if the Cabinet wished toinclude it, they would know whether it would be likely to be acceptable; but equally the Cabinet need not proceed with the ideaif on mature consideration they did not wish to do so.    Its initialimpact on the public sector borrowing requirement was howeververy helpful and it could make the whole package more acceptable to the Trades Union Congress.    On the major issue before Cabinet -tho reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement which theyshould put as their offer to the IMF - the majority took the viewthat in order to get the loan there should be adjustments of if billion in 1977-78 which the Chancellor had said should leadto one of  2 billion in 1978-79*    There were however differences of view within this majority over the best composition of such an adjustment, and over the reasons why it should be made.    At thesame time there was a group of members of Cabinet who regardeda  lj billion cut as unacceptable, and for whom some elements insuch a total would be repellent.    That group was, however, a minority, and the majority felt that the Chancellor of the exchequer should have authority to offer to the IMF a reduction of  l  billionin 1977-78.    In doing this the Chancellor would have it in mind that 500 million would be realised in 1977-78 by the sole of 3P shares,and the balance of the rest made up mainly by public expenditure cuts.    There were some members of Cabinet who would want alarger tax element in the total: this was something which cabinet would need to discuss further the following week, though the wrongcomposition might mean that the markets would not be convinced of the adequacy of the package.   He stressed that all that was being agreed was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should put his proposal to the Fund.    A final decision would be taken by cabinet after the results of this approach to the Fund were known, and whenthe whole package could be seen in its entirety.7
The Cabinet nTook note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssurnming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office3 December 19768
