1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary (CP(76) 110) on the Britishrole in Rhodesia during the interim period,THE PRIME MINISTER said that there bad been a preliminary discussion of the subject in the Ministerial Group on Southern Africa.Opinion bad been fairly evenly divided on the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposals.    Some Ministers hadargued that the risks and consequences of a breakdown for which wewould be blamed were such as to justify a limited move on the lines proposed.   As against this, there was a substantial view that once we had made a move it would be difficult to avoid furtherinvolvement and that we should therefore refuse to do so, even ifthis resulted in our being blamed for a breakdown.   All those present had agreed that, if we were to play a role in Rhodesiaduring the interim period, it should go no further than proposedin paragraphs 9 and 11 of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary1^memor andum.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theposition in Geneva was that either there would be agreement on theindependence date in the next few days or, if there was not, theChairman would, on his instructions, adjourn the talks for a week or ten days.    In either case, a decision had to be made on theBritish role during the interim period.    He was convinced thatthere would have to be a British presence of some kind.    We hada continuing responsibility under the 1961 Constitution, which hadbeen recognised by successive British Governments.    Publicopinion would not expect or want us to wash our hands of this,African Governments, the Commonwealth Secretary General andothers, all considered that a solution of this issue would determine whether the conference broke down or not.    This was because ofthe fundamental distrust by the Black Nationalists of Mr Smith andthe African view that, without a British presence, Mr Smith mighttry to back out of any agreement reached at Geneva.    If theconference were to break down in circumstances in which we wereblamed, we should lose our influence and goodwill in Black Africa;relations with our European partners would be soured; the effecton our relations with the United States would be disastrous; andthere would be an escalation of the guerilla war, with the south africans coming in on one side and the Cubans on the other, whichwould make a shambles of Rhodesia.    We should thus be facedwith everything which, when embarking on the present initiative,we had hoped to avoid.    He ruled out any possibility of sendingBritish forces or officials to Rhodesia, or of assuming direct orsole responsibility for maintaining law and order.    Moreover, ifwe were to agree to a British presence, it would have to be madeabsolutely clear that it would be withdrawn if the interim government1
should break down.    Subject to these points, he proposed that theoffer of a British presence should be made on the conditions thatguerilla activity should cease as soon as the interim governmenthad been established;  sanctions should be lifted when the interim government was legalised;  and the cost of the British presenceshould be borne by the interim government.    On these conditionshe proposed that we should offer to provide a British representativewho would play an active part in negotiating the independenceconstitution and act as the chairman of the constitutional conference.The British representative would have responsibility for externalaffairB under the 1961 Constitution and would have ultimate responsibility for defence and Internal security which would extend to exercising a veto over certain appointments and dismissals inthe armed forces and having power to convene a meeting ofMinisters in the event of a major threat to law and order, at whichhe might have a casting vote.    It would only be acceptable fox theBritish representative to exercise this ultimate responsibilityprovided that either a Council of State was established with executive responsibility in the fields of defence and law and order or agreement was reached in Geneva on the identity of the ministers who would exercise day to day responsibility in these two fields.The Commonwealth Secretary General had suggested that thereshould be some symbolic Commonwealth presence in support ofthe British representative and that this might take the form ofmilitary advisers from, say, Canada, India and Nigeria,    Thiswas a helpful suggestion.    There was no certainty that a packageon the lines he had proposed would secure agreement.     What was certain, however, was that if we were not prepared to offersomething on these lines, the conference would break down.    Therewere serious risks and he understood the argument that if we wereto go this far we would be pressed to go further.    The risks couldbe minimised if we declared in advance the limits of what we wereprepared to offer.    We would then be In a position to claim thatour offer was a reasonable one and, if we could do this, the pressures on us would be much reduced.In discussion it was argued that while we should be very cautiousabout extending our involvement, it was crucially important thatthe Geneva conference should be given every chance of success.We had continuing responsibility for Rhodesia: and it would be quite wrong for us not to take such steps as lay within our power to achieve a peaceful settlement.    Furthermore this issue was notirrelevant to the discussion which the Cabinet would Bhortly behaving about the loan from the International Monetary Fund: if other countries were prepared to help us in our economic difficultiesthis was at least partly because we stood for something in the world and fulfilled our responsibilities.    The African Presidents were aware of the limitations of British power.    They knew we could not2
send troops and did not want us to do so.    But they looked to usto take the lead and provide the focal point on which success or failure might turn.    Furthermore the consequences of failurejustified our taking some risks: indeed if we did not accept aBritish role we would still face serious risks but without any ofthe opportunities.    There would however be advantage in some form of a Commonwealth presence alongside our own if this could he achieved.   Although we could not guarantee success and might in the end be forced to pull out and admit failure, it would beshameful to do so at this stage.It was however pointed out that we should have considerabledifficulty in securing fulfilment of the condition that guerillaactivity must cease.    Indeed the people with whom we would benegotiating a British presence might not themselves have thepower to call off this activity completely.    We should certainlyensure that our requirement was understood and accepted by theNationalist participants in the interim government as well as bythe African Presidents.    We should insist on a public statementfrom Presidents Nyerere, Kaunda and Seretse Khama, thoughprobably not from President Machel, as well as from theNationalist leaders in Geneva, that they would take active steps to discourage the continuation of guerilla activity.    But even withsuch a statement the condition could not be an absolute one,,Whether any continuation of guerilla activity would make itnecessary to withdraw the British presence would depend on thescale.    Giver, the circumstances we would not be able to prevent a continuation of minor activity on a sporadic basis.Against a British presence it was argued that its objectives couldonly be achieved by a major exercise of power which we could not and should not exercise.    It was no good saying that we should puta British representative in Rhodesia in charge of defence and then,when Rhodesian troops were fired on, pulling him out.   Inevitably,a British presence would result in Rhodesian politics becomingBritish politics and we should be increasingly involved, withprobable detriment to our relations with Black Africa.    there could even be a risk that a British Commander in Chief would findhimself in command of White Rhode sian forces against Black Africanswhich would be both politically and militarily unacceptable.    Wewere already on a slippery slope in that the Cabinet was preparedto admit that we could not make the cessation of guerilla activity an absolute condition of a British presence.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said many ofthe Cabinet had earlier been opposed to the idea of a British presence in the interim government.    There was however now a large majority in the Cabinet that felt that, provided we could secure the right3
conditions, the risks could be minimised and should be run in thehope of achieving a lasting settlement.    The Cabinet were accordingly prepared to endorse the Foreign and Commonwealth5ecretary&apos;s proposals on the lines of paragraphs 9 and 11 of his memorandum, on the clear understanding that what was involvedwas the presence of an individual British representative and not amilitary force.    But, before we finally committed ourselves tothis, there must be agreement on the structure of the interim government and the conditions laid down in paragraph 7 of thememorandum must be fulfilled.    Ja particular we should make itclear both in Geneva and to the African Presidents that if the interim administration broke down the British representativewould be withdrawn and that the sole purpose of the British presencewas to assist in the movement towards independence by March 1978.We should state publicly that this was why we were prepared toaccept a role in Rhodesia during the interim period.    The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should consider the best tacticalmethod of presenting our offer and securing acceptance of theconditions under which it was made.The Cabinet -1.

The Cabinetfaced a very serious question: did they think that they could andshould afford to pay the price the IMF were asking for a loan; andif not, what were the consequences ?   If they failed to reach agreementwith the IMF, the Government faced the risk of the exchange ratefalling out of control, with reserves totally inadequate for thepurposeb of intervention, with implications for prices and unemploy-ment which could break the partnership between the Government andthe unions.    On the other hand, if an agreement were reached on thelines at present envisaged by the IMF, this too could strain theGovernment&apos;s relationship with the trade union movement beyondbreaking point and put the Social Contract at risk.    The situation was not made easier by the need to take very early decisions.    Heenjoined upon his colleagues mat if they rejected one course theymust be ready to consider what the alternative might be.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the situation wasvery difficult, but it would be worse if the negotiations broke down.The IMF supported the Government1 s broad economic strategy; butthe difficulty was that the Government would be unable to financeeither the internal or external deficit over the next year without theloan.    The present position with the Fund was as follows.    In theview of the Fimd staff, the objective should be to get the public Bee torborrowing requirement (PSBR) down to  6^ billion in 1978-79, whichwould mean a cut of  3 billion on the present forecast.    For 1977-78the present forecast was  10  billion and the IMF would like to see
this reduced to something lower than  9 billion, although he believed that it would probably be possible through negotiation toget them to accept  9 billion.    That meant a total reduction of l  billion;  and if  ^ billion could be obtained by the sale of some british Petroleum shares, this would leave a further  1 billion tofind.    He thought that the IMF would want this to be obtained almost wholly by public expenditure reductions.    The further reduction in1978*79 would be assisted by the fact that the reduction in 1977-78would lead to reduced debt interest payments the following year tothe extent of some   j billion.   A further  ^ billion could be secured by adoption of his proposals for changes in the present export creditarrangements (but this would reduce the PSBR in 1977-78 only by 100 million).    He shared the Fund&apos;s view that the more whichcould be done in 1977-78, so the better the effect on confidencewould be, the easier the position in 1978-79 would become, and theless would be the risk of having to take a further bite at public expenditure.    The proposals would mean that the gross domestic product (GDP) would grow at some 1-1^ per cent in 1977-78, and3^-4 per cent in 1978-79.    The lower PSBR would lead to a fall ininterest rates, which would help investment.    It would mean theaddition of about 70, 000 to unemployment at the end of 1977-78,over and above the if million already forecast.    The balance ofpayments would be in surplus on current account by the second halfof 1977, instead of in 1978 as forecast on present policies.    he pointed out that if events proved that the Treasury forecast was toopessimistic, it would be possible to feed demand into the economy bytax cuts in the 1977 Budget,    In his view the desirable deadline foran announcement about the IMF loan would be 7 December (beforethe present standby had to be repaid on 9 December), or at worst on15 December, so that the Parliamentary Debate could take place before Christmas.    It was therefore a matter of some urgency toreach agreement with the IMF on the target size for the PSBR, and very broadly on the extent to which it would be achieved throughtaxation or through expenditure adjustments.    He reminded hiscolleagues that, if negotiations with the IMF failed, there was nohope of obtaining bilateral aid from other countries; whereas if agreement were reached there was a real possibility of getting anagreement on the sterling balances which could be announcedsimultaneously.    The adjustment he was proposing would be painfulbut it would be made with the full endorsement of the IMF and our major allies.   It could transform our international position and havea very important effect on domestic confidence.2
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theproposed reduction in the PSBR in 1977-78 could not be defended onany reasonable grounds.    In terms of resource allocation there was clearly no need to release further resources for exports whilounemployment was so high.    In terms of the financial argument -that the Government would be unable to finance the prospectivePSBR - no outside forecast of the 1977-78 PSBR was as high as thatof the Treasury, and the National Institute  or Economic and SocialResearch had recently reduced their estimate to  8. 3 billion.    this estimate would be published at about the same time as the announce-ment of the proposed measures.    In terms of achieving a surpluson the balance of payments, it was clear that present policies would achieve that surplus in 1978, and the only effect of the IMF proposals would be to bring that improvement forward into the latter part of1977,    In terms of the industrial strategy, the effect of the lowerinterest rates which would flow from the IMF proposals if implementedwould be as nothing compared with the effect upon productive industry of the increase in unemployment and the reduction of the growth rate to something not much above zero.    In terms of the Social Contract,there was absolutely nothing to be said for the proposal.    The case for a reduction in public expenditure had not been made out;  and therewas an impressive body of opinion among economists of all politicalshades against *such a move.    Further public expenditure cuts wouldhave a disastrous effect upon the public service unions, and theSocial Contract would certainly break down as far as the public sector was concerned.    In the Parliamentary Labour Partyopposition would come not only from the left wing but also from the manifesto Group.    On the other hand he accepted that theGovernment faced the question of maintaining market confidence,and for that reason alone, even though they might mink furtherdeflationary steps otherwise wrong, it might be necessary to take some action.    He therefore suggested, as an alternative to theChancellor of the Exchequer^ proposal, that the Government shouldtell the IMF that they would be prepared to reduce the prospectivePSBR in 1977 -78 to  9^ billion, ie a cut of  1 billion which would bemade up as follows;  tj billion from the sale of British Petroleumshares;    j billion from cuts of a kind which had no effect on demandor employment; and S.\ billion from real cuts in public expenditure.The IMF should be left in no doubt that the consequences of pressing for more could only be to drive the Government into a protectionistattitude with serious implications for the future of the e.c. and for world trade.    The United Kingdom&apos;8 weakness was in fact its strength, as long as the Government kept their nerve, since the IMFcould not afford not to make the loan available.In discussion there was considerable support for the point of viewput forward by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.    It was argued that the Government simply could not face publishing a forecast figure of 1^ million for unemployment at the same time asthey were announcing measures which would add to, not reduce, that figure.    There would be no hope of trade union co-operation in such3
a situation.    Nor was there any prospect that the Government couldobta&amp;ft the approval of the House of Commons for the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer^ proposals.    In particular, the suggestion that thenext uprating of social security benefits should be reduced oreliminated - a proposal which would require legislation - would be quite impossible to carry in the House, save perhaps as part of sometotally new policy such as a 12 months freeze on wages and prices.There was no economic ground on which such a deflationary changeof policy could be justified and it would split the Labour Party anddestroy the Governmenfs relationship with the trade unions.    TheGovernment needed more time in order to consult the Trades UnionCongress (TUC), the National Executive Committee of the LabourParty and the Parliamentary Labour Party.    To agree to what theIMF had proposed, if Cabinet did not believe that prescription to be right, would be a betrayal of the national interest and would damagenational confidence.    If the Government believed their present policies were right, they should say so and make it clear that, if other countries were not prepared to help, then the United kingdom would be ready to defend herself, if need bv by adopting an alternativestrategy involving import controls.    Nevertheless, there was abroad measure of agreement that it was necessary for the UnitedKingdom to get the loan and for this reason it was essential that theGovernment should go back to the IMF to seek to negotiate more acceptable terms.    At the same time the Prime Minister should perhaps take the matter up with the Heads of friendly governments,to impress upon them the seriousness with which the Cabinet viewed the IMF position, and to solicit any help they could offer.Against this it was questioned whether there was any viable alterna-tive to the Chancellor^ proposals.    Furthermore it was argued that, quite apart from the IMF terms, some reduction in the PSBRwas essential and that it would be better to go for a figure ofSLBj billion in order to obtain the maximum advantage from it.    Ithad to be remembered that it was not only the IMF which had to be persuaded to accept some less drastic figure; there was also thequestion of market opinion.    Unless the agreement reached wasone which carried conviction with the markets, it would be of nouse.   Economic policy had for years been mistaken because it had placed too great an emphasis on arguments about resources.    the truth was that the Government was facing the question of its ownsurvival.    If a PSBR of  85 billion in 1977-78 was right, then theGovernment should set out to get the support for it of theParliamentary Labour Party; failing that it should get the proposalsthrough with the support of other parties; or it should make way for another Government.4
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment had always to keep in mind both domestic opinion -without the support of which the Government could not carry itspolicies through - and overseas opinion, since the confidence of the markets was also of cardinal importance.    The degree of inter-dependence in the developed world was now such that it was essentialto have at least the acquiescence of the United Kingdom&quot; s partners inany action which she might take.    Defirtnce would not do.    It was amatter of judgment, not of knowledge, how far the possibilities whichthey had been discussing would in fact satisfy either overseas governments or market opinion: and if the IMF were persuaded tomodify their terms too far as a result of political pressure the outcome would not necessarily satisfy the markets.    Reference hadbeen made to the possibility of an alternative strategy of import controls; but it had to be remembered that such a strategy wouldalso be difficult to carry politically and would in any case taketwelve months to work during which time we would have to continueto finance the deficit.    He did not think the Cabinet could reach any final conclusion that day.   There was widespread agreement that theGovernment must have the loan from the IMF, and he had receivedindications from President Ford and others that, if agreement were reached with the IMF, some arrangement over the sterling balancescould be agreed quickly in order to be announced simultaneously.This was an important advantage.    The Chancellor deserved credit for the progress already made in negotiations with the IMF.Nevertheless many of the Cabinet at present felt that the scale ofthe public expenditure cuts at present proposed was too great toaccept.    Both he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would thereforetalk further to the leader of the IMF mission with a view to gettingagreement on a PSBR in 1977-78 of  9j billion, and at the same time he would seek to reinforce the United Kingdom&apos;s position by sendingmessages direct tb^Presldent Ford and Chancellor Schmidt asking them to b^ing^pre^a aure to bear on the IMF.    The Cabinet could then consider the matter further at their meeting on Thursday when heand the Chancellor of the Exchequer would hope to make a jointrecommendation to them.    It would however then be essential toreach a conclusion on the broad shape of an agreement with the IMF,including the question whether that agreement would carry convictionin the markets and be capable of gaining the support of the Party.He was seeing Mr Len Murray of the TUC thfct afternoon, and wouldmention the situation to him in a suitably discreet manner.    All that should be said to the Press was that progress was being made.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;asumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office24 November 1976
