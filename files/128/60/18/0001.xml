j^uamenTARY       i.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there was still some uncertainty about the business to be taken in the weekbefore Christmas and the date of rising for the Christmas Recess.It was necessary to take Private Members&apos; Motions and the consolidated Fund Bill on Monday, 20 December, and the business on 21 December would be the Rate Support Grant (RSG) Orders orthe economic debate, and on 22 December the Second Reading ofthe Water Charges Equalisation Bill or die economic debate or theRSG Orders.    He hoped that the House could rise on Thursday,23 December, taking the Christmas adjournments on that day, hutif the Government committed themselves to this, now the opposition would be more likely to press for a two-day economic debate.In discussion of the business in the week before Christmas, theimportance of obtaining Second Reading of the Water ChargesEqualisation Bill that week was stressed.   The RSG Orders hadto be taken before the Recess, and the Opposition had said that, ifthere were a two-day economic debate, they would expect theOrders to be taken on one of these two days.    It was noted however that this course would involve a risk that the Orders would be defeated.In discussion of ihe arrangements for announcing the conclusion ofthe negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) it wasnoted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer*s statement would bemade on Wednesday, 15 December.    There was general support for the view that the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party(PLP) to discuss the statement should not be held until the evening of Thursday, 16 December and that mis meeting should not beasked to pass a formal Motion supporting the government decisions.In discussion of the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill, it was noted mat there were likely to be three Committeesittings before Christmas, with Clause 4 - on unemploymentbenefit for occupational pensioners - being reached on 21 December.It seemed inevitable that the Government side of the Committeeshould contain at least one opponent of this Clause, though it was tobe hoped that no out and out Labour opponent of the main provisionsof the BUI would be selected.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be the general wish of the House to rise for the christmas recess not later than Thursday, 23 December.    The proposedbusiness for the week before Christmas would, however, have tobe kept flexible for the present, and it was not yet possible to announce the date of rising or to decide whether Second Reading of
the Water Charges Equalisation Bill could be fitted in.    TheLord President of the Council would announce that afternoon thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer would be making a statement onWednesday, 15 December, on the outcome of the negotiations withthe IMF; if questions were asked about a debate, the answer couldbe that this was for discussion through the usual channels and therewould be no debate next week.    The statement would be discussed at a meeting of the PLP on the evening of Thursday, 16 December.In the meantime it was essential to preserve secrecy about the package.    In order to offset any market uncertainty due to thefact that we were due to repay the stand-by credit that day itshould be mad  known simply that the Cabinet had agreed that theChancellor of the Exchequer would make a statement on Wednesday,15 December.    On the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill, there might be difficulty in getting through the mostcontentious provisions.    The Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister for Social Security had just sent him a minutecanvassing possible concessions; but before deciding whether tooffer any such concessions it would be necessary to establish, by consultation with the moderate opponents of the contentionsprovisions, whether these concessions would suffice to get these provisions through.    The Home a ad Social Affairs Committeeshould give further consideration to this matter and should putforward recommendations, covering both the clause on unemploy-ment benefit for occupational pensioners and the clause withdrawingsupplementary benefit from students during short vacations, whichthe Cabinet would consider the following week.The Cabinet -Took note,  with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;8 summing up of their discussion, and invited the Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.2
0tland andA^S BILL:^-ASSENT^BENDA2.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council proposing that during the Second Reading Debate onthe Scotland and Wales Bill the Government should announce their intention to hold referenda in Scotland and Wales, following royal assent to the Bill (CP(76) 130).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that pressure forreferenda on the devolution proposals had become very strong.Sixty-four Government supporters had now put their names to a carefully-worded Second Reading amendment in this sense.    It was virtually certain that sooner or later the Government would have to concede the principle; the iBsue could not be avoided.    The best timefor making the concession would be on Second Reading, in order bMhto retain the initiative and to maximise the Governmenfs majority,the size of which would have an important psychological effect at later stages in the passage of the Bill.    An announcement should make clearthat the referenda should be held after Royal Assent, in Scotland andWales only, and on whether or not the Acfs provisions should be implemented.    Other aspects need not be settled yet.In discussion it was argued mat the use of referenda in such a domesticmatter was gravely objectionable from the constitutional standpoint andshould be flatly resisted, and that the case against them was reinforced by the evident difficulty of sustaining the exclusion of English voters.There was however more widespread support for the view that theprinciple would have to be conceded, having regard both to parliamentary pressures and to public expectation in Scotland;  specialpublic approval of the proposals would also be a valuable reinforcementto the stability- of the settlement.    The timing of the concession neededmeasured consideration.    While there was a case for using it tomaximise the Second Reading majority, it would be important to extracimaximum benefit from it, and this might point to seeking to relate it tostages of the BilPs passage where the Government might be more at risk than seemed likely on Second Reading.    Careful assessment was needed of the likely reactions and future intentions of government supporters advocating referenda.The need was also urged for Ministers to have before them an analysis of the many more detailed issues mat wculd arise.    There were, forexample, very powerful arguments against posing a question onindependence; fully-argued proposals should be presented on both this aspect of referenda and such others as the question of English andNorthern Ireland voters, the problem of Shetland, the precise status of the results and the position if different answers were returned forScotland and Wales.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general recognition that the principle of post-Assent referendawould probably have to be conceded, and that the Government should avoid appearing to be forced into a late and grudging acceptance of it.On current evidence, however, the balance of advantage lay againstannouncing acceptance during the Second Reading Debate,    he therefore proposed that in opening the debate the following Monday hewould say that the Government recognised the strength of the arguments in favour of referenda in this case; that they had not so far reached a conclusion about them; that they would listen carefully to what was said during the debate; and that they would thereafter reach a conclusion and take an early opportunity of putting their conclusions to the House.    He would circulate to his colleagues, in advance, tLedraft of a suitable passage.    The matter could be further consideredby the Cabinet if necessary on 16 December, in the light of the first three days&apos; debate on Second Reading.    The Ministerial Committee onDevolution Strategy (the composition of which for this purpose hewould review) should consider the deiailed aspects of referenda, witha view to Cabinet decisions on them as early as possible in the New year the Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime MinistersBumming up of their discussion.3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Defence (CP(76) 104), the Lord Privy Seal (CP(76) 105) aud theMinister for Overseas Development (CP(76) 106) about the government&apos;s programme of dispersal for the Civil Service.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that his proposal that the dlsoersal plan for the Minister of Defence (MOD) should be abandoned was based on practical considerations stemming from the major reductions in MOD staff which had been approved since July1974.    Since the circulation of his memorandum he had had toaccept further substantial cuts in public expenditure over the next2 years, and the costs of dispersal over those years would representa loss of about 1, 500 jobs which would add to public expenditure in umemployment benefit and other ways.    About 90 per cent of the MODwere already dispersed and travel costs were a substantial item ofexpenditure.    In 1974, when the dispersal plans had been announced,the then Secretary of State  or Defence had reserved his position onthe size of the dispersal to each location in the event of the defence review having a significant effect on the size and shape of the Ministry.It was now estimated, however, that by 1984, as a result of cuts andreorganisation already decided upon, MOD HQ staff in the London area would number only 13, 000 out of the figure of 19, 000 in 1974 to whichthe dispersal figure of 11, 000 was primarily related; and this forecast4
did not take account of the possible implications of the most recentdecisions on public expenditure.    The biggest problem, however,was the hostile staff reaction to the dispersal plans.    This presentedan immediate problem because it affected the whole attitude of theStaff Side to closures of depots and redundancies which were already being brought about and which were being attended by industrial action and threats of industrial action in servicing depots critical to themaintenance of the Armed Forces.    He wai not seeking to retreat ondecisions already taken on staff reductions but merely to have his patheased, by abandonment of the dispersal plans, in carrying them out.THE MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT said that he believed that the present public expenditure constraints, the narrowingof the difference between rents in London and elsewhere, the projectedreductions in Civil Service manpower and the more even spread ofunemployment throughout the country all constituted a sufficient changeof circumstances since 1974 to justify a serious reappraisal of the government&apos;s dispersal programme *s a whole.    The Hardman report had expressed serious reservations about the wisdom, in terms of efficiency, of dispersing any of his ownMlnUtry&apos;s (QDM) staff, andthese reservations had not been properly considered by the Cabinet atthe time.    The ODM were committed to dispersing about 600 out of a relatively small HQ staff, and most of these would be concerned withrecruiting and administering technical co-operation officers, a dutywhich would require frequent travel to London.    The case forabandoning the dispersal plans for the Directorate of Overseas Surveys(DOS) was even stronger because the Directorate would in any casegradually be run down, with a diminishing benefit to Scotland, whileits dispersal would require a costly, purpose-built building vhichwould subsequently be difficult to dispose of.    He therefore urged thatthe whole of the dispersal programme should be re-examined but that,in any case, the plans for ODM dispersal should be abandoned.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the facts and figures in his memorandum were addressed to the MOD case, but the generalarguments in it applied equally to that of the ODM.    The Governmenthad repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to the dispersal pro-gramme, which had struck a careful balance between the claims of competing regions.    To abandon any part of it would provoke a strongreaction from the regions concerned, which would be seized onpolitically by the Nationalist Parties in Scotland and Wales and wouldbe more generally seen as a further example of Whitehall getting itsown way.    It would also make it very difficult to sustain the reBt ofthe programme.    He recognised that there was strong Staff Sideopposition to the programme but this was not confined to the MOD andODM; and there was evidence that some unions, which had strongregional representation, would actively resist any proposal toabandon the programme.5
In discussion, it was generally recognised that to make exceptionsfor the MOD and ODM would place in jeopardy the whole of theGovernment1 s dispersal programme.    It was argued, however, thatthere was a strong case for reviewing the scale and timing of theprogramme or, at the least, of giving more thought to the practicalitiesof securing its implementation.    The timing would in any case belikely to be affected by the proposed moratorium on the PropertyServices Agency construction work; and both the implementation andthe accepted benefits to the regions would be seriously prejudiced ifdispersal could not be achieved without staff consent.    In the case ofthe MOD, the planned reductions in staff numbers, which had notbeen foreseen in 1974, presented a real difficulty in finding jobs todisperse without denuding the Whitehall headquarters.    Against this,it was argued that while it might be right to consider marginaladjustments in the programme, though even this would hold out the riskof escalating demands from Staff Sides, it would be wholly wrong to depart from the Governmenfs basic plan.    This was carefullybalanced as between regions; and the MOD element in it amounted toas much as one-third.    The MOD had never been reconciled todispersal to Scotland and Wales and would continue to take arexyopportunity to resist it, but they were already widely dispersed inthe South.    The operative date for the dispersal to Glasgow was 1984,and to abandon this project, particularly so far ahead, would provoke a disastrous reaction in Scotland.    Moreover, any departure from the government&apos;s basic programme would affect the attitude of staff tothose dispersal plans which their representatives had largely accepted and which were going ahead.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, while recognising the difficulties which some Ministers faced,  the Cabinetdid not favour the suggestion that there should be a general review ofthe dispersal programme, to which the Government were firmlycommitted, or that there should be any basic departure from it inrespect of the MOD and ODM.    The Secretary of State for defence and the Lord Privy Seal should, however, consider whether anyadjustment was required of the MOD dispersal figures in the light ofthe projected reductions in MOD staff;  and if adjustments appeared tobe required, the Lord Privy Seal should consider, in consultation withother Ministers concerned, how any consequential shortfall in the government&apos;s overall target of dispersal might be made up by otherparts of the Civil Service, whose overall strength had increased since1974.    The Treasury&apos;s position was that the costs of dispersal wouldbe absorbed by the Departments concerned.    The Cabinet had not reached any conclusion on the special case presented by the projectedrundown of the DOS, and this should be further considered by theLord Privy Seal and the Minister for Overseas Development.    TheLord Privy Seal and the Ministers concerned Bhould report their conclusions to the Cabinet in due course.6
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Miniatesumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office9 December 19767
