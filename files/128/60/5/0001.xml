1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following weak.THE CHIEF WHIP said that, while the Opposition would sea noobjection if he were to make the business statement in the absenceof the Lord President on a single occasion, they had indicated thatthey would not think it appropriate that he should perform leader of me House duties in addition to those as Chief Whip, over a1period which might extend to several weeks.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that he understood the Oppositions viewpoint that thebusiness statement should be made by a senior Cabinet minister if the Leader of the House was absent for any extended period oftime, and he would be grateful if the Home Secretary would makethe statement.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that it hadnot been possible in the previous week to complete the Commonsstages of the Road Traffic (Seat Belts) BUI as planned, because,although it was a Government Bill, it was not being whipped and ithad some determined opponents who had held up progress.   this bill had received overwhelming support on the Government sideon Second Reading, and it would save human lives as well as money.If it did not reach Royal Assent this Session, there would be strong pressure to reintroduce it next Session, when the legislative programme was already very crowded.   He would accordingly like a day to be allocated to the Bill, in the following week if possible,so as to complete the Commons stages.   Even if the House ofLords did not then pass the Bill by the end of the Session, it wouldbe better that the BUI should fall In the Lords than that theGovernment should receive the blame for not being able even toget it through the Commons.In discussion it was pointed out that these difficulties all flowedfrom the original decision, taken in a previous Session, to allow a &apos;free vote on the seat belts issue.    The prime time available inthe Commons for Government legislation was all required for bills which were at a more advanced stage, and it was not certain thatthe Bill could be completed in the Commons even if prime time was1
allocated to it.    Moreover the Lords would have an additionalcause for complaint if another Bill was sent up to them at this latestage in the Session; and they would attribute to this any failure Incompleting its stages.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that he was concerned about the considerable difficulties being experienced in getting the remaining Government Bills through theHouse of Lords, and the possibility that the Lords might not be ableto finish all the outstanding business before the new Session was dueto start on 17 November.   The Home Secretary, with the Lord privy seal, the Chief Whip and the Chief Whip (House of Lords), should accordingly examine all the problems surrounding the completionof the Session&apos;6 legislative programme, and report back to theCabinet in time for a further discussion on Tuesday 26 October.The group should report on all possible means of overcoming these problems, including such possibilities as dropping some legislation,finding extra sitting time in the period up to 17 November, orextending the Session, though The Queenfa convenience as well asthat of the Government would have to be considered.   The group&apos;sreport should also deal with what might be done about the road traffic (Seat Belts) Bill.The Cabinet -2.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up of this part of their discassion by the PrimeMinister.WjPtion againsttlk   Ambers^meatTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, in the absence of the lord president, he had the previous afternoon, at short notice, answereda Private Notice Question asking what steps the government proposed to take to clarify the position in law of Members ofParliament in relation to allegations of corruption.   The question had arisen tram an article in The Observer, which discussedallegations against one named and two unnamed Members ofParliament in connection with the Poulson affair, and from a written Answer given by the Attorney General on 19 October to theeffect that the Poulson investigation, which was concerned solelywith possible criminal offences, was being brought to an end.The Sneaker had undertaken to give a ruling on whether there wasa prima facie case of contempt of Parliament in connection withThe Observer article.   If the ruling, which was to be given that afternoon, was to the effect mat a prima facie case existed, thenormal response of the Government would be an immediate motionto refer the issue to the Committee of Privileges.   But if, asappeared more likely, the Speaker ruled that there was no prima facie case, the question arose whether, in view of the serious
nature of the allegations, it would be right to let the matter restthere.    To do so might lead to charges of a &quot;cover up&quot; and topersistent pressure for the allegations to be investigated.    TheLord President had been of the view that any enquiry should be related to the future position of MPs, taking account of therecommendation of the Royal Commission on Standards of Conductin Public life that Parliament should consider bringing corruptionand bribery of a Member of Parliament, Kctiog in his Parliamentarycapacity, within the ambit of the criminal law, and not to the pastactions of the Members against whom allegations had been made:but in view of the feeling in the House on this matter he doubted whether this line could be sustained.In discussion, it was argued that an enquiry into the truth orotherwise of the allegations discussed in The Observer articlewould revive Press and public interest in the widest ramificationsof the Poulson case, and would also further discredit those who hadbeen convicted and in some cases already been released from prison.The named MP, Mr Cor die, had already instituted a libel actionagainst The Observer which was a matter for settlement by thecourts.    An enquiry into the past conduct of the Members concerned could not in any case, under present law, result in criminal proceedings in respect of a corrupt action by an MP acting in his parliamentary capacity; and to alter that law raised fundamentalconstitutional issues which would need to be very carefully considered.    On the other hand, it was strongly argued that one ofthe reasons for Parliamentary privilege was that Parliament had itsown remedies to deal with the misconduct of Members; and it wouldbe very dangerous to allow an impression to be created thatprivilege could be used to protect the private commercial trans -actions of Members.    There was therefore a strong case for an investigation by Parliament into the allegations of corruption whichhad been made.In discussion of the method of an investigation, it was generally agreed that the Committee of Privileges was not well constituted todeal with the matters at issue.    While it was arguable mat an enquiry headed by a High Court judge might command greater public confidence than one internal to Parliament, mere were objectionsof principle to such an enquiry.    In any case action under the tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 would be quite inappropriate.The form of investigation best suited to the present circumstances would be one conducted by a select committee of the House ofCommons whose membership should be carefully drawn to commandpublic confidence.    A motion to set this up would require priorconsultations with the Opposition; and these should be set in hand.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, whether or not the Speaker ruled that therewas a prima facie case of contempt, a full investigation was requiredinto the allegations made against certain MPs acting in their parliamentary capacity, and that this investigation should be conducted by a select committee of the House of Commons.   Hewould make a statement to this effect in Parliament that afternoon.He would also make it clear that this select committee would not be concerned with considering possible changes in the law following therecommendation of the Salmon Commission.The Cabinet -3.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.4
2.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(76) 85) about cash limits on public expenditure in1976-77.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the proposal beforeCabinet was that in general the Government must hold expenditure in1976-77 within the existing cash limits, which had been laid down inthe White Paper (Cmnd 6440), published the previous April; and departments must plan accordingly.    There would be a number ofspecial cases, mainly those in which a significant proportion of costs were incurred directly in foreign currencies, which would needIndividual consideration, although even here there should be noquestion of an increase in the cash limit unless it was clear that therewas no alternative way of absorbing the extra expenditure.   It wouldbe most desirable to make an early public statement of theGovernrnent&apos;8 general intention to make the existing limits stick inorder to make it clear that the Government was keeping public expenditure under control.    Monitoring which had been carried out on expenditure to date in the current year showed no tendency to over -spend - rather the reverse.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the general proposition that existing cash limitsmust be observed.    When the cash limits had been fixed it had beenmade clear &quot;that account would have to be taken of unforeseendifficulties, and that if the rate of inflation turned out substantiallydifferent from that allowed for, the Government would have to takestock of the position in the light of current circumstances.    This theywere now doing.   Remembering the high level of the public sectorborrowing requirement, it was clearly necessary to take a firm stand.Ministers with problems could discuss these bilaterally with the chief secretary, Treasury, to see whether some relaxation could be agreed,or some offsetting savings found.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury,should then circulate the draft of a public statement reaffirming theGovernments intention to abide by the existing cash limits, with suchminor exceptions as might prove necessary.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2,        Invited those Ministers who saw difficulty in keeping within their cash limits to consult bilaterallywith the Chief Secretary, Treasury, with a view toagreeing either some increase in the limit oroffsetting savings.5
3.        Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to circulate a draft of a possible public statement asBoon as he had completed these bilateral discussions.6
3.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP(76) 87) on the scope for discrimination between local authorities in the distribution of Rate Support Grant(RSG).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVJRONMENT said that theCabinet on 3 August had asked him to bring forward a paper setting outthe issues which would be involved in discriminating between localauthorities it. the calculation of RSG.   He had examined the subjectcarefully and had reached the conclusion that even if it were legallyopen to discriminate the difficulties involved were so great that itwould be preferable not to do so.    This view had received a good dealof support at a discussion in the Ministerial Group on the Rate support grant,    In any case the Law Officers had subsequently advised thatthere was no power under the Local Government Act 1974 to permitdiscrimination in the grant between individual authorities on the basisof their expenditure performance.    In consequence discrimination wasnot practicable without new legislation; this could not deal withdiscrimination alone but would have to form part of a coherent set of proposals for local government finance as a whole in response to theLayfield Report,In discussion some emphasis was put on the need for the possibility of discrimination to be actively pursued in the further consideration of localgovernment finance being undertaken in relation to the Layfield Report.The present arrangements under which those local authorities who had followed the guidance of the central government nevertheless had to be covered by any measure taken to deal with the consequences of thefailure by other authorities to follow the guidance, were quiteunsatisfactory.    It would be most helpful if the local authority associations could be brought to recognise that powers to discriminatein these circumstances would be in general for the benefit of their members.    It was pointed out on the other hand that there were serious difficulties of principle In any scheme for discrimination and inparticular that very careful consideration should be given beforelegislative measures were introduced which imposed sanctionsrelated to the way in which local authorities had discharged their functions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that there was no way at present of discriminatingbetween local authorities on the basis of their expenditure performance.There was however a considerable feeling that the possibility of discrimination should be actively pursued in the further considerationof future financing of local government which was being carried outfollowing the Layfield Report.   Although there would undoubtedly be difficulties in a scheme for discrimination the disadvantages of being unable to discriminate were also serious.7
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2,        Took note that there was at present no legalpower to discriminate in the provision of rate support Grant between local authorities on the basisof their expenditure performance.3.        Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to consider in consultation with theother Ministers concerned whether and how to incorporate provisions for discrimination into thenew arrangements which would be developedfollowing the Layfield Report.8
4.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment (CP(76) 86), the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP(76) 89) and the Central Policy Review Staff (CP(76) 90) on thelevel of Rate Support Grant (RSG) for 1977-78.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe level of RSG had a very important influence on the level of localauthority expenditure.   However although the Government couldcontrol the RSG they could not control the rates levied by the localauthorities and in consequence could not directly control the totallevel of their expenditure.    For this reason the co-operation ofthe authorities was necessary if their expenditure was to be limited,and this meant that the determination of the level of the RSG had tobe a mixture of economic and political judgments.   A further difficulty which had to be remembered was that the lower the levelof RSG the higher the likely increase in rates, sod since rates were reflected In the retail price Index this was directly In conflict with the Governmenfs counter-inflation policy.    There were somegrounds for optimism about future levels of expenditure.   Therewere now better arrangements for consultation between theGovernment and the local authorities and the increase in their realexpenditure had been brought down in successive years to a figureof less man 2 per cent in the current financial year with a prospectof no growth or perhaps even a small reduction in 1977-78.    In hisopinion a grant of 62 per cent would be most appropriate.    Thiswould be a severe settlement; it would mean a  ail of 3  percentagepoints from the grant for 1976-77, much the largest reduction therehad ever been in the level of grant.   Nevertheless be believed thathe could carry the local authorities to accept this figure but he didnot see any possibility of doing so at any lower figure.   When thelevel of grant had previously been discussed in the Ministerial group on the Rate Support Grant the&quot;Chief Secretary alone had supported a lower figure.    He therefore asked the Cabinet to agree to a figureof 62 per cent.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said mat the cabinet had decided under a previous item to make no allowance in the cashlimit for the RSG for 1976-77   for the fact that inflation was going to be more rapid man had been allowed for when the limit was originally fixed.   Nevertheless in his view the Scottish authorities would be faced with additional expenditure of  19 million on this account.   For this reason, and because of the cut in the rate increaseorder for 1976-77 which had been decided in August It was notrealistic to think that local authorities would start the coming financialyear with large cash balances in hand, and mis affected the increasein rates necessary to finance a given level of local authority expenditure.   On his calculations a grant of 62 per cent would require an average rate increase of 20 per cent in Scotland even if theauthorities kept their expenditure to the level laid down in the public9
expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393) and an average increase of33 per cent if they maintained their expenditure in the coming year at the lovel of the current year.    In addition local authorities wouldbe increasing rents.    There would be grave political difficulty if it became clear mat the Government was conducting its policies so asto bring about an average rate increase of 20 per cent.    he considered that the grant should be set at 63 per cent even though he believed that circumstances really warranted a figure of64 per cent.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that the crucial issue was the level of expenditure of the local authorities.    If, asexpected, a grant of 62 per cent led to spending by the authorities of  250 million in excess of the provision in Cmnd 6393 this wouldrequire either reductions in central government expenditure or anincrease in taxation.    To avoid these unwelcome alternatives itwould be preferable to set the grant at a lower level so as to induce the authorities to make reductions in their expenditure.    It was not clear that a lower level of grant would have an adverse effect onthe retail price index.   If authorities responded by cutting expendi-ture rather than increasing the rates there would be no effect on prices.    If on the other hand the grant was set at 62 per cent thiswould add  250 million to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.To cover that by an increase in indirect taxes would increase theprice level by much more than would an increase in rates.   Even ifsetting the grant at 60 per cent, rather than the 62 per centrecommended by the Secretary of State for the Environment, resultedin no consequential reduction in local authority expenditure and were wholly made up by an increase in rates this would increase the retail price index by only 0.18 per cent.    The Governmentproclaimed that it was their policy to give priority to manufacturing industry.    In practice, however, they had done little to substantiatethis.    There had been no transfer of resources from the public to theprivate sector.    Unemployment in the public sector was one-thirdas high as in the private -sector; in the previous year local authorityemployment had risen by lj per cent while unemployment in thecountry as a whole had risen.    It was widely felt in the country matthe public sector was being sheltered from the effects of the economiccrisis at the expense of manufacturing industry.On the other hand it was argued strongly that even a figure of62 per cent would put at serious risk the machinery for co-operationwith the local authorities which had beenafeated with much difficulty and which was very valuable.    There were good reasons to suppose that rate increases might prove larger than had beensuggested: if local authorities forecast inflation being more rapidthan allowed for in the Government calculations, and if they were unwilling to run down their balances to the extent expected, theywould need to raise move finance.    The burden of a severe
settlement would be felt particularly by the poor authorities andthe effect ia Wales would be more severe than in England.    Thedecisicn which the Cabinet had taken on cash limits was anadditional pressure on local authorities and it was most important not to reach a position where very large rate increases were forcedon the local authorities who would in turn be able to lay the blame for them on the central government.    The effect of rate increases on the retail price index might exceed the figures which had beenquoted and it was quite unsatisfactory to ignore this increasebecause, taken on its own, it seemed small.    A whole series ofGovernment measures were all adding to the rate of price increases and this was becoming a matter of increasing dissatisfaction both,to the Trades Union Congress and to the public at large.    full account had to be taken of the fact that rent, water charges andfares were all likely to have to rise and it was important to avoid any more pressure on prices by the local authorities.   A cut of3j percentage points in the level of grant was clear evidence of aswitch of resources from the public sector.    Furthermore a very severe squeeze on local authority expenditure would result in increased redundancies and these would result in an offset in anyapparent saving in the public sector borrowing requirement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that amajority of the Cabinet favoured setting the RSG at 62 per cent.The Government was however facing very great difficulties overpublic expenditure: and it was not clear mat, despite the skillwith which the Secretary of State for the Environment had beenhandling the matter, the local authorities fully appreciated the seriousness of the situation.    Internal and external pressureswere going to be very severe in the months ahead.    Furthermorethe Cabinet had previously accepted that it was only by strengtheningindustry that the country could emerge from its severe economic difficulties.    If they did not do this by changing priorities in public expenditure it would have to be done by fiscal action.The Cabinet -1,    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.    Agreed that the Rate Support Grant for england and Wales for 1977-78 should be62 per cent and that the settlement in scotland should be on a similar basis.11
5.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP(76) 88) on the introduction of legislation to prepare for direct elections to the European Assembly.THE HOME SECRETARY said that his memorandum set out the basicdilemma arising from the Government&apos;s statement that it would useits best endeavours to meet the target date of May-June 1978 for community-wide direct elections to the European Assembly, theconclusion of the Second Report of the Select Committee, published in August, that to meet this date a Bill would need to be introduced at the outset of the new Session and, on the other hand, both thepolitical difficulties and the difficulties in relation to the legislativetimetable which the early passage of such a Bill would entail.    Evenon the abbreviated basis recommended by the Select Committee the boundary Commission procedures would still take some 30 weeks and would need to be completed by the end of 1977 if preparations were to be made in good time for direct elections on the dateenvisaged of May-June 1978.    There was therefore some case for considering whether these procedures could not be furthertruncated.    But his conclusion was that it would be premature to take decisions at present on Boundary Commission procedures and suchlinked questions as the allocation of seats to the constituent parts ofthe United Kingdom.    His recommendation was that the Governmentshould announce their intention in T!u Queen&apos;s Speech to introduce legislation in the next Session, that a start should be made on the drafting of the Bill but that the timing of its introduction should bedecided later in the light of progress on devolution legislation.In discussion it was argued that at a time of acute financial stringencythe cost of direct elections for the United Kingdom, estimated at some 10 million, would not be commensurate with any benefits which theywould yield.    Direct elections were unpopular in the Labour party and were not thought by the electorate at large to have any relevanceto the problems faced by ordinary people.   And agreement to intro-duce legislation during the next Session simply meant our being edgedeven further along a dangerous and unrewarding road.On the other hand it was pointed out that while at some stage we wouldhave to choose between meeting the tar got date and telling ourCommunity partners that despite our best endeavours we had not beenable to do this, a course which it was more than possible that wewould have to adopt, the moment for this choice had not yet arrived.It might in fact be to our advantage for direct elections to coincide with the date of a General Election and this could form the basis indue course of revised proposals by us on timing to our Communitypartners ,    But this was for the future; to decide now not to include in The Queen&apos;s Speech a declaration of our intention to introduce12!?CTI0NS TOEUROPEANWBLY
legislation in the next Session would cause major difficulties for theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary in the negotiations now in train in the Community involving vital British interests such asfisheries.    A declaration of intent, however, in The Queen&apos;s Speech,even without any commitment to introduce legislation at anyparticular date, would hold off these pressures for the immediatefuture.    Discussions on related matters therefore, such aB theallocation of seats to the constituent parts of the United Kingdom,could be left until later.    Nor did it seem necessary, if a declarationof intent were being made in The Queen&apos;s Speech, to accept the SelectCommittee^ recommendation for an early debate.In further discussion it was argued that the representation of NorthernIreland raised special problems.    The Select Committee had recom-mended three seats from the total United Kingdom allocation.    This was acceptable but unless one of the three representatives were a Catholicthere would be considerable difficulties with the Catholic voters and theSocial Democratic Labour Party and this made it necessary forsome further thought to be given to the electoral arrangements for northern Ireland.    In the meantime it seemed premature for adecision to be reached, as recommended in the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum, on the &quot;first past the post&quot; electoral system for allcomponent parts of the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement mat The queen s Speech should contain a commitment to introduce legislation in the next Session without any commitment as to when a Bill would be introduced.    In the meantime the drafting of legislation (including alternative Boundary Commissionprocedures) should begin.    The general view of the Cabinet was thatthere need be no early debate but there might be some discussion of direct elections in the Debate on the Address.    Further considera-tion should be given to the allocation of seats between the constituent parts of the United Kingdom and the procedure for determining the constituency boundaries (including the possibility of a truncatedBoundary Commission procedure).    No decision should be taken atthis stage about the general adoption of a &quot;first past the post&quot;electoral system, but the Secretary of State for Northern ireland should prepare a paper on the practicability of devising an electoralsystem which would permit a Catholic to be elected.    The timing ofthe Bill should be considered in due course by Cabinet in the lightin particular of progress with the devolution legislation.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s Bumming up of their discussion.13
2.    Invited the Home Secretary to bring beforethe Cabinet in due course a memorandum on theallocation of seats between the constituent parts ofthe United Kingdom and the procedure for determining the constituency boundaries (including the possibilityof truncated Boundary Commission procedures).3.    Invited the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland to bring before the Cabinet in due course a memorandum on the practicability of devising anelectoral system for Northern Ireland which would permit a Catholic to be elected.Cabinet Office21 October 197614
