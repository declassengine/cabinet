They had before them the tableannexed to these minutes, indicating ways in which the public expenditure reductions so far agreed by the Cabinet could be increasedto raise the gross totals to about  1.2 billion in 1977-78 and 1. 7 billion in 1978-79, offset by additional expenditure to assistindustry and employment of  135 million in 1977-78 and  95 million in1978-79.Hcing ofItureIn discussion it was argued that it would be wrong to try to finance theadditional expenditure on industry and employment by making even greater savings on other public expenditure.    The IMF had asked for savings of  1 billion on public expenditure in 1977-78, and theChancellor of the Exchequer^ table Indicated how this might beachieved; but there was no reason why, once they had agreed upon that, they should not agree to additional expenditure financed from, the proceeds of some increase in indirect taxation.    Thus, 2^p on apacket of cigarettes (with corresponding increases on other forms of tobacco), 0. 7p per pint on beer, 6p per bottle on wine and 31p perbottle on spirits would, taken together, raise about  200 million;while 3^p On a gallon of petrol would raise  140 million.    Such taxIncreases, presented as a means of enabling the Government to give further assistance to industry and to counteract rising unemployment,would meet the mood of the country.   Against this it was argued thatthe inclusion of a tax clement would weaken the credibility of the package which to have the maximum effect upon confidence should consist only of public expenditure changes.    An increase in excise duties would not be welcome to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) andwould add to the Retail Price Index (RFX).    More generally therewould be advantage, when it came to negotiating the third pay round,to retain the option of changes in both direct and indirect taxation.
THE PRIME MINISTER, Humming up this part of the discussion, saidthat the issue to be settled was a matter of judgment.    There was a genuine risk that a package in which some additional expenditure on industry and employment was financed from tax increases might notcommand the necessary market confidence.    On the other hand taxincreases were easier to agree upon than further expenditure savings,and a majority in Cabinet were of the view that the attendant riskshould be accepted.     Any additional expenditure should therefore bemet from increases in indirect taxation.    The details of this would bea matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion,In the table he had handed round, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed additional expenditure of  30 million in 1977-78 and 45 million In 1978-79 on assistance to industry,  25 million in1977-78 only on training (being an addition to the   50 million already in train), and  80 million In 1977-78 and  50 million in 1978-79 on jobcreation.In discussion it was pointed out that thi? made no allowance for additional money for the National Enterprise Board (not), theScottish Development Agency or the Welsh Development Agency,although the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself, in his statement of22 July last in the House of Commons, had said that the resources tobe made available to industry through these channels would beincreased significantly.    The package would be ill-received if therewere nothing for this purpose, and it was suggested that  50 million would be an appropriate figure for 1977-78.    Expenditure of this order would be essential to make the package more palatable to the LabourParty, since it would give substance to the claim that the harddecisions on social expenditure had been taken in order to give priority to manufacturing industry.   Against this it was argued thatthe not had no great appeal to the average Labour voter, and that if additional expenditure were to be made available It would be better toput more of it into employment-creating measures man into theactivities of the not or the Agencies,    It was noted that theexpenditure changes so far provisionally agreed by Cabinet would addabout 35, 000 to the figure for unemployment at the end of 1977 and about 125, 000 to the figure for the end of 1978.    It would be important to introduce measures to counteract these effects, since otherwiseunemployment was likely to rise by about 10, 000 a month in the period
up till March, and thereafter by about 35, 000 a month up till the end of19?7.    In the memorandum he had circulated (CP(76) 119) theSecretary of State for Employment had proposed the extension of thecurrent measures to counter unemployment until the end of 1977, at a cost of  380 million, and certain new measures, at a cost of 400 million; but in both cases the gross cost would be offset byreduced payments of unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit, and by increased revenue from the tax payments and national insurance contributions of those who would be in work instead ofunemployed.    It was argued that there was some danger of doublecounting here; and it was noted that the Department of employment and the Treasury were not agreed upon the estimates of the net effectof the Secretary of State for Employ me nt&apos;s proposals upon the public sector borrowing requirement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, Baldthat there was general agreement in Cabinet that room should befound, through increases in indirect taxation, for additional expenditure of  200 million in each of the two years.    The questionof how this should bo allocated between the various forms ofassistance to industry and measures to counter unemployment couldnot be finally settled by Cabinet that evening.    The Secretary of Statefor Education and Science and Paymaster General, the Secretary ofState for Industry and the Secretary of State for Employment, with theChief Secretary, Treasury, should meet under the chairmanship ofthe Home Secretary the following day and be authorised to Bettle theallocation.    The question should only be brought back to Cabinet ifthey were unable to do so.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet had at their meeting earlier that day agreed to scoresavings of  100 million in each year under this head, to be obtainedpartly through reductions in capital spending and partly through anincrease in gas prices.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer had annexed to the note which he had handed round to Cabinet a suggestedcomposition for a saving of this order.In discussion the possibility of an increase in telephone charges was again considered.    It was argued that, with the industry making a profit of  400 million, there was no industrial case for such anincrease, which in any event the Government had no power to impose;
but it was pointed out that such a price increase was nevertheless less objectionable than other elements in the package.    The Increase in gasprices would make it possible, were it so desired, to increaseelectricity prices also; but given the likelihood of an increase in thenear future in oil prices this could mean a very adverse effect both onthe domestic consumer and on industry.    It was noted that the RPI,forecast to be increasing at an annual rate of about 15.8 per cent by themiddle of 1977, would be 2-3 per cent higher than that as a result ofthe provisional decisions already reached, and that further increases in nationalised industry charges could push it up to 20 per cent, atwhich point the political implications could begin to be extremelydifficult.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet confirmed their view that  100 million net should be scored asa saving in each year under this heading.    The details could not besettled by Cabinet that evening.    There should be an early meeting ofa group of Ministers comprising the Secretaries of State for Industry,for Scotland, for Trade, for Prices and Consumer Protection, and for transport, with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, under the chairman-ship of the Secretary of State for Energy, to consider, in the light ofthe Cabinet discussion, how the reduction of  100 million net shouldbe made up; they were authorised to settle the matter if they could reach agreement, only bringing the question back to Cabinet if theywere unable to do so.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet then discussed those Items of public expenditure on whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the table he had handed round, had proposed further savings.    The results of the ensuing series of briefdiscussions were as follows:i. Construction - other environmental services; It wasagreed that a saving of  50 million in 1978-79 should be found.ii. Housing; Savings had previously been agreed for1977-78 sufficient to reduce the prospective overspend of  220 million to   70 million; but on further consideration it wasagreed that another  50 million of savings should be found,which would reduce the overspend to  20 million.    Thesesavings would carry through to an additional saving approaching
 100 million in 1978-798    Reductions in the prospective over-spend would fall entirely 07. the England and Wales programme.The programme for Scotland would bear its usual share ofpositive savings.    It was argued that when housing associations obtained funds from the commercial banks for capital expenditure purposes, that spending should not fall within the definition of public expenditure.    It was noted that      *this Issue would be among a number of presentational points which would be considered early in 1977.iii. Prescription charges: It was decided that no increase should be made in prescription charges and that the saving of 40 million in each year which had been provisionally scoredshould not be confirmed,iv. Education: It was agreed that further savings of 10 million and  20 million in 1977-78 and 1978-79 respectivelyshould be made from expenditure in England and Wales underthis heading.    This would make the total savings on education(including school meals)  20 million in 1977-78 and  30 million in 1978-79.v. Social security and public service pensions; TheCabinet agreed that no savings should be made in social security expenditure, but they were very concerned about theproblem of the poverty trap, and were of the view that this 3would have to be tackled in the context of the discussions withthe TUC en round three of the incomes policy, when it would be   ^possible to consider the interlocking effects of changes in earnings, social security benefits and rates of direct and indirect taxation.    The statement to be made the following weekshould indicate that it was the Government&apos;8 intention to do this.The Cabinet agreed however that as a first step in this directionthe upratlng of public service pensions should be related to themovement In earnings rather than that of prices; this was expected to produce savings of some  13 million in 1977-78 and 91 million in 1978-79.vi. Child Tax Allowances - non-resident children; It wasagreed that no savings should be made under this heading.vii. Community Land Act; It was agreed that a saving of 35 million, in place of the previously agreed  50 million,should be made in 1978-79 under this heading.viii. Export credits; The savings of  100 million in 1977-78and  200 million in 1978-79 were confirmed; and theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for trade were invited to settle bilaterally the question whether any kind of .limits should be placed upon the level of sterling financing.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,lflitB while some members of the Cabinet had favoured an import depositscheme mainly on the ground that It would make the packagepolitically much more acceptable there was general recognition that itwould be deflationary in effect and would add to the unemploymentinherent in the rest of the package.    There was also a danger thatthe Introduction of a scheme of import deposits would put at risk the chance of obtaining a safety net for the sterling balances.    On balance the Cabinet agreed that no scheme for import deposits should beintroduced.The Cabinet -4,        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.llu*ions THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the outcome of the present andthe two previous Cabinet meetings, said that the Cabinet had reached agreement on the following points:a. They approved the list of public expenditure reductionsset out In the table annexed to these minutes, subject to i. the amendments agreed In the course of the present meeting, and ii. the additional saving of  1 million in 1978-79 in theexpenditure of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which hftdbeen agreed at the previous meeting.    This led to total savings of  1,019 million in 1977-78 and of  1, 578 million in 1978-79.b. They agreed that British Petroleum (BP) shares inexcess of those required to keep the combined Government andBank of England shareholdings at not less than 51 per centshould be sold; if ftt all possible the sale should be made fromthe former Burmah shareholding at present in the hands of theBank of England; but if this proved impracticable, part of theGovernment&apos;a own shareholding should be sold and replaced bythe shares at present held by the Bank of England.    The sale ofthe shares was expected to realise about    billion.c. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was authorised tosettle with the IMF on the basis of a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement in 1977-78 of about  l  billion,of which  ^ billion would come from the sale of BP shares and 1 billion from reductions in public expenditure; and on thebasis of a reduction in 1978-79 of  2 billion of which at least l  billion would come from public expenditure reductions.
He was also authorised to enter into a contingent arrangement with the Fund whereby, if in early 1978 the economy appeared likely to grow at more than 3^ per cent per annum in 1978-79there would be a further reduction of  ^- 1 billion in thepublic sector borrowing requirement in that year over and above what was now being agreed.d. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would now consider further the content of the Letter of Intent to the IMF, and would consult the Prime Minister on this.    The Prime minister would ensure that any points of difficulty were brought to theattention of the Cabinet.e. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider the way in which, through increases in indirect taxation, he would raisethe  200 million needed to off Bet the additional expenditure which had been agreed.f. Groups of Ministers under the chairmanship of theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Energy, asminuted earlier, would consider respectively the question ofthe allocation of the additional expenditure and the question of finding savings from the nationalised industries.At the same time the Chancellor of the Exchequer would press on withthe arrangements to try to get a safety net for the sterling balances.This would need to be done very rapidly because there would need to bean announcement In the House of Commons about the package onWednesday 15 December,    The timing of a meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party to consider the package, and the questionwhether the Government should put down a Motion for such a meetingseeking the backing of Government Members of Parliament, werematters which would need further thought, and which could beconsidered again at Cabinet on Thursday 9 December.    The packagewould need to be debated in the House of Commons in the week beginning 20 December, but it Bhould be left open for the presentwhether this would be a one-day or a two-day debate.    He enjoinedupon his colleagues once again the paramount need, If the package wasto have its maximum impact upon confidence, to maintain total secrecyabout its content until the announcement was made.The Cabinet -5.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion, and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office8 December 1976
