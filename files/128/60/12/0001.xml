NTARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the^RS House of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the business onWednesday 1 December would be the Second Reading of the aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, and a related procedural Motion the precise form of which was still under consideration.    This Motionwould need to cover both the truncation of the Committee and ReportStages, as had been done in the previous Session with the Trade union and Labour Relations  (Amendment) Bill, and the question of hybridity.Unless the Government indicated their intention of putting down a motion to the effect that the Bill should proceed as a public Bill, then the Bill would - under the normal procedure of the House - be referredto the Examiners for them to consider whether it was hybrid, a process which would take two weeks or more.    Meanwhile it would not bepossible to proce-od with Second Reading so that, even assuming theBill was found not to be hybrid, Second Reading would be delayed until after the Christmas Recess.    The provisions now alleged to be hybridwere those relating to ship-repairing, not those on which the Speakerhad given his ruling ef prima facie hybridity last May.   If theExaminers found that the Bill was hybrid, it would then be referred toa Select Committee, which would hear any petitions against provisionsof the Bill and which might make amendments.    parliamentary proceedings on the Bill would then drag on for many months.   he hoped that the procedural Motion could be taken after Second reading on 1 December, but this might not be possible If the question ofhybridity were to be raised in the House before then.    The Motionmight provoke a considerable row with the Opposition but this could notbe helped.In discussion it was pointed out that the debates on the Aircraft and shipbuilding Industries Bill on 1 December, and on the Second reading of the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill on 2 December,would mean taking two difficult and contentious pieces of business :immediately after the Debate on the Address, which would sour the atmosphere at the start of the new Session.    It was, however,important to make early progress on both Bills, and there might be difficulty In obtaining Second Reading for the Social Security(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; the Governments majority was likelyto be reduced from Monday 6 December.    The procedural Motion onthe Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill could be justified on thebasis that hybridity should not be used as a device to frustrate theoperation of the Parliament Act; and a row with the Conservatives onthis Bill on 1 December might help with the morale of backbenchers,and reduce the risk of defections in the vote the following day on theSecond Reading of the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill.   While those backbenchers who had previously voted against theGovernment on the earrings rule for retirement pensioners were now
believed to recognise that the alternative to the Governments proposalto restrain a further rise in the earnings rule would be even worse,there was considerable opposition to the proposal to restrict paymentof unemployment benefit to occupational pensioners.    There could beno question of forgoing this saving of unemployment benefit, though itmight be possible to offer the prospect of some give In Committee.While further time for consultation with the Parliamentary LabourParty might help to reduce the risk of failing to carry the SecondReading of the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, therewas no other suitable business to bring forward to 2 December; and itwould have to be emphasised to the Party that the alternative to theGovernments policies was a Conservative Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the need to take the Second Reading of the aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill and the related procedural Motion, andthe Second Reading of the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill, in the following week.    It was important to do everything possibleto ensure that the latter Bill would receive a majority on SecondReading.The Cabinet -Took note.2.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 112) covering areport by the Ministerial Committee on European Questions on astrategy for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled that theCabinet at their meeting on 11 June had expressed the wish to considerbefore the end of the year our strategy towards the CAP.    the ministerial Committee on European Questions had In the first instanceremitted the question to a small Sub-Committee of the Ministersmainly concerned, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food.    After considering the Sub-Committee &apos;s report the ministerial Committee were agreed In recommending mat our long-term aim should be to eliminate structural surpluses by reducingCommunity support prices, but that in the medium and short term weshould give priority to retaining for as long as possible the very substantial advantages we derived from the Green Pound and should give up no more of those advantages than was necessary to secure an acceptable price settlement.2
In dlscuBSion there was general agreement with the recommendationsof the Ministerial Committee.    In the short term we were in a stronger position to retain the benefits of the Green Pound than to resistCommunity price increases.    It could be argued that we could not expect to retain those benefits much longer and should make a virtueof necessity by sacrificing them in favour of insistence on a pricefreeze for surplus commodities.    But this wftB to underrate our ability to hold the Green Pound against pressure both from theCommunity and from our own agricultural Industry, and It wasnecessary to recognise that an outright confrontation with our partners over prices would be unprofitable.    It was howeverimportant to be sure of avoiding more than a minimal change In the green Pound during our Presidency.   In the longer term particularlybb and when currencies became more stable there would be great pressure from the Community to abolish green currency differentialsand we should not lose sight of the bargaining counter this would give us in holding down prices for surplus commodities.    Even at the nextprice fixing we should pursue this aim by all means short of outrightconfrontation.   But it was not clear how far in practice concessions on the Green Pound could be used to secure restraint on prices and weshould make no such concessions that were not fully justified by theneed for an acceptable price settlement.    There were good reasonsfor believing that the Commission^ proposals for automaticadjustment of green currencies could be successfully resisted.In further discussion attention was drawn to the damaging consequences of the Green Pound for Northern Ireland whereagricultural employment was much more important than in GreatBritain and where there was serious unemployment in rural ateas.The green currency differential in favour of the Republic resulted inwidespread smuggling of livestock to the South and It had been necessary to subsidise supplies to Northern Ireland meat plants at a cost of  1 million per month.    This was a burden which should be shared by the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted the special problems of Northern Ireland, but acceptedthe recommendations of the Ministerial Committee on EuropeanQuestions set out in the report attached to CP(76) 112, subject inparticular to our taking as tough a line in next yearfs fixing of community prices as was compatible with the avoidance of confrontation and to our only making concessions on the Green Poundwhich were fully justified by an acceptable price settlement.

He had sent messages to president Ford of the United States and to Chancellor Schmidt of west germany; and both he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had seen the leader of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) team.    The IMFnow fully understood that the Cabinet were not convinced of the needfor deflationary measures; and they understood the nature of the dilemma facing the Government in which if the action taken were undulysevere the Government would lose the present co-operation of thetrade unions, whereas If it were too mild it would fail to carryconviction in the markets.    Contrary to their previous view,neither Germany nor America were now pressing for an immediateagreement with the IMF, and It was therefore not necessary to pushmatters to a conclusion in the present week.    He himself would beattending the European Council on Monday and Tuesday of the following week, so that Cabinet would resume their discussion of this subject onWednesday 1 December.    In the meantime, officials of the treasury and the IMF were examining the implications of three possiblescenarios, involving differing levels of the Public Sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) at  8 j billion,  9 billion and  9  billion in1977-78.    He had spoken, on Privy Counsellor terms, toMr Len Murray of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to Indicate the broad nature of the problem to him, and Mr Murray would be givingthe matter further thought.In discussion it was argued that it would be important, when theCabinet returned to this subject the following week, to have proposalscirculated on paper in advance of the meeting so that Ministers wouldhave an opportunity to reflect upon them before the discussion.Indeed, it would be wrong if the sole proposals before Cabinet were those which the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the exchequer had at the last meeting said they would hope to put forward jointly.It would not be enough for Cabinet to be asked to approve or reject one
set of proposals.    There should be an opportunity to discussalternative courses, including the more radical alternative strategywhich had already had some discussion In the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy.    The Cabinet ought also to discuss the likelycontent of the Letter of Intent which the IMF would need; and ft waspointed out that the 1975 letter gave an assurance that the Governmentwould not adopt the kind of import restrictions which were at the heart of the alternative strategy,,    One possible course of action would be toimpose a wage and price freeze for a period - although it was pointedout that, while it might be possible to freeze Incomes, most prices were determined by forces which were beyond the Governmentscontrol.    The Cabinet had, at their last meeting, broadly agreed thatthere were no economic grounds justifying large deflationary moves;but there had been some bupport for the view that some reduction in thePSBR would be necessary to reach an agreement with the IMF and thusobtain the loan which was needed to get through the next 12 months.The Government were subject to two constraints: on the one hand Itwas necessary to satisfy the IMF, and perhaps more important tosatisfy the markets, since unless this were done even an agreementwith the IMF would be of little value; on the other hand, there was theneed to arrive at a package for which the Government could commandsupport in their own Party and In the House of Commons.    On theformer count, it was argued that the alternative strategy was quite impracticable, and that it was essential to avoid negotiating the IMFinto agreeing a package which the markets would reject as inadequate.On the latter count it was argued that any package which involved cutsin public expendifcare and a continuation of the rising trend in umemployment would not work and would destroy the Bodal contract.In further discussion the following points were made -a. Market confidence depended not on securing the short-term approval of the Press and others but on having soundpolicies and economic structures with a good political backing.The establishment of a safety net under the sterling balanceswould be a major boost for confidence.b. The announcement of an agreement with the IMF would now be not very widely separated In time from the publication ofthe economic forecast.    There was therefore a strong case forannouncing, along with the loan agreement, measures to reduce unemployment in 1977, particularly the extension of theTemporary Employment Subsidy, which placed a lower burdenupon the Exchequer than the cost of redundancies.    Unlessaction was taken on unemployment, the social contract wouldcollapse.
c0        Time would be needed, after the Cabinet had consideredthe Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals the following week,so that once the magnitude of &amp;o total public expenditure cutenvisaged was settled, there could be a round of discussionwith the TUC about its allocation,d. The IMF had now abandoned the concept of a target forthe PSBR in 1978-79, having been persuaded that the uncertainties In such a calculation were too great; and theywere moving towards the concept of a target figure for the adjustment, which would be varied in relation to growth.    Itwas suggestsd that if the target In 1977-78 were  8f biltton,the carry-through of the expenditure cuts that would involve,including the consequential reduction in debt interest,combined with acceptance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^proposals on export credit, would mean that relatively littlefurther expenditure savings would be needed,e. it should not however be assumed that, for 1978-79,part of the solution could be found in a hardening of the termsof our export credits.    The proposals which had been putforward, but not yet discussed, could mean putting theinterests of manufacturing Industry second to other considerations.    This would finally and totally undermine theGovernments industrial strategy.f. It would be important not to underrate the politicalrealities of the situation.    The Cabinets decision over safetyrepresentatives had, as predicted, upset the TUC.    Theminers, contrary to expectations, were displaying militancyover the early retirement Issue - and might, indeed, be trying to move towards free collective bargaining.    TheParliamentary Labour Party was likely to prove difficult overthe proposal to restrict the right of occupational pensionersto draw unemployment benefit.    It was not impossible that theinsistence of the IMF on hard terms could lead to theGovernment losing office,g. While It would be difficult to carry the Labour Party ina tough package, it might well prove even more difficult tocarry them in a repeated series of smaller doses madenecessary because the market was unconvinced by the adequacy of the original prescription.    It was essential to ensure thatany course which was chosen would in fact work in practice.h. The position was that the country had been spending,and continued to spend, more than it earned.    This was truebom of the nation and of the Government.    In recent years, the
real value of the spending of those on social security benefitshad been protected by law, while the real incomes of those in work had been cut,    A continuation of this could destroy theLabour Party,    The seminal issue was that in an economy which was both mixed and open, dependent upon the level of world trade, to spend more than was earned meant that thecountry became dependent upon foreign borrowing, and thusdependent upon the judgment of those who financed the purchaseof British goods and would finance the loan now being sought.It would be essential to convince the Governments supportersthat these were facts of life which had to be faced,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that none of the courses facing the Cabinet was attractive or certain In its effect.    In the following week they would need to decide which course was lenst unpalatable and least risky, and then seek the maximumsupport for it.    Ke understood the desire expressed by some membersof the Cabinet for a discussion of an alternative strategy of protection,although it had to be borne in mind that if no agreement were reached on the IMF loan the prospect of an arrangement to deal with the sterling balances, which now seemed very good, would also disappear.The alternative strategy had however hitherto only been discussed inthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy and it would be right for the Cabinet to discuss this, in addition to resuming their discussion of the IMF negotiations, in the following week.   He would arrange for the circulation of the necessary papers, having regard tothe  sensitive nature of some of the possibilities envisaged.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister &apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office25 November 1976
