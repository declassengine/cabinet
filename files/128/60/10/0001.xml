J.      THE LORD PRESIDENT CF THE COUNCIL said that the House ofCommons would be considering that afternoon whether to reject the message from the House of Lords insisting on the exclusion of ship-repairing from this Bill.   There were 3 options open to theGovernment.    First, to accept the Bill this Session without ship-repairing, as a fulfilment of most of the Government&apos;s commitment.Second, if the Lords would not give way, to lose the BUI this session and re introduce it next Session under the Parliament Act.    Third,to accept the Bill this Session without ship-repairing and introduce a Bill next Session to nationalise ship-repairing.    If the Commonssent the Bill back to the Lords mat afternoon, there was a possibility that the Lords would then kill the Bill by referring it to the Examinerson the question of hybridity and not by insisting on their amendments to exclude ship-repairing.    In his view it would be disastrous toabandon ship-repairing now, and the right course - if the lords would not give way - would be to re introduce the Bill next Sessionunder the Parliament Act.    This would mean the loss of a further2 days, or possibly 3, in the Commons early in the Session.    Itwould probably not be possible, however, to take the Second Readinguntil after the Cambridge by-election.    After Second Reading theprocedure might be to put down a Motion to truncate the remainingCommons stages.    The Bill would then have to go to the Lords, who might spin it out until the end of the Session, delaying Royal Assentuntil then.    There would, however, be a chance of the Lords givingway when the Bill was sent up once more from the Commons, as theyhad done earlier in the present Session on the Trade Union andLabour Relations (Amendment) Act, in which case Royal Assent mightbe reached by Easter.    There could be no guarantee of being able toget a separate Bill on ship-repairing on to the Statute Book next session;  the Lords might wreck such a Bill and it would not then bepossible to use the Parliament Act until the Session after next.    If itwere decided to proceed under the Parliament Act next Session, itmight be necessary to drop a Bill from the legislative programme tomake room, probably the Conspiracy Bill.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he had sent a minute to the Prime Minister and all members of the Cabinet on16 November, in which he had set out his assessment of the situation,had proposed that the Government should do everything possible to deter the Lords from their ship-repairing amendments and had reached the conclusion that it would be preferable to lose the Bill this session rather than give way to the Lords on a major issue ofprinciple.    There was no doubt about the firm and public nature ofthe Governments commitment to the nationalisation of ship-repairing,which had been spelt out in both the 1974 Election Manifestos.   TheBill had recieved its Second Reading last December and had beenexhaustively debated in the Commons.    The Government had not losta single vote on this BUI in the Commons, and their supporters, whohad worked very hard to get the BUI through, would not understand ifthe Government now asked them to give way to the Lords, and to vote1
in the same lobby as the Opposition to save Mr Bailey of bristol channel Ship-Repairers from nationalisation.   He had consultedleading members of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions, who had expressed the view that it would be better to make every effort to obtain the whole Bill mis Session, even if the effortdid not succeed, rather than to lose ship-repairing,   Mr WiUey andMr Blenkinsop had expressed the same view to him.    There was nodoubt that the only way to manage the affairs of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries sensibly was to bring them into public owner-ship, and mere would be considerable difficulties in the short termif nationalisation was held up.    The British Aircraft corporation would be in difficulties and would be unable to start new projects,and Swan Hunter would probably collapse.    Warship building wasprofitable, but merchant shipping yards would be in severe difficultiesin any event, and there might be as many as 30, 000 redundancies.This situation could be managed much better under nationalisation.Nevertheless in his view the only course was to stand firm.    the lords should be warned of the grave consequences of resisting the will of the Commons, and it might be desirable to consult theParliamentary Labour Party.    If necessary, the Parliament Actshould be invoked next Session, taking the Bill through the commons as early as possible in the Session.In discussion it was suggested that, although the behaviour of the lords deserved the strongest condemnation, they were nonethelesslikely to insist upon the exclusion of ship-repairing.    Reliance on the parliament Act next Session would at best involve a long delay in bringing the aircraft and shipbuilding industries into public ownership.There could be no certainty of getting the Bill through next Session;and the Government might end up with no legislation at all.    the better course might be to secure the nationalisation of the two majorindustries this Session and to introduce a Bill next Session to nationalise ship-repairing.    Otherwise two major industries wouldbe put at risk, with adverse effects on order books, and possiblymassive unemployment In the shipbuilding industry under the present government.    It would be essential to have a contingency plan fordealing with such a situation.   Trade Union leaders might now arguefor standing firm, but it was not so clear that workers on the shopfloor would take the same view when the consequences began to be felt; and the Governmenfs support might well be affected adverselyin a number of constituencies.    The Lords had nothing to  ear fromthe Government during the life of the present Parliament.   A onechamber Parliament would not be an electorally attractive propositionAs against this it was strongly argued that the Lords were taking uponthemselves to reject an important part of legislative proposals whichhad been put before the country in two General Elections and had menbeen passed through the Commons without a single defeat.   The Lordswere seeking to absolve themselves of the blame for the consequences of this action and it might be that some of the odium would fall uponthe Government.    It was, however, intolerable and unconstitutional2
for the non-elected chamber to interfere in this way with a majormeasure passed by the elected chamber.    The Lords ought to give way, and if they did not, there might well be long term effects onrelations between the two Houses.    If the Government did not stand firm, the effect on labour backbenchers would be disastrous.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were firmly of the view that the Lords amend -ments to exclude ship-repairing from the Bill must be rejected bythe Commons that afternoon.    Some members of the Cabinet had expressed doubts whether, in the event of the Lords then refusing to give way, it would be prudent to lose the entire Bill this Session,and there might be a need for further consideration by the Cabineton Monday 22 November.    The Government could not allow their programme for next Session to be affected by the behaviour of the lords, and the legislative proposals in The Queen&apos;a Speech should all be maintained.    If, because of the need to invoke the parliament act next Session, it was not possible to complete some other measures it would be clear where the blame lay.aThe Committee -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat the Lords, who would be considering that afternoon the Commons1message rejecting most of their amendments to mis Bill, might decide to press two of their amendments.    One of these would makethe comprehensive principle subordinate to the principle of parentalchoice and would seriously weaken the Bill; the other would remove from the Bill the power to control the take-up by local educationauthorities of places at independent schools.    If the Lords were toemasculate the Bill in this way it might be necessary to lose the Billthis Session and re introduce it next Session under the parliament act.    This would take up more Parliamentary time next Session,but there would be no difficulty about getting the Bill through the commons.    She hoped that the Lords would not stand out to the endagainst the will of the Commons, but it might be necessary to send the Bill back to the Lords a third time.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.3
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,at the Conference in Geneva, Mr Richard was still trying to obtainacceptance of his formula on the independence date.    Discussions were still going on with Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe, who had so for been unwilling to agree.    If agreement could be reached the talks would thenmove on to discuss the structure of the interim government and weshould be faced with the major question of what role we should play in rhodesia during the interim period.    He would be putting a paper onthis subject to the Cabinet for consideration next week.The Cabinet -1.    Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he wished to warn his colleagues of the possibility that on the terminationof our fishing rights under the Oslo Agreement on 1 December the24 British trawlers fishing in Icelandic waters might be required toleave by the Icelandic Government.   Action of this kind would clearlycause a major outcry: but this outcome was not yet certain.   He wasgiving careful consideration to possible courses of action on our part.The Cabinet -2.    Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.3.        The Cabinet discussed the negotiations with the international monetary Fund.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.4
^SUPPORT-Rant. 1*) 27th4.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that at their discussion on 21 October the Cabinet had agreed that the Rate support grant for England and Wales for 1977-78 should be 62 per cent andthat the settlement in Scotland should be on a similar basis.    However,that decision had been taken before the Government had known of theattitude the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be taking, and forthis reason he wished to reopen the earlier decision.    The formalposition was that the local authorities would be informed of theGovernments conclusion at the statutory meeting on the following monday, 22 November, although some hint had been given to theminformally of the likely level of settlement.    In his view the prospect that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) would need to bereduced next year made it highly dee liable to reduce the Rate support grant to 60 per cent, thereby saving  220 million on the PSBR.    Afurther reduction in the rate of grant was the only way of applying anadditional squeeze to local authority expenditure; and although itwould be possible to announce 62 per cent at the statutory meeting,and then to change it at a later stage, it would be acutely embarrassingand it would be far better to decide in favour of the lower figureimmediately.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that hehad investigated the possibility of delaying the statutory meetingbeyond 22 November.    If this were done, it would mean that theParliamentary consideration of the Order which would have to be made would be delayed until after the Christmas Recess.    There was noprecedent for delaying the statutory meeting, but in 1973, at the height of the oil and coal crisis, there had been a second statutory meeting to change the rate of grant.    In his view it would be impossible to defer the meeting without his making a statement in the House ofCommons., and this would create alarm and foster a crisis atmosphere.He did not therefore recommend that course.    He pointed out that theearlier decision in favour of 62 per cent implied a cut of 3? per centcompared with the level of grant in 1976-77.    This would be the mostsevere cut ever made.   On top of this, the local authorities lookedlike being some  150 million over their planned current expenditure for 1976-77, wholly for reasons outside their control.    Strictadherance to the cash limits laid down for the Rate Support Grantthis year would mean that that sum would be left for the localauthorities to bear, although in that case he felt that the Governmentbhould not make the cut of  50 million in the Increase Order which theyhad announced earlier.    If the 1977-78 grant figure were reduced to60 per cent, the combined increase in rent and rates for council tenantswould be as much as  1 a week.   Politically it would be very important to retain the co-operation of the responsible Labour councils, which hehad done much to fobter, and in his view a reduction to 60 per cent would not be consistent with retaining that co-operation.    There couldbe a considerable feedback from the Labour councils to theParliamentary Party, and it could even be difficult to get the necessaryRate Support Grant Order through the House of Commons.   It was even
possible that the lower rate of grant would produce, not reducedexpenditure, but higher expenditure coupled with a higher ratedemand, with the Government being blamed.In discussion it was suggested that it was unreal to think of settlingthis issue at the present meeting.    If the statutory meeting with thelocal authorities could not be postponed, the right course was to announce 62 per cent as the Governments decision the following monday, but to make it clear that some change was not impossibleas part of the consideration of the IMF package, thus putting localauthorities on warning that a second statutory meeting might be needed later.    If this course were adopted it would avoid thedifficulty of trying to decide the local authority element in the possiblepackage of public expenditure reductions in isolation from the rest ofthe package.   However, it was argued against this that it would leadto a chaotic situation for the local authorities.   On the other hand, to announce 62 per rent as the Governments final view was effectively to exempt the Rate Support Grant and local authority current expendi-ture from the wider cuts which might prove necessary.    It was pointedout that special difficulties arose in Scotland, where, because of theabsence of any substantial local authority balances, the proposed levelof 62 per cent would lead to average rate increases of some18  per cent (compared with 10 per cent in England), while a grantlevel of 60 per cent could mean an average rate increase in Scotlandof 26 per cent, with some rate poundages rising to over  2 in the pound.    Moreover, local authorities in Scotland unlike those inEngland and Wales could not contain current expenditure within thelimits laid down In the last Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393)without significant redundancies.    Such a prospect could be disastrousfor the 1977 municipal elections.    It might be possible in England andWales to move from 62 per cent to 61 per cent for the 1977-78 levelof grant; but this was not acceptable in Scotland,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that  theCommittee were agreed that the Rate Support Grant in England andWalos for 1977-78 should be fixed at 61 per cent, and this could be announced at the statutory meeting on 22 November.    Furthermore,the local authorities would be told that the Government would insist on strict adherence to the cash limit laid down for the grant in1976-77 so that they would have to cope themselves with their forecastexcess current expenditure this year of  150 million, and would insist upon the cut of  50 million in the Increase Order which had been announced some time ago.    On Scotland the position was somewhatconfused and it was difficult for Cabinet to handle, the matter in theabsence of papers.    Since a decision was wanted in time for themeeting on 22 November, it was agreed mat the best course would beto remit the matter to a small group of Ministers who could reach a conclusion on it on CabinetS behalf.   The Home Secretary might chairsuch a group, which should consist of the Secretaries of State for the environment, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Trade, theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Chief Secretary,Treasury.   The Groups task would be to decide on the Rate support grant arrangements to be adopted for Scotland in the light of theCabinet decislou on England and WaleB.6
The Cabinet -1,    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.   Agreed that the Rate Support Grant for england and Wales for 1977-78 should be, not62 per cent as had been decided on 21 October,but 61 per cent.3.    Invited the Secretary of State for the home department, in consultation with the Secretaries ofState for the Environment, Northern Ireland, Scotland,Wales and Trade, the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to consider  and decide upon the Rate Support Grantarrangements to be adopted in Scotland in the light ofthe decision which had been taken in respect of Englandand Wales,7
5.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP(76) 108) seeking their endorsement of the conclusions of the ministerial Group on Official Information on the reform of the official secrets Acts and on more extensive publication of official information.A note by the Prime Minister (CP(76) 107), covering the report ofLord Houghton&apos;6 Committee on Cabinet Document Security, was alsorelevant.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the broad effect of the conclusions ofthe Ministerial Group wao to follow the recommendations of the franks committee In narrowing the protection of criminal sanctions to specific categories of official information but to modify those categoriesso as to make the package more liberal in respect of informationbroadly dealing with home and economic policy, which included thebulk of Cabinet documents; and somewhat more restrictive in respectof information in the fields of intelligence and security, defence and international relations.    He believed mat most people would understandand support a package which was overall more liberal than Franks andthe consistent theme of which was broadly to regard unauthoriseddisclosures about domestic affairs as likely to cause political embarrassment to the Government of the day but not serious damage to the national interest, and therefore not to justify criminal sanctions.On measures to achieve more open government the group s conclusion was that the Governmenfs policy of making official information more readily available should be further developed and that there should bea greater readiness to publish the factual and analytical materialassociated with major studies, such ae Programme Analysis and review studies (PARs), but that any system involving automaticpublication or a public right of access would be unworkable or toocostly to administer.    He  invited the Cabinet to endorse theconclusions and to agree that a suitable opportunity should be taken to announce them in Parliament on the lines of the draft statementsattached to his note.    It would be helpful if bis colleagues would alsoindicate whether they saw, or were likely to see, any objections to his proposal to publish the report of Lord Houghton&apos;6 Committee on CabinetDocument Security and to announce the Governmenfs broad acceptanceof its recommendations.In discussion it was argued that since there was no question about theneed to continue to safeguard the confidentiality of Cabinet and CabinetCommittee proceedings and of a great deal of economic information,relating not only to the reserves but to such sensitive matters asrelationships between the Government and particular firms, therewould be risks in removing from these matters the protection of criminal sanctions, to the extent that these acted as a deterrent againstunauthorised disclosure.   Against this, it was pointed out that the realissue was not whether particular information should continue to beconfidential, which must clearly be the case over a wide range of matters, but whether the Government could, with public support,invoke the criminal law against unauthorised disclosures.    the 8^ICIAL^CRETS ACTS*ND OPEN^VERNMENT
suggestion was made, however, that the draft statement should seek to avoid any misunderstanding on this score by making it clear thatthe normal sanctions of Civil Service rules of conduct would continueto apply.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusions set out in CF(76) 108 and in thedraft statements annexed to it.    The Home Secretary should nowfinalise the draft statement on the reform of the Official Secrets Acts,taking into account any minor amendments which his cabinet colleagues wished to suggest, including the suggestion, which had beenmade in the discussion, that mention should be made of the continuingapplication of Civil Service rules of conduct to all cases ofunauthorised disclosure.    The statement should be made at an early opportunity and in any case not later than at the beginning of the new session.    Thereafter further detailed work on the Franks Committee^recommendations would proceed under the supervision of the HomeSecretary in consultation with other Ministers as required, with any major issues being referred to the Ministerial Group on official information.    He would himself take an opportunity in his speech onthe Debate on the Address to refer briefly to the Government intention to publish as much as possible of the factual and analyticalmaterial associated with major policy studies including such material in PARs.    The Cabinet had also noted, and raised no objection to,his intention to arrange for early publication of the report ofLord Houghton&apos;s Committee on Cabinet Document Security and to announce the government broad acceptance of its recommendations.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Home Secretary to make an earlvannouncement of the Governments conclusions onthe reform of the Official Secrets Acts.3.    Took note that the Prime Minister would takea suitable opportunity in Parliament to refer to theGovernment1 s intentions on greater openness.4.   Took note that the Prime Minister would arrangefor early publication of the report of Lord Houghton&apos;sCommittee on Cabinet Document Security and announce the Governments broad acceptance of its recommendations.9
PETY^REsenta tivesPlBfe*ence:l*Vte 56.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (CP(76) 103) making revised proposals forthe implementation of regulations under the Health and Safety atWork Act 1974, taking account of a report by officials on the costs of implementation in the public sector which was appended to his memorandum,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that as aresult of the further study by officials which had been agreed atthe Cabinet&apos;e previous discussion of this question the localauthority associations had agreed that their previous estimates ofthe costs of introducing the draft regulations were unreasonableand could be halved from  88 million to  44 million.    Officialsstill took the view that the cost would be less than mis.    in deciding what should be done the Cabinet should recall that the health and Safety at Work Act had been one of the first measuresof the Labour Government in 1974.    In the period since the Actwas passed unanimous agreement had been reached in the health and Safety Commission (HSC) - which included representatives ofthe Confederation of British Industry and of the local authorities -on the draft regulations and there was extremely strong pressure for them to be brought into force without undue delay.    Given thisstrong pressure for action, but taking account of the financialpressures of the local authorities, there were in theory three possible courses of action.    The first would be to implement theregulations immediately but to exclude the local authorities and theNational Health Service from their scope.    This was no more man atheoretical option.    There were no arguments of principle by which to defend it and its effect would be to attract criticism of theGovernment for not acting in the public sector rather than credit for taking action in the private sector.   The difficulties would bethe greater since the trade unions affected covered both the private and the public sectors.    A second alternative would be to bring thedraft regulations into effect during 1977 and to provide anadditional  10 million to the local authorities through the rate support Grant.    If this were done he would use his influence to try to ensure that the costs falling on the local authorities did notexceed this amount.    Provisions for finance in subsequent yearscould be considered in the light of practical experience of costsactually incurred.    The third option would be to make theregulations right away but not bring them into effect until1 April 1978.    Deferral for as long as this would undoubtedly giverise to protest but he thought that he could justify such a course byemphasising that the making of the regulations made them a firm commitment, and putting emphasis on the financial stringencyfaced by the local authorities.    Deferral for longer than this, or a lesser commitment, could not be defended.10
In discussion it was argued strongly that while the extent of disagreement about the costs between the local authority association and Departments had been reduced a substantial margin of disagree -ment remained.    Implementation of the regulations would bringbenefits in the longer term but they were unquantifiable.    In theimmediate future implementation would cause severe problems withthe local authorities.    The Rate Support Grant settlement would put them under great pressure and it would be intolerable to require them to bear an additional burden, whether it was  25. 5 million as officials estimated or  40 million as the local authoritiesestimated.    The authorities pointed tout that time and again theGovernment simultaneously called on them to reduce their expend!-ture and required them to meet the cost of new measures.    At atime when they were being required by financial pressures to closefacilities and to make staff redundant it would be wholly unjustifiableto introduce new provision which would intensify these pressures.The Scottish local authorities, in consultations over the level of rate Support Grant, had expressed particular concern about theeffect of implementation of these regulations.    Similar problems would arise with the National Health Service, where there was anadditional difficulty that there were staff associations not recognised for the purposes of the regulations.In further discussion it was argued that in the difficult circumstances it would be preferable to take no decision on the regulations as they stood, but to consider the possibility of introducing only those partswhich would not entail significant costs (for example the provisionfor safety committees) and of finding some means to limit the costs which, as the regulations stood at present, were liable to be inflatedby abuse of the rights they conferred.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said there wasa clear feeling within the Cabinet that at a time when the localauthorities were being subjected to severe financial pressure, whichwas leading to the closure of facilities and redundancies amongsttheir staff, it would not be right to impose an additional financial burden upon mem.    The general view was that the regulations shouldnot be brought into effect in 1977-78.    The matter would need to be handled with great care with the trade unions and the Secretary ofState for Employment should discuss with, the HSC and the TradesUnion Congress possible arrangements for phasing the regulations in at a later date.    He should also give consideration to thepossibilities raised in discussion that some parts of the regulationsmight be introduced at much lower costs, and that means should befound to avoid the possible danger of abuse in a minority of cases.11

Thenegotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had so far been mainly exploratory.    He had himself seen the head of the IMFteam to ensure that the negotiation was conducted with a full sense of the political dimension involved.    He had also spoken to theChancellor of West Germany and to the Presidents of France andthe United States.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had only just returned from Washington where he had been explaining the British position to leaders of the United States Administration,with some success.    There was much goodwill for the UnitedKingdom in its present position, but a general view that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) was too high and should bereduced.    The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (EY)had met the previous evening and had given the Chancellor of theExchequer a very tight negotiating mandate, making it clear that he must report back to the Committee before entering into commitments of any kind with the IMF.    The Bize of the PSBR was a central factorand this would have to be considered by Cabinet.   At the same timework was in hand at both the technical and political levels to remove the vulnerability of the sterling exchange rate to the risk of with-drawal of the sterling balances, and it was hoped that some statement on this, if only in general terms, would be possible at the time theIMF loan itself was announced.    That, together with the possibilityof import deposits or something similar would come before Cabinetin due course to give Ministers the opportunity to construct a two orthree part package which would enable the Government to stand firmfor a further 18 months, until the situation improved in 1978.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that so far theGovernment had taken a tough, non-committal line with the IMF.In accordance with the instructions he had had from EY, there hadbeen no discussion with the IMF of possible action.    The IMFdisliked putting their own proposals forward, but they had nowproduced a broad judgment on the prospects as they saw them.    Intheir view, if the PSBR were not cut, then even with high interest rates it would be impossible to finance the PSBR without aninflationary increase in the money supply which would react on the
exchange rate and lead to lower investment and higher unemployment -a recipe for catastrophe.    If, however, the PSBR were reduced, they thought that it should be possible to resume steady progress by theend of 1977 because they took the view that the Governments basicstrategy was correct.    The problem for the Government, therefore,was to decide what was the highest level of PSBR which could be financed without adverse effects, and which they could persuade theIMF and the other countries concerned to accept.    EY had agreedthat he could discuss with the IMF the policy options on variousbases, down to but in no circumstances below a PSBR of  9 billionin 1977-78.    He would report back the following week, and it wouldthen be time to discuss how a reduction might be achieved.    once the loan had been agreed, it should be possible to move towards some arrangement on the sterling balances, which, together with other possibilities, would make the package rather more acceptable.    Ontiming, it was essential to announce some agreement with the IMFby mid-December if confidence we re not to be impaired.    As he sawit, agreement would be needed by 7 December on the IMF loan ifthere was to be time before mid-December to make progress on anarrangement for the sterling balances.    A decision on the size ofthe PSBR would therefore be essential early in the following week,and thereafter Cabinet would be able to discuss the options - taxincreases or public expenditure reductions - for achieving this.In discussion it was argued that, when the time came to make anannouncement about the IMF loan, the package would need to be presented as part of a new strategy.    It would not be enough to offermore of the old medicine in stronger doses; the package must beseen as part of a wider economic plan.    Import controls, whetherthey were to be recommended or not, should form one of the optionsput before Cabinet.    There was, however, a considerable difficultyover timing.    It was not easy to see at what point Cabinet could find the opportunity for a broad discussion of the kind this would entailgiven that the highly sensitive nature of some of the issues meant that the period between decision and implementation would need to bekept to the absolute rninimum.    To some extent it was inevitable that EY, which itself covered a broad range of opinion within theCabinet, should be trusted to carry the discussion forward; andthere was support for the view that anything which looked like special cabinet meetings - eg at Chequers at the weekend - could only create an undesirable crisis atmosphere.    Not all Cabinet members could take part In the development of the proposals which they would in anycase eventually have a chance to pronounce upon; and it wasnecessary to leave matters for the moment in the hands of the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to trust them,supported as necessary by EY.    It was vital that there should be nooutside speculation on sensitive issues, and although the Governmentwould argue hard with the IMF, it would be important for confidencereasons to maintain a calm public image.    It would however bedesirable for Ministers to consider, if it were possible, the political2
dimension involved - the problem of presenting, to the Party, tothe trade unions, and to the country me revised strategy of whichthe IMF agreement would only be part.    It was further argued thatit was not merely a question of presentation but one of substance,since it could be held mat the Labour movement would be unwilling to accept any appreciable measure of further deflation, and that a move in this direction would erode the confidence not only of theLabour movement but of the British people in the Government.From this point of view the quantum of the PSBR rather than itsdistribution was the crucial factor.    These matters needed discussion at an early date.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that he had much sympathy with the feeling which had been expressed that anopportunity for more disc use ion should be found; but there were certain facts which had to be recognised.    The IMF team had cometo the United Kingdom to negotiate a loan, which the United Kingdomneeded.    They had already been here a fortnight, and it was essentialto reach at least preliminary conclusions with them early in thefollowing week.    To send the IMF team back to Washington on theground that the Government needed to discuss the situation at lengthwab unthinkable.    On present evidence of the IMF&apos;s views, it seemed likely that some reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement would be needed, whether through taxation increasesor expenditure cuts.    However, simply to announce more deflationand no growth was politically unacceptable, and for this reason hewas anxious if possible to introduce into the situation the new factors which had already been mentioned on the sterling balances and imports,which would give the Government the possibility of standing firm fora further IB months until wings improved.    The best way to cope with the worries which had been expressed would be for Cabinet tomeet on Tuesday of the following week to settle the quantum of thePSBR, without any prior discussion in EY.    It would then be possiblelater in the week for Cabinet to discuss strategy if mat was still felt to be necessary; but he suggested that that point might bere considered after Tuesday&apos;e Cabinet meeting.    He assured hiscolleagues that there was no question of cutting expenditure programmesbehind the backs of the spending Ministers - any decision on the composition of the steps needed to get to a lower PSBR would be amatter for Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssurnming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office19 November 1976
