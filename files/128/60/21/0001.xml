PARLIAMENTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the week beginning on 10 January.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, in the period up to Christmas, the Government had carried all the business whichhad to be carried before Christmas.    The Scotland and Wales bill had obtained its Second Reading; the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries Bill had been sent to the Lords; the Fisheries limits and National Insurance Surcharge Bills were due to receive royal assent that day;  and the Social Security BUI had started in committee.    It had not been possible to fit in Second Reading ofthe Water Charges Equalisation Bill, but it was hoped to do so soon after the House returned.    The main problem in the period betweenChristmas and Easter would be shortage of time for essentiallegislative business.    The Scotland and Wales Bill would need notless than two days a week; mere would have to be an average ofone Supply Day a week; and most Fridays would be taken up by private Members&apos; Bills.    In addition, it would be necessary tocomplete the progress of the Social Security Bill through bothHouses by the end of March; and there were eight other Bills(including one Bill combining the hitherto separate Bills on theInternational Monetary Fund, the Export Credits guarantee department liability limit, and Overseas Resources development and Overseas Aid) which ought also to have passed through bothHouses by about that date.    There would not be more man about one day a week for these Bills, so they would have to queue up for second Reading, and there could be no guarantee that they could begot through both Houses by the dates desired.    This list of eightBills excluded some important Bills, such as those on the CoalIndustry, Direct Elections to the European Assembly and price control and Counter Inflation.    It would not be possible to carry the Scotland and Wales Bill without a timetable motion at some stage;  and during the Second Reading debate the Prime minister had offered discussions with all Parties on how the time availablemight be allocated.    The Chief Whip had already initiateddiscussions through the usual channels, which he himself would befollowing up.    The official Opposition had been given an outline ofthe way in which time might be allocated; their initial reactionshad been negative and their further reactions slightly less so.There had also been tentative approaches to the other Parties.    Itwas just conceivable that the Opposition would agree to a timetable;they had their own difficulties on this Bill, and might not wish to spend unlimited time on it.    Unless some agreement could bereached, the Government would have to consider in the New Yearwhether to table a timetable motion for debate in the first week afterthe Recess.1
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe position on the programme as a whole could be summed up as satisfactory to date, and the Lord President and th^ Whips deservedcongratulations for keeping it up to schedule so far.    The handling of the Scotland and Wales Bill would require further considerationafter the Recess, and it would be useful to have a further reporton the progress of the legislative programme about a month afterParliament had returned.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2
WIND SCALENuclear WasteProposalPreviousReference:CM(76) 4ZndConclusionsMinute 72.        THE LORD CHANCELLOR reminded the Cabinet that theprevious week they had decided that British Nuclear Fuels Limited(BNFL) should be bsked to resubmit their planning applications for development at wind scale separately for the three projects, andmat only the application for one of them - a plant to reprocessoxide fuel - should be made the subject of an inquiry.    He and theSecretary of State for the Environment had been asked to consider what form of inquiry would be best for the purpose, bearing inmind the importance both of satisfying public opinion, and of speed,to minimise the risk of losing the substantial order in prospectfrom Japan for reprocessing work.    They had considered threepossibilities:  a planning inquiry commission, a non-statutoryinquiry and a normal statutory public inquiry,   A planning inquirycommission would be long drawn out so the effective choice was between the two latter suggestions.    The main arguments in favourof a non-statutory inquiry were speed and the ability to concentrate on the key issue of safety but it was likely to be faster than a planning inquiry only if it heard evidence mainly in private with no opportunity for cross-examination.    This was unlikely tosatisfy public opinion, which would demand that the majority ofthe sessions be public.    Moreover public opinion was less willingnow than in the past to accept the judgment of a panel of this kind,however eminent its members, and there was a risk that it mightbe seen as a device to evade the normal statutory planningprocedures, and challenged in the courts.    If this happened, or ifthe inquiry reached an inconclusive recommendation, a public inquiry might at ill have to be held, and time would have been lostrather than saved.    Hence they had decided that the best course was to adopt from the start the normal procedure of a publicplanning inquiry.    It would enable all the issues to be publiclyventilated, and provided that the presiding inspector maintainedfirm control, it should be possible to complete the proceedings in9 months from the submission of BNFL&apos;s revised application.    the choice of the presiding inspector would be very important, and hesuggested that Sir Douglas Frank, the Chairman of the lands tribunal and formerly leader of the planning bar would be verysuitable.    He should be supported by two assessors with expertknowledge of the subject.In discussion it was argued that the questions were not primarilyof a planning nature.    If the plant were to be built at all, Windscalewas the only appropriate site; the aspects of most concern to thepublic were such issues as the safety of its operation, the transportof plutonium and iriadiated fuel elements and the return ofplutonium to overseas customers.    these issues were hardlyappropriate to a statutory planning inquiry.    Moreover there seemed no reason why a non-statutory body should not follow theprocedure adopted by Royal Commissions, accepting evidence from
anyone who wished to submit it, and inviting some of those who had done so to give evidence orally but without formal legal procedures.Doubts were also expressed whether a public inquiry would in fact be able to complete its work in 9 months, and whether the presidinginspector, however competent, would be able to exclude irrelevantmatters which could waste a great deal of time.It was argued on the other hand that if a non-statutory inquiryfollowed the procedure of Royal Commiusions, it was unlikely tobe able to complete the task any faster than a public inquiry.    Thelatter would not have to take evidence from all who wished to give it: this was a matter for the presiding inspector^ discretion.    Thelegislation prescribed that the safety, health and general welfare ofthe people were matters which planning inquiries ohould consider.The Secretary of State for the Environment could write to thechairman of the inquiry drawing attention to the principalconsiderations which he should take into account and urging him toproceed with all due speed.    The presiding inspector could admitevidence on any matter which he considered relevant but equallyrule out irrelevant and repetitive matter.    During the inquiry onthe installation of a floating buoy near Anglesey to enable tankersto off-load oil, evidence had been admitted on the general oil needsof the country and on the ecological effects of spillage.    Whendecisions based on public inquiries took a long time, this was oftenthe result of delay in setting them up, or of dealing with therecommendations in Whitehall.    The Japanese did not expect tosend their first consignment of irradiated fuel for reprocessing,under the new contracts, for at least 18 months, but this did not mean that they would be prepared to wait as long as mat for adecision.    It might be useful to explain our problems to theJapanese Ambassador.    Other things being about equal there waseverything to be said for following the normal procedures of the planning Acts as any departure from them would arousecontroversy.    There were good grounds for hoping that dieinspector would recommend a go ahead for the project; but if he did not mere would be a major issue for consideration by Cabinet.In further discussion it was noted that the Chairman of the UnitedKingdom Atomic Energy Authority had written to a number of theDepartments concerned reminding them that In a Parliamentaryanswer cn 12 March the Governmenfs decision to authorise BNFLto take on oxide fuel reprocessing work from overseas had been announced.   He had urged that any inquiry should be confined to the safety of a particular plant at a particular site, avoiding wider issues which might cast doubt on our intention to provide any reprocessingfacilities for oxide fuels.    It was not possible fully to meet thispoint but as much reassurance as possible should be given to potentialoverseas customers in replies to supplementary questions after thestatement which the Secretary of State for the Environment would be making that afternoon,4
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said matalthough several Ministers had expresssd reservations, on balance the Cabinet accepted the recommendation by the Lord chancellor and the Secretary of State for the Environment that the planningapplication should be submitted to a statutory planning inquiry andthat the Secretary of State for the Environment should announce thisdecision that afternoon.    They also agreed that the Lord chancellor should approach Sir Douglas Frank to ascertain whether he was willing to act as presiding inspector.    The Secretary of State should send a letter of guidance to the inspector, when appointed, drawinghis attention to the importance of safety and environmental effectsrather than questions of location of the reprocessing plant.    Heshould also consider who might be invited to assist as expertassessors, and submit proposals on this to the Prime Minister.The arrangements, for holding the inquiry should be completed as quickly as possible.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theLord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for the environment to be guided accordingly.5
MERIDEN 3.        The Cabinet had before them a minute from the ChancellorMOTORCYCLE        of the Duchy of Lancaster to the Prime Minister datedCO-OPERATIVE       21 December reporting the conclusions of a group of Ministers(GEN 55(76) 1st Meeting) on possible forms of assistance to theMeriden motorcycle co-operative,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy had asked a group of Ministers under his chairmanship to consider proposals of possible means of enabling the co-operative to continue in operation for a period.    The only basis for assistance which seemed acceptable to the group was for the Government to subordinate its existing loan to Meriden to the interests of othercreditors, thus possibly enabling the co-operative to borrowelsewhere, and to capitalise the interest due in January.    If such assistance weve provided, however, it shculd be subject to thecondition that there should be no substantial increase in the stocksof motorcycles which had to be financed by the Government andthat the co-operative must persuade Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT)to continue to market its product in acceptable quantities and atacceptable prices.   Although the co-operative had substantialachievements to its credit their fortunes were wholly dependent ona machine which was coming to the end of its commercial life.Their difficulties were the greater because they lacked managementexpertise and because the economic conditions in which they were operating were more difficult than they had been when they werecreated so that alternative work was hard to find.    The Governmenthad shown itself flexible and prepared to experiment through its initial support of the co-operative, but further investment of newfunds could not be justified.    The Cabinet should be aware that even the provision of limited assistance such as he had describedwould cause problems.    The Attorney General had advised that awaiver of interest and subordination of the Governmenfsinvestment could result in claims against the Government underSection 332 of the Companies Act 1948,    While he did not question the legal advice he did not however consider that the practicaldanger for the Government on this score was great.    consideration would also need to be given to the presentation of such a policy tothe Public Accounts Committee.    He had been advised by the accouting Officer of the Department of Industry that he would not feel able to justify the subordination of the Governmenfsinvestment to the interests of other creditors except on the grounds that the Ministers had so directed, since there would not be acommercial justification for such subordination.    Finally he shouldwarn the Cabinet that even action such as he had described did not hold out any great prospect of enabling the co-operative to survivefor any substantial period.6si.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that whenassistance had been provided to the Meriden co-operative in 1974it had been made clear, as in the case of assistance to otherco-operatives, that this was once and for all.    The co-operativefaced a very difficult position because the crucial United Statesmarket was dominated by the Japanese industry and its only product,the Bonneville motorcycle, was an obsolescent design.    Theco-operative&apos;8 cash position had been steadily deteriorating and areport by Price Waterhouse made clear that there was no possibility of their finding interest of  203, 000 they were due topay to the Government in January.   A further report by theBoston Consulting Group indicated that the only possibility of achieving      viability would be to concentrate on the low volumelarge motorcycle market but that this would involve a minimuminvestment of  6- 8 million and a similar amount in finance fromthe Export Credits Guarantee Department.    He could not recommend the        investment of such sums to provide employment for 700 men with a low prospect of long term viability in contravention of theprevious earlier commitment that the assistance provided toMeriden was once and for all.    The co-operative themselvesbelieved that much smaller sums were needed but he consideredthey were mistaken.    The Ministerial Committee on Economicand Industrial Policy had concluded that the co-operative&apos;s wishto take over itself the responsibility for marketing its productsshould not be supported.    While he did not recommend a major new investment he hoped that the Cabinet would agree to limitedmeasures described by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,which might enable the co-operative to continue for a limited period.In discussion it was argued that the decline of the motorcycleIndustry was araicrocosm of the wider decline of British industry.Over a period of 25 years it had suffered from a succession of badmanagements and from successive plans for reorganisation drawnup by consultants.    The experiment of Meriden had excited theLabour movement but in fact the Governmenfs assistance had beenhedged with conditions as to the once and fur all nature of finance and requirements of viability which did not apply to assistance to private industry.    The violent opposition from industrialists to the experiment was motivated by fear that workers would see inco-operatives an alternative to accepting dismissal.    There weresuspicions that NVT had deliberately held down sales of Meriden&apos;smachines so as to damage the co-operative&apos;s prospects.    It was wholly unreasonable to expect the co-operative In 18 months to reverse the decline of 25 years.    The worxerB at Meriden were convinced of their future prospects and the Cabinet had to decide whether to back the workers or the consultants.    The right coursewould be to decide that ways must be found to recreate a major Britishpresence in the growth market offered by the motorcycle industry.7
On the other hand it was argued strongly that the Government^earlier assistance had been based on advice from the sponsors ofthe co-operative that there was a market for 24, 000 motorcyclesa year.    In practice sales the previous year had been only 6, 000and existing stocks were 5, 000.    The market open to Meriden wasnot a growth market.    It was one which was becoming dominated by the Japanese,    To provide assistance to this industry wouldmean taking it away from others with greater prospects of success.The decline of the industry had been accelerated by the decisionsof the present Government to assist Meriden at the expense of otherplants.    Continued assistance to Meriden would be politicallydamaging: many workers in the Birmingham area believed thatthey had lost their jobs for Meriden&apos;s benefit.    Moreover it wouldbe wholly unsatisfactory to insist as part of the new package ofassistance that NVT continued to market Mexiden*s output.    Theyhad been induced against their will to accept responsibility formarketing because they had been led to believe that this would resultin other assistance from the Government which had not in fact beenforthcoming.    Nevertheless NVT had the strongest of commercialmotives to achieve the highest possible sales of the machines theybought from Meriden, and suspicions that such sales had beenartificially restricted should be discounted.In relation to the limited measures of assistance put forward bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster it was argued on the onehand that they would extend the life of the co-operative at no realcost.    The loan which it was proposed to subordinate was neverin fact likely to be repaid and the interest which it was proposed should be waived could not in any case be paid.    While theselimited measures might prove ineffective because they were dependent on continued marketing by NVT, and while the conditions to limit the build-up of stocks might in any case require a cut backof employment they would offer the co-operative some furtherprospects.    Even if liabilities were incurred under Section 332the total amount owed to creditors at present was only  l  million,some of which was owed to the Government.    On the other hand itwas argued that it was clear that the experiment at Meriden had failed and that it would be unwise to prolong its death throes,THS PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said mat while there were differing views the balance of opinion with the cabinet was that it would not be a good use of resources to make the large scale investment which would be required to offer any prospect ofviability to the co-operative.    If no new finance were to be provided the question whether the limited measures recommended by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should be offered became a difficult question for tactical judgment.    The Secretary of Statefor Industry should consult further with the co-operative and with8
Mr Jack Jonet of the Transport and General Workers Union,    if in the course of these consultations he judged it wise to offer thesubordination of the Governments existing loan and thecapitalisation of the interest due to the Government in Januarysubject to the conditions set out in the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster^ minute he was authorised to do so.    He should howevermake clear that the Government would provide no new finance andthat the assistance offered would depend on the co-operative being able to make satisfactory arrangements with NVT for the continuedmarketing of their products.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Industry to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office22 December 19769
