A tablesetting out the position reached at the previous discussion was handed round at the beginning of the meeting.    The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (CP(76) 127)about pensions increases in the public sector.^1 Meals THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet appeared to have a choice between reducing the unitcost of a school meal, by replacing the present hot meal service with a pre-packed cold meal with milk, or reducing the entitlementof staff to free meals.    The former did not find favour with theCabinet, and it was therefore agreed that savings of  10 million in1977-78 and  10 million in 1978-79 should be made by reducing staffentitlement to free meals.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the primeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.KSecurity        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that something likeone-fifth of all public expenditure went on social security payments.Previously this programme had been sacrosanct, and the otherfour-fifths of public expenditure had taken the brunt of all cuts.By their policy over the last few years the Government had reduced the differential between the living standards of those in work and the
living standards of those in receipt of long-term benefits; but ifthis process were continued under the existing statutory mechanismit could produce a backlash which could damage the Party.    be referred to the poverty trap and to the fact that the uprating ofSupplementary Benefit in 1977-78 would cost  620 million, while to give the same advantage to those in work through a revalorisationof tax allowances would cost something like  1, 240 million.    Thiscost could be met by increasing the rate of Value Added Tax to12^- per cent across the board, and this might be a sensible stepto take; but it would add 2 per cent to the Retail Price Index (RPI),and this would only be possible as part of a wider negotiation onRound 3 of incomes policy.    In his view if the Government did not take some action to prevent a further narrowing of the gap betweenthe low paid and those not in work, there would be a revolt amongthe low paid which would sweep the Government out of office.    Hewould therefore favour legislation to enable the Government touprate benefits in line with net earnings, instead of in line with prices, thus saving  160 million in 1977-78 and  430 million in1978-79,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES argued thatthere was undoubtedly a problem over the poverty trap which needed to be tackled; but it should be done in open debate with the tradeunions, as part of a revision of the social contract.    It was quite impossible to take a decision on such a matter in the context ofthe current exercise, and to announce it without any prior consulation.    It would in any case need fuller discussion in cabinet, when he would himself wish to put hi a detailed paper.In discussion it was argued that it would be unthinkable to worsenthe position of recipients of social security benefits at a time when,by the other elements in the package, the Government was creatingadditional unemployment.    What were at stake were the principlesupon which the country1 s social security system was founded, andit would be wrong to change them in the course of constructing thepresent package.    In any case, the necessary legislation would notbe passed by the House of Commons,   This was true, not only ofsome adjustment to the statutory basis for uprating benefits, butalso of changes to such features of the system as earnings-relatedbenefit supplement.    On the other hand it was argued that, if theCabinet were concerned about the weakest members of thecommunity, the weakest were not necessarily those in receipt of benefits, but those in geriatric and mental hospitals, and smallchildren in nursery Bchools in deprived urban areas, whoseinterests the Cabinet were subordinating in their decision to cut the construction elements in the Health and Education programmes.The truth was that the narrowing of the gap in living standardsbetween those in work and those not in work had gone on too rapidly,2
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the possibility floated in his memorandum was that the automatic link between increases in public service pensions and price rises should be suspended.   Ifpublic service pensions were uprated in line with net earnings itwould save about  13 million in 1977-78 and  91 million in 1978-79.Savings in the rest of the public sector might amount to half as muchagain.    He reminded Cabinet that there were over one million publicservice pensioners (and over half a million in the rest of the public sector) many of whom received very small pensions.   For thisreason the proposal would be easier to implement if at the sametime action were being taken to restrict the uprating of social security benefits.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit had been argued on the one hand that public service pensionershad done a good deal better than most private sector pensioners inthe last two years; that to restrict future increases would be popular; and that it could be done regardless of the decision on social security benefit.    On the other hand it was held that such astep would provoke the opposition of a whole series of well-organisedbodies representing the staff affected - not only civil servants, butthe police, firemen, teachers and nurses.    There was no agreement in Cabinet on thiB point, and therefore no saving could be scoredunder this head at present.The Cabinet -3.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.3 *HC SectorVisionsand it was time to rein back the rate of change for a while.    one other possibility would be to withdraw child tax allowances from non-resident children, which could save  20 million in 1977-78and  15 million in 1978-79; but this, while it might be accepted in parliament, would be seen as a breach of an agreement withthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) and would hit some of the poorestpeople in the world,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was clear that views in Cabinet were divided on this issue, and that no agreement could be recorded for the moment.The Cabinet -2. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion
TOP SECRETiTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that at their meetingthe previous day the Cabinet had provisionally scored  100 million of saving in each year from minor reductions across all nationalised industries, and had commissioned him to report how this might beachieved.    He reminded Cabinet that the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries was no longer defined as public expenditure;but cuts in that capital expenditure which reduced the borrowing ofthe industries from the Exchequer would reduce the public sectorborrowing requirement (PSBR).    Without having consulted either theindustries or the sponsoring Ministers, he thought it should bepossible to get  100- 150 million from this source.    However, the short Term Economic Forecast had already subsumed  100 million of this s so that he would not look for a net saving of more than 50 million to be scored in the present exercise.    On increasingprices, he thought that  50 million might be had from an increaseof 8 per cent in gas charges.    On an increase in telecommunicationscharges, he pointed out that there was already a profit of 400 million in that field, so that the industry&apos;s capital expenditure was already 99 per cent self-financing.    The Government had,with considerable difficulty, got away from the distortion whichhad affected nationalised industry prices as a result of their havingbeen held down in the wider interests of general prices policy, andto press the industries now to make further increases would not bewell received.    It would also be contrary to the recommendation in        &apos;the recently received report of the National Economic DevelopmentOffice, which favoured less Government interference in theindustries.    He therefore proposed  50 million net from minorcapital expenditure savings, and  50 million from an increase in ;gas prices.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere was some feeling in Cabinet that action of the kind proposed would be damaging to the industrial strategy, and, indeed, that itwas irresponsible to consider changes of this kind other than in full consultation with the industries concerned.    On the other hand, the damage it would do might well be less than that resulting from some alternative reduction elsewhere.    The Cabinet noted that an increaseof 5 per cent in telephone charges would yield  120 millions, butgiven the present high level of Post Office profits it was felt that toimpose such a charge would be treating it as a source of indirect jtaxation.    On balance the Cabinet were in favour of scoring a total 1saving of  100 million here in each year, partly to be obtained &apos;through reductions in capital spending and partly through the increasein gas prices, although the Chief Secretary, Treasury should consultin the next few days with the Ministers directly concerned in order !to settle how it should be achieved. 1.i4
The Cabinet -4. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that he proposed theabolition of the fiat rate  2 Regional Employment Premium (REP) which,although it was a Manifesto commitment, was now meaningless asan incentive.   Abolition would save  150 million in 1977-78 and 170 million in 1978-79,In discussion it was argued that REP was the least effective of all forms of regional assistance, representing only 2 per cent of wagecosts, at which level it was ignored by industrialists.    Its impact on employment had now been swamped by the impact of theTemporary Employment Subsidy.    Moreover unemployment was now a problem which affected the whole country and not just thedevelopment areas.   Against this it was argued that the abolitionof REP could cost 10-15, 000 jobs in Northern Ireland, where unemployment was already lOj per cent, and a further 4, 500 jobs in Wales.,    The gap between assisted and non-assisted areas hadbeen greatly narrowed by the Governments regional policies until recently, but the gap was now widening, which made the abolitionof REP a difficult step.    It could be argued that in some cases theloss of REP would push an industrialist into making an applicationfor Temporary Employment Subsidy, so that there might be littlenet saving,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,while there was a majority in Cabinet in favour of abolition, theycould for the moment do no more than take note of that fact.The Cabinet -5.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be a cut of  1 million in 1978-79 inthe expenditure of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and took note that the Minister of Agriculture would consider whether it wouldbe possible to make a reduction of up to  10 million from agriculturalgrants.5Sik Payment
The Cabinet -6.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.Credits        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the positionas set out in the memoranda by himself and by the Secretaries ofState for Trade and for Industry, circulated under cover of notes by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP(76) 113 and 114) had now beenovertaken by further events.    He had discussed the matter withthe other Ministers concerned, and the Secretary of State for trade had since consulted the major firms involved to see whether itwould be possible to achieve a sufficient switch from sterlingfinancing into foreign currency financing without the increase of2 per cent in the rate of interest charged for guaranteed sterlingfinance which he had proposed.   As a result it now seemed likely that it should be possible to obtain a substantial switch in 1978-79.He himself would accept this as satisfactory if it were possible toagree at the same time that there should be a cash limit for the next two years placed upon the level of sterling financing.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that it was nottechnically possible for him to accept a cash limit on the sterlingfinancing, since he did not control the level of that financing whichwas itself a function of, on the one hand, the level of export creditmade available and, on the other, the level of bank deposits.    Buthe was quite clear that he could produce a sufficient saving in1978-79 tc offset what would otherwise be an additional bid of 150 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,in addition to the change proposed by the Secretary of State for Trade,an attempt should be made to persuade the clearing banks to take ayet higher proportion of this finance themselves.    On this basis theChancellor of the Exchequer should consider whether savings of 100 million in 1977-78 and  100 million in 1978-79 (the latter figureon the assumption that tha additional bid in that year was whollyoffset by switching into foreign currency financing) could be scored.The Cabinet -7.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion,6
THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had set out the positionreached in the Ministerial Committee on Energy in his memorandum(GP(76) 115).    The question for decision was whether, if it proved impossible to sell the former Burmah shareholding in british petroleum (BP) because of the claim for restitution which theBurmah Oil Company had brought against the Bank of England,the Government should instead sell part of their own shareholdingand replace it with the former Burmah holding,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, while he accepted the sale of the bulk of the former Burmah shareholding,the Governmenfs own shareholding should not be sold.    The shareshad been purchased in 1914 by Sir Winston Churchill; they had notbeen sold through two World Wars; and they would undoubtedlyrise in value.    To sell them would be against both the Labour PartyManifesto and the latest version of the social contract.    It wouldmake a nonsense of the Governmenfs oil policy, where theGovernment was seeking a majority holding in all North Sea oilactivities; and would be ill received in Scotland.    It would beseen as a psychological defeat for the Labour Party and wouldmake no contribution to the problems of the country.    Indeed, itwas hard to see why the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shouldbe impressed by it, since it in no way improved the economicsituation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere was a general feeling in Cabinet that the Burmah oil company should be pressed strongly not to persist in their claim for restitution, but to substitute for it a financial claim whichwould thus release the former Burmah shareholding for sale.However, the general view was that the Government should, ifnecessary, sell sufficient of their own shareholding to reduce thetotal joint shareholding of the Government and the Bank of england to not less than 51 per cent, the proceeds of such a sale beingestimated at about  500 million in 1977-78.    Sale of these shareswould be a good deal less painful than any alternative saving of 500 million could possibly be.The Cabinet -8.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.7
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the reductions which had, withsome reservations, been provisionally agreed so far totalled 954 million in 1977-78.    Thlo left no room for additional expenditure to counter unemployment, as proposed by the Secretaryof State for Employment in his memorandum (CP(76) 119).    Itwould therefore be necessary to run through the list of possiblesavings a second time.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider each programme again,with the following result:i. Defence: No change.ii. Overseas Aid: No change.iii. Food subsidies: The agreed savings were amended to  160 million in 1977-78 and  57 million in 1978-79.iv. Construction; The savings in respect of health and personal social services were increased from  5 million and  10 million to  10 million and  20 million respectively;and the savings in respect of the Property Services Agencywere increased from  20 million and  30 million to 37 million and  60 million respectively.v*        Roads; No change.    It was noted that the agreedsavings were in respect of Great Britain, and that Scotlandand Wales would take their usual proportions of 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of the total figure.vi. Nationalised industries: No change.vii. Housing: No change.viii. Community Land: No change.ix. Health: On prescription charges, it was noted thatthe Cabinet remained disagreed on whether an increase onthe scale proposed should be made.    On other national health Service expenditure, the savings of  10 million ineach year were reduced to  5 million in each year (a consequential of the changes made above under&quot;Construction&quot;).8
J*We THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet were still short of the^Ocedure total savings needed.    They should meet again at 8.00 pm whenthey must decide a definitive package for the fiscal adjustment.The Cabinet -9.        Took note with approval of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office6 December 1976
