1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that it was usual tohave one day on the Floor of the House each Session on Welsh affairs.The last such debate, a year ago, had followed the debate on theremaining Commons stages of the Welsh Development Agencylegislation; barely two hours had been available and time had to befound to resume tha debate three weeks later.   He was anxious toavoid any repetition this year of mat unsatisfactory arrangement, andhis first priority on Monday 1 november was the Report and third reading of the Development of Rural Wales Bill.   He very muchdoubted whether time would remain for a general debate on welsh affairs after both the debate on the Motion to appoint a SelectCommittee to investigate the allegations against Members ofParliament, which might require considerable time, and the remaining stages of his Bill,    He would prefer that the general debate on welsh affairs should not be announced for that day, and that a better time forthis debate should be sought later in the spillover,THE CHIEF WHIP subsequently reported that arrangements could bemade for a debate or resumed debate on Welsh affairs on Friday5 November in place of the debate on the highway code, or later in thespillover, perhaps while awaiting Lords amendments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat if the debate were postponed beyond the following week therewould be a risk of its being overtaken by events, and it would be better to arrange the general debate on Welsh affairs on Friday 9 November.The Cabinet -1.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.1
itteeeire o fousfence:28thC^Sion3,1The Cabinet were Informed of the order of reference and compositionso far proposed for the Select Committee on the Conduct of Members.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the outstanding point of difficulty,which had emerged from his consultations with the Opposition Parties,related to the proposal, which the Cabinet had favoured at their last meeting, that the Select Committee should sit in private.    The presentposition was that any Select Committee had power to exclude membersof the public from their proceedings and that Members of Parliament,who had a right to attend the proceedings in that these were formallypart of the proceedings of the House itself, were generally prepared towithdraw simply on a request to do so.    The Opposition were very strongly in favour of imposing a requirement on the Select Committeeto exclude Members of Parliament as well as members of the publicon the basis that the order of reference should also require theCommittee to publish, together with their report, all such oral ordocumentary evidence considered by them as appeared to them to be relevant and admissible.    This, in the Opposition^ view, would strike the right balance between avoiding any appearance of a cover-up andprotecting Members against the spread of unfounded allegations.   he himself had much sympathy with this view, although to impose a requirement on the Committee in the sense suggested would be anunusual step and would be bound to be controversial.hi discussion it was recognised that a requirement of the kind proposed would lead to considerable criticism from many back-benchers.    Even giving the Select Committee a discretionary power to exclude Members of Parliament, who were not members of theCommittee, would provoke a good deal of criticism, particularly sfecethe precedents showed that such a power had not been given since 1857,Comparisons would be drawn between the privacy being accorded to members of Parliament whose conduct was being investigated ascompared with private citizens in the courts.   Even Tribunals of inquiry were normally open to the public.    Some awkwardness might also arise from the difficulty of applying any effective sanction if, forexample, a Member were to publish evidence which he had submittedto the Select Committee and for which he might claim parliamentary privilege.    In favour of giving the Committee a discretionary power,rather than a direction, to exclude Members of Parliament as well asthe public, it was argued that the Select Committee would be&apos; wellcomposed to exercise this power wisely.    On the other hand, it waspointed out that if a power and not a direction were given, theOpposition might throw the whole matter open to debate and press fora Tribunal of Inquiry, for which there might be considerable public support.   Such a Tribunal or any other inquiry of a quasi-legal nature would be wholly inappropriate to the investigation of matters whichwere essentially the domestic concern of the House and which were not substantially of a different order from matters habitually dealt with by
the Committee of Privileges,   The analogy of proceedings in a courtof law, which were not by any means invariably open to the public, wasnot apt, since in their case there were specific charges, known to the defendants beforehand, and scurrilous and inadmissible evidencecould be ruled out.    There was a defensible case therefore forrequiring the Select Committee to exclude Members of Parliament aswell as the public from their proceedings, provided that they were also required to publish their report and the relevant evidence at theend of their taskt    This would at least enable any groundlessallegations in the evidence to be disposed of at the same time ratherthan be the subject of publicity and speculation over several months,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were conscious that a proposal that the Select Committeeshould be required to exclude Members of Parliament and members ofthe public from their proceedings would be strongly attacked by some sections of the House and the public.    Nevertheless, the cabinet agreed that, when combined with the proposed requirement to publish the relevant evidence together with the report, this would offer thebest hope, in the unusual circumstances of an inquiry of this kind, of reconciling the aim of a full and thorough investigation with the need to limit the spread of allegations which might be groundless.    The HomeSecretary would accordingly arrange, subject to his final consultations with the Opposition Parties, for a Motion to be tabled that eveningsetting out the composition and order of reference of the Committee,on the lines agreed in discussion, and the debate on the Motion wouldbe arranged for Monday 1 November.The Cabinet -Z, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.ltfce THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Opposition in the House of Lordshad been sounded about their attitude in the event of an extension of the*Qgj^&quot;&quot;Ve present Session, and had not been very forthcoming, though Iney hadTaTnQ agreed not to hold up the Governmenfs business deliberately.    Theywould give no specific undertakings about getting the business through,&quot;a^eno since they could not control their own backbenchers or cross-bench orpH(7$\ *: Liberal Peers, but they accepted mat an extension would help.    Their(iS*us i attitude in any dispute with the House of Commons over Lords^itg j 118 * amendments would depend upon the political atmosphere at the timeand the attitude of the Commons,    They wished to see some positivereturn for all their hard work on the major Government Bills; and, if their amendments wore rejected wholesale by the Commons, this couldcause Conservative backbench Peers to insist on some of these
amendments.   He regarded extension of the Session as vital.    Thiswould demonstrate the Governments determination to get their Billsthrough, though he could not guarantee success, and it would place the blame firmly on the Lords If this proved impossible.THE CHIEF WHIP, HOUSE OF LORDS, said that without an extensionthe Health Services BUI would be lost, and possibly another Bill.Disputes over Lords amendments,* requiring a second exchange ofmessages between the two Houses, were likely to arise onthe aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries and Dockwork Regulation Bills, and possibly on the Education 3111; it was essential to provide sufficient time forthese exchanges.THE HOME SECRETARY said that. If the start of the new Session wereto be postponed, it would still be possible to take the Second Reading ofthe Devolution Bill before Christmas, by deferring until after theChristma3 Recess other business which it had been planned to takebefore Christmas,In discussion it was suggested that care should be taken in the timing of Ministerial speeches criticising the House of Lords.   An onslaughton the Lords now would rouse them still further, which would not helpin getting the Governments legislation through.    Most people In thecountry were much more concerned about hew the Government weretackling their economic problems than about the progress oflegislation.    Against this it was argued that the Lords, encouraged bythe Leader of the Opposition, were making amendments of a wreckingcharacter which went far beyond the role of a revising Chamber; and ministerial criticism of this behaviour helped with government supporters and with the trade unions.    Unemployment would in factresult if the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill did not reachRoyal Assent this Session, and the right of an elected Government toget their legislation through must be defended.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that at theCabinet meeting on 26 October there had been a clear majority forextension of the Session, and the Cabinet now confirmed their decisionto extend the present Session, which would be well worth while If theGovernment could then obtain all their major Bills.    Wednesday24 November would be the most convenient day for the Opening of thenew Session.    This decision should be announced by the HomeSecretary that afternoon In the course of the Business Statement, andan appropriate announcement should also be made in the House ofLords.    Any references which Ministers chose to make in speechesabout obstruction in the House of Lords should of course be directed tothe actions of the Tory Peers; the Cabinet much appreciated the goodwork of Labour Peers in recent weeks.
The Cabinet -3, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.5
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said it seemed likely that the Conference would open mat afternoonwithout any pre-conditions having been made by the participants.At Mr Richard&apos;s meeting with Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe yesterday,fee latter had again pressed that he should go to Geneva to open the Conference.    He had decided not to do so on three grounds.First, it would have the effect of weakening Mr Richard&apos;s position;second, mere would be a risk that it would be seen as giving wayto the nationalist demands to negotiate with the British Governmentrather than with Mr Smith; and, third, it could lead to more direct United Kingdom involvement in the proceedings, to whichthe Cabinet were opposed.    He bad also been urged to agree to the attendance of observers at the Conference,    On balance he had concluded that there would be advantage in admitting, in additionto representatives of the front-line Presidents, representativesof Mauritius, which held the Presidency of the Organisation of african Unity, and of fee Commonwealth Secretary General.The United States had not sought observer status.   As regardsthe prospects, mere would be pressures on Mr Smith, who couldnot reckon to restore the situation as it was six months ago.There would also be pressures on the nationalists, in mat thealternative to a successful outcome of the Conference would be a return to the bush: neither Mr Nkomo nor Bishop Muzorewawanted this.    Furthermore if they were to back out the fieldwould be left to Mr Mugabe or possibly to someone else as yetunknown, so they would wish to avoid a breakdown.    There were clearly major difficulties ahead: but, while he could not claim tobe optimistic, he did not rule out the possibility of success.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
3.        The Cabinet had before them a paper by the Lord Chancellor(CP(76) 95) covering drafts of The QueenS Speeches on the prorogation of Parliament end the Opening of the new Session whichhad been prepared by The Queens1 s Speeches and Future Legislation(QF) Committee.The Cabinet approved the draft Prorogation Speech, subject to deletionof the words &quot;In consultation with other Governments&quot; at the beginningof the paragraph on Rhodesia on page 1, and to reconsideration of the wording of the second sentence of the final paragraph on page 3, whichreferred to encouragement of a &apos;nigh and stable level of building for owner-occupation&quot;.THE LORD CHANCE smaller said that the QF Committee had recommended that the Speech should not promise the introduction next session of more legislation than there might be time to complete.The decision now taken to extend the present Session would mean fewerdays available for legislation next Session than had been expected whenthe draft Opening Speech had been considered by the Committee, and itmight now be necessary to take the painful step of excluding someBills mentioned in the Speech,    Some Ministers, however, had asked that additional Bills should appear in the Speech.    But not mentioninga Bill in The Queen&apos;s Speech did not mean mat the Bill could not beintroduced, if time should in the event prove available.The Cabinet then considered the draft Speech paragraph by paragraph,and the following points were made:Page 1. 3rd paragraph.     The Minister for Overseas Development, who could not be present, had proposed that the second sentence should say that overseas aid would Increasingly be directed towards the poorest developing countires because, without the added word&quot;increasingly&quot;, this sentence did not take account of the fact thatoverseas aid was by no means exclusively directed to such countries.It was pointed out, however, that &quot;increasingly&quot; might seem to implyan increasing total of aid) and it was agreed to leave this sentenceunchanged, subject to further consideration at the Cabinet^ nextdiscussion of the Speech.Page L.    The penultimate paragraph should say that the Government&quot;will introduce&quot; legislation on direct elections.7
Page 2.    In the let paragraph the second sentence should say that theGovernment were seeking progress In &quot;the negotiations to reduceforces in Central Europe&quot;.Pasre 2.    3h the 4th paragraph, on Northern Ireland, consideration should be given to making the second sentence read:  &quot;They are determined to combat terrorism and to maintain individual liberty andthe rule of law&quot;.    The passage at the end of page 5, on legislative proposals relating to complaints against the police in NorthernIreland, should appear at the end of this paragraph.Page 2.    The final paragraph should begin: &quot;My Government arepledged and determined to continue the attack on inflation ,. . &quot;,    Thesecond sentence should begin:  &quot;Success in this joint effort isessential for creating more jobs and for achieving the aim .    &quot;.Page 3.    The 3rd paragraph, on offshore oil, could be omitted; but itwas suggested that a reference should be inserted to the Coal industry bill, which was only a second priority Bill but which would containprovisions relating to the National Coal Board&apos;s borrowing limit whichcould become essential.Page 3.    It was suggested that the last line should say that legislation would be introduced &quot;to extend fishing limits to 200 miles at thebeginning of 1977&quot;; but whether this could safely be said would depend upon whether It was certain that the necessary legislation could be passed before Christmas.Page 4. 3rd paragraph.    It was appropriate to refer to &quot;legislative proposals&quot; on industrial democracy, a term of art which would cover the presentation either of a Bill, or of a White Paper which might havea draft Bill attached.     This paragraph contained no reference toconsultations following the publication of the Bullock Committee^Report.    It was argued that such a reference should not be insertedbecause it would be interpreted by the Trades Union Congress as a weakening of the Governments undertaking to introduce legislation inthe coming Session.    On the other hand, some strong supporters ofindustrial democracy would be anxious to ensure that there were adequate consultations before legislation was introduced, and inpractice consultations would undoubtedly be needed.    It was thereforeagreed to add, at the end of this paragraph, the words: &quot;and thenecessary consultations have taken place&quot;.   It was also suggestedthat, since it would not be possible to enact industrial democracylegislation next Session, this would make it the more important tointroduce next Session the legislation on occupational pensions schemes,which had the unanimous support of the Trades Union Congress,
US-CONFIDENTIALPaj*f^4e    The final paragraph should contain a reference to priority for the problems of inner cities, and the reference to proposals for a future strategy for housing should be made more explicit.Page 4.    The 4th paragraph, which reaffirmed basis Labour philosophy,was misplaced, and should appear as the final paragraph of the Speech,thereby avoiding an anti-climax.Page 5, 2nd paragraph.    The annual increase in pensions and other social security benefits would now have taken place before the Openingof the new Session, but the wording of this paragraph should never-theless stand.Paffe 6, 1st paragraph. The reference to Scottish housing subsidieswas in square brackets because policy was not yet agreed, but policy was expected to be settled before the Speech was delivered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had agreed a number of amendments to the two draftSpeeches.    They had also identified several points where amendmentsshould be considered, and the Lord Chancellor, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, should now prepare amendments of thesepassages.   Any Ministers with suggestions for improving the language of passages on matters for which they were responsible should give theLord Chancellor their suggestions.    The Cabinet had reached no conclusions on which Bills should be promised in the Opening Speech.The QF Committee should meet again to consider this question in thelight of the decision to defer the start of the new Session until24 November, which might mean that one or two Bills mentioned in thedraft Speech would have to be omitted.     The Committee should be attended for this purpose by the Ministers responsible for the bills which were in question.    The Lord Chancellor should report back tothe Cabinet the conclusions reached by the Committee on prioritiesamong the Bills and on which Bills should be promised in the Speech,and should also circulate a revised version of the Opening Speech.The Cabinet would then resume their discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister *esumming up of their discussion and invited the LordChancellor to proceed accordingly.9

Several oi. the specific issues mentioned in the note would come up separately for Ministerial discussion and decision as theoccasion arose.    He had in mind to bring before Cabinet in earlyDecember a further assessment of priorities in the light of developments up to then.
