F&amp;ANGESIQOESIAfusions,1U THE PRIME MINISTER said he felt sure that at this firstmeeting following the recent Ministerial changes the Cabinet would wish to place on record their thanks to Mr Jenkins and Lord Shepherdfor the contribution which they had made to their deliberations and fortheir distinguished service both to the Party and to the nation.   At thesame time they would wish to welcome those members of the cabinet who were attending for the first time.   The Cabinet was a nnlqufinstitution and the privacy of their discussions was one of its most valuable assets.   They should be able to argue differences of opinionfreely and with comradeship within the Cabinet, but if there were leaksof their discussions this would not only make for personal divisionsbut would play into the hands of their political opponents.   He wishedto say how grateful he had been for the steps which Ministers hadtaken to maintain close contact with the Party: this was of the utmost importance as was the continuing dialogue over economic policy withthe Trades Union Congress.    It was difficult to foresee the politicalsituation In the period ahead but he was convinced of the importanceboth of carrying the Devolution Bill and of adhering to the Governmentsindustrial strategy.    Industry was not  n bad heart and if we could get through the next two or three years our economic position in the 1980sshould be very much better.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by thePrime Minister,2. The Cabinet discussed Rhodesia. Their discussion and theconclusions reached are recorded separately.3,        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary^FIT of state for Education and Science and Paymaster General (CP(76J 76). reporting the conclusions of the Social Services Committee onr^Otts proposals to phase in the full Child Benefit (CB) scheme and on^encej consequential problems arising from the phasing out of Child TaxW) 21st Allowances (CTAs).fusions,e 1 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENE.3AL said that the Social Services Committee had agreed with recomm andatjons made by the Secretary of State for
Social Services and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, that the schemewhich had been devised by the Working Party of the Labour Party/Trades Union Congress (TUC) Liaison Committee for phasing in fullCB in three years, beginning in April 1977, should be accepted by theGovernment.    For the first year CB would be made tax-free by removing tax and clawback and financing this by an equivalentreduction in CTAs.    The effect on take-home pay - a 70p reductionper family - would be the same as in the Governments present scheme, announced in May, for paying a new benefit for firstchildren.    For the two subsequent years, it would be open to theGovernment to consider how the phasing in of CB and phasing out ofCTAs should be apportioned, and also to consider the allocation ofadditional resources, beyond those released from the phasing out ofCTAs, to the CB rate.    But the full scheme would be introduced inApril 1979.    On the treatment to be accorded to the parents of non-resident children for whom CB would not be payable, the Cabinet had previously inclined to the view that CTAs should be retained for a transitional period of about five years.   A majority of the social services Committee, however, had favoured a three-year phasing outperiod for these parents on the same basis as for others; and theCommittee had agreed that if the Cabinet decided in favour of threeyears, the Home Office should give priority to the entry to this country of non-resident children In order to avoid hardship.    On students, theCommittee had concluded that the revenue from the withdrawal ofCTAs from their parents should be directed towards reducing parentalcontributions to the maintenance grant at least to the value of the CTAat the basic rate of tax: two-thirds of students whose parents wereassessed for parental contributions received either less than the full amount or none at all,   A solution on these lines would have thesupport of the National Union of Students,    But she would consider further with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the position of parentswhose incomes lay between the tax threshold and the starting point ofparental contributions since it was Important to fulfil so far aspracticable the Government^ previous assurances mat no-one would suffer from the Introduction of the full CB scheme.    She thereforeinvited the Cabinet to endorse the proposals for phasing in the CBscheme and for compensating the parents of students for thewithdrawal of CTAs; and to consider, in the light of the discussion bythe Social Services Committee, the treatment to be accorded to the parents of non-resident children.In discussion there was general agreement that in the new circumstances of a full commitment by the TUC to phasing in a tax-free benefit at the exj-once of CTAs, a proposal which was notdissimilar to one whiih had been discussed with, and rejected by,their representatives in the earlier consultations, the Governmentshould accept the Working Party&apos;s recommendations,   a was notedthat the figures for Iiland Revenue staff required for recodlngs in 1977
and 1978 included a large element of overtime working as distinct fromextra staff.   Further consideration would need to be given in due course to the amounts of resources to be transferred from CTAs to theCB rate in 1978 and 1979, but at the present 1979 seemed a better year for a major transfer.On the consequential treatment of the parents of non-re eident children,there was considerable support for the view that, in logic and equity,these parents should receive a cash benefit equal to CB and that,given the practical difficulties of this course, they should be allowedinstead to retain the full value of their CTAs indefinitely in respect ofeligible children overseas.    The view was expressed that although theWorking Party had not considered the position of non-residentchildren under their proposals for phasing in CB and although the TUC,in the earlier consultations, had strongly opposed any solution involvingdifferences in tak*-home pay for the same work, the TUC and LabourParty members of the Working Party would react adversely if adecision were taken to implement the proposals without any concession to non-resident children; and the lack of a concession wouldbe particularly difficult to defend when the cost of allowing a transitional period of, say, five years for the retention of full CTAscould be accommodated within the estimated cost of the schemealready announced by the Government,    There was therefore a serious risk that political and public reactions to the Government&apos;b acceptanceof the phasing in proposals would be largely soured by the belief that non-resident children had been treated unfairly.    It was howeverquestionable whether CTAs need be retained for longer than a specified period of transition.    On the other hand, it was argued that greaterdamage to race relations would be caused by a concession which wouldresult in a larger take-home pay for Immigrant workers.    suggestions that a phasing out period of three years for CTAs would create hard-ship for overseas children were not borne out by the average level ofremittances to families in the Indian sub-continent which, at  68annually to cover both wife and children, were several times less thanthe total value of the CTAs.    With regard to the implications forimmigration of a three-year phasing out period, It would be impracticable, without adding greatly to the waiting periods for entrygenerally, to select hardship cases for special priority.   Although the waiting periods for applicants in the Indian sub-continent at presentranged from nine to 23 months and there were 26, 000 awaitinginterview, there had been a striking improvement in the rate of issueof entry certificates last year as compared with 1974 (21,470 ascompared with 11,975).    There were therefore good grounds for thinking that most of the bona fide applicants would gain entry within the next three years; and it was doubtful whether a phasing out of CTAs would lead to an fncrease in applications.
On the treatment of parents of students, it was generally agreed&apos; matcompensation for the phasing out of CTAs should take the form, asproposed, of a reduction in parental contributions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the proposals pat forward by the working party of the Labour Party/TUC Liaison Committee for phasing in thefull CB scheme should be accepted on the basis that furtherconsideration would have to be given in due course to the amounts bywhich resources should be transferred from CTAs to the tax-free CBrate in 1978 and 19?9 and to the question whether any additional resources should be made available for the CB rate in those years.The Cabinet also agreed with the recommendations of the social services Committee that CTAs for the parents of students in higher education should be phased out over a corresponding period and thatthe resources so released should be used to reduce parental con-tributions by at lep st the equivalent of the value of the CTAs at the basic rate of tax.    They noted that the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, would give further consideration to theposition of parents whose incomes lay between the tax threshold and the starting point of parental contributions.   A clear majority of theCabinet were opposed to the phasing out of CTAs for parents of non-resident children on the same three-year basis as for other parentsand further consideration would need to be given to the questionwhether the alternative proposal, considered by the Social services committee, for the retention of CTAs in full for a transitional period should be adopted or whether, as several members of the Cabinet hadargued, full CTAs for these parents should be retained indefinitely.The Secretary of State for Social Services would announce the deciaioasin a Press statement that afternoon, the text of which Bhould be agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General.    So far as non-residentchildren were concerned, the statement should indicate that CTAs wouldbe retained in full in 1977-78 and that the longer-term arrangements forthese children would be settled and announced later.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;asumming up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.4
4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Education and Science and Paymaster General (CP(76) 77)recording the conclusions of the Ministerial Group on unemployment among Young People on the priorities between the various measures that had been proposed for action !n response to the growing problemof youth unemployment and also unemployment generally.    They also had before them a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 79)covering a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, on thestate of the contingency reserve both for 1976-77 and for 1977-78.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that the Ministerial Group onUnemployment among Young People had agreed unanimously torecommend to the Cabinet three measures - an additional  15 million for the Job Creation Programme,  6. 6 million for training in officeand clerical occupations and computer programming and operating,and  1.1 million to permit the local authority Careers Service to bemaintained at Its currently expanded level.    They had not however been able to agree on two other larger proposals - for a job releasescheme and for a scheme of educational maintenance allowances inEngland and Wales.    The majority of the Group supported theintroduction of both, but the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had reservedhis position on them and one or two other Ministers had also been opposed.    The job release scheme, to which the majority of the Groupaccorded the higher priority, would remove 65, 000 people from theunemployment register at a gross cost of  73 million.    The group had changed their earlier view and now recommended that theunemployed should be eligible.    A minority of the Group hadreservations on the grounds that the scheme would add to otherpressures for early retirement more generally, that it wasadministratively complicated and open to abuse.    Educationalmaintenance allowances would not affect youth employment until April1977 but were estimated to lead to 21,000 extra young people staying onin education In 1977-78 at a gross cost of  18 million, rising to 44,000by 1979-80 at gross cost of  24- 33 million.    The advantage of theseallowances was that they were relatively cheap and cost-effective: onthe other hand once introduced such allowances would be permanent and could be presented by  critics as paying pocket money to school-children.    The Secretary of State for Scotland had made the importantreservation that while he would support both of these two measures hewould ascribe still higher priority to continuation of the TemporaryEmployment Subsidy (TES), which was at present due to be closed to new applications at the end of the year.In discussion there was general agreement with the three minormeasures proposed by the Ministerial Group on Unemployment amongYoung People.    It was pointed .mt that the decisions on the measuresto be adopted needed to be seen against the most recent unemployment5t M PLOY ME NTWONGYOUNGous**ence***(76) 22ndfusions,te 4
figures.    Unemployment now was at its highest level since the warand the increase beyond l  million in the previous month had resultedin a much greater degree of criticism.    Youth unemployment figurestoo were very much higher than the previous year.    The Trades UnionCongress (TUC) had called publicly for very urgent steps to be tokenand supported the proposals for both the job release and educationalmaintenance allowances schemes.    It was of paramount importance that the Government retained the support of the TUC whose co-operation was indispensable for the Government&apos;b other policies.    Thewhole range of measures proposed were cheap, particularly whenoffsetting savings were taken into account.    The need for substantial action was particularly great in Northern Ireland where unemployment was in general twice as high as In the rest of theUnited Kingdom and where youth unemployment gave rise to a greatsecurity risk.    On the other hand it was argued that the Cabinet hadearlier taken a decision which must be irreversible, that any increase in public expenditure must be kept within the limit of the contingency reserve.    If both job release and educational maintenanceallowances were approved there would be very little left in the reserve for 1976-77 while the reserve for the following year, which was stillsix months away, would be much (smaller than had been available forthe current year.    If further decisions abosrbed any more of the1977-78 reserve it would be necessary to cut other programmes so asto restore it to a realistic size.   While there was always attraction in agreeing new measures account had to be taken of priorities.    Therewould undoubtedly be pressure to extend the TES, and commitmentshad been given to provide additional resources to the NationalEnterpriee Board and the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.It would therefore be wrong to pre-empt too large a proportion of thesmaller reserves outstanding by adopting both the measures nowproposed.In support of the job release scheme it was argued that this was theonly measure which could bring about an impact on the unemployment figures which was of a scale appropriate to the problem faced.    Itwas pointed out that the proposal was for the scheme to be used on an experimental basis in the assisted areas only.    Li fact the highestunemployment In the country was to be found in the inner city areas and in any review of the operation of the scheme this should be takeninto account.    It was argued strongly that If the scheme were intro-duced it should not be applied to the Civil Service.    To do so wouldconflict with a commitment under an Order in Council of 1969 to fillvacancies by open competition.    More generally the effect of thescheme would be to encourage retirement a year early.    The CivilService employed more than 10,000 people aged over 65,    The impact of accelerated retirement had not been given adequate consideration and no decision should be taken until this had been put right.6
In support of educational maintenance allowances it was argued thattheir cost-effectiveness as a means of reducing the number of unem-ployed was far greater than any of the other measures underconsideration.    Over and above this their introduction was a long-standing Manifesto commitment and there would be long-termadvantages to the economy from a larger number of children staying onin education.    It was however argued on the experience in NorthernIreland that the numbers taking advantage of the scheme were likelyto be very small unless there was an increase in the sixe of allowanceproposed.It was strongly argued that prolongations of the TES should be given ahigher priority than either of the other two measures.    The agreedanalysis of officials showed that its costs were more than offset byconsequential savings.   It made no sense whatever to discontinue ameasure which actually b*ved money.    Moreover it had provedextremely helpful in enabling companies with financial problems to bekept in existence while longer-term solutions to their problems were found.    On the other hand it was argued that as industry grew morefamiliar with the scheme they were becoming more sophisticated atexploiting it; threats of redundancy were brought forward so as to qualify for the subsidy.    It was also applied indiscriminately throughoutthe country at present.    It would be useful to consider whether any extension of it should be limited to particular areas.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the recommendations of the Ministerial Group onthe provision of more funds for the job creation programme, trainingin office and computer skills and the local authority Careers Service.They were also of the view, however, that it would not be right to limit themselves to these relatively small measures.    The degree of concern at the level of unemployment was very great both in the tradeunion movement and in the country at Urge.    There was a wide measure of support for the introduction of a job release scheme andthe only serious reservation was that this should not preclude theextension of the TES, at present due to be closed to new applicationsat the end of the year.    The cost in 1976-77 of a prolongation of theScheme would however be only  7 million and acceptance of the jobrelease scheme would not rule this out.    On this basis the cabinet agreed that the job release scheme should be introduced.    Sinceboth the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry were in favourof the unemployed being able to participate this was also agreed.    TheCabinet were not in a position to decide whether an exemption wasnecessary in the case of the Civil Service and this  should be reBolvedbetween the Ministers directly concerned.    There had not been substantial support for the scheme of educational maintenanceallowances in the context of the present package but furtherconsideration could be given both to this scheme and to the possible
extension of the TES later in the year.    When the Secretary of Statefor Employment announced these decisions he should not say thatthese two measures were still under consideration, but if Bpecificquestions were asked he might say that decisions on them had notyet been reached.    He should agree the text of hie statement with theMinisters directly concerned.    The Minister of State, Civil service department, should look at the Civil Service policy of retaining peopleover 65 years of age.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2,        Agreed that a job release scheme should beintroduced for a period of six months, confined tothe assisted areas, and that the unemployed shouldbe eligible to participate.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment and the Minister of State, CivilService Department, should agree between themselveswhether an exsption should be made in the case of theCivil Service.3.        Agreed the recommendations in CJ*(76) 77covering the job creation programme, training in office and clerical occupations and computerprogramming and operating, and for the localauthority Careers Service.4.        Invited the Secretary of State for employment to clear with the Ministers directly concerned the text of the statement announcing the decisions.5. Invited the Minister of State, Civil service department, to have the Civil Service policy of retaining people over 65 years of age examined.8
TYfiRESEN-TtVESMTTTEESNvious*&apos;ence r(76) 23rdlusions,te 35.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (CP(76) 78) about Ms proposal to make regulations and approve a code of practice under powers in the health and Safety at Work Act 1974, giving recognised trade unions the rightto appoint safety representatives and to oblige employers to set upsafety committees.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he had considered the possible courses put forward when the question of introducing the regulations had been discussed at Cabinet on9 September, and his memorandum set out his views on their relativemerits and practicality.    At a meeting the previous day between the secretaries of State for Education and Science, the Environment and scotland, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and himself, agreement hadbeen reached on the areas where the wide disparity lay between theestimates of the Health and Safety Commission and the localauthorities on the costs of implementing the regulations in the public sector.    It had been agreed that a working group of officials should examine this question over the next six weeks with the aim of producing fresh estimates on an agreed basis.    He would see that allthe Departments concerned were represented on the working group.He proposed that future consideration by Cabinet should be deferred until these estimates were available.    If this were agreed he proposed to inform the Trades Union Congress (TUC) of theGovernment decision, explaining that it arose from the difficulties in implementing the regulations in the public service area, and that these were being further examined.    He hoped to be able to persuade the tuc to acquiesce in this with relatively muted protests.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Employment.Element6.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe agreement reached the previous day between the National Union of seamen (McManus) and the shipowners was a good one which most of that morning&apos;8 Press had misrepresented.    There was for example no truth in the suggestion that many seamen were receiving more than  6 perweek in increased fringe benefits.    The main increase was in line withthe  4 limit.    The only case where an increase above  6 a week hadbeen conceded was that of the Merchant Navy Establishment Benefit orfallback pay, where the increase was  7. 20 a week for adult ratingsfor the first two weeks1 unemployment on leaving ship and  3. 60 a weekthereafter.    This increase was in accord with the pay policy.    Detailsof the agreement had been published by the National Maritime Board In
a Press Notice.    In his view the worst feature of the settlement wasthe prior commitment to give additional leave in lieu of captive time as soon as pay policy permitted.    ThiB would weaken the general lineagainst agreements to enter into prior commitments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwas most important that the true facts about the settlement with theNUS should be made clear over the next few weeks.    The Secretaryof State for Employment should arrange for a speaking note to beprepared for Ministers, who should do everything possible to make the true position known.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.

TffB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY*S government copy NO        36CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 24th ConcluaionB, Minute 2Thursday 23 September 1976 at 10, 00 am the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP(76) 80) describing the diplomaticactivity of the American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, in southern africa and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP(76) 81) covering a note by officials on proposals for financial inducements to persuadeWhite Rhodesians to remain in the country after independence.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that dr Kissinger began a further visit to Southern Africa on 14 September.After discussions with President Nyerere of Tanzania and president Kaunda of Zambia, and with their agreement, he had several lengthy meetings with the Prime Minister of South Africa,Mr Vorster, in which he explained his proposals for persuadingMr Smith to accept majority rule.   As a result of these meetings,Dr Kissinger decided to see Mr Smith himself, which he had done on19 September,    Dr Kissinger had given Mr Smith a document setting out a five-point plan for establishing majority rule within two years,with the intention that this document should form the basis of an &quot;offer&quot;to be made publicly by Mr Smith.    Dr Kissinger had told ub thatMr Smith had undertaken, subject to consulting his Cabinet colleagues and his Party caucus, to make such an offer before the end of thisweek.    Dr Kissinger had subsequently informed President Nyerereand President Kaunda of these developments.    The latter had warmly welcomed them, but President Nyerere was still suspicious.    It was uncertain what precisely Mr Smith would say; how the moderateAfricans would react to his statement; whether they would be able to restrain the guerrillas: and whether the Black African Oppositioncould put forward a united front.    It was therefore too early to say whether we were nearing a solution.   We had maintained contactthrough our Ambassadors with the African leaders and Dr Kissingerhad briefed our Ambassadors fully.   A Foreign and commonwealth office official had also travelled with his party.    Care had been takento avoid accepting any commitment which the Cabinet would not be1oub23*d^eions,*te l
prepared to underwrite, and this had caused some irritation to dr Kissinger.    We had made it clear that any British commitmentwould be contingent on the achievement of Black majority rule within amaximum of two years, and that any settlement must have the supportof at least three of the African Presidents.    In the course of had discussions Dr KIbsinger had nevertheless gone somewhat beyond what had been agreed with him during his last visit to London at thebeginning of September, in particular as regards the formulation and status of the five points In the document he had given to Mr Smith.We saw this document as no more than a basis for Mr Smith&apos;sstatement, and we were not committed to It.    Dr Kissinger had however seen it in terms of a commitment, provided it was acceptedby Mr Smith.    While not what we had intended, and while in the lightof our experience of previous negotiations with Mr Smith we were bound to be sceptical about his apparent change of heart, it was also important that we should not be put In the position of scapegoats in theevent of a breakdown or appear not to be giving full support to the  :Americans in this important initiative.    We were playing for highstakes and this was probably the last chance of a settlement.Breakdown would have serious consequences involving hostilities in southern Africa.    He hoped that when they came to discuss thefinancial paper, his colleagues would be prepared to accept some risksin view of the major importance of reaching a solution.    He and thePrime Minister would have an opportunity to seek further information from Dr Kissinger at a meeting later that day.In discussion it was strongly argued that there were grave risks ofour getting involved in the wrong way.    Events in Southern Africacould develop in such a way that we would find ourselves supportingWhites against Blacks.    Dr Kissinger was obsessed with the idea of communism spreading in Southern Africa and wanted to prevent anotherAngola.    It was in Mr Vorster&apos;s Interest to exploit this fear and thus to reduce pressure on South Africa.    It was suggested that this fearwas exaggerated and that no Black African Government, however muchCommunist support it received in order to achieve power, would    fremain loyal to its Communist backers.    It was important that weshould not find ourselves on the wrong foot in the event of a breakdown.Although we had constitutional responsibility for Rhodesia, we must avoid appearing to legitimise an unviable interim arrangement-    If, inaccordance with Point 4 of the document given by Dr Kissinger toMr Smith, we had to enact enabling legislation for the process towardsmajority rule, there was a risk that in the event of a breakdown wewould find ourselves in a position, similar to that before the unilateral declaration of independence fudi) and be once again fully involved in rhodesia: There were many snags ahead and it waspossible for the process to break down at any stage.    While the state department were behind the proposals, there was no evidence of popular interest or support in the United States or that Congress would
be willing to provide the finance.    So it could not be guaranteed that,if things looked like going wrong, the Americans would remaininvolved.    We should therefore need to proceed with extreme cautionif we were to avoid being landed with sole responsibility.It was argued, on the other hand, that, while the dangers were real,it was not possible to overlook the history of the past eleven years.Our interest was a long-standing one.    We had a debt of honour tothe black people of Rhodesia which would be paid by giving themmajority rule.    In any case we retained juridical responsibility underthe Rhodesia. Act and even now some of the Black African leaders were asking us to call a constitutional conference.    We could notevade our responsibilities even if we wished, although the risks involved were considerable.    It was true that Dr Kissinger was unlikely to be in office by next February and there was therefore some risk that after his departure American commitment to the proposals might weaken.    But it might be expected that a new Secretary of State,even a Democratic one, would wish to capitalise on the effortsDr Kissinger had made and Btart his period in office with a major political success In Africa.In further discussion it was pointed out that the proposal with regardto United Kingdom legislation in the document handed to Kir Smith wasimprecise.    There could be no question of our negotiating withMr Smith or doing anything to legitimise his regime.    Any legislation should be enacted only at the end of the process of discussions between  the Rhodesian authorities and the Black leaders, in order toprovide for the transfer of constitutional power.    We should seek toavoid a situation where in the event of a breakdown during the periodof the interim government, we were left with the same responsibilitiesas we had before udi.    It was however argued that, while legislation would be needed at the end of the process in connection with theestablishment of an independent Rhodesian Government on the basis of majority rule, some initial legislation would also be required in orderto provide the interim government with adequate powers and to terminate sanctions.    Thus we would not be able to avoid at least some legislative action at the beginning of the processt this stemmedfrom the constitutional and juridical position.    The preciselegislative requirements required further study.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat we sh mid continue to encourage and support Dr Kissinger in thevery consl ierable ef orte which he had made to achieve a settlement.It was of the utmost importance to obtain such a settlement if possible.We should not, however, allow ourselves to be unduly influenced bythe euphoria expresned by him and privately by some of the Africans.There were serious risks in the present position and even if mr Smith&apos;3 reactions were favourable there was still much which
might go wrong.    We should therefore proceed with extreme cautionto avoid being once more saddled with responsibility for Rhodesia inthe event of a breakdown.    In the talks with Dr Kissinger, In whichthe Lord President of the Council, the Lord Chancellor and theChancellor of the Exchequer would accompany the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and himself, we should make it clear that wewere not formally committed to the document he had given to Mr Smithand that the Cabinet would wish to look again at the details when mr Smith&apos;s definitive reaction and those of the African Presidentswere known.    He hoped that the Cabinet would give the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and himself discretion to act within thegeneral framework of the cautious approach which he bad outlined.Meanwhile, in preparation for the meeting with Dr Kissinger,clarification of the legislative requirements should be obtained.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;a summing up of this part of thediscussion.2.        Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultationwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, toprepare a study of United Kingdom legislativerequirements,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, introducing the note on financial inducements (CP(76) 01) Bald that both we and the americans had recognised that any settlement must containinducements to the White Rhodeslana to stay after independence,particularly people on whom the Zimbabwe economy would depend,eg civil servants and farmers.    Initial proposals for this purposewere referred to as &quot;the Rogers plan&quot;.    He did not know how muchDr Kissir ger had said to Mr Smith about this plan or whether thelatter would make something on these lines a condition of hisconstitutional offer.    More information about the Rhodesian economy was required before decisions could be taken.    As a first step, itwas propc sed that preliminary official level discussions should takeplace near: week in Washington.    These would be without commitmentand ad referendum to Ministers, but British officials should adopt a positive approach to the problem.    He was seeking the approval of hiscolleagues to the note as a basis for instructions to the british officials taking part in the Washington discussions.    It was clear thatthe United States would have to make a major financial contribution and dr Kissliger had mentioned a figure of 50 per cent.    If our contribution was limited to 15 per cent, there would be a further35 per csnt to find.    Preliminary reactions of President Giecard of
France and Chancellor Schmidt of Germany had not been unfavourableand the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Trudeau, had told the PrimeMinister that he thought the Canadian Government would alsocontribute.    So he was not too pessimistic about the prospects.In discussion the following points were made -a. Our financial contribution must be contingent on therest of the money being forthcoming, including Congressionalsupport for an American contribution of 50 per cent.Dr Kissinger could not commit Congress and it was unlikelythat the latter would take a decision before the summer of 1977at the earliest.b. The United Kingdom should not take the lead incollecting contributions.    This should be done by the UnitedStates.    It would be prudent to put our position In writing to dr Kissinger.c. The United Kingdom contribution would have to be metwithin the existing public expenditure limits,    hi view of theimportance of what was at stake an annual contribution of 15 million or a contribution of 15 per cent, whichever was theless, might be accepted as a charge on the aid programme.d. No commitment should be undertaken which might involve the use of British forces in Rhodesia at any stage.    any military operation was totally impossible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat at the talks in Washington the following week the official teamshould be guided by the note and the points made in discussion.    Thesetalks would be ad referendum and no commitment would be enteredinto.    Ministers would wish to consider proposals in detail in the lightof the teamfs report.    The Treasury should be represented in the teamfor the Washington talks as well as the Foreign and commonwealth office and the Ministry of Overseas Development.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of thediscussion.Cabinet Office24 September 1976
