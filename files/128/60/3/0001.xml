1. The Cabinet were reminded of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE CHIEF WHIP said that requests had been made for specialdebates on the economy and on Rhodesia,    It would In any event benecessary to obtain an Affirmative Resolution before the end of the session on the Order renewing the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965.   he understood from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that this order would not be ready before 1 November, and the Opposition had saidthat they would be prepared to take the Order without debate if therehad been any earlier general debate on Rhodesia,    But if the Ordercould be available earlier it might be preferable to combine a general debate with the debate on the Order.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the House of Lords had been sittinglate every night and were now faced with too many Bills - nearly all ofthem unpopular - to be taken through in too little time.   He would do all that he could, but there were only 29 days of the Session leftwhereas 35 days were needed; and he did not see how he could get allthese Bills through by the end of the Session.In discussion it was suggested that the Health Services Bill was the onemost at risk, and mat the former Lord Privy Seal had said in July thatif this Bill did not reach the  Lords until after 11 October there wouldbe a serious danger of its being lost.    It was argued, however, thatthe loss of mis Bill would deal a severe blow to the maintenance ofgood industrial relations in the Health Service, which was alreadydifficult; and that it would be necessary to weigh very carefullywhether it would not be better to extend the Session, at the expense ofa Bill in next Session^ programme, rather than to lose one of thepresent Session^ major Bills which had already made considerable progress,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thequestion of a general debate on the economy would be considered furtherunder the third item on the agenda.    There appeared to be a good case for bringing forward the Order renewing the Southern Rhodesia Act1965 earlier than 1 November, and this possibility should be pursued.The discussion on the completion   of the Session^ legislativebusiness would be resumed next week when the Lord President of theCouncil had returned from India, mad the Cabinet were reaching no decisions now except to confirm that the remaining Commons stages of the Health Services Bill would be taken next week.    The crowdingof contentious legislation at the end of the present Session was alesson for the future, and it would be necessary to be very tough in keeping dovm the size of next Session&apos;s programme.    There was,however, already a considerable amount of essential legislation whichwould have to be taken through early next Session, and the decision1
which had just been announced to start the new Session on17 November was a firm one and not open to reconsideration.No-one was advocating the loss of the Health Servir.es Bill, but in assessing this BLU5s prospects it was necessary to face the realities,which were that the matter was not wholly within the hands of theGovernment and the Lords were very short of time.    This was theBill most at risk because it was the only one of the Governmentsmajor and contentious Bills still in the House of Commons, whereasall the other Bills of this kind had already made some progress In the lords.    But for the present the Government should proceed with allthe remaining Bills and see how they progressed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2
2. THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that during his recent tour ofSouthern Africa he had seen President Kaunda of Zambia,President Seretse Khama of Botswana, President Machel ofMozambique and President Nyerere of Tanzania as well as Mr Nkomoand Bishop Muzorewa,   He had also visited Salisbury where he had seen Mr Ian Smith and representatives of various Rhodesian groupswho had asked to see him.    He had been accompanied byMr Schaufele, the United States Assistant Secretary for AfricanAffairs, who had been able to clear up misunderstandings which had arisen over the statue of the five points.   All concerned accepted theneed for a conference to start as soon as possible for the purpose ofestablishing an interim government and, with the possible exception ofMr Mugabe, whom he had not seen, that no pre-conditions should belaid down by the participants.    The Africans were deeply suspicious ofthe five points and would certainly press for major changes.Mr Smith on the other hand would try to insist that the five points should be maintained as a package, although in reality he probablyaccepted that there would have to be some negotiation about them.As regards participation, Mr Smith did not want the other WhiteRhodes ian Parties, which had no seats in Parliament, to be represen-ted.    The Rhodesia Party had of course 18 per cent of the vote: butthe Minister of State had not been impressed by Mr Gfbbs and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary had reached no final view on thispoint.    On the African side, we should wish to invite Mr Nkomo,Bishop Muzorewa and probably also Mr Mugabe.   As regards venue,although all would have preferred a meeting in Southern Africa no onelocation was generally acceptable and a consensus had emerged infavour of Europe.    The Swiss authorities were being asked about thepossibilities of Geneva.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryhoped it might be possible to start the meeting during the week beginning 18 October.   He might decide to make an announcement on6 October or possibly to postpone this until he could make a statement in Parliament early next week.In discussion it was pointed out that one of the problems which would arise was Mr Smith&apos;s wish to retain as much personal influence aspossible.    His insistence on defence and law and order remaining inwhite control would be strongly resisted by the Africans and theimpression in Salisbury was that he wanted to play a major role,possibly as President of the Council of State, in the interim government.    This would be unacceptable to the Africans; but mr Smith was in practice probably the only man who could deliver theWhite Rhode russians.The British position at the meeting would be a very delicate one.The Africans, especially President Nyerere, had accepted that it wasnot possible to move direct to a full-scale constitutional conference,
and that it would be necessary to adopt the two-stage approach we had proposed; but they wanted us to play an active rather than a neutralrole at the meeting, and might press us to appoint a Governor-General during the interim government.   Our task would be to allayAfrican suspicions, to keep the Europeans moving but at the sametime to avoid any involvement which would leave us with implied oractual obligations which we could not discharge.    We should take theline that the five points represented a reasonable basis for establishing an interim government: but our only commitment was tothe achievement of majority rule within two years.It was suggested that Mr Smiths concern that sanctions should be lifted and the guerrilla war ended could create difficulties for us.The timing of action to meet these concerns was important.    Thefirst task was to get an interim government established.    Once this had been achieved we could take legal steps to transfer powers to it.Only at that point would the question of lifting sanctions arise.    while we had no direct control over the guerrilla leaders, those who&apos; wishedto continue the war would find they were fighting their friends, as members of the interim government.    If this happened the interim government might appeal to us for help.    Difficulty would also arise if the interim government broke down and the Africans withdrew, butwe would have to consider this situation if and when it arose.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said the cabinet would wish to thank the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs for what he had achieved on his recent tour.There were many difficulties that could arise at any stage In theprocess.    But the risks of failure were very great and we must make every effort to achieve success.    We should need to maintain regularcontact with the African Presidents throughout the process.    We mustbe free to disengage, but we should not be in any hurry to do so.   Hehad every confidence in Mr Richard*s ability as chairman.   Asregards legislation, the first requirement would be for affirmativeapproval in Parliament of the annual Order in Council renewing the1965 Act, which would have to be given before Prorogation.    Orderswould subsequently be needed to legitimise the interim governmentand to revoke sanctions, but the timing of these would depend on progress at the meeting.    No decisions were required from theCabinet at this stageA but there would be further opportunity fordiscussion as the situation developed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.

/^Hfi DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTvI COPY NO -JGiCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 25th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 7 October 1976 at 10.30 am&amp;OMIC^TIONTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, reviewing developments Inthe last two or three months, said that the background to the present difficulties was the need to get the economy into balance without socialbreakdown.    The country had large internal and external deficits,which had to be financed by borrowing; and any fall in the sterlingexchange rate exacerbated the problems.    In June the Group of Tenhad made available a standby facility of $5,300 million.    Of this,$L100 million was drawn and spent in June, as a result of which theexchange vate rose from $1.71 to $1,78.    By the early part ofSeptember the rate was still at $1.77, but there had been no reflux of funds on the scale hoped for, and substantial pressure on the rate thendeveloped.    Heavy spending through intervention failed to hold therate, and It was decided to stop intervening in the market, aB a resultof which the rate fell some 3-4 cents and then fluctuated around$1. 73.    A further $500 million of the June standby was drawn during september, making a total drawing of $1. 600 million, in order to preventthe United Kingdom reserves from going below $5, 000 million.    On24 September the rate dropped below $1.70, and plummeted down on27 and 28 September, the first two days of the Labour Party Conference,falling as low as $1.63.   After consulting the Prime Minister heannounced the Governments intention to apply to the international monetary Fund (IMF) for the United Kingdom&apos;S full entitlement on allunused credit tranches, which would total $3,900 million.    This steadiedthe rate which today was araund $1.65.The authority he had previously had from the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy to apply for an IMF drawing had been on theunderstanding that this would be negotiated on the basis of theGovernments existing policies.    This made it all the more important that the Government should be seen to be keeping within the targets for domestic credit expansion and for the growth of money supply in 1976-77(about  9, 000 million  , and 12 per cent respectively) which had been announced.   However, in the period between mid-July and
mid-September the Government had been unable to make any net sales of gilt-edged securities, with the result that the money supply figuresfor those months were very bad.   He had therefore called for specialdeposits of 1 per cent by the banks; and the Minimum Lending Rate(MLR) had been increased by lj per cent.    Subsequently there was adramatic reversal in gilt-edged sales, and in the week ending       larg24 September sales had totalled  1, 000 million.    The hope of further /sales of gilts in the following week had however been destroyed by thefall in the exchange rate.    Moreover, there had been very heavy banklending in September, much more than had been expected, and this,combined with the failure to sell gilts before the week ending24 September, meant that the figures to be published on 18 October ofmoney supply would be very bad indeed (the sales of gilts would onlyshow up in the following months figures).    There was some evidencethat the bank lending was financing leading and lagging as well as the advance purchase of imports undertaken from fear of a further fall inthe sterling rate or the imposition of import controls.In his view mis situation could only be dealt with by the application ofa sharp monetary squeeze.    The Bank of England would therefore that day be calling for a further 2 per cent of special deposits; and theMLR would be increased by a further 2 per cent.    These wereunpleasant measures to have to take but he hoped that against this background it would be possible successfully to launch a further tapstock.    In private meetings which he had had with a United StatebMinister he had been under pressure to take action on the moneysupply; and It was clear from talks which Sir Douglas was had hadin Manila with Mr Simon, the United States Secretary of the Treasury,and Mr Witteveen, the Director General of the IMF, that thenegotiations on the drawing for which the United Kingdom had appliedwould be tough and difficult.     Nevertheless he believed mat theywould be successful as long as the Government was seen to be stickingby its announced policies.    If negotiations could not be concluded onthis basis, he would consult his colleagues further in the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy.In discussion it was argued that the course which had been followedsince June did not constitute a coherent strategy.    Events had in facttaken over.    Some members of Cabinet had warned that. In spite ofthe steps announced on 22 July, it would still be necessary to go to theIMF; and so it now proved.    The further call for special deposits andthe increase in the MLR, although they might help the exchange rate,would have grievous effects on the Governments economic andindustrial strategy which was aimed at switching resources intomanufacturing industry.    The political repercussions could also be serious, i-nd it would be essential to discuss what strategy should nowbe followed.    If the Conservative policy was to take a cleaver to public expenditure, it appeared that the Chancellor of the Exchequer*e
policy was to take a cleaver to money supply.    The public would not accept continuing high unemployment when alternative policies wereavailable, and it was essential that Ministers should consider the opportunities for restricting imports which were available under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The truth was that the economy was bleeding to death, and that only the adoption of aprotectionist policy could save the situation.    Both monetarist andprotectionist approaches were respectable views to hold, and thealternative policies they offered should be considered.    It had beenargued that to go half-way towards protection was no good, and that only full protection for a prolonged period was any use.   By the sametoken it could be argued that recent events, with repeated nibblings atmonetary policy, were equally a half-way house, and that it would bebetter to go all the way in the kind of spasm advocated by theConservative Party.    There was nothing in the protectionistalternative which was not compatible with the view that the country should live within its means.    What was clear was that a monetaristapproach was incompatible with the Governments industrial strategy,and would destroy it.    The Government would pay the price for adrift towards monetarism in terms of unemployment, worseningrelations with the trade unions and a lost election.    The country would be more willing to support a protectionist policy.   Fiscalmeasures might be needed within such a policy but there would be a choice between cuts in public expenditure and increases in taxation.Protectionism had been described as a siege economy? but if this wasthe case, it would be preferable to have the trade unions inside thecitadel during the siege rather than the international bankers.    Itwould not be possible to win the support of the people of the countryfor policies which were needed simply to satisfy bankers.Protectionism was not an easy course and would involve sacrifices;but it presented the best way to gain the support of the British people.In further discussion it was argued that it would be wrong to dub thepresent policv as one of monetarism.    The truth was that, with highpublic expenditure, the Government had a high public sector borrowing requirement, and this could only be sustained by high interest rateswhen the Government had to borrow in a competitive market.       Thereal question was whether the present and prospective level of thepublic sector borrowing requirement was sustainable.    High interest rates inevitably hit investment, and it was therefore to be hoped thatthe new level of MLR would be only temporary.    In considering thequestion of alternative strategies, the key was the Governmentsdesire to maintain the present level of public expenditure.    While itwas questionable whether that level could be sustained with thepresent mix of policies, further cuts would certainly be just as necessary with a protectionist policy as they might be on present policies.    Protectionism was a respectable philosophy, but only whereit could be applied without doing damage to the national interest.    It
had to be remembered that the general level of exports in the current year was 10 per cent up in volume terms on the previous year; andthat In some sectors - eg chemicals - the increase was twice that much.Far more manufactured goods were exported than imported, and thoseexports would be put in grave jeopardy if protectionist policies,incurring the risk of retaliation, were adopted.    Massive protectionwould be self-defeating.    In 1964 the then Labour Government hadintroduced a 15 per cent import surcharge, and the internationalpressure from the countries in the European Free Trade Area had beensuch that within four months the Government had been constrained toreduce the figure to 10 per cent.    Much of the country&apos;s currentdifficulties derived from the fact that it was widely believed that theGovernment was on the edge of adopting either import controls or, asthe Trades Union Congress urged, import deposits.   As a result,borrowing from the banks had been increased by those anxious to forestall such developments,    it,was probably not possible wholly todissipate this impression, but there was a case for the strongest possible public statement making it clear that general protection wasnot the Governments policy.In continuing discussion it was argued that alternative policies needed to be discussed because current policies were not working.   It wasnot surprising that cuts in public expenditure had received a badreception at the Party Conference.    The Government was in danger of moving step by step towards the philosophy of Milton Friedman andthe policies of the Conservative Party.   A Labour Government couldnot survive without the support of the trade unions; but the trade union leaders needed to see the Governments policies working.   against this it was pointed out that it would be wrong to identify theprotectionist versus monetarist argument with the Socialist versusConservative argument.    The Government did in fact have a strategy -the industrial strategy was proceeding through the sectoral studiesunder the auspices of the National Economic Development Council, andthis was now moving to the point where discussions would take place ina wide range of firms.    Selective protection for some industries suchas shipbuilding might be necessary in support of that strategy.Industrial regeneration was absolutely fundamental to the governments policies and represented the only way out of present difficulties.    the crucial need was to gain time and consideration should be given to how we could, secure longer-term backing for the sterling balances.It was true that the monetary measures which would be announced that day would set the industrial strategy back to some extent; but that didnot mean that the strategy was not working, only that the effects ofextraneous factors, including an undervalued currency, would have tobe overcome.    H was noted that ten years previously it had been argued that if the Government would depreciate the pound and allow the rate tofloat, all problems would be solved.    In the same way it was now
suggested that the imposition of import controls would Bolve allproblems.   It was however to be noted that the Trades Union Congresswas not asking for the adoption of a generally protectionist policy,which could severely cu*&quot; the exports upon which their membersdepended.    The question was not one of ideology but which coursewould best help the country in its present economic position.    a situation could arise in which the Government was faced with a choice between a high public sector borrowing requirement, requiring highinterest rates which affected industry adversely, or alternatively a lower borrowing requirement, which could only be achieved byadjustments in fiscal policy.On the question of presenting the Governments policies, it wassuggested that steps should be taken to ensure that a clear statementof the Government^ determination was necessary when parliament reassembled the following week.    One possibility would be to have a debate of a general character  until 7.00 pm on the basis of the counter-inflation Price Code Order; but it seemed possible that theOpposition might refuse this and prefer a full debate running until10. 00 pm.    This could take place on a Motion for the Adjournment,and the opposed Private Business which had been put down for 7.00 pmon Monday could be moved to a day later in the week.    Theimportance of the vote for the Government would require a three-lineWhip, although, since Members were only expecting a one-line Whip onthat day, those who were abroad would have to be recalled.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment had to live through a period of little confidence in theBritish economy and to take the action necessary to restore confidence and get the economy moving again.    He was in close andfrequent touch with President Ford and Chancellor Schmidt, both ofwhom had been very helpful in making statements to assist the poundwhich was clearly undervalued.    He would be probing furtherpossibilities with Chancellor Schmidt in the near future.    The need tocall for more special deposits and to increase the MLR wasunwelcome to all of them because of the adverse effect, althoughhopefully only temporary, which It would have upon the industrialstrategy.    With the pound standing at $1.65 the Government&apos;sinflation target would be seriously affected, and the only hope they had of carrying their policy through and reaping the fruits of the industrialstrategy depended upon their standing firmly together.    The chief whip would consult the Opposition on the question of a dayts debate onthe economic situation the following Monday, on a Motion for the adjournment.    Given the fact that the life of the Government would beat stake, a three-line Whip would be essential.    A meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party should be held later in the week in thenormal way.    The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy hadalready had full discussions on alternative policies; and further
analytical work was in hand on the basis of which these discussions would continue.    One of tue causes of the present uncertainty was however the belief that the Government was contemplating the adoptionof a protectionist strategy.    On the basis of present information themajority of the Cabinet were against such a course: and unless anduntil any change of policy were agreed it was essential that all suchinternal discussions should be kept strictly private.    In public thiswould mean individual Ministers subordinating their personal views inthe wider interest of the Government presenting a united and determined front, but unless mis happened those who wanted analternative strategy would be liable to find that they were arguing for it from the Opposition benches.    The Chancellor of the Exchequerbore a heavy burden with resolution and deserved their full support inthe face of the many pressures upon him.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office8 October 1976
