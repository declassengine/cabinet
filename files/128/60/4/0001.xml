^RUAMENTARY     1.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE CHIEF WHIP said that the week beginning 8 November wouldbe a difficult one, when Lords amendments to major Bills wouldbe considered, and it was important that there should be nounpaired absences on any day that week, including Friday,12 November.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had had informal consultations with the Opposition in the House of Lords, who understood theproblem of time lacing the Government in completing the legislative programme.    He had made clear to them the Government1 s intentionto get all their legislation through, and would do his best to achieve this.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, stressed that everything possible should be done to get the Health ServicesBill, as well as the other remaining major Bills, to Royal Assentby the end of the Session.The Cabinet -Took note.1
foreign*TAIRSfliaPreviousReference:CM(76) 25thConclusions.Minute 22.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatit seemed certain that the three Black African representatives he had invited, Mr Mugabe, Bishop Muzorewa and Mr Nkomo would attend the Geneva Conference, although Mr Mugabe was still pressing forpostponement of the starting date.    He was willing to consider a shortpostponement if necessary, but would await the advice of Mr Grennan,his Adviser on African Affairs, who was at present in Southern Africa,bom on this point and also on the question whether Mr Slthole shouldbe invited to attend.    He had seen Mr Rodgers, United States UnderSecretary of State, yesterday in order to bring him up to date about our plans.    Mr Rodgers had come straight from a talk withMrs Thatcher.    This was contrary to the advice he had given to dr Kissinger in response to a direct enquiry from the latter and wasonly likely to create further difficulties.    But he understood fromDr Kissinger, to whom he had spoken subsequently, and who hadapologised, that the call on Mrs Thatcher had been a private initiativeon the part of Mr Rodgers.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there would be ageneral debate on Rhodesia on the Motion for the Adjournment on20 October, and this would be followed by a debate on a Motionapproving the Order to renew the 1965 Act.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Lord Presidentof the Council.-2
6thfusions,43.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos; (CP(76 ) 82) covering a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury, assessing the value of the programme analysis and Review (PAR) system.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Cabinet had asked for this assessment at their meeting on 20 May.   the assessment by officials was annexed to his memorandum, and he had concluded that it would be worth continuing with the PAR system onthe modified basis suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his paper.   Hewas clear mat studies of the kind conducted under the PAR arrange-ments were necessary for a number of reasons.   There wasadvantage in the opportunity the system provided of an annual stock-taking of studies in progress and planned to be started,    tt was help-ful that      central Departments - the Treasury and the Central policy review Staff - were Involved in the studies, and that the results were considered collectively by Ministers.    The distinction between PARstudies and non-PAR studies was somewhat artificial, but he was inclined to keep the PAR label, since if It were dropped there might be exaggerated criticism of the significance of the change.   The object ofthe system should be to choose subjects for study which would be helpful to Ministers in the furtherance of their policy aims.    Ondisclosure, it would in his view be desirable to disclose all the factual information possible but to retain flexibility on the question of publishing recommendations, since it might well not always be wise tomake public the internal advice which had been offered to Ministers.In discussion the justification for a different status for PAR studieswas questioned.    There was a risk that Parliamentary Committeesmight Imagine that PARs were in some way greatly superior to normalinterdepartmental studies, and that they would press to see them before Ministers had considered the advice they contained.   For thisreason It would be better to drop the name of PAR, which&apos; was In anycase only a gimmick of the last Conservative Government, and revert to the normal arrangements which had obtained previously for inter-departmental studies.    It was noted that, as the assessment by officials made clear, most PAR studies would have been put in handwhether the PAR system had existed or not; and some major reviewswere still conducted quite independently of the PAR arrangements.What was important for Ministers was that there should be an annualstocktaking at which they could scrutinise the proposed programme ofstudies so that a higher degree of political input could be provided toensure that when the studies were done they were more closely related to the problems with which Ministers were concerned.   Itwould also be desirable for PAR studies to take more account man atpresent of work which had been done under Party auspices, perhapsbefore the Government came to power.    It might indeed be desirable for the Cabinet to discuss from time to time the general policies of a
particular Department.    However not all PAR studies were of equalpolitical interest.    Civil servants often produced proposals for studieswhich dealt with important administrative questions; and although these might be of small political significance, such work was notsomething to be discouraged.    The most recently circulated PAR - onIncentives in Regional Policy - was itself a good example of what agood PAR report could do on a subject which crossed the interests ofmany Departments.    It came to no hard and fast conclusions, but setout the options and left Ministers to take decisions.In further discussion it was argued that while it would be acceptable to publish the factual material contained in PAR studies, it would be unwise to make any commitment about publishing that part which contained recommendations to Ministers.    For this reason it would be best not to publish a list of the subjects which were being studied asPARs.    It was true that, as long as the PAR system was retained,Parliamentary Committees would press to be informed of studies in train and to see the results; but this was pressure which would have tobe resisted.    The increasing number of documents which were leakedto the Press made it desirable that the Government should publish asmuch material as possible, keeping only the minimum as confidential -although it was argued conversely that it was not always helpful to publish papers when policy was still In process of formulation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view in Cabinet was that the PAR system, modified in the wayproposed in the paper by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(76) 82) tocover all major ongoing and planned reviews, should continue.    Theway the system should work would be for officials to put forward a programme of possible studies, but for decisions to be taken by ministers,    There might perhaps be more discrimination in the subjects chosen for study.    The PAR tittle should also be retained.On the question of disclosure, there was broad agreement that, whilethe factual material in PAR studies could normally be published, itwould be desirable to retain flexibility over the question of publishing the remainder of the material, and each case would need to be judgedon its merits.    In any case disclosure should not take place until after Ministers had had an opportunity to consider the study.    TheChief Secretary&apos;b paper had Bought approval for the studies which werelisted In Annex 1 to CP(76) 19 as already in progress or due to start in1976 to go ahead as planned; and while there was no desire to stopstudies already in progress, the view of Cabinet was that no furtherstudies should be started in 1976 until the Cabinet had had anopportunity to consider a stocktaking paper.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, should therefore bring forward such a paper in Novemberor December with a view to enabling Cabinet to agree upon a 1977programme of studies on the basis set out in CP(76) 82.
The Cabinet -1.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion,2,        Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to circulate a stocktaking paper proposing a programme of Programme Analysis and Reviewstudies for 1977,5
^ALTHG AND      4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services, the Secretary of State for Scotland and theSecretary of State for Wales (CP(76) 83) on the use nf the Medicines Act2968 to control smoking.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theGovernment had a clear commitment to bring tobacco additives andsubstitutes within the scope of the Medicines Act.    To fail to do thiswould not only be a retreat from this commitment and from theagreement reached with the major part of the tobacco industry but would lose the Government the opportunity to secure voluntary agree -ments with the industry covering a wide range of matters, relating to changes in the composition of cigarettes, more precise health warningsand control of advertising, which would play a major part in furtheringthe Governments policy.    In order to secure these agreements,however, it would be necessary for the Government to negotiate from aposition of strength.    The Minister of State, Department of Health and social Security, had announced in January that the Government would introduce statutory controls, under the Medicines Act, on tobaccoadditives and substitutes, while control of tobacco products as suchwould be the subject of voluntary agreements with the industry.    this approach had received wide support from the industry, the onlychallenge coming from British American Tobacco which commanded aninsignificant share of the market.   A further reason for taking early action was that the fiscal legislation, which was at present used tocontrol additives and substitutes, would cease to be available from theend of December 1977 in order to comply with the European economic community Directive on the harmonisation of tobacco duty.    If no control were substituted for this legislation, there was a real risk matimporters and manufacturers would bring additives and substitutes onto the market; and it was inconceivable that the Government should allow this to happen without establishing machinery to avoid the hazardsto health which would undoubtedly exist.    The question therefore wasnot whether the Government should take statutory action but what formthat action should take.   He did not propose legislation to controltobacco products as well as additives and substitutes.    The choice,in his view, lay between making an Order under the Medicines Actand accepting the risk of legal challenge, which had always been recognised, or taking powers to bring additives and substitutesindisputably within the scope of the Medicines Act.    This would be ashort measure which he proposed should be added to the Bill to recoupthe costs of road accidents.In discussion there was general agreement that to proceed by means ofan Order which was known to be of doubtful validity would entail a real risk of challenge in the courts and would expose the Government to agood deal of criticism, with consequent loss of prestige, particularlyin the light of the recent Tame side judgments.    It was also generally agreed that to bring tobacco as such within the scope of the MedicinesAct would give rise to an unacceptable degree of controversy as well
as causing alarm to those employed in the industry.    If legislation were introduced, therefore, me Government should resist any amendments designed to widen its scope to include tobacco.    Therewere however major difficulties about introducing legislation in thenext Session of Parliament, when business would be exceptionallycrowded.    Preliminary consultations with Parliamentary Counselhad indicated that even if it were technically possible - and there appeared to be considerable doubt about this - to tack on the necessaryprovisions to the Bill on the recoupment of road accident costs, the resulting measure would be open to wide amendment.    The Bill wouldin any case be controversial and the additions to it would be likely to amount to a major new legislative undertaking which might involve thedisplacement of some other Bill.    There was already a danger ofoverloading next Session&apos;s programme by the expedient of tackingprovisions on to Bills already approved, and the pressure for thisshould be resisted.In further discussion it was suggested that, although it was in principleundesirable to enter into forward commitments of this kind, the bestcompromise in the circumstances might be to promise legislation forthe following Session.    This should be enacted within a short time ofthe expiry of the existing fiscal legislation; and the undertaking tointroduce it need not exclude the possibility of proceeding earlier bymeans of a suitable Private Member&apos;s Bill, which the government might well be able to arrange.   However, to enable the Government inthe meantime to pursue effective negotiations with the industry on voluntary agreements for tobacco, the undertaking to legislate, nolater than in tho 1977-78 Session, on additives and substitutes wouldhave to be very firmly stated.    It was for consideration whether theGovernment&apos;s proposals for legislation should be set out in a white paper.    It was doubtful however whether it would be appropriate torefer to them in The queen b Speech for the opening of the next Session,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Governments commitment to introducestatutory control over tobacco additives and substitutes should becarried out by means of primary legislation putting use of the MedicinesAct beyond doubt and that the Government should announce a firmintention to introduce the legislation early in the 1977-78 Session.This need not preclude earlier legislation by means of a suitablePrivate Member&apos;s Bill.    He would consider further with the Secretaryof State for Social Services the timing and manner of mis announcement which he might himself make in the Debate on the Address.    meanwhile the Secretary of State for Social Services would examine the suggestionthat the Governments proposals might be set out in a White Paper.The Secretary of State for Energy had raised the wider questionwhether the time was       ripe for a fundamental review of the tobaccoindustry and of its economic and social role; if he wished at some stage to provide a paper setting out his thoughts, he would arrange for it to be considered by an appropriate group of Ministers.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;aHumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office14 October 19768
