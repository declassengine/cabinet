THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.........................................-r t-:cretDowngraded to SECRET   PS(76) 41 refersCopy No.38CABINET*bgotjations*&quot; laionaLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 37th ConclusionsMonday 6 December 1976 at 3. 30 pmThe Cabinet resumed their discussion of 2 December 1976.*al the PRIME MINISTER said that the task now before Cabinet wasto give substance to the fiscal adjustment of  1 billion in 1977-78which they had the previous week agreed should be offered to theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).    It was now a matter of urgencyto bring this to a conclusion.    On present plans a week was neededbetween final decisions and a public announcement, but he doubted,given the extent to which the Cabinet discussions had already beenmade known to the Press, whether it would be possible to tolerateso long a gap.    In addition to the composition of a fiscal package,the Cabinet would need to take a decision about import deposits and about the sale of the British Petroleum (BP) shares.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was necessaryto have a week between decisions and announcement in order that theeffects upon the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) and domestic credit expansion (DCE) could be worked ou$ - a process which would take three or four days - before insertion in the letterof application to the IMF.   Furthermore, only after a decision onan agreement with the IMF on the loan would it be possible to bringthe negotiations on a safety net for the sterling balances to a headwith the countries concerned.    On the question of import deposits,the United Kingdom had a legal obligation to give at least 36 hours
notice of their implementation to the IMF and to the european economic Community,    In his view the presentation of the packagein the House of Commons would require very careful consideration.There was therefore no real chance of a statement being made inthe course of the current week.Reporting on the developments since the last Cabinet discussion,he said that the IMF had now with some reluctance agreed to theproposal which Cabinet had endorsed^ namely that there should bean adjustment of  1^ billion in 1977-78, cf which S.j billion would berealised by the sale of BP shares, with an adjustment of  2 billionin 1978-79, of which at least  ^ billion would be achieved throughtaxation changes.    If the rate of economic growth in 1978-79 werebelow 3J- per cent, the United Kingdom would have the right to consult with the IMF on a lower adjustment; conversely if the growth ratewere above 3j per cent, the IMF would have the right to look for alarger adjustment.    The Cabinets immediate task was to agree upon the cut of  1 billion in public expenditure in 1977-78 and of l  billion in 1978-79.    The raw material for this was in the paperhe had circulated on 30 November (CP(76) 126) and in a revised version of Appendix A to the Treasury note attached to that paper.A copy of the revised appendix was then handed to each member ofCabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet took note mat what had happened in Parliament in thepreceding week on the Social Security Bill would need to be takeninto account when they came to consider possible social security measures.    It was firmly understood that all the provisionaldecisions they would take would be contingent on a final decisionon the total package; and he gave an assurance that there would beno question of a last minute attempt to introduce a new element intothe package which had not already been mentioned to the Cabinet -although import deposits would have to be considered separatelyafter the expenditure changes had been settled.    The Cabinet notedthat the question of the sale of BP shares and of changes in thearrangements for export credits had yet to be discussed; but on thelatter they noted that the Ministers concerned had had discussions withthe major firms concerned which could lead to the savings neededwithout an increase in the minimum lending rate for sterlingfinancing.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were agreed that for the moment savings of  100 million in 1977-78 and  200 million in 1978-79 should be Bcored againstdefence expenditure.    They looked to the Secretary of State for defence to report further the following day on the feasibility ofmaking cuts of this magnitude.    It was noted that the expenditure figures included in the public expenditure survey assumed thereceipt of offset payments from West Germany of  50 million ayear, and that if these were not successfully negotiated mere wouldbe a further problem to be solved.The Cabinet -2.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.Aid THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit was agreed that savings of  50 million should be scored in eachyear, but that when all other savings had been settled cabinet should reconsider this item to see if they still wished to persist inmaking these cuts.The Cabinet -3.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.tidies THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that reductions of  150 million in 1977-78 and 60 million in 1976-79 should be made in food subsidies.The Cabinet -4. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a series of brief discussions on savings on construction programmes said that the Cabinet werein favour of a 6 months&apos; moratorium on new construction in anumber of public sector programmes and that, subject to certainreservations, the following savings should be scored1977-78 1978-79Education 22 UWater 75 130Other Environmental services 50 NilHealth and Personal social services 5 10Property Services Agency 20 30Courts 2^ NilOf these savings, the Education figure excluded basic needs, andwas made up of figures of 20 and 10 for England and Wales, with a proportionate addition for Scotland.    The Secretary of State for the environment would wish to consider the figures for Water expenditurefurther and report again the following day.    The figures for theProperty Services Agency were made up partly of  10 million ineach year in respect of training facilities, on which the TrainingServices Commission would need to be consulted, and partly of savings on dispersal and other expenditure by the Agency, on which cabinet would need further information in order to ascertain whetherlarger reductions might not be possible - although it was recognisedthat this gave rise to the difficulty that it could involve the cancellation of building projects in the heart of derelict areas in Liverpool andGlasgow, as well as the postponement of the provision of a purpose-built home for the Welsh Assembly,    On the other hand, there wasthe danger of allowing building for dispersal to proceed, and thenfinding that staff cuts in the Civil Service meant that there were nostaff to transfer to the new offices.    The Cabinet would want furtherinformation on this urgently.The Cabinet -5.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Secretary of State for Transport had offered savings of 40 million in 1977-78 and  30 million in 1978-79 from a 12 months1moratorium on new road construction.    Because road contractsran for a long time, the proportion of the programme affected bya moratorium was small; and there was a general feeling in cabinet that something more than this should be found from theRoads programme.    Savings of   75 million in 1977-70 and 50 million in 1978-79 should provisionally be scored for GreatBritain, and the Secretary of State for Transport should report thefollowing day on ways in which this might be achieved.    It had beennoted that the possibility of imposing tolls on the use of motorwaysdid not offer any immediate savings but should be further examinedon a longer term basis.The Cabinet -6.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.pausedatryActionTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit might be possible to make some savings, in terms of the callmade by the nationaliwed industries on the National Loans Fund,if they could all be asked to make minor reductions in theirspending programmes.    This was not aimed at major productive investment, but at minor and peripheral expenditure, eg onshowrooms, offices, distribution, etc.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, should consider urgently whether it would not be possibleto save, say,  100 million in each of the two years in this way.The Cabinet -7.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion it was argued that, if the excess expenditure in1977-78 - which arose solely from the allocation to this programmeof the consequences of increased interest charges, something whichhad not been suffered by any other programme - were to be whollyoffset, the only logical step to take would be to increase councilhouse rents by  1, 40 a week.    Such an increase was not in factproposed, although it was pointed out that owner-occupiers suffered
a direct and larger increase in their mortgage payments wheninterest rates rose.    It would be possible to reduce the house-building programme, and a cut of 20, 000 houses could save 200 million; but it was argued that, given the fact that thedemographic forecast showed a continuing increase in the need for public sector housing, all this would do would be to build up abacklog of social misery for the future by lengthening waiting lists.Cuts in other housing expenditure, eg municipalisation, would be preferable to this,    Jn any case, a moratorium on house-buildingcould well lead to housing completions falling to the levels of theimmediate post-war years.    It might be possible to make somesavings in the expenditure on improvement investment and perhapson mortgage lending, although this had already been severely cut.It was noted that it had been claimed that there should be no Scottishcounterpart to the English attempt to offset, in whole or in part,the excess expenditure of  220 million in 1977-78, since offsetting savings for this purpose had already been made in other Scottishprogramme s0    It was also noted that, if there were to be anyquestion of a further increase in council house rents, the possibilityof some reduction in tax relief on mortgage interest should also beconsidered, at least in respect of the taxpayer who was paying taxat more than the standard rate,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that for the moment figures of 150 million for 1977-78 (ie  70 million less than the forecastexcess on thip programme) and  200 million for 1978-79 should be entered as savings on the housing programme for England, but thatthey reserved the right to reconsider these figures in the light of areport the following day from the Secretary of State for the environment on how they might be achieved.The Cabinet -8,        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of thip part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thata cut of  50 million in each year had been proposed; but it had beenargued that this would be tantamount to repealing the CommunityLand Act, although this was not wholly true since the provisions ofthe Development Land Tax would continue to operate.    However, on balance Cabinet favoured cuts of  35 million in 1977-78 and 50 million in 1978-79.
The Cabinet -9.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe view had been expressed that the National Health Service (NHS)was on the brink of suffering serious damage, involving a reductionin the number of doctors and nurses and the closing of wards.    Inview of this it was proposed to make savings of  40 million in eachyear by an increase in prescription charges to 50p (but keepingmore advantageous arrangements for the chronic sick) and of 10 million in each year from other NHS expenditure of which a part would fall on capital expenditure in addition to the six months1moratorium.    This was a provisional decision, and some membersof Cabinet might wish to look particularly again at the question ofprescription charges.The Cabinet -10.       Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.rvice THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that^gs the proposal had been made to save  30 million in 1977-78 and 8 million in 1978-79 by a squeeze on Civil Service manpower.    Ithad been argued that higher savings could be obtained from a12 month ban on recruitment; but that this would lead to Departmentskeeping on staff who were old and expensive instead of replacing by those who were young and cheaper; and that such a move would be popular with the public, but only until it became impossible tomaintain essential services, eg the payment of social security benefits.    For the moment savings of  30 million and  8 million should be scored against this heading, but the Lord Privy Sealshould consider the matter further and make proposals the following day for higher savings.The Cabinet -11.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.7
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would resume itsdiscussion of possible savings at a meeting the following morning.Cabinet office December 19768
