IVPFLIAMENTARY   1j The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken In theI    AIRS House of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT Op THE COUNCIL said that on 20 Julytimetable motions had been passed for the remaining Commons stages of the Education and Rent (Agriculture) Bills, the DockworkRegulation and Health Services Bills, and the Aircraft and Ship-building Industries BUI,    The three supplementary motions on8 November, each of which could be debated for up to one hour, wouldallot six hours for the first consideration of Lords amendments on each BUI and three hours for any other messages from the Lords.There would be proteste from the Opposition, but each of the*e Bills,and particularly the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, hadalready taken far more time in the Commons than was usual even for major legislation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it would not be possible adequatelyto discuss all the Lords amendments to these Bills In the course of six hours for each BUI; there were 58 amendments to the aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries BUI alone.    When the Bills were returned from the Commonsf the Lords would be likely to argue that the commons had rejected some of their amendments without discussion,or without proper discussion, and that some Important provisions hadbeen guillotined twice and never properly discussed on the Floor ofthe Commons at aU,    It would be of some presentational value, andmight help tc reduce the number of further exchanges of messagesbetween the two Houses, if eight hours could be aUowed rather than six.In discussion it was pointed out that the Opposition in the commons had not so far pressed for more time, and the three supplementarymotions had now been placed on the Order Paper.   It might never-theless be worth offering extra time on the BUI, or the two Bills,which had attracted the greatest number of Lords amendments.    Incountering Conservative protests it might be useful to cite the example of the last Conservative Government in forcing theirIndustrial Relations Act through Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theGovernment should not volunteer any alteration in the threesupplementary motions,    H, however, the Opposition were to press for more time, it might be worth conceding a further two hours on oneor two of the Bills if that would ease the position when these BUlswere returned to the Lords and reduce the likely number of subsequent exchanges between the two Houses,
The Cabinet -Took note.(OF ROAD1 OCCIDENT\taATMEKTdeviousTerence:,^7fc) nth^*cVuBions2.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP(76) 97) on the proposed Bill to recover from motorists through insurance companies the full costs to theNational Health Service (NHS) of treating road accident cases.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that whenthe Cabinet had considered public expenditure on 19 July he had proposed to save  20 million In 1977-78 and  40 million in a full yearby legislation to recover, mainly from Insurance companies, the fullcosts to the NHS of treating road accident cases.    If this proposal which had not at that stage been worked out in detail did not provepracticable he had undertaken to find alternative savings in 1977-78.He was still ready to proceed with legislation if the Cabinet so wished;a detailed scheme had been agreed in Home Affairs Committee, therehad been extensive consultation with interested parties and the bill was nearly ready.    There were, however, changes in circumstancessince July which led him to feel that there were better alternatives.The pressure on the legislative programme In 1977-78 had become more acute and others  would be great advantage in eliminating the needfor one Bill.   From the consultations which had taken place it was evident that the Bill would be controversial.    The Bill would also bemore difficult to defend to the House than he had anticipated because it had been decided In recent Public Expenditure Survey Committeediscussions that the revenue it generated in the years after 1977-78could not be used to sustain additional expenditure for the NHS but should, for all practical purposes, be merged with the generalrevenue from taxation.   Finally the public expenditure position had become graver since July and there would be a correspondingattraction in alternative ways of raising revenue which could be made effective for the whole of 1977-78 rather than for the half year whichwas the most that could be achieved with his legislation.   He mere-fore considered that It would be preferable to collect an amountequivalent to the relevant NHS treatment costs by an Increase inVehicle Excise Duty (VED).    The charge for this purpose could be a distinct element which could be accounted for separately and adjustedperiodically as these costs changed.   The charge could be made by aprovision In the 1977 Finance BUI, thus eliminating the need for specific legislation and raising a full year&apos;s revenue.
In discussion it was pointed out that there had been a clear commitment in July either to introduce the Bill or to make alternative savings.    Toraise additional taxation by means of an increase in VED was not asatisfactory alternative and would not enable the Government to keepwithin the agreed limits for public expenditure.    There were well-established objections of principle to hypothecating tax revenue as was involved in this proposal.    The alternative possibility of increasingthe NHS component of the national insurance contribution was equallyunacceptable.    It would mean that the costs were met by thepopulation at large whereas the principle behind the legislation wasthat motorists should pay for the costs they brought about.   Anadditional provision in the Finance Bill to increase the VED would alsobe controversial.    While a review of all transport taxes was needed,and was indeed already under way, this could not give results in the short term.    The alternatives were therefore to continue with the bill or to cut public expenditure either in the health service or on otherprogramme s .In further discussion it was argued strongly that although the HomeAffairs Committee had approved the detailed scheme for recovery ofaccident costs further work suggested that it was open to serious objections.    These were so serious that they cast doubt whether thelegislation could be carried in Parliament in the form proposed, andwhether if carried it would yield the expected revenue.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet appreciated that the possibility of increasing VED had been putforward as   a constructive alternative to the legislative pressureswhich would arise from a Bill to permit recovery of road accidenttreatment costs.    Nevertheless the Cabinet reaffirmed the decision which they had taken in July that either a Bill should be introducedwhich would permit charges of  20 million to be levied in 1977-78 oralternative savings should be found by the Secretary of State for social services,    if the Secretary of State for Social Services felt in the lightof the criticisms which had been made of the proposed Bill that heshould seek alternative expenditure savings he should bring the matter before Home and Social Affairs Committee.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the  Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.
3,        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(76) 98) to which was attached a note by the chief secretary, Treasury, about the possibility of using savings on PostOffice investment to cover increased expenditure on selectiveassistance to industry,THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Government had recently agreed upon, and persuaded the Select Committee on expenditure to agree to, a changed treatment of the figures for nationalised industry capital investment.   As a result, the definition of public expenditure would in future exclude that part of that capital investment which was not financed from public funds.   This was avery desirable improvement, but inevitably it meant, in the year inwhich the change was made, that there was no baseline (in terms ofwhat the figures on the new basis would have been had that basis beenin  use when the last White Paper was compiled) against which to measure alleged savings; and that made it very difficult to use suchsavings as an offset to excess expenditure elsewhere.    In any case,even if such baseline figures could be constructed In a way whichwould not arouse suspicions of book-cooking among outsidecommentators, it would not be defensible to do it for the Post Officealone, and it would have to be done for all nationalised industries.When the needs of the British National Oil Corporation and of the newnationalised industries - British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders -were taken into account, there might well be no saving to use.    Moreimportant still, any attempt to operate in this way was liable to jeopardise the credibility of the important new presentational change which was now winning acceptance.    In his view, therefore, the savings derived from the Post Office investment programme could notbe used as an offset to additional expenditure on industrial support.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwas generally agreed that it was important to do nothing which wouldupset the success of the new form of presentation.    To have got that new presentation generally accepted was a considerable achievementby the Treasury, who should be congratulated.   It would be helpful Ifthe Chancellor of the Exchequer were to circulate a note which ministers could have by them for reference setting out the newdefinition of public expenditure and the proportion this revised totalbore to the Gross Domestic Product compared with the old definition.On the immediate problem before Cabinet, it was recognised thatthere was a real reduction in Post Office investment, which would nodoubt be reflected in a lower call on the Government for financing;but it was less clear whether, given the difficulty of making thenecessary assumptions about prices and private sector financing, thefigures for nationalised industries as a whole on the new basis wouldbe higher or lower than they would have been In the last White Paper,and thiB was an exercise which should be done.   However, it wasindustrial^fportI*kd postfjFFXCEpVESTMENT
clear that there could be no question of using such a hypothetical base-line in the White Paper to be published in January, although thesituation would be different In subsequent White Papers.The Cabinet -It Took note , with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;a summing up of their discussion.2.        Agreed that savings arising from thereduction in Post Office investment could not be offset against increases in expenditure on industrialsupport.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate a note about the new definition of public expenditure.i.5
4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 99) reporting on a discussion inthe Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El)about additional expenditure on selective assistance to industry,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in his statementof 22 July last he had said that the Government planned to increasesignificantly the resources available for selective assistance to industry through the National Enterprise Board (not) and the scottish and Welsh Devlopment Agencies, as well as through discretionaryassistance in support of the lndustrin.1 strategy.    The Secretary ofState for Industry had put forward proposals to implement this,estimated to cost  90 million In 1977-78,  142 million in 1978-79, 195 million in 1979-80 and  216 million in 1980-81.   El had considered ways in which this additional expenditure might be offset bysavings cn non-selective assistance, but they had been unable to reach any agreement.    The majority of the Committee did not favour makingsavings by ending Regional Employment Premium (REP) in theDevelopment Areas (DA); and some members of the Committee hadfavoiorad making Regional Development Grants (RDG) more selective(eg by limiting payments in respect of very large projects which had little flexibility in location), by reducing the level of RDG inIntermediate and Development Areas (IA and DA), and by reviewing the boundaries of the Assisted Areas (AA) as a whole to reduce theircoverage.    These were, however, important matters of policy, andthey could not be settled in a day or so.    More time was needed fortheir consideration.    Some members of the Committee had favouredmaking free depreciation through the tax system more selective, butin his view this would be damaging to industrial confidence.    Theproblem for Cabinet was to decide how the extra expenditure should be offset.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that theGovernments commitment to give priority to industrial developmentover consumption and their social objectives had not been carried out;and aid to industry had in fact gone down as a proportion of public expenditure.    Industrial confidence was being eroded by such things asthe surcharge on the employers1 national insurance contribution andthe 15 per cent Minimum Lending Rate (MLR).    The industrialstrategy had not been given priority.    Jh the cuts of last July 114 million had been taken off the expenditure of his Department, and 50 million off his nationalised industries; and in Ms view this represented Ms contribution to making more resources available tothe not.   Even so, in view of the deterioration in the position since then, he was prepared to find further savings from industrialsupport.    The REP was regarded as the least Important of all the regional incentives, being equal to only 2 per cent of labour costs - far
less effective than Temporary Employment Subsidy which was worth10 per cent.   By dropping REP in the DA (but not in the SpecialDevelopment Areas)   31 million could be saved in the next year, and  65 million in a full year.    If changes were to be made in RDG,careful study would be required.    They had already been reduced by making the mining and construction industries no longer eligible forthem, and further erosion could affect confidence.    They were regarded as probably the most important of the forms of regionalassistance, although it might well be that the Government had beenmistaken to allow them to go to large projects which could not be sitedotherwise than where they were.   A ceiling on individual projectsshould be looked at, but it would hit the British Steel Corporation, whowould then want more financing from the Government in other ways.There was much to be said for ceasing to pay RDG in the IA, but thiswas politically very difficult.    The boundaries of the AA neededrevision with a view to reducing their stee, since 65 per cent of theland in the country, and 45 per cent of the population, were in AA.He pointed out that of the       figure of  225 million for the not atpresent entered for every year through to 1980-81* British Leyland andRolls Royce alone would next year need more than that total, so theNEB was left with no flexibility to carry out the interventionist rolewhich the Government had envisaged for it.    It was at present nothing more than a glorified state holding company, unable to fulfil Its role in the Governments industrial strategy.    Lord Ryder, Chairman ofthe not, had indicated that he could probably spend another 70- 90 million next year to strengthen and assist industries.    In his view the Government must find some way of making these resources available.In discussion it was argued that if the package which had been proposed in El by the Secretary of State for Industry were adopted,both Wales and Scotland would fare badly, and show a net reduction insupport for industry.    REP was the only labour-intensive subsidythere was, and it was important to the Governments supporters.There were signs that the gap between the AA and the rest of thecountry, which had narrowed for some time past, was beginning towiden again.    This made it a bad time to reduce regional support.Indeed, it could be shown that the Special Development Areas got lessthan their fair share of RDG and REP was the only redress for this.The Government had already decided to reduce the male rate of REPfrom  3 to  2, in spite of the Manifesto commitment to maintain It,and there should be no further reduction in this assistance.In further discussion it was argued that it would be wrong to reduceregional support which was the Governments way of guidinginvestment into the ireae where it was needed.    Indeed, the fact that private investment generally was not taking place in spite of the cut-back in the demand on resources made by the public sector suggestedthat market econorrics were not working and that there was therefore
all the more need for stepping up the activity of the not and the agencies.    Against this It was argued that the Governmenfsexpenditure on industrial assistance was of much less importance thansuch factors as 100 per cent free depreciation, the introduction of the fiscal stock appreciation provisions, and getting the MLR down to a lower level.    It was easy to overestimate the capacity of Governmentto make selective decisions In industry.    Within employment-makingexpenditure, It would be wrong to cut expenditure on regional policysuch as RDG and REP in order to increase selective Industrial as sis-tance,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment had committed itself in July to making more resources available to the not and the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.The problem was to find the offsetting savings which would make thenecessary resources available.    He was not personally wedded to allthe expenditure in aid of regional policy, and was prepared to believethnt over time its value reduced.    Nevertheless It would be verydifficult simply to abolish it; the need was to wean the publicgradually away from it, and the equalisation of the male and femalerates of REP had been a step in this direction.   What was needed wastime to look at expenditure on assistance to industry to see what shiftseould be agreed on within it.    In preparing the White Paper, therefore,the present figures for finance for the not and the Scottish and WelshDevelopment Agencies should be entered but with a footnote to theeffect that the whole field of public expenditure on aid to industry wasbeing examined to see what resources could be shifted to the not andthe Agencies,    In accepting this line, the Cabinet also clearlyaccepted that, by the time the White Paper was published, they musthave put themselves into a position to announce the changes whichwould be made.    This gave them about two months to review theposition, although it was recognised that the exercise couldconceivably be subsumed In any wider expenditure exercise whichmight be necessary following the forthcoming negotiations with theInternational Monetary Hind.    On the question of a successor to the accelerated Projects Scheme, for which the Secretary of State for industry was also bidding for additional money, and which was generally regarded as desirable, this should be treated as a potential charge on the Contingency Reserve on a basis to be agreed between the Secretary of State for Industry and the Chief Secretary,Treasury.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.8
^?PC 5.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theJ^KDITURE        Exchequer (CP(76) 96) covering a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury, about public expenditure in 1978-79 and latertatV&quot; years.q?8-79 andr THE PRIME MINISTER said that the position following their&apos;^ discussion on 26 October on this subject was as follows.    It wask 0118 agreed that the figures in the next White Paper must show no increase4j,(J?l.e.: 0ver those in Cmnd 6393 as modified by the statement of 22 July last.C,J 6) 28*h Agreement had been reached on all items except:illusions,2 i. Major programmes where the outturn was &quot;Relativelyuncontrollable&quot; - viz Social Security and Export CreditRefinance, on both of which the Chief Secretary, Treasury,would report separately at a later meeting.11.       Housing, on which the Cabinet had agreed an Increase inrents saving   30 million a year, but on which all furtherissues remained to be settled.Ui. Expenditure by the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, which had not been dealt with at their last meeting. **uiure THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said mat itlfl?* wxs agreed that the additional bids in respect of the Thames Barrier&apos;W*try of and Investment in pig enterprises listed In the last part of Table 6 of?lojJCulture* the Treasury report annexed to CP(76)91 were accepted, while the bid*M j^**e8 fo* strategic and emergency food stockpiles was, at any rate for the00^ present, withdrawn.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.^ 8 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that heNdin- , had offered to reduce local authority mortgage lending by  150 million^ a year gross in 1978-79 and later years if it could be agreed that theJ^lett^ presentation of public expenditure figures could be amended bo as toWcai exclude lending by the building societies to local authorities.   He was concerned that the funds which the building societies were now making available, with local authority assistance, to down-market borrowerson a case-by-case basis should be expanded throagh an arrangement
with the building societies whereby his Department would make blockallocations to individual local authorities; but to do this it was essential to get round the present convention whereby this would thencount as public expenditure (whereas the case-by-case arrangements,in which the money went direct from the building societies to theindividual borrowers, did not).    He now had reason to believe thatthe money would be forthcoming from the building societies for sucha scheme to fill the gap which would be made by the reduction in localauthority lending he was now offering.    However, he accepted that thepresent year was not a good one for making a further change in thepublic expenditure conventions in the forthcoming White Paper, and hewas therefore content to see the change made in the following white paper.    He needed to discuss urgently with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, how this should be handled so that he could clinch thearrangements with the building societies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwas agreed that the figures for local authority mortgage lendingshould be reduced by  150 million a year gross, on the understandingthat before the next White Paper but one came to be publishedconsideration would be given to a change in the accounting conventionswhereby lending by the building societies to local authorities to enablethe authorities to on-lend toindtvidualmortgagors would not score as public expenditure.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.3.        Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for the environment, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Secretary of State for Wales, to consider further the possibility of amending the public expenditure conventions in the manner envisaged.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he had been askedat the previous discussion to consider what proposals might be madefor offsetting the excess housing expenditure, and he had set out thepossibilities In CP(76) 96.   Annex A to that paper showed how theadditional expenditure might be offset within the housing programme,and Annex C set out possible options on other programmes.    In his view, given that a further public expenditure exercise was possiblefollowing the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),10
it would be better not to touch the items in Annex C but to find the savings within the housing block.    The Cabinet had already agreedto an increase in rents of 8Op from April 1978, and he would now propose some further increase above that, together with reductions in expenditure on municipalisation and on improvements to broadly thelevel of 1977-78, while holding new house building also to the level ofthat year,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT reminded the Cabinet that the additional expenditure on housing was the consequence of the increase in interest rates, and that they had notyet heard how the Treasury proposed to deal with the additional burden this imposed outside the housing programme.    In his view itwould be quite unrealistic to take a hurried decision about the housing programme at a time when the broader exercise might well have to be started in the next two or three weeks.   Annex A to the chief secretary, Treasury&apos;s paper would mean a collapse of the housing programme, and would cut new house building outside the stress areas(which represented half of the housing programme) to one-third of Itspresent level.    He did not regard this as a sensible way of proceeding.It was true that some Conservative-controlled councils would not undertake house building on the scale the present figures allowed; butit would be wrong to provide them with the excuse by cutting figuresback.    The construction industry had lost 250, 000 jobB since theGovernment took office, and more losses were in the pipeline.In the course of discussion the following points were made -a. Xf a major cut in public expenditure had to be made, itwould be preferable to make a few major policy excisionsrather than to erode programmes all round.    It would there-fore be best to wait until it became clear what would be the upshot of the IMF negotiations,b. &apos; Even if large cuts became necessary following the IMFtalks, it was virtually inconceivable that more should be taken out of housing than was now proposed.    Given that the possibleouts hi Annex C -were politically no easier to accept than those in annex A, there ws-a much to he said for-accepting those In Annex A.c. It was of very great importance that the Treasury, intalking to the IMF mission, should be able to demonstrate that public expenditure was firmly under control, and that theGovernment were sticking to their declared limits.   For thisreason it was essential to agree on ways of offsetting theincrease  a. housing expenditure.
d.        The requirement to publish a White Paper lookingfour to five years ahead was irkBome in a situation in whichthe immediate future was by no means clear.    Nevertheless,while it might, in cf.lmer times, be possible to abandon theannual publication, to do so in the present situation would havea seriously adverse effect on confidence.   Against this it was argued that, at a time when the economic prospects werechanging rapidly, the Government would be wrong to commit themselves to particular figures for a period of years ahead.It was particularly important to avoid a situation In which theWhite  Paper was published after it had been overtaken by events.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had not yet reached final agreement on how to offset theadditional expenditure on the housing programme.    Expressed Interms of figures for England only, the additional bids totalled about 450 million.    The   Cabinet had agreed already on a rent increase from April 1978 which would save  30 million a year; and they had accepted the offer of the Secretary of State for the Environment to save a further  150 million a year gross on mortgage lending by localauthorities.    This left a further  270 million to find.    The Secretaryof State for the Environment had indicated his willingness to find afurther   100 million from the housing programme, which meant that 170 million had to be found from other programmes, since thegeneral view was that It was essential to be able to demonstrate to theIMF in what way the announced limits were being kept.   A number ofMinisters had indicated a willingness to make a contribution.    the timetable would just allow the Cabinet to have one further discussionof this subject.    In the ensuing week, therefore, all spendingMinisters would consider to what extent they were able to contribute towards the required outstanding savings of  170 million.    There wasno reason why such contributions should be confined to the suggestionslisted in Annex C to Cp(76) 96.    It would facilitate the Cabinefs nextdiscussion if Treasury officials were to discuss possibilitiesbilaterally with the officials in the spending Departments.Proportionate reductions would also be needed either In the scottish and Welsh housing programmes or In other expenditure.The Cabinet -4,        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister *s summing up of their discussion.12
5,        Agreed that, through increases in rents andcuts in housing expenditure, a total of  280 million a year should be saved in 1978-79 and later years,and that proportionate cuts would need to be madein Scottish and Welsh expenditure.6.        Agreed that at their next meeting theyshould consider in what way a further  170 million(plus pxoportlouiite sums in respect of Scotland andWales) might be saved on other programmes; and invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrangefor officials to discuss the possibilities in themeantime.Cabinet Office4 November 197613
