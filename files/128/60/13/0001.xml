The West German chancellor was, however, impressed with the gravity of the situation, andfearful of the possibility that the world might start moving down thetrade restriction route.    He reminded the Cabinet that the loannegotiations were only one element in the situation, and there were good grounds for believing that others might be negotiable, eg aninternational arrangement to cover the sterling balances.    Without anagreement with the IMF over the loan, there was however no questionof covering those balances, and no question of any other bilateralborrowing.    He had talked privately and separately to Mr Len Murrayand to Mr Jack Jones but there were difficulties in any widerconsultation with the Trades Union Congress (TUC)in view of the needfor complete secrecy.    He suggested that at that day&apos;s meeting theyshould concentrate on the broad strategic options open to theGovernment, leaving more detailed consideration till their meeting thefollowing day.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Cabinet hadto reach a political judgment on the situation.    The West german chancellor had shown himself unsympathetic; the pre sent UnitedStates administration was a lame duck; and President-elect Carterwas an unknown quantity.   All of this pointed to the need for self-reliance.    The country was in the depths of a slump which woulddeepen.    With l  million unemployed the Government must go forreflation in order to move towards their target of getting unemplay-ment down to 700, 000 by 1979.    They must expand the manufacturingbase; and they must safeguard social security benefits.    The cabinet had to choose between two alternative strategies; that which he proposed, and that which was put forward by the Chancellor of th*Exchequer which, with its deflationary impact, was a departure from,not a continuation of, the existing strategy.    In his view deflation was unacceptable.   The expansion which was needed could only be achieved through protection, which was legal both under the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under the rules of the european economic Community (e.c.).    The Government should seek inter-national support for a protectionist strategy which would involve bothimport controls on manufactures and, at least for an interim period,exchange controls to check speculative outflows and facilitate a differential rate of interest for official holders of sterling, togetherwith control of bank advances and reserve powers to introduce planning agreements.    Not to have even attempted to agree such a set of policies internationally would be inexplicable to the Labour movement.If the Government deflated, undermined the industrial strategy, cutback social security benefits and accepted international control of thecountry1 b economic affairs, their political stance would be impossible.Under his proposals the Government would be seen to be defending thenational interest, and in his view in this situation the IMF might wellbe prepared to make the loan available; but if they did not, theGovernment would have a tough self-reliant strategy to follow.    He saw no prospect of survival for the Government if they allowed unemploy-ment to increase in order to meet the demands of internationalbankers.    The effect of the policies he proposed would be to bringabout a more rapid recovery of employment than the other proposals before Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT agreed thatthe choice before the Cabinet was deflation or some alternativestrategy.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer was proposing areduction of  1 billion in public expenditure in 1977-78 - which would increase unemployment - to be followed by a further cut of  1 billionin 1978-79.    This would be a political tomb for the Government.In response to such measures the IMF would issue the loan in tranchesto enable them to police the United Kingdom&apos;s economic behaviour andwould require a Letter of Intent ruling out import controls.    In his view the heart of the country&apos;6 present problems was that we were running a deficit on our current account and had exhausted allpossible sources of borrowing.    It was therefore aeeessary to close
the trade gap and get into surplus as quickly as possible, and the best and speediest way of doing mis would be by imposing controls on imports.    He did not share the views of those who wanted such controlsfor a prolonged period, since he did not believe mat British industry would achieve the necessary regeneration behind protective barriers.All he wanted was to get into current balance as soon as possible.It had been objected to this course that it would provoke retaliation;but he pointed out that under Article XII of the GATT, paragraphs 1and 2 (a) (i) and (ii) of which he quoted in extenso, such action by theUnited Kingdom was fully justified and there was no provision forretaliation by other members (unlike the position under Article XIX,which dealt with selective controls, and which did concede such aright).    The trade pledge entered into by members of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,which the Government had twice reaffirmed, contained the reservationthat it was dependent upon the surplus countries behaving in such a way as to stimulate world trade, and the failure of the surplus countries inthis respect removed any inhibition cn account of that pledge.    It was true that there was some risk of emulation by those in a similarposition to the United Kingdom.    Italy would undoubtedly follow suit,and just possibly France and perhaps such countries as Australia,New Zealand and Canada, who were all in balance of payments difficulties; but the major surplus countries - the United States, west germany and Japan - would have no right to do so.    In his view itshould be possible to adopt import controls and to persuade othercountries that it was sensible for us to do so.    This would lead to a surplus of  4 billion on current account in 1978.    Admittedly there remained the short term problem of obtaining the necessary financialassistance to cover the immediate period of difficulty, but it shouldbe possible to bridge this gap, perhaps by introducing import deposits.The IMF could not afford to refuse help to a major democracy, but ifthis should happen one alternative possibility would be to seek to rollforward to a later date the repayment of the short term standby credit,at present due to be repaid on 9    December.    Another possibility would be to arrange for the mobilisation of the country&apos;s capital assets and arrange for their orderly release until the current account deficitwas closed.THE FOREIGN AND C02j MONWSAI*TK SHCRJBTARY said that neither of the strategies proposed by the Secretary of State for Energyor the Secretary of State for the Environment were necessary oneconomic merit.    The Governmenfs present economic strategy was working and the case had not been made out either for import restrictions or for a further deflation of  1 billion.    In his viewexpenditure cuts on such a scale would be disastrous.    If the IMFpushed the Government that far, it would become necessary for thePrime Minister to state publicly that the only alternative to such acourse would be a siege economy.    The reaction to such a threatwould be that the United States and Germany would ensure mat theIMF would act in such a way as to avert that possibility.    The question
was; what deal would be tolerable with the IMF.    In his view it wouldbe acceptable to cut the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)by  1 billion as long as this was done mainly by non-deflationarymeasures, such as the sale of the British Petroleum shares.    quota restrictions would be wholly inconsistent with the XMF&apos;s attitude; butit might be possible to do something about import deposits.    taken with  1 billion of other cuts, the PSBR would go below  8y billion in1977-78, and this would appear the more acceptable as being part ofa larger strategy.    The deflationary effects of import deposits were very much less than those of comparable expenditure cuts.    Whenthe annooaceme nt of an agreement with the IMF was made, theGovernment should at the same time announce the cuts which they had recently agreed but not yet made public - although he accepted thi*tthis was a presentational point only, since the cuts were policy changesneeded to keep expenditure within planned limits.In the course of discussion the following points were made;-a. It was by no means clear, given the limited scale of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s foreign exchange reserves, that if a policyof import controls were adopted it would be possible to finance the external deficit, which would inevitably persistfor some time, without having to resort to such steps asdrastic rationing.    It might be, as the Secretary of State forthe Environment had suggested that, faced with proposed action under Article XH of the GATT, the ZMF would make theloan available; but if this proved wrong the country could befacing a bankrupt situation.    It had been argued that it wouldbe necessary to impose exchange controls at the same time asimport controls in order to stop a capital outflow; but it waspointed out mat the United Kingdom in fact enjoyed a net inflowof capital, since much of what was scored as an outflow was infact capital investment overseas from retained profits.b. It was suggested that if, aB part of the price of a loan,the IMF required an undertaking that import controls would notbe introduced, then a decision against them now could not be reversed: but it was pointed out that the Letter of Intent would only specify the need for prior consultation.    The IMF would wish to monitor the United kingdom s progress over a two-year period and they would propose to spread the release of theloan over that time - although it was hoped to get a large partof the loan as soon as the agreement was signed.c. It would be a mistake for those who regarded it as of greatimportance that the United Kingdom should have the loan tounderestimate the negotiating power which this need placedin the IMF&apos;s hands.    Furthermore, the IMF view was that thepresent exchange rate was too high rather than too low, sothat they might well be prepared to go to the absolute limit in negotiation.4
d. There must be doubt about the Foreign and commonwealth secretary^ proposal that, if the IMF pushed for largeexpenditure cuts, the Prime Minister should state publicly that a seige economy was the inevitable alternative.    Such a move could lead to a collapse of confidence which made it an extremely risky procedure.e. A go-it-alone policy was not viable, since the country would be unable to finance the needs of her basic industries.Import deposits were not a painless alternative, and it was recalled that the import surcharge scheme of 1964 hadprovoked strong opposition in the countries of the european free Trade Area and a withdrawal of their co-operation inwider fields.    Action on imports was contrary to theinterests of a country which, like the United Kingdom, tradedworld-wide.    The reaction of the e.c. would need to beconsidered, particularly on such otherwise unrelated issues as the Green Pound, through which the United Kingdom was atpresent enjoying a subsidy of some  500 million a year.f. Rising unemployment was inevitable under any of the policies before the Cabinet.   The rationalisation of industries such as shipbuilding, aircraft and the motor car industry, aswell as coal and steel, was all aimed at improving productivity and thus - at least in the short term - increasing unemploy-ment.    It had to be remembered that, thanks to the labour government, the worst of the misery had been taken out ofunemployment by the payment of reasonable levels of benefit.g. It would be important to avoid making the mistake of doing too little - even if that were enough to get the loan - andthen having to do more and worse at a later stage.    It was by no means clear that  1 billion off the PSBR by means whichwouM not affect employment would create the necessary marketconfidence; while import deposits involved grave disadvantages in the second year when their effects were reversed.h. If it proved possible later to reduce personal direct taxation, this would release a considerable fund of goodwillamong Labour Party supporters.    It might be worth consideringthe possibility of differential taxation in favour of those whoworked in specified sectors such as manufacturing industry.More immediately, the possibility of an increase in ValueAdded Tax should not be ruled out, since the effects of mis onthe retail price index would probably be less damaging thanthat of a fall in the value of the pound.5
i.    All the main schemes put before Cabinet had three aims in common: first, the desirability- of obtaining the IMF loanif this were possible; second, the need to cut imports,whether by controls or by higher unemployment; and third,the survival and improvement of British industry.    these three ends would be beBt served by adoption of the scheme putforward by the Secretary of State for the Environment,j.    It was argued that although the morale of the Party wasvery low, it would hold together to put through the Chancellorof the Exchequers proposals.    Against this the view was taken that it was too much to ask the Government&apos;s supporters tostomach a third package in a year, including cuts in the s.jcialsecurity field which required legislation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet must decide which of the courses before them was the least disagreeable.His proposals had been condemned as deflationary, but he remindedCabinet that the large PSBR in prospect was inflationary and a cut init would simply modify the degree of inflation.    The under use of capacity in the country was part of a world phenomenon.    In his view the right adjustment to make to such a situation must take full accountof the monetary and financial factors and the effect they had upon thereal economy.    The PSBR had to be cut because it was impossible to finance it at the prospective high level save by printing money ormaintaining excessive interest rates.    Without the IMF loan the external deficit could not be financed, there would be no safety netfor the sterling balances, no acquiescence by other countries in ascheme of import deposits, and no bilateral lending.    He remindedCabinet that if, in the event, the PSBR looked like being lower thannow forecast, it was always possible to feed demand into the economythrough cuts in taxation in the Budget, a course which would proveextremely popular.    In his view failure to reach agreement with theIMF would cause unemployment to rise very rapidly.    A siegeeconomy of the kind envisaged by the Secretary of State for Energyimplied also a command economy, which was contrary to themaintenance of the mixed economy to which the Government was committed.    The Secretary of State for the environment s alternative would not cut unemployment, and being a short term policy designedto last only until the balance of payments was in surplus, it involvedall the short term disadvantages without any of the longer termprospects of improvement.    He reminded Cabinet that effectivelyaction had already been taken on imports since the depreciationwhich had taken place in the exchange rate since 1975 had beenequivalent to a tariff of 25 per cent.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet had now reached a point at which it should be possible toreach a conclusion on the general economic strategy to be adopted.It was clear that the majority were not in favour of adopting a strategywhich would involve quota restrictions on imports; and that theywould support the continuation of efforts to reach agreement with theIMF on the loan - although some members of Cabinet who favouredthis course would wish to reconsider the alternative, protectioniststrategy if the terms of an IMF loan proved to be too arduous.    no agreement had however yet been reached on the question of the Biceor composition of the package which the Cabinet would endorse either on its own merits or in order to obtain the loan.   At their meetingon the following day they would need to decide the amount by wbicathe PSBR should be reduced, and, in very broad terms, how such areduction should be achieved.    Further detailed discussion would ofcourse be necessary subsequently in order to settle the precise make-up of the package; but the Cabinet needed to settle without further delay what proposal to put to the IMF.    He indicated that he would beseeing certain members of the TUC that evening and would listen totheir views and inform them, as far as he properly could, of thesituation.    He observed that in his view the state of the Labour party was not, perhaps, as bad as some had suggested, and that there was a growing understanding of the situation which had to be faced and an increasing will to come together in a closer unity.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet office December 19767
