The Cabinet had before them a draft of a statement which theChancellor of me Exchequer proposed to make in the House ofCommons the follow^ig day about the outcome of the negotiationswith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a further drawingby the United Kingdom (CP(76) 131),    There was also made availableto them for the meeting, and subsequently withdrawn, a copy of theproposed Letter of Intent which the Chancellor of the exchequer would sign the following day, setting out the economic policies which the Government would pursue over the next two years..THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the draft of theLetter of Intent followed a similar pattern to that used in 1969.    it contained some standard undertakings, eg in relation to generalised,as distinct from temporary selective, import restrictions;  and included an undertitking not to impose restrictions on internationalpayments, eg currency for holiday purposes.    The draft had certain special features, in that it laid down performance criteriarelated to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) and domestic Credit Expansion (DCE), but not specifically to the moneysupply.    If the Government wished to depart from any of the undertakings given in the Letter of Intent, it would be necessary to consult with the IMF and to get their agreement.   Similarly, if inthe event the performance criteria were not being met, it would benecessary to consult the IMF and - unless good reason could be shown for taking no action - agree with them what needed to be done to ensure that the criteria were met.    If at any stage the Governmentwere unable to reach agreement with the Fund, and decided to gotheir own way, then they could do so but would forgo any undrawntranches of the loan.    Some tolerance, although not as much as hewould have liked, had been built into the figures for the performancecriteria.    He drew attention to the contingent arrangement inparagraphs 16 and 19 of the draft letter whereby some adjustment of the performance targets might be made, depending upon the forecast rate of economic growth,    He had reported these contingentundertakings to Cabinet on 6 December.The Chancellor of the Exchequer went on to explain that the talks with the other countries concerned about a safety net for the sterling balances had not reached as conclusive a point as had earlier been hoped, mainly because of the difficulties being made by theUnited States Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank who preferred amuch more ambitious arrangement to fund the balances over a period.There was a good case for such a scheme, but it involved a number of very difficult questions, including: the kind of undertaking needed to stop the balances from building up again; how, in that situation, theUnited Kingdom could rebuild her reserves;  and what exchange rate1
policy the United Kingdom should follow.    Such a scheme wouldalso require discussion with the sterling holders themselves, andall of this would take time.    It was now clear that final agreement on the less ambitious ccheme for a safety net would not be reached in time for him to announce it the following day, and a lessforthcoming form of words had therefore been agreed with theother countries concerned.    This would refer to the general desireon the part of those concerned to achieve a satisfactory arrangement for the sterling balances, adding the belief that it would be possibleto reach an agreement bofore long.    The United States Governmenthad given an assurance that they would make supporting statements to the same effect, but they were not prepared at present to goany further,hi discussion the following points were made -a. The absence of a firm arrangement covering the sterling balances was a great disappointment, and meant that the position was by no means satisfactory.    Thedifficulty clearly stemmed from the reluctance of theUnited States Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank,    Althoughthe Germans had been co-operative throughout, they had always made it clear that they could only participate in asafety net arrangement if the Americans did the same.    Itwas accepted, regretfully, that there was no help for it butto use the form of words which had been agreed with theother countries concerned,b. The letter restricted the freedom of the Governmentto introduce import controls if, for example, the level ofunemployment rose.    Nevertheless, it did contain - inparagraphs 6, 7, 15 and 16 - provisions which left theGovernment some room for reviewing the situation in thelight of changing circumstances.    Moreover it would always be open to the Government if the country was in balance ofpayments surplus in 1978 to take its own decisions and forgothe remaining instalment of the loan.    It was suggested thatthere was some ambiguity about the precise meaning ofparagraph 16, particularly the penultimate sentence, whichcould be read to mean that fiscal action would be taken toprevent economic growth from rising above 3^- per cent a year.An amendment, to be put to the IMF, was agreed to make itclear that such action would be intended to allow such growthto take place rather than to restrict it.c. Jn paragraph 12 of the draft letter there werereferences to the present burden of direct taxation whichwas &quot;excessive especially at the lower and higher earnings2
levels&quot; and to the Chancellor of the Exchequers personalbelief that the present levels of direct taxation weredamaging.    It was argued that the implication that theGovernment was contemplating a reduction in the taxation on higher earnings was unnecessary, had not been discussed in Cabinet, would have an adverse effect upon the forthcoming negotiations for round 3 of pay policy and should be omitted.Against this it was argued that the expression of such an intention would be helpful to confidence and would provide an opening for refLationary action if, eg, the new United states administration adopted an expansionary economic policy.After further discussion it was agreed that the referenceto the Chancellor^ wish to reduce the burden of direct taxationshould stand and also the final sentence about the disincentiveeffect of the present levels: but that the IMF should be askedto accept the omission of the reference to taxation beingexcessive at the lower and higher earnings levels.d. Paragraph 24 of the letter raised political difficultiesbut was not open to amendment.    It embodied standardconditions for IMF loans, and the Government were in factalready bound by it as a result of the conditions entered into on the occasion of their last drawing,e. The reference in paragraph 4 to average earningsrising In the 12 months ending July 1977 by &apos;*iot much morethan half of the amount of increase in the preceding 12 months&quot;implied too high a figure.    The Chancellor of the exchequer undertook to agree a revised form of words with the Secretaryof State for Employment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that on the assumption that the International Monetary fund would be prepared to accept the amendments which had been agreed in the course of discussion, the Cabinet authorised the Chancellorof the Exchequer to sign a letter in the terms of the draft before themin return for a credit drawing of SDR 3, 360 million.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion, and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to be guided accordingly.
^ THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, because oft^fient the pressure of work involved, there were a number of errors inthe draft statement circulated under cover of CP(76) 131.   He wasin any case, following some discussion with the Prime Minister,proposing to shorten the text by about one-third, cutting out mostof the first five pages, reducing the section on the sale of british petroleum (BP) shares, and removing some of the repetition aboutDCE and the detail on the control of credit.    Where it was possibleto do so he would be adding figures of savings in the appropriateparagraphs.    The reference in paragraph 21 tc a further statement by the Secretary of State for Defence would be omitted; and inparagraph 48 he would be using the words about a safety net whichhe had indicated in their discussion of the Letter of Intent.    Heindicated that he now hoped to arrange with the IMF for a firstpayment of $l-$lj billion in January.j^uc Service THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE^ons said that she had earlier that morning chaired a meeting ofMinisters to consider what should be said in the statement aboutthe uprating of public service pensions.    The meeting had reachedthe conclusion that there were very formidable difficulties indeedabout legislating to cover the whole of the public sector, since insome of the nationalised industries there were schemes where theduties of the trustees would need to be modified.   Such legislation would be extremely complex.    It would be necessary to consult the unions before any details of restrictions in the increases in public service pensions could be settled, and to consult both sides of industry before anything could be said about what might be donein the nationalised industries and in the private sector.    Hermeeting had thus considerable doubts about the wisdom of proceeding with the proposed savings in public service pensions, although theyhad agreed a form of words which might be used if Cabinet choseto do so,hi discussion there was general agreement that to extend therestriction on increases in pensions from the public service to the nationalised industries would be politically extremely difficult,while to restrict it to public service pensions only would provokestrong opposition from the public service unions.    It was true thatit might be possible to legislate to break the mandatory link withincreases in prices, and for the Government to indicate how they proposed to exercise the new discretion in respect of their owndirect employees, leaving other public sector employers to act asthey saw fit;  but it was felt that this would in fact be more difficultthan finding altemativo savings sufficient to ensure that the totalsavings were safely above the flares of  1 billion and  l  billion4
for 1977-78 and 1978-79 respectively.    One possibility would beto increase the price of gas, not by the 8-9 per cent which hadalready been planned, but by 10 per cent, which would provide anadditional  10 million of savings; but it was objected to this thatit would be tantamount to imposing a tax upon a necessity, whichwould have to be paid by all consumers including the poorest,which would be a negation of the Governments social priorities.Other possibilities in the field of nationalised industries included a saving of  10 million in 1977-78 on the financing requirement ofBritish Airways and a saving of  10 million in 1978-79 achieved bycharging for airport security.    The possibility of some savingfrom Post Office telecommunications was also considered and itwas observed that an increase of 1 per cent in telephone chargescould yield  20 million in a full year.    This would, however, meanoverruling the Price Code, would mean that the industry was over100 per cent self-financing, and would provcke pressure from the equipment manufacturers to reduce charges and thus increase thedemand for their equipment,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was generally agreed that the time was not yet ripe to announce any change in the arrangements for the uprating of publicservice pensions; the possibility of action in this field could beconsidered further in the context of the proposed discussions withthe Trades Union Congress and other interested bodies concerningthe inter-relationships between changes in earnings. Social security benefits, occupational pensions, and rates of taxation.    The Cabinettherefore agreed that no savings should be scored on this account inthe present package,    hi order to ensure that the total savingswere sufficient, the Cabinet agreed that, while it might be unnecessary to announce all the details in the near future, a saving of  10 million in 1977-78 should be made in the financingrequirement of British Airways; that a saving of  10 million shouldbe made in 1978-79 by charging for airport security; and that a saving of  20 million in 1978-79 should be made from the financingrequirement of the Post Office, possibly by an increase in telephonecharges, although precisely how it should be achieved would be amatter for the Secretary of State for Industry to consider further.This would mean that the total savings would be shown at 1, 016 million for 1977-78 and  1, 513 million for 1978-79.The Cabinet -2, Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.5
THE PRIME MINISTER reported that he had met the Chiefs of staff at their request the previous week and they had read to him a formal statement expressing their concern at the proposed defencecuts and their fear that the cuts would make it impossible for themto discharge their responsibilities.    He had told the Chiefs of staff that he would report their concern to the Cabinet, though he had indicated mat he thought mere was little likelihood of any changebeing made.    He had undertaken to consider very carefully theirviews on how the cut of  200 million in 1978-79 would be made.The Secretary of State for Defence should now inform the north atlantic Treaty Organisation of the proposed defence savings andthe further cut of f 30 million in 1978-79 to which tjie Cabinet had agreed in October.The Cabinet -3.        Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement on this topic.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion on the draft statement, said that, subject to the points which had been made in discussion, and to the shortening which the Chancellor of theExchequer would undertake, the Cabinet were content with thesubstance of the proposed statement.   Any drafting points which individual Ministers wished to make should be in the hands of theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;8 office by 5.00 pm that afternoon.It was left to the discretion of individual Ministers to inform such bodies as nationalised industries and local authorities of the changes which would affect them either shortly before or immediately afterthe statement was made the following afternoon.    The Cabinet notedthat both the Letter of Intent and the economic forecast required bythe Bray amendment to the Industry Act 1975 would be madeavailable in the Vote Office the following afternoon.The Cabinet -4.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;a summing up of their discussion and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office15 December 19766
