The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in*AIRS the House of Commons during the following week.?**vi?- A^1^ Z- THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidFAIRS that in March the Cabinet had authorised further discussions withthe Argentines.    Since then, two rounds of talks had been heldj, and Lord S hackle ton&apos;s survey of the Falkland Islands had been^*land Islands published.     The Argentines wanted a third round and we could nolonger postpone a decision on this.    The Defence and Overseaions Policy Committee (DOP) had considered three options.    The firstCC rence: was that we should state publicly that we intended to embark onCo      Hth negotiations with the Argentines about our interests in the South^lllBiaXX3 West Atlantic, including future relations between the Falkland Islandste 3 and Argentina     This would clearly be seen as involving discussionof sovereignty and could result in a political storm.    The secondoption was to break off the dialogue with the Argentines.    This wouldbe very damaging to our political and economic interests and wastherefore unacceptable.    The middle option, which DOP hadendorsed, was that he should make a statement in the House ofCommons soon after the Recess to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared to commission a number of feasibilitystudies of the recommendations in the Shaefeleton Report, but thatthis should make it clear that the financing of their implementationcould only be done on the basis of interdependence between the falkland Id lands and Argentina..    Following mis statement hei proposed to send a Minister to the area, probably in March, toi consult with both the Islanders and the Argentines in order to see whether there was a possibility of joint talks on this basis later inthe year.^eia THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, asfr^^ he had announced in the House of Commons on 14 December, the^&quot;Vious Geneva conference had been adjourned until 17 January.Ckf7^nC*: Mt Ivox ********* would l**ve shortly after Christmas for visits toCfl^J. ) 33rd the African capitals and Salisbury.    Two factors had emergedF*tln     *0nB- since the  Conference had begun which had blocked progress.    TheI 1 first was that there was clearly no chance of agreement on the basisof Mr Smiths a five points.    The second was that, contrary to the expectations of the Blacks, Mr Smith remained firmly in power in Rhodesia,    This had produced a deadlock in Geneva.    With theobject of breaking it, we were now working on new proposals, whichwould have to depart from the five points.    But they would remain within the limits of what the Cabinet had agreed.    If they weretabled in Geneva, there would be a risk of their being rejectedoutright and for this reason he had decided mat it would be better to adjourn the Conference so as to allow time for consultations on the
new proposals with, the delegations and the front line Presidents.It was encouraging that all the delegations had expressed their firmintention of returning to the Conference in January.    He thought itwould be possible to produce alternative proposals which would command the assent, even if reluctantly, of the Nationalists and hewould hope, with American help, to get the South Africans to enforcetheir acceptance by Mr Smith.    Dr Kissinger had told him theprevious week that he had no intention of taking any further initiativebut would still give any support for our efforts mat he was asked for.Two American officials were in London this week to discuss our new proposals and, in his view, it would only confuse the situation if theUnited States Administration were to intervene actively in thenegotiations at this fltage.    Such criticism of Mr Richard as had appeared in Press report was wholly unjustified: he had done a goodjob and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had been glad topay tribute to this in the House on 14 December.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said he had some good news to report.    It was almost certain that byttJ!*?Tti I April 1977 all unauthorised Russian and East European trawlers*gu Affairs)     would be out of British waterB.    This was because the Russians had now declared their intention of enforcing a 200-mile fishery limit of their own.    This meant that the difficulties we had foreseen overthe enforcement of our fishery limits, especially against Soviettrawlers, should be much less substantial than we had feared.A^?tB with the      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY Baid that he was^ted States     aware that a number of hie colleagues would wish to make early contact:^**tration        with the new United States Administration.    He was anxious to ensurethat these contacts were properly co-ordinated.    This was particularly important before a decision had been taken on when thePrime Minister should visit Mr Carter.    He hoped there would be norush to Washington and that bis colleagues would keep him closely in touch with their intentions and in particular observe the proceduresset out in paragraph 43 of C(PR)(76) 1.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign andj Commonwealth Secretary.
te-HCrtja. rule^HevioueReference t1stConclusions,Uioute 13.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that during the closing stages ofthe negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and in preparation for the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ statement a numberof papers had necessarily to be circulated to the Cabinet at very short notice.    A fast moving Parliamentary situation had similarlynecessitated the circulation at short notice of some of the paperswhich they would be considering during the present meeting.    he regretted the reed for this and wished to emphasise to his colleagues the exceptional nature of the dispensation.    The Cabinet could notwork effectively if they had regularly to consider papers at such short notice, and Departments should observe carefully the guidance set outin paragraph 9 of C(PR)(76) 1 regarding the timely circulation of memoranda.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the Prime ministers statement.
4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council on referenda about devolution to Scotland and Wales(CP(76) 134).   A Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet covering an analysis by the Constitution Unit of the characteristics and implications of such referenda (CP(76) 135) was relevant to the discussion.THE LORD PRESIDENT QF THE COUNCIL said that the movement ofParliamentary opinion, on referenda during the Second Reading debate on the Scotland and Wales Bill compelled him to ask the Cabinet to reconsider the matter at short notice.   A pro-refer end vim motion in the name of Mr Leo Abse MP had attracted over a hundred and fiftysignatures.    It now seemed that the Speaker would not call the motion, but pressure of expectation centred upon it had bu  t upgreatly, and the size of the Governments majority on Second Readingwould be seriously Imperilled if the Government made no newresponse to this pressure.    It seemed in practical terms inevitable that referenda would have to be conceded at some stage; the balanceof advantage pointed to doing so now.In discussion there was general acceptance of the Lord President&apos; bappraisal.   Although there were some objections of principle toholding referenda, nothing that toe Government had said earlierpresented any major reason against adopting referenda now in relationto a constitutional matter of such a special character as devolution.An announcement that the Government accepted the principle ofreferenda on devolution should not pre-empt decisions on detailedaspects, though it was recognised that there were very cogentarguments against extending the referenda to voters in England andNorthern Ireland.    At the same time, it was noted that in mis, as inother matters arising on the Scotland and Wales Bill, the government might not find it easy to get their way in Parliament.    It was suggested,in particular, that there might well be pressure both for some form of proportional representation for the Assemblies and for a review of thelevel of representation at Westminster, following devolution.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Governmenfs acceptance of the principle ofreferenda on devolution should be announced by the Minister of State,Privy Council Office, in opening the final day&apos;s Debate that afternoonon the Second Reading of the Bill.    The terms of the statement should follow those proposed in CP(76) 134, as slightly amended inaccordance with the Cabinet1 s discussion.    He would himself seekduring Question Time to give the House warning of the impendingannouncement.    The outstanding detailed aspects of referenda shouldbe brought before the Ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategyby the Lord President, with a view to Cabinet decisions after the christmas Recess.4
The Cabinet -1.      Touk note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord President of the Councilto proceed accordingly.5
5,        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(76) 136) reporting theconclusions of the Home and Social-Affairs (HS) Committee discussion on the handling of the Committee Stage of the Social Security(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the HS Committee^ discussion ofthis problem, which had been remitted to them by the Cabinet theprevious week, had been severely handicapped by the absence ofmany of the senior Ministers who were members of the Committeeand by the absence of any Commons Whip.    In addition theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Minister for social security had not been able, by that stage, to carry very far theirconsultations with interested trade union representatives andbackbenchers.    The Committee had therefore been unable to form a judgment on whether the concessions under consideration wouldenable the Government to carry Clause 4 which dealt with therestriction of unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners.The Committee^s conclusion, however, was that the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Minister for Social Security shouldbe given discretion to raise from  25 to  30 the weekly level of occupational pensions above which unemployment benefit began to bereduced; and to offer, but only as a last resort in the committee stage itself, the concession of making the provision temporary.The Committee would consider Clause 13, which dealt with studentaccess to supplementary benefit, at an early meeting after the recess when interdepartmental discussions about possibleconcessions would have been completed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thathe had met representatives of the Post Office Engineering Union theprevious afternoon.    They remained totally opposed to the principleof the provision to restrict unemployment benefit and would stilloppose it if the weekly limit were raised to  30 and the provision made temporary.    But they would be less critical of it if theGovernment made both these concessions.    He would be seeing theTrades Union Congress (TUC) on Monday to discuss their attitude tothe provision and the Minister of Social Security would be talking toMr George Cunningham MP, who was a member of the StandingCommittee, to ascertain his reactions to the concessions whichmight be offered.    The Confederation of British Industry weretotally opposed to the provision but had recently indicated that theywould not wish to send a deputation to discuss it.In discussion, it was suggested that the Government should not rule out the possibility of raising the weekly limit to  35, instead of  30,since this would still secure worthwhile savings of  9 million in afull year.    Doubt was expressed, however, whether a limit of  35would be any more successful in overcoming objections.Preliminary soundings of Mr Cunningham had indicated that he6
himself might be more attracted by an amendment to make theprovision temporary since it could men be represented, withoutprejudice to the principle, as a measure of economic stringencyin the present difficult situation.    The point was made that atemporary provision was otherwise unattractive; and the inequity,at least for those affected by it, might appear greater.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusions of HS Committee set out inparagraph 5 of CP(76) 136, except that the Secretary of State for social Services and the Minister for Social Security had discretionalso to offer a weekly limit of  35 if that was likely to enable theprovision to be carried.     The Cabinet noted that the Secretary ofState for Social Services would have considerable difficulty in findingalternative ways of securing the savings to which he was committed by the Cabinet&apos;s public expenditure decisions in July.    He should therefore do wJiat he could to secure the passage of the Clause in a form which achieved the maximum savings.   Any proposals for concessions on Clause 13, relating to student access to supplementary benefit, would be considered by HS Committee whichwas free to reach a decision without reference to the Cabinet.    TheSecretary of State for Employment, in addition to the other ministers directly concerned, would wish to be consulted about the preparationof any paper.    It was important that senior Ministers should,whenever possible, attend Cabinet Committees of which they were members; and he would arrange for them to be reminded of this obligation.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Ministerfor Social Security to be guided accordingly.^ATHON (UK)       6.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of**TED State for Scotland (CP(76) 132) about possible assistance forMarathon (UK) Limited.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thatMarathon(UK) Limited were just completing their laBt order, ajack-up rig for Abu Dhabi, and had no prospect of immediate further work.    The company had suspended the 1, 400 employees but if further work was not obtained these suspensions would soon haveto be turned into redundancies.    There was the possibility offurther orders in 1977 both from Abu Dhabi and from Petro Baltic;and he proposed that the Government should take some action tobridge the gap between the order now being completed and the
placing of further firm orders.    Marathon was the only company in the United Kingdom with facilities to construct oil explorationrigs.    The yard had a good record both on profitability and productivity with good quality management.    It would be a tragedyto allow the facilities to disappear when there was a fair chance offurther orders to come.    The company&apos;s unique position meant that any help given to it could not easily be quoted as a precedent for similar help to the shipbuilding industry generally.    Marathonhad been excluded from nationalisation as a result of undertaking^given when the company was set up by both the Labour Party in opposition and the trade unions.    He proposed that the assistance should take the form of arranging for the British National OilCorporation (BNOC) to place an order for a rig.    The financing ofabout  13 million could be arranged under the Industry Act 1972partly in the form of arrangements for commercial credit atconcessionary interest rates and partly in the form of loan assistanceNot only would BNOC have need of a rig at some later stage; theirplacing the order would emphasise that this was somethingdifferent from assistance for a shipbuilding firm.    It would be acondition of such assistance that the labour force should be rundown from the present 1, 400 to about 800; and the trade unions had indicated their willingness to accept this.    If no help were given,the firm would collapse and there would be an explosive industrial situation.In discussion it was argued that, although the profitability and the productivity of Marathon had improved, they were still notimpressive.    The firm had already been supported twice by theGovernment; the parent company in the United States was itself in considerable difficulty; and there was world over-capacity forthe manufacture of drilling rigs.    The BNOC had no immediate use for a rig, and they might well need a positive direction before theywould place an order.    The proposal which had been put forwardamounted to building speculatively at a time when sale prospectswere poor;   and in spite of what had been said, it would be quotedas a precedent for other shipbuilding companies, especially on the clyde.     The proposed assistance worked out at  16, 000 a job(which would only continue for nine months if new orders were not obtained) which was over twice what the Government normallyregarded as the limit for assistance under Section 7 of the industry act.    The application had not been processed by the IndustrialDevelopment Advisory Board (IDAB) and the Cabinet had noindependent view of the company&apos;s prospects before them.    Theproposal should therefore be turned down.8
Against this it was argued that, if the preservation of the facilitiesfor constructing exploration rigs were deemedl desirable on grounds of energy policy, then the proposed assistance would bejustified.    A report by the Offshose Supplies Office indicated thatthe market for rigs might well pick up in the next 12 months,and this was the more credible given the likelihood of an early risein the price of oil.    The decision was not, however, withoutdifficulties, and Cabinet were warned that a further request forassistance, from Scott-Lithgow, for the speculative building of adrill ship, would be coming forward shortly,    BNOC had no immediate need for a rig and would normally have met their needat a later stage by leasing.    Nevertheless, on grounds of industrialstrategy, and In spite of the element of risk involved, the proposal should be agreed.    If this were done it would be necessary to seekapproval from the European Commission in Brussels.THE  PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral feeling in Cabinet was that they needed more information in order to come to a view on this proposal which was howeverfavoured by a number of members.    Because of the urgency, thematter had not been put to XDA3 or to the Scottish IndustrialDevelopment Advisory Board (SIDAB), with the result that Cabinetdid not have before them an independent assessment of the merits ofthe proposal or of the future prospects of the firm.    The matter should therefore be referred without delay to IDAB (or its Scottishcounterpart if that were more appropriate) with a view to furtherconsideration by the Ministerial Committee on Economic andIndustrial Policy at their meeting on 21 December and if necessary by the Cabinet later in the week.    In the meantime, as the PolishPrime Minister was visiting London, he would take the opportunityto have a word with him about the prospective order from PetroBaltic.    He informed the Cabinet that, from talks he had already had with the Polish Prime Minister, it was clear that Poland wasvery keen on a joint shipbuilding venture, and that there was everyprospect of orders from Poland totalling 300, 000 tons for the UnitedKingdom shipbuilding industry.    Talks were now proceeding betweenPolish representatives and Admiral Sir Anthony Griffin, the Chairmanof the Organising Committee for British Shipbuilders.    The polish authorities wished to do business with a British Government under-taking; in view of the delay in shipbuilding nationalisation he had asked the Ministers concerned to explore the possibilities of settingup a shipbuilding subsidiary of the National Enterprise Board or some other form of consortium.   He had every reason to hope that,before his departure, the Polish Prime Minister would agree to aStatement expressing the intention to go ahead with these orders,which would give great encouragement to the United Kingdomshipbuilding industry.    In addition, agreement had already beenreached for United Kingdom contractors to build a hotel at the warsaw Air Terminal worth some  75 million.9
The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinistei&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Secretary of State for scotland to arrange for the proposal to assist Marathon (UK)Limited to be put to the Industrial DevelopmentAdvisory Board (or its Scottish counterpart) for urgent advice; and to report the outcome to the ministerial Committee on Economic and industrial policy and if necessary the Cabinet the following week.7.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP(76) 133) by theSecretary of State for the Environment about the procedure for handling proposals for new nuclear reprocessing facilities atWinds cale.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatBritish Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) had applied for planning permission to construct new facilities at wind scale for thereprocessing of irradiated fuel from nuclear reactors.    Theapplication comprised three projectsi.    Improvements to the existing plant for reprocessingfuel from Magnox reactors.ii.     The development of a pilot plant for vitrifyinglong-lived radioactive waste; and.    New facilities for reprocessing uranium oxidefuols from the advanced gas-cooled reactors and forcustomers overseas, notably Japs n.Cumbria County Council who had done their work in a veryresponsible way, had written to him that they were &quot;minded to approve the application&quot; but had pointed out that they could not accept responsibility for expressing their satisfaction with arrangements forthe safe transport of the fuel, the risk of contamination or the long-term build-up of radioactivity in the environment resulting from the projects.    The Ministerial Committee on Energy had considered on24 November whether he should call in the application.    They hadbeen content that the first two of the three projects should go ahead,but opinions had been divided on the third - the plant for handlingoxide fuel.    The planning laws covered a very wide range of activityfrom modest changes to a house to the siting of a new airport, or alarge chemical plant such as Flixborough.    He believed that if theGovernment refrained from exercising their powers in the present10
instance, and exposing the issues to public scrutiny and theopportunity for cross-examination provided by a planning inquiry,it would be unhelpful to the nuclear industry and the Governmentwould be accused of having disregarded environmental con&amp;idera-tions in order not to lose an important contract from Japan,There were several important .*a poets  of the issue which had beanoutside the competence of the local planning eommittee.    Thebuilding of a plant for oxide fuel would increase the level of radio-active discharges into the Irish Sea fourfold.    High radioactivewastes could not be disposed of in this way and would have to bestored since they would remain dangerous for hundreds orthousands of years.    The recent leak from such storage facilities at wind scale, although it had been of a minor nature, added toanxiety on this score.    No country in the Western world had yetsuccessfully operated a commercial oxide plant.    The UnitedStates had constructed three, but had closed them and imposed athree-year moratorium on the reprocessing of oxide fuel.    TheJapanese had a small plant which public opposition prevented them from using.    Only the French were going ahead, but their plant was still under construction.    When Britain had cariied outreprocessing of oxide fuel on an experimental scale there had beena minor accident.    There were also related problems concerningsecurity during the transport of materials to and from the plant forprocessing, and the regime for supervising the return to overseascustomers of the plutonium recovered during reprocessing.    Theywere all serious and relevant questions which neither he nor theCounty Council could answer.    He felt therefore that the Governmentshould not allow the project to proceed until the consequences, notonly in the present but in the future had been thoroughly exploredand exposed to public debate.   He could not call in only part of the planning application, and he therefore suggested that BNFL should beinvited to re submit their applications for the 3 projects separately.The first two could go ahead, and the third be called in for reference to an inquiry.    This could take several forms.   a planning inquiry commission, provided for in the planning acts, had never been used, but it seemed likely that it would take 12-18 months to carry out its work.    For this reason he did not recommend it.The alternatives were a non-statutory inquiry - a panel of &quot;wisemen&quot; or a normal public planning inquiry.    The former might also ,take quite a long time and if it did not reach a firm conclusion might still have to be followed by a further planning inquiry.   A publicplanning inquiry had been the procedure used in the case ofFlixborough.    Despite the complex and difficult issues, the inquiryhad produced conclusions in 5 months.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the ministerial Committee on Energy bad approved the oxide fuelreprocessing project in February 1976, after mere had been a gooddeal of public discussion of the issues.    However mere was boundto be a need for considerable expansion in the nuclear industry in thefuture, and it would be difficult to make progress without public
confidence, not merely in the United Kingdom but world-wide.    Hebad received many representations from countries who were concerned about the problems which had been mentioned.    TheUnited States would like a general moratorium, and the French had said that countries engaging in reprocessing would have to be totallyopen about it.    His own confidence had been shaken recently byBNFL*s delay in informing him about the leak at wind scale, though they had had an opportunity of mentioning it when he had seen themjust before the ENM meeting.    He had been told the previous evening that tritium had been found on the beach at wind scale.    he agreed that the Magnox and vitrification plants should be allowed toproceed, but felt that the oxide fuel facilities should be re-examined.The Japanese who were sensitive about nuclear matters wouldunderstand our reasons for caution.In discussion it was argued that although a great deal of emotion hadbeen stirred up on this issue by The Guardian and by environmentalpressure groups, the National Radiological Protection Board had advised the County Council that they were quite content with thescheme.     Although there had been leaks of radioactivity from timeto time at wind scale, they had all been of a very minor nature andthe latest one had a negligible effect on health.    Delay could be atragedy, and might be interpreted as a contradiction of the announcedpolicy of exploiting the opportunities offered by advanced technology.Throughout its construction the plant would have to meet therequirements of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.    important and responsible trade unions were opposed to calling in the planningapplication.    Reprocessing of Magnox fuel was of great importanceto the Ministry of Defence, who bartered the reclaimed plutonium in exhange for tritium from the United States.    If Britain did not meet its obligation, Anglo-United States nuclear arrangements mightbe called in question by the new United States Administration.Provided the Magnox improvements could go ahead there would be noproblem, but to hold a public inquiry on the oxide plant might reopendebate on the development at Chapelcroon to produce tritium, whichhad already been approved and was under construction.    Under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty the nuclear weapon states would have to provide reprocessing facilities for others if they wanted to limit the spread of the technology.   Against this it was strongly argued that there had already been several disturbingaccidents in experimental oxide fuel plants in the United States, andit would be irresponsible not to call in the application and hold some form of inquiry.    The issues raised by the Secretary of State for the environment constituted an overwhelming cPtse for doing so.In further discussion it was suggested that any inquiry should becarried out as quickly as possible, in order not to risk losing theorder from Japan nor prejudice the service to the United KingdomAGR stations, which would have to close down if there were notfacilities for reprocessing their fuel.    The irradiated fuel elementswould however have in any case to be stored for several years until12
the new plant was ready- to handle them.    The inquiry should be in a form which enabled it to concentrate on the real question whether itwas safe to construct an oxide fuel reprocessing plant rather thanwhere such a plant should be sited.    The only precedent for a planning inquiry commission, was the Roskill Commission on thethird London airport which had taken 3 years.   A non-statutorypanel appointed by the Secretary of State or the Prime Ministerand adopting the procedures used by a Royal Commission might offer the most expeditious solution.    It could call for evidence from whom it chose, and would be free from the possible disruptive influence ofthe more irrational elements which it would be difficult to keep outof a public inquiry.    Moreover questions might be raised whichcould not be answered in cross-examination at a public inquirybecause of security considerations, and obligations to the UnitedStates.    However it was important mat all who wished to make theirviews known should have an opportunity both to do so and to challenge the views of the other parties as they could in a planninginquiry.    There was moreover the danger that, if a non-statutoryinquiry reached no clear-cut decision, there might be irresistiblepressure for a subsequent planning inquiry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for the Environmentshould ask BFNL to withdraw their application, and resubmit thethree projects separately.   He. should allow the application for the improved Magnox facilities, and the vitrification pilot plan to go ahead, and subject to an inquiry the application with relation to plant for reprocessing oxide fuel,. The Secretary ofState for the Environment, should consider urgently in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor the form of this inquiry and the possiblecomposition of a non-statutory panel of distinguished and knowledge-able people to conduct it.   He should bring proposals to Cabinet assoon as possible, and in formulating them bear in mind that the primary objective must be to satisfy public opinion on the safetynot the location of the plant.    He should also circulate forclearance if possible by correspondence the draft of an interimannouncement to Parliament, which he could make before the christmas Recess.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;esumming up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office16 .
