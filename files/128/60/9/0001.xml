I. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Teresaee*slattvegrammeNviouSTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the lords&apos; amendments to the Dockwork Regulation Bill, which had beencarried in the House of Commons the previous night, altered the definition of the cargo handling zones but left untouched the classification of work within these zones which was an important feature of the Bill.    The outcome, however, appeared to be that somework which was already classified as dockwork would now be excluded.For this reason, if for no other, the Government could not bring theBill into operation as it stood.    One possibility would be to accept theBill as amended but to introduce amending legislation next Session,In discussion it was pointed out that the Lords, even if they wished,could not now rectify faults inherent In the amendments carried in the commons,    R would be open to them to send back any amendments which the Commons had rejected and they might be the more ready todo this in the case of amendments which had been rejected by thecasting vote of the Speaker.    It would ttlao however be opento them not to send the Bill back to the Commons, in which case itwould become law in its present form.    The Cabinet need not take animmediate decision on the question whether the Bill would be worthretaining in Jte present form, but a proper assessment of this shouldbe made very urgently particularly if thera was to be any question ofGovernment action to prevent the Bill proceeding directly from the lords to Royal Assent,    The options appeared to be to drop the bill as having no value in its present form and as leaving dockers in aworse situation than at present; to allow the BUI to go to royal assent but not to make the Commencement Order until its defects hadbeen remedied by fresh legislation next Session, If this could becarried; or to decide, on analysis, that the Bill was worthimplementing in its present form whether or not its defects could besubsequently remedied,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Employment should urgently assess the optionsopen to the Government In the light of the Commons&apos; acceptance ofLords&apos; amendments to the Dockwork Regulation Bill and circulate hieadvice to all members of the Cabinet as soon as possible.    The lord president of the Council, in consultation with the ministers responsible, the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, should be readyto report to the Cabinet at their meeting the following week on the stage reached in disputes between the Lords and Commons on other major Bills, including the Race Relations BUI, and on the choiceswhich might then be open to the Government in their further handling.
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Employment to proceed accordingly.^ THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Government would clearly faceNta31 2Jld serious problems between now and the Christmas Recess.   ApartAft from Parliamentary difficulties surrounding the remainder of the1   BPects legislative programme for this Session, the outcome of negotiationswith the International Monetary Fund, though still unknown, loomed upstarkly: and the latest forecasts for the economy presented a muchgloomier picture than the last National Incomes Forecast.    TheSecond Reading of the Devolution Bill was a further major hurdle.   Allthe reserves of stamina and steadfastness, in the Government and theParliamentary Labour Party as a whole, would be required to over-come these problems and uncertainties.   But the lead must come fromthe Government and It was basically for them to resolve now whether to accept the alternative of a Conservative Government or to pursuewith full determination the policies which would be required to see thecountry through this period of unprecedented difficulty.   He had nodoubt himself that the Government should fight the battle through buthe wished to be assured that the Cabinet as a whole were ready to steelthemselves to the unpalatable measures and subordination of individualinterests and judgments which would be required,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet unanimously supported the view that the Government shouldcontinue to govern and should not be diverted by the present and prospective difficulties from their main strategic purpose and alms.They agreed that this statement of intent and their collective backingfor it should be made widely known.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2
^PAIRSViesia*vioue^    -nee:7^*6) 29th2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat Mr Richard, the chairman of the Conference at Geneva, had made a start on discussing with the participants the date for independence.    Despite differences between the Nationalist delegationsand the Rhodesian Front, he hoped to obtain agreement to a compromiseformula shortly.    The negotiations would then turn to the structure ofthe interim administration.    At that point we should be under great pressure from the Nationalists to appoint a Governor General.Reports had appeared in the Press of views expressed by president Nyerere of Tanzania and others on this issue.    It would present great difficulties for us.    He wished to assure his colleagues that no decision would be taken on it without their being consulted.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.3SECRET
^the queen ]sspeech on\thb opening\dp the new\sess10nI PreviousInferences:\ClA(76)28th1 Conclusions,^finute 1 and^M(76) 29th3.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord President of the Council (CP(76) 101) covering a revisedtext of The queen s Speech on the Opening of the new Session, andthe questions how much time would be available for legislation inthe coming Session, which Bills should be promised in the opening speech and the order of priority among other Bills,THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in addition to the Lord Presidentspaper, he had circulated to the Cabinet the note by the Chairman ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) summarising proposals onnext Session&apos;s legislative programme made at a meeting of the PLPon 20 October,    The main message to be taken from this was thatthe Government should seek to lessen the future legislative load,although 19 suggestions had been put forward for legislative action next Session none of which was in fact promised in the draft speech or planned for introduction.    The Session would be a hardone, in that the short recesses would be unprecedentedly short, andit would be crowded because of the time likely to be needed for theScotland and Wales Bill and of the number of other Bills to be fittedin.    Few BUIb would be highly contentious on Party lines, but theOpposition would have ample opportunity to criticise and delay theGovernments business, for instance on devolution and directelections and on the Bills required to achieve public expendituresavings.    The Lord Presidents paper was written on the basis thatthe Government intended to see next Session through to the end andto carry onto the Statute Book all the measures expressly promisedin the Speech.    It was important to start the Session with a legislative programme which was containable and in his view merewould be no advantage in promising Bills in the Speech which therewould not be time to carry through.In discussion it was suggested, in support of the view that thelegislative programme should not be overloaded, that the datesenvisaged for the short recesses next Session would be verypunishing for backbenchers, who should be able to spend more timein their constituencies than these dates would allow.    On the otherhand, it was argued that a programme containing little exceptunpalatable measures would be bad for the morale of government supporters.I **echThe Cabinet then considered the text of the draft Opening speech and the following points were made -Page lf 3rd paragraph.    The second sentence might bethought to imply, incorrectly, that overseas aid waB nowdirectedexclusively towards the poorest developing countries.
This sentence should be amended to read: &quot;Our overseas aid will continue to give increasing emphasis to the needsof the poorest developing countries&quot;.Page 2, 5th paragraph.    The reference to individual libertyin the second sentence was inadvisable, given the continued existence on the Statute Book of powers of detention withouttrial, and should be omitted; the reference to the rule oflaw would embrace the maintenance of individual liberty.Page 3j 3rd line.    The Speech should reaffirm theGovernment&apos;s commitment to obtaining a lasting reductionin the level of unemployment, without qualifying the referenceto the level of unemployment by the adjective &quot;unacceptable&quot;.Page 3, final paragraph.    It might have been preferablesimply to say that legislation would be introduced &quot;to enablethe United Kingdom to extend fishing limits to 200 miles atthe beginning of 1977&quot;; but the formula &quot;for the purpose of enabling the United Kingdom&quot; to extend the limits at thebeginning of 1977 was acceptable.Page 5, 7th paragraph.    The reference to the legislation onconspiracy would require amendment to reflect the decision that this Bill would now incorporate some provisions fromthe Criminal Justice Bill.Page 6, 1st paragraph.    The reference to legislation on housing subsidies in Scotland remained in square bracketsbecause policy on this subject had not yet been settled; butit was hoped that the policy would be cleared in the following week.Page 6f 3rd paragraph. It would be better to place thisparagraph before the reference to other measures whichwould be laid before Parliament.Official Secrets Acts.    No reference to the governments proposals for amending the Official Secrets Acts should beincluded in the Speech; this matter would better be covered in a separate statement or in the Debate on the Address.5
The Cabinet next went through the list of Bills in Annex 3 to cp(76) 101 and considered for which of them time would have to beallowed next Session and which should be promised in the Speech.It was noted that the first 9 Bills in Part IA were those which theCabinet had agreed in May would be Essential and that, althoughlegislation to provide grants for harbour boards might not now benecessary next Session the other 8 Bills remained Essential.    the bills to extend the borrowing powers of British Nuclear Fuels Ltdand to extend the maximum liability limit of the Export credits guarantee Department had since become Essential; the Governmentwere committed to the legislation on fishery limits; and the cabinet had already agreed that the Speech should promise the introductionof legislation on direct elections to the European Assembly.Consideration should, however, be given to combining EssentialBills relating to financial matters.    It was agreed that all the BiU-blisted in Part IB of Annex 3 would have to be included in nextSession1 s programme, and that time would have to be allowed forthe three Bills in Part IIB of Annex 3;  of these three, the Bill on price control and counter-inflation might be long and contentious.In discussion of the Direct Labour Organisations (DLOs) Bill, itwas accepted that this Bill was properly classified Essential in that legislation would have to be introduced next Session to renew powersrelating to DLOs, due to expire on 31 March 1977.    It was, however,suggested that the proposal that this Bill should also extend these powers would be highly contentious and would be opposed by all theOpposition Parties; a reference to such a Bill in the Speech mightattract an Opposition amendment, which might be carried.    It mightaccordingly be better not to mention this Bill in the Speech, or to promise in the Speech only a Bill to continue existing powers; andthen to consider nearer the time of introduction whether it would be advisable to include in the Bill any extension of the existing powers.On the other hand, it was argued that the extension of the present powers would be welcomed by the Governments supporters and by labour-controlled local authorities and was important to the DLOsat a time of considerable difficulty in the building industry.    It wasagreed to retain the wording in the draft Speech promising legislation to remove unnecessary restrictions on the powers relating to DLOs.In discussion of the three Bills in Part HA of Annex 3, it was accepted that the Conspiracy Bill should be promised in the Speech; it wasnoted that the provisions in this Bill relating to Obscenity were nowto be dropped, and replaced by provisions relating to law and orderin the Criminal Justice Bill.    It was also agreed that there were strong political and practical reasons, which had been reinforced by the impact of the drought in South-East Wales, for proceedingnext Session with the Welsh Water Charges Bill and promising misBill in the Speech.6fculs to beWinded in thepromised16 the Speech
The Patents Bill could also be regarded as essential in all but thetechnical sense.    It was needed to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the European Patents Convention, and failure to ratify wouldhave a very damaging effect upon the patents industry in this country.The Bill was uncontroversial and could be introduced in the Houseof Lords.    The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committeehad suggested that this Bill should be promised in the Speech only ifthe Opposition had first agreed to Second Reading Committeeprocedure in the House of Commons; and it was argued that whilethe Opposition might be unlikely to give any firm undertaking to this effect at present, they would no longer have any incentive to do so if the Government committed themselves in the Speech to theintroduction of the Bill next Session.   As against this, it was argued that failure to mention the Bill in the Speech would result inthe Government being pressed about their intentions in the Debate onthe Address, and since the Cabinet agreed that the Bill should proceed, it would be better to promise the Bill in the Speech and notappear to have been forced by pressure into introducing it next session.    For the purposes of negotiating with the Opposition on second Reading Committee procedure, a firm statement of intentionin the Debate on the Address would be no different from a promise inthe Speech.    It was also pointed out that, although Second reading committee procedure would avoid the need to take Second Reading onthe floor of the Commons, the same amount of time would be required on the floor for Report and Third Reading.    It was agreed mat theright course in the circumstances was to retain in the Speech thepassage promising the introduction of this Bill.In discussion of the Bills in Part EC of Annex 3, it was accepted thatthe Bills on Homelessness and on Occupational Pensions could notin the circumstances be mentioned in the Speech, though they werebom important and attractive measures to which the Government were committed.    It had been stated earlier in the Session that theGovernment planned to introduce the legislation on Homelessnessnext Session, and in some respects it would be complementary tothe squatting provisions of the Conspiracy Bill.    The Trades UnionCongress (TUC) attached great importance to the occupational pensions Schemes Bill, and if the Government failed to proceed withthis, it would be seen as a victory for the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) who had been campaigning against it.    It would therefore be most desirable to reaffirm in the Debate on the Addressthat the Government would introduce these Bills at the earliest opportunity, though this would need to be done in carefully chosenlanguage and without implying that either Bill would necessarily beintroduced next Session,7
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet had agreed certain amendments to the draft of the opening speech, and had decided that all the Bills mentioned in the draft should be included but no others.    The Lord President of the council would now prepare a revised draft for him to submit, with thedraft Prorogation Speech which the Cabinet had already agreed, toThe Queen,    The Lord President would also give consideration tothe feasibility of amalgamating Bills in Part IA of Annex 3 of cp(76) 101, and in particular numbers 7, 9 and 12.    There was aconsiderable risk that next Session would prove to be overloaded,particularly in view of the increased difficulties presented by thestate of the Parties in the House.    It was also important, however,that the Cabinet should not lose sight of Bills which had a very strongclaim for introduction if time allowed.   Accordingly, the lord president, with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, should keepthe progress of the legislative programme under continuous review,and make regular reports to the Cabinet.    The Cabinet would thenbe able to consider whether any adjustments should be made in thepresent legislative plans.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.8
JdbucExpenditure* 1978-79 and^ter years[j(76) 30th^&quot;elusions,sfence -4,        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(76) 102) covering a paper by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, about possible savings in public expenditure in 1978-79and later years.le*al THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatwhen the Cabinet discussed mis matter on 4 November they had agreed that of the additional expenditure of about  450 million a year on Housing in England,  280 million should be found from theHousing programme, leaving  170 million to be found from elsewhere.To this had to be added  30 million in respect of Scotland and Wales,which meant that they were looking for total savings of  200 million.It bad been suggested that, given the possibility that a  Urtherexpenditure exercise might be needed when the views of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) were known, there was no pointin pursuing the present savings; but the Cabinet had decided at an earlier meeting to settle the figures for 1978-79 and later yearsand this they should now proceed to do.    hi terms of the Governmentsbargaining position with the IMF, it might be important to show thatthey were planning to keep expenditure within the limits laid down inthe last White Paper (Cmnd 6393).   Any reductions agreed todaywould not be announced until January,    So if mere had to be a furtherexercise - which was not yet by any means certain - then clearlythose reductions would be subsumed in the further exercise.    In themeantime great care should be taken by Ministers not to say anything in public which might pre-empt the decisions which might have to betaken when the outcome of the IMF negotiations was known.    the table attached to the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum set out the areas to which the Cabinet should look.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.9
^fence THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he could not accept the suggestion that a saving of  50 million be made from theDefence budget.    Defence expenditure had already suffered fromfour cuts since March 1975, and this would be the fifth.    He had toallow for the fact that the Anglo-German offset payments which hadbeen assumed to continue probably would not do so; and he also hadto cope with additional expenditure in Northern Ireland costing I0- I5 million.    Cutting defence expenditure had consequences forour allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), to whomthe proposal to make further cuts would have to be reported.    Cutscould only be made by reducing manpower or equipment.   any reduction in manpower led to increased expenditure in the year in whichit took place because of the very high redundancy payments which had tobe made.    He reminded the Cabinet that cuts in equipment meant a lossof jobs in industry.     One hundred and forty thousand job opportunitiesin manufacturing industry had already been lost from defence cuts,and the Armed Forces were large customers of the aircraft, guided weapons and shipbuilding industries which were on the point ofbeing nationalised.    He also pointed out that, even when cuts hadbeen agreed, he did not always enjoy the support of his colleagueswhen it came to implementing them - witness the decision not toreduce the number of hydro-graphic survey ships and the oppositionto closing the Micro-biological Research Establishment at Porton.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet appreciated the serious nature of cuts in defence expenditure and the repercussions they had for NATO.    Neverthelesssome reduction was essential, and the balance of opinion was that a cut of  30 million should be made.The Cabinet -2,        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.s Aid        THE MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT said that toaccept the proposal to keep the aid programme at the 1977-78 level,which would save some  35 million in 1978-79 and later years,would mean that planned aid expenditure would not only not move towards, but would actually fall back from, the internationallyaccepted aid target of 0. 7 per cent of the Gross National Productfor official development assistance.    He drew attention to therelevance of the North-South dialogue and of the possibility that inthat context It might be necessary for the industrialised countries to make some concession to the developing countries.    The10
maintenance o  and Indeed the increase In, the volume of officialdevelopment assistance was important, and if this were seen to begoing down there was the risk that the developing countries wouldsuccessfully press for a higher price to be paid in some other way.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,while there was some sympathy with the view that the overseas aid programme should, as had been the case hitherto, not be reduced the balance of opinion was that some cut should be made, given that so much of the United kingdom s expenditure was being financed by borrowing from other countries.    The balance of opinion in theCabinet was that a cut of  5 million a year should be scored againstthe aid programme.    This would still mean that the programme would be growing in real terms over future years.The Cabinet -3,        Took note with approval of the prime minister s summing up of this part of their discussion.Subsidies      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that the present provision of  84 million in1978-79 and  56 million in later years was somewhat notional andin practice would cover a subsidy on milk for a time at around lpa pint, plus an ability to take up any European Economic Community(e.c.) subsidies that might become available.    He would be preparedto reduce the expenditure by   25 million if the Cabinet would agreethat  2- 3 million a year in 1977-78 as well as later years might then be added to local authority expenditure on consumer protection,which was an activity strongly favoured by the trade unions,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,although there might be a political connection between food subsidies and consumer protection expenditure, the two were technicallyunrelated and it was not possible to strike quite the kind of bargainwhich the Secretary of State had proposed.    The Cabinet were agreedthat the reduction of  25 million should be made in expenditure on food subsidies.    The Secretary of St ate&apos;s proposal for additional expenditure on consumer protection should be very seriously considered but it should be put through the proper channels.The Cabinet -4.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;8 summing up of this part of their discussion,U
^0ads and The Cabinet agreed that a reduction of  10 million a year should bejg^sport made in the expenditure on roads and transport in England,other the Cabinet agreed that savings of  25 million a year should be.    ronmental      made from expenditure on other environmental services in England,8 of which  20 million wculd come from the expenditure of Regionalgland) Water Authorities and  5 million from miscellaneous expenditureother than the Community Land Scheme,Ration and        THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatten tn*s D*stock fta,* a^^ady absorbed some additional expenditure, butStand) Cabinet were agreed that a further  25 million a year could be saved.    One way in which such a saving might be made would be anincrease in the charge for school meals over and above the increase to 25p in 1977-78 already agreed.    This however was purelyillustrative and the Cabinet was not, in agreeing to the  25 millionreduction, taking any specific decision about how the cut would bemade or whether it would be achieved wholly or partly through anincrease in school meal charges.    There were in any case otherways of cutting the net cost of the school meals service, and these would need to be examined.The Cabinet -5.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.^Mthand THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatB*cial me Cabinet were agreed mat a saving of  25 million a year should be mads.probably made up of  10 million from an increase in dental charges,8  5 million from capital expenditure reductions and  10 million fromdrug costs (other than an increase in prescription charges).The Cabinet -6.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.12
?j*cial THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that^Curity there must be doubt whether the Affirmative Resolution which wouldbe needed to withdraw entitlement to flat rate unemploymentbenefit for the first six days of any period of temporary suspensioncould be obtained in the present Parliamentary situation; while thewithdrawal of supplementary benefit from students in the longvacation, if added to the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill was likely to prove so contentious that it might endanger thewhole Bill,    hi this situation the Cabinet agreed mat a saving of 25 million should be made in the net exchequer cost of childbenefit by phasing out child tax allowances for non-resident children from 1978-79 onwards.The Cabinet -7.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.Off]^*ce and The Cabinet agreed that a saving of  5 million should be made inT^ral this expenditure.j,Ccornmodation^ces^-Jand THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,Scot!-,Wales since there was no additional bid for housing from Scotland, therewas no justification for further cuts in Scottish expenditure on this account. The Cabinet were, however, agreed that a reduction of 5 million should be made in Welsh expenditure.The Cabinet -8.        Took note with approval of the prime minister s summing up of this part of their discussion.italy  THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the whole discussion, saidthat the Cabinet had now agreed cuts totalling  180 million in 1978-79,This was sufficiently near to the  200 million which had been their original aim bearing in mind mat the object of the exercise was toshow figures to the IMF and in the next White Paper which were13
broadly in line with those in Cmnd 6393.    The Cabinet had been discussing expenditure in 1978-79, but comparable savings wouldbe needed in 1979-80 and 1980-81, and in most cases mis wouldmean a repetition in the later years of the saving in 1978-79.Any variation from this should be settled in bilateral discussionwith the Treasury.The Cabinet -9.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.14
EUROPEAN[economic IMMUNITYP^ORMPASSPORT9thfusions.5.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 100) on theEuropean Economic Community uniform passport.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled matthe Cabinet at their meeting on 11 June had authorised him to seekCommunity agreement on a layout of the front cover of the proposedEEC uniform passport which would place the name of the issuingState and the national arms above the reference to the european community.   Cabinet had also agreed mat the use of languagesshould conform with existing international practice, whereby issuingStates use their own language plus English or French.    Followingdiscussions in the Community he now sought the agreement of hiscolleagues to a Presidency compromise which largely met these requirements, in that it would place the name of the issuing State,thought not the national arms, above the reference to the Community;would in relation to languages preserve the existing practice of member States except that an index page in all seven languages of member States would be added; and would limit Community competenceto the form of the passport.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, Baid that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary had done well in securing thesubstance of our requirements.    It would be some time before freshnationality legislation could be passed and the uniform passportintroduced in the United Kingdom.   Although some hesitations hadbeen expressed about some of the details, the Cabinet agreed that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should accept the bestcompromise he could obtain on the lines set out in CP(76) 100.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to be guided accordingly in further discussions in the Community.Cabinet Office11 November 197615&apos;     fiy k CONFIDENTIAL
