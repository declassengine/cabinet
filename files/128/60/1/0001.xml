1, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY informed the Cabinet that news had just been received of the death of chairman Mao Tse-tung.    This, following closely on the death of prime Minister Chou En-lai, must be expected to lead to a periodof uncertainty in China in which the moderate and radical elementswould compete for leadership.    But no change was likely in China1 s foreign policy or in her attitude towards the Soviet Union,   a message of condolence an the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung hadbeen sent by the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister of china the Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,The Cabinet discussed Southern Africa. This discussion is recorded separately.2.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (CF(76) 75), and by the Secretaryof State for Prices and Consumer Protection and Paymaster General(CP(76) 74), on the question whether the non-sugar aspects of thetakeover bid by Tate and Lyle Ltd for Manbre and Garton Ltd shouldbe referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection AND PAYMASTER GENERAL said that she had asked that the Cabinet should review the decision by the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El) that, there shouldbe no reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of thenon-sugar aspects of Tate and Lyle&apos;s takeover bid for Manbre andGarton because she was worried that this decision would be seriouslydamaging to Government policy on mergers and would lay theGovernment open to criticism.    The volume of representationsagainst allowing this takeover bid to go ahead without a referencehad been unprecedented.   They came from a very wide range ofcustomers and from the union representatives at all of Manfape andGar ton&apos;s refineries,   A representative of some of the majorconsumers had also made clear that he would not regard voluntaryassurances by Tate and Lyle about their future conduct as being ofany value.   She was particularly concerned about the nature of consultation which had taken place over the two companies&apos; plans for rationalisation of cane sugar refining.    In May El had consideredvarious ways in which rationalisation could be carried out and had  
favoured the course then known as option iv, which was based onthe premise of unified control by Tate and Lyle.    Since then theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had discussed thiscourse with Tate and Lyle, but not with Manbre and Garton norwith the trade unions concerned as El had asked.    She accepted that it would have been difficult to discuss Tate and Lyle&apos;sproposals with the other parties before their takeover bid had beenmade public.   After circulation of the bid, however, Manbre andGarton had put into question the premises on which the considerationof rationalisation proposals had taken place and had claimed matjob losses on the scale envisaged in option iv were not necessary.It would be most damaging for a decision to be reached against a*reference without a full understanding of the facts becauseinadequate consultation had taken place.    She recognised that time was of the essence for decisions on rationalisation and she had therefore established with the Monopolies and Mergers commission that any reference would be completed by Christmas.    Sincerationalisation decisions were not required until March a referencewould cause no delay.    In any case there was no question of a reference covering the cane sugar refining interests of thecompanies.   Reference of the other aspects by holding up the bidwould give time for discussions between the companies aboutunified control of their sugar interests which could go ahead with no delay at all and for fuller consultations with them and the tradeunions.    Jh her view a reference of the non-sugar aspects wasvital since there was disagreement about the unemploymentconsequences of the merger and because the interests affectedhad not been adequately consulted.    The case was reinforced bythe fact that it would cause no delay.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat he did not accept Manbre and Garton&apos;a allegations that they hadnot been properly consulted.    There had been continuous consultationboth at Ministerial and official level.    He also regarded it asinappropriate to put undue weight on the views of particular consumers-there were in fact differing views.    Since the two companies were concerned with different unions the Government would in the endhave to decide.    The crucial issue, however, was that in order toreach the moot satisfactory solution to the inevitable and substantialcontraction of the cane sugar refining industry it was necessary to look at all six refineries together.    This came out clearly from the unsatisfactory proposals which Manbre and Garton had put forward for preserving their own capacity, which would have resulted inredundancies in Greenock and Liverpool and large exchequer costs for the conversion of the Manbre plant at Newton-le-Willows fromcane to beet refining.    It was in recognition of this need forrationalisation to be based on the interests of the industry and thecountry as a whole that all Ministers had agreed mat there should be2
no reference of cane sugar refining.    The only question at issue was whether to make a reference of starch and glucose, but such a reference would bring the proposals for rationalising sugar refiningback to square one.    That was in essence the case against a reference, but the case for reference had in any case been greatlyweakened by the undertakings which Tate and Lyle were preparedto make and which could be quoted in public:-a, to continue production of the full range of productsnow offered by both companies so long as customers wantedthem and to set up an independent committee to vet thecompany&apos;s service to its customers; and b. to keep Manbre and Garton&apos;s starch and glucosebusiness as a separate and self-contained entity for threeyears.The latter undertaking meant that if in the light of experience amonopolies reference were necessary it would be possible forManbre and Garton&apos;s business other than sugar to be separated from the merged company.In discussion it was argued strongly that there was a clear need for substantial reduction in capacity in the cane sugar refining industry.The major issue for the Government was where the reduction inemployment should fall and what replacement jobs could be found.The two companies had discussed the issues for some years but had achieved no result.    If Tate and Lyle secured full control they mightbe able to bring about the solution which would be most satisfactoryfrom the Governments point of view but there was no chance of thiswhile Manbre&apos;s interest remained separate.    Manbre1 a suggestionthat a substantial reduction in manpower could be avoided was quite unrealistic.   All Ministers were agreed on the need forunified control of the sugar refining interests and by deciding againstthe reference in this, the major market, they were taking a judgment on the public interest.    If a reference were made on the separate and subordinate issue of starch and glucose the sugarrationalisation plans would fall.    Moreover if a reference were confined to the non-sugar interests of the companies the commission could not take account of the problems of sugar rationalisation whichwere the main arguments for a merger.On the other hand it was argued that the chances of Tate&apos;s bid beingsuccessful were not high even if there were no reference; it hadbeen accepted so far by only 3j per cent of Manbre and Gartonshareholders.    If the bid failed in the market the Governmenfsrelationships with Manbre and Garton and with their trade unions would have been prejudiced unnecessarily.    If no reference were3
4made this would be the first time that a strong recommendation bythe Director General of Fair Trading in favour of a reference hadbeen rejected.    It could have a damaging effect on futuremonopolies and merger policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the Cabinefs discussion, saidthat it had been previously agreed that there would be advantage inunified control of the cane sugar refining industry and mataccordingly there should be no reference to the Monopolies andMergers Commission of any merger of those interests.    It wasthe clear view of the Cabinet that this major interest should not be prejudiced by reference of the starch and glucose sectors whichwere of lesser significance.    Concern had been expressed aboutthe effect which this decision might have on future merger policyand there would be advantage in reviewing this policy in the lightof accession to the European Economic Community and the greaterdegree of competition to which the national market wasconsequently exposed.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Agreed that no aspect of Tate and Lylesstakeover bid for Manbre and Garton should bereferred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.3,        Invited the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection and Paymaster General toarrange for a review of mergers policy in the lightof British accession to the European economic community and to report to the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy,
t3.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Employment (CP(76) 73) about theappointment of safety representatives by trade unions and the setting up of safety committees in places of employment by employers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that themeasures set out in his paper stemmed from proposals which hadbeen put to him unanimously by the Health and Safety Commission,on which the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Confederation&quot;of British Industry (CBI), as well as the local authorities, were represented.   He was proposing to make Regulations and to approve a Code of Practice whereby each trade union would havea statutory right to appoint a safety representative at every placeof work in which it had members; the functions and rights of safety representatives would be prescribed;  employers would berequired to give those representatives time off with pay to carryout their functions; and the employers would be required, inprescribed circumstances, to establish a safety committee.    Inhis view to fail to implement these proposals would be interpretedby the TUC as a serious matter, casting doubt on the Government&apos;intention to implement the other worker-representative elements in the Employment Protection Act as well as the Health and Safetyat Work Act.    The objections which had been put forward by hiscolleagues were based largely on the cost to the public sector.The estimates by some Departments were in his view veryexaggerated, apparently being based on the appointment of far more safety representatives than could possibly be trained in thetime available.    He reminded the Cabinet that under bis proposalsan employer would be free to agree or disagree the number ofrepresentatives to be appointed, and if the unions&apos; proposals onthis were disagreed they would have to be taken through all stages of the normal negotiating machinery, and ultimately to an IndustrialTribunal, before the matter was settled.    This would undoubtedlykeep within reasonable bounds the number of representativesappointed.    His fear was that if the Government did not act as he proposed, the trade unions would pursue these safety measures byindustrial means, and might well seek far more than thestatutory rights now envisaged.   In his view it should be possiblefor the centoel Government cost to be absorbed in the initial stages; and he thought that  10 million might be allocated to localauthorities in 1977-78 to meet any extra cost.    He did not thinkit was realistic to envisage going back to the Health and SafetyCommission to ask them to revise their proposals; nor did hethink it desirable, given the strong trade union interest, to defera decision - although it would be possible to lay the BAgulattonssoon but with an effective date deferred until, say, 1 April 1977.5SAFETYRepresentatives-*nd committees
In discussion, it was argued that while mere was no disagreementin principle that the Employment Protection Act should be implemented, there were reasons for postponing that implement a-tion.    It was not merely that the potential cost was high, butthat there was a very large range of difference in the estimatesbefore Cabinet of the cost, and It would be wrong to go aheadwhile such uncertainty prevailed on this important aspect.    Forthe Civil Service the cost could be  5 million a year, with afurther  2. 7 million for the Health Service - although higherestimates had been made; and for local authorities the estimateranged from  2. 8 million favoured by the Health and SafetyCommission to  24 million arrived at by the responsibleDepartments and  80 million which had been put forward by thelocal authorities themselves.    The cost in defence establishmentscould be considerable.    With these discrepancies the questionclearly needed further examination.    In addition it would benecessary to ensure that whatever costs were incurred could be either offset or absorbed, since otherwise they would representdemands on an already overstrained contingency reserve.    Inthis connection the difficulty of asking the local authorities, throughthe Consultative Council, to absorb this cost at a time when theywere being urged to eliminate overspending and the GovernmentRate Support Grant for 1976-77 and 1977-78 was being cut back,was obvious.    It had been a repeated theme at the consultative council meetings that the Government simultaneously pressed the local authorities to undertake additional activities and to cuttheir expenditure.    Furthermore, there was little point ia.setting up Safety Committees in public sector establishments suchas schools if - quite apart from the cost of the Committeesthemselves - there were to be no extra money available forcarrying out the recommendations the Committees were likely tomake, which would probably involve building work.   All in all,there was a strong case for considering the matter further, andin particular for re-examining the cost estimates.Against this, it was argued that the higher estimates of cost were clearly based on an unrealistic assessment of what would happen inpractice.    In schools, where the safety risks were relatively small, the estimates might really only be the notional cost of thetime a teacher was absent from his class on safety work - althoughthe unions could be expected to use this as an argument in favourof more teachers.    What mattered, however, was the attitude ofthe TUC, who placed great store by the implementation of theEmployment Protection Act.    They wanted allocation ofresponsibility to the trade unions, this being the key to industrial democracy.    Much of the opposition to the present proposals was really only obstruction.    Whatever the true burden Of costs,they would only work up slowly.   It was notable that the energyindustries Md already said that the proposals would involve themin no extra costs.6
7THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that anumber of members of Cabinet felt that the estimates of costneeded further examination in view of the wide disparity of thefigures before Cabinet, and took the view that in any case before any action could be taken serious consultation with the localauthorities on both the cost and the way in which it should be financed was necessary.    On the other hand, Cabinet recognisedthat there were strong and serious trade union pressures forthe implementation of proposals along the lines put forward bythe Secretary of State for Employment.    One possible way of proceeding might be to provide for the implementation of theRegulations at different timeB in different sectors.    The matter was one which required further thought, and in view of the urgentbusiness still to be considered that morning, the best coursewould be for the Cabinet to adjourn its consideration for thetime being and to resume discussion at the next meeting.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.
4.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that in considering the eeamentsstrike, which had been announced the previous day, the Governmentshould avoid dramatising the situation.    The experience of 1966gave no warrant for the adoption of doomsday attitudes.    the seamen had a case in logic, though not necessarily in equity, fortheir arguments, and it would be important to avoid casting them aseither wreckers or villains.    There could be no victors in this sort of strike.    If the seamen won, the consequences for pay policy generally could be serious; while if the seamen lost the country wouldhave lost too from the effect of the strike.    He had it in mind that,if the current efforts of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) were unsuccessful, he might appeal to the Executive Council of theNational Union of Seamen (McManus) on these lines and seek to get themto reverse their vote in favour of a strike.    He had also reachedthe view that if the strike seemed inevitable he should cancel hisprojected visit to Canada.    The Contingencies Unit at official levelhad that morning considered the possible effects of the strike.Some two-thirds of the United Kingdom18 overseas trade was carried in foreign ships, which meant that the effects of a strike would be greatly reduced unless foreign crews or dockworkers took sympatheticaction.    In general the domestic economy would not be significantlyaffected adversely for 2-3 weeks; and stocks of major foodstuffssuch as grain and wheat were sufficient for 3-4 weeks.    No difficulty was expected in relation to coal, electricity and gas, but the oil industry would feel some effects after 2-3 weeks.   Some difficulties might arise regionally - eg in the case of the Scottish Isles in relationto fresh milk.    In 1966 a growing problem was caused by congestion in the ports as ships arrived home and were laid up, and this was something the Department of the Environment would watch and provide reports on.    Port Emergency Committees would be set up,but the present view was that it would be premature to consider takingemergency powers which would involve recalling Parliament.   he observed mat Mr Len Murray of tide TTJC had indicated that it wouldbe helpful if the Government would make it clear that they stoodfirmly by the pay policy; and this he was prepared to do, although he would need to avoid making the mistake of the last ConservativePrime Minister and getting himself completely boxed in.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the NUSsaw their 1975 wages settlement, which preceded the introduction of pay policy, ea historic, since it changed the basis upon which seamenwere paid.   A Board of Arbitration had given a decision wherebyfrom 2 July 1975 the seamen were based upon a 40 hour, 5 day week,with improvements in their basic pay and in their efficiency pay, aswell as in their arrangements for overtime payment.   All the improvements were staged.    The aim had been to put the seamen ina position comparable with other leading Merchant Navies.   As aresult, the seamen had had an immediate increase in 1975 of  6. 55 aweek, with increases of from 25p to 92p a week in efficiency pay,
followed by a later increase of  8.55 a week plus 5Qp to  1.50 aweek in efficiency pay.    From Z July 1976 they bad receivedimproved overtime payment.    Under the transitional provisions for the second round of incomes policy, any further improvementcould only be paid on the anniversary of the date of the higheststaged payment, which meant the seamen could have nothing until january 1977 when they would be entitled to an increase within thelimits of stage 2.    The McManus had tried to argue that the arbitration award should be treated as if it had not been staged, but this hadbeen rejected by the Government, the TUC Economic Committeeand the TUC General Council.    The vote in the Executive Councilin favour of a ballot had been 10-7 with one absentee; while at theprevious day&apos;s meeting the vote in favour of an all-out strike hadbeen 9-5, four members being absent.    Those members of theExecutive who opposed the strike had been in favour of an overtimeban in United Kingdom ports, but no resolution to this effect had beenput to the Executive.    Mr Murray had the previous evening seen theGeneral Secretary of the McManus and made it clear that there was nochange in the view taken by the TUC General Council, and the TUCEconomic Committee hoped to see the McManus Executive Council later in the day.    In his view the Government should make no move until it was quite clear that the TUC had failed to move the McManus.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, while he fullyagreed that the impact of the strike on the economy must not be exaggerated, the financial effect was undoubtedly severe.    Sterlinghad been edgy during August, but there had been no significant fallin foreign government holdings of sterling since June (after largewithdrawals in the second quarter of the year).    Nevertheless,the cost of fighting off odd bouts of selling had meant that$1,100 million of the $5, 300 million standby facility had been spent.The prospect of the result of the seamenfs ballot had led to pressure on sterling in the previous two days; and that morning the result ofthe decision to strike had led to heavy selling so that the rate had fallen between 3 and 4 cents before recovering slightly.   As a result the Discount Houses1 minimum lending rate would increase thefollowing day, and this would add to the difficulty of handling theGovernments internal deficit, since it would be more difficult to sellGovernment debt.    In addition there was the major problem of financing the external deficit, on which he would put proposals to cabinet in due course.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that if the TUC failed to persuade the McManus to change their line, he should himself see the McManus Executive with aview to persuading them to reverse their decision before the strikebegan.    For the time boing there was no need to consider therecall of Parliament or the taking of emergency powers.    He would keep in touch with a small group of colleagues over the weekend as necessary.

*his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO      4 i1*1CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 9 September 1976 at 11.00 am^ORElGN THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had^AlRs discussed Southern Africa with the American Secretary of State,Dr Kissinger, at the end of the previous week and that Dr Kissinger^tkern Africa      had visited London again for talks with the Prime Minister after hismeeting in Zurich at the weekend with the South African PrimeMinister, Mr Vorster.    In both Namibia and RhodesiaDr Kissinger^ objective was to achieve a peaceful transition tomajority rule.   For Namibia the prospect was now quite promising.Mr Vorster had agreed to participation by (fie South West AfricanPeoole*s Organisation (SWAPO) in the Windhoek Conference and tothe move of the Conference from Windhoek to Geneva; and therepreeentativep of SWApO were reported to have struck a sensibleattitude at the recent meeting at Dar-es-Salaam between the AfricanPresidents and the liberation movements,    hi Rhodesia Dr Kissinger&apos;saim was to obtain agreement to the formation of an interim governmentin which Africans would have a majority and whose task would be tonegotiate a constitution for an independent Rhodesia.   The successof his venture would turn on Mr Vorster&apos;s ability to exert pressure on the present regime in Rhodesia and on the support of the presidents of the neighbouring African States,   A vital element inhis plan was provision for financial inducements for white Rhodesiansto remain in the country for at least a period after independence.For our part we wished Dr Kissingers initiative well and had helpedin working out some of his proposals.   But we were not committed to anything in the plan at this stage and had also made clear ourinsistence on four points.   These were that Dr Kissingers proposals must be endorsed by the African Presidents; that the United kingdom could have no responsibility for an interim administration in rhodesia; that the bulk of finance for a scheme of inducements for white Rhode russians must be found by the United States; and that wecould not contemplate negotiations with Mr Smith, whose earlydeparture from the Rhodesian Government would be essential to thesuccess of the initiative.   Dr Kissinger planned to visit Africa during
the following week and thens depending on the reactions of the african presidents, to have further discussions with Mr Vorsterin South Africa.   Dr Kissinger&apos;s negotiations were at a delicatestage and it was essential that the information which had been givento the Cabinet should be treated in the strictest confidence,hi the course of a brief discussion it was noted that prospectswere much more encouraging in Namibia than in Rhodesia,    In viewof our important economic interests in Namibia it might be asensible precaution for us to make further contacts with the movements which might take part in government after independence.Further consideration should be given to this at the appropriatestage6    But the Prime Minister, when Foreign and commonwealth secretary, had already had many contacts with SWAFO and hadencouraged their representatives to hold a series of discussions with the Chairman of Rio Tinto Zinc Ltd.    The London representativeof SWAFO was not a moderate but the representatives of theorganisation in Lusaka had in private shown a full understanding ofour position.   As regards Rhodesia we should not discourageDr Kissinger so long as his initiative remained consistent with theprinciples set out in the statement made by the Prime Minister as foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in Parliament on 22 March 1976,If Dr Kissinger did not succeed, we could expect nothing but an intensification of the guerilla struggle, supported by the AfricanPresidents; and pressures on us would mount as more whiteRhodesians were killed, many of whom would have relatives living in this country.The Cabinet -Toak note.Cabinet Office9 September 19762
