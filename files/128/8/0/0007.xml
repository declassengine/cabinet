(46)  104TH CONCLUSIONS . jfinu teJSConfidential Annex(10th December,   1946 - 11. 0 a.m. )INDIA In the course of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the results of the recent visit of Indian leaders to this country,  THE PRIME MINISTER said that itConstitutional       was impossible to be confident that the mainPosition political Parties in India had any real will to-   reach agreement between themselves.      Pandit Nehru&apos;present policy seemed to be to secure completedomination by Congress throughout the governmentof India.      If a constitution was framed which had this effect,  there would certainly be strongreactions from the Muslims.      Provinces with aMuslim majority might refuse to join a centralGovernment on such terms at all;,   and the ultimateresult of Congress policy might be the establishmentof that Pakistan which they so much disliked.The Prime Minister warned the Cabinet that thesituation might so develop as to result in civil war in&apos; India, with all the bloodshed which thatwould entail.      There seemed to be littlerealisation among Indian leaders of the risk that ordered government might collapse.The Cabinet felt  that,  however much theIndian politicians might abuse the British Raj,there was always at the back of their minds the sense that the Army was there and would be ableto deal with civil disorder.      This dulled theirsense of responsibility for the consequences oftheir political policies.      Apart from this,however,  such confidence in the authority of theArmy was no longer fully justified.        The strengthof the British Forces in India was not great.And the Indian Army,  though the Commander-in-Chiefhad great personal influence with it, could notfairly be expected to prove a reliable instrument for maintaining public order in conditionstantamount to civil war.      One thing was quite certain viz.,  that we could not put back the clockand introduce a period of firm British rule.Neither the military nor the administrative machinein India was any longer capable of this.Some Ministers felt that in the eventour only course might prove to be to evacuateIndia and to leave the Indians to find,  after aperiod no doubt of chaos,  their own solution totheir own problems.      The Cabinet were assured that plans&quot;were being made for evacuating,   in an extreme emergency, both British troops and civiliansfrom India.      Other Ministers felt, however,  that even if such evacuation were practicable as amilitary operation - and it would not he an easy
operation to carry out - it was not, politically,realistic to suppose that we should, he able toadopt that course.      would it he acceptable toParliament and to public opinion that we should leave India in chaos,  having ohtained no guarantee of fair treatment for the Muslims or for the otherminorities?     That would indeed be an inglorious end to our long association with India.      World opinion would regard it as a policy of scuttle unworthyof a great Power.There was general agreement that so gravea decision could not be taken, without the most anxious thought.      The decision need not beprejudged at this stage.      Matters might not reachso serious a pass.      It was certainly the wish ofthe great masses of the Indian people that thereshould continue to be ordered government throughout India and the leaders of the political Parties inIndia might well be forced to take account of this.For the moment, the important thing wasto secure that these leaders faced the difficultieswhich inevitably accompanied major constitutional changes in India.      We should do anything that wecould to bring home to them the heavy weight ofresponsibility which rested on them.Cabinet Office,  S.W.1.11th December,   1946.
