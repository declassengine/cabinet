(46)  108TH conclusions confidential Annex(31st December,  1946 - 11 a.m. )INDIA The Cabinet considered memoranda bythe Prime Minister (CP. (46) 456) and the Ministerof Defence (CP. (46) 468) on the constitutionalConstitutional   position in India.Pos itionTHE PRIME MINISTER,  in amplification(Previous of his memorandum, informed the Cabinet of the reference;&apos;        discussions which the India and Burma Committee had. (46) 106th had with the Viceroy since the departure of theConclusions,      Indian representatives.      The Viceroy had urged that,Minute 4) if it became clear that the Muslim League would not co-operate in the work of the Constituent assembly and that the plan of the Cabinet Mission could notbe carried through, we should have in readiness adefinite   policy which would then be announced.In the Viceroy&apos;s opinion we should not be able toenforce British rule in India beyond 31st March,  1948.The Committee had considered that an announcement ofour intention to leave India by a specific date mighthave the effect of bringing the two communitiestogether.      It would also have the advantage that itwould make it possible for us to take the first steps&apos;towards our departure.      They therefore proposedthat a statement should he made on the lines of thedraft annexed to CP. (46) 456.      Legislation must hedeferred until the final stage of our departure.It was therefore proposed that Parliament should beinvited to pass a resolution endorsing the statementof   policy, so as to provide some parliamentary sanction enabling the Government to proceed withthe gradual devolution of their authority in India.The Prime Minister explained that theViceroy had at first suggested that the initial steps towards our departure should take the form of complete withdrawal from the four Southern Provinces.After discussion,  however,  it had been agreed that,while British troops might be withdrawn from those areas and British officials serving there posted toother parts of the country,  it would be necessary,in the initial stages,  to maintain the present constitutional forms.
Discussion turned first on the question       9.whether it would &quot;be wise to announce in the near **-future a precise date for our withdrawal from India.Was it wise to commit ourselves to a precise date when we had no assurance that  there would by then hea representative authority to whom we could handover power?     It might be that if we left India atthat date we should leave only chaos and the prospectof civil war behind us.      It was also necessary toconsider the effect of such an announcement on other parts of the Empire and on world opinion ingeneral.      Some Ministers felt that an announcement in the terms of the draft attached to C. p. (46) 456might be regarded as the beginning of the liquidation of the British Empire:    and it would be bound to have serious repercussions in Burma, malaya and elsewhere.      Nor must we forget that a breakdown of ordered central Government in India would provideopportunities to her neighbours, which they would notbe slow to take,  to interest themselves in Indianaffairs.      We might well find that in this area laythe seeds of a future world conflict.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that theannouncement proposed would have serious repercussions in the Middle East. He recalled that in thenegotiations with Egypt we had claimed that it wouldnot be practicable for us to withdraw our troops fromthat country before 1949.      How should we reconcilethis claim with a statement that we were prepared to evacuate the whole of India by the spring of 1948?The general feeling of the Cabinet Wasthat withdrawal from India need not appear to be forced upon us by our weakness nor to be the first step in the dissolution of the Empire.      On thecontrary this action must be shown to be the logicalconclusion, which we welcomed, of a policy followedby successive Governments for many years.      It was too late to reverse the whole direction of our Indianpolicy,  even if we had had any desire to do so, andthere was no reason to fear special repercussions fromthe completion of that policy.      Our main objectivenow was  to bring the principal communities in Indiato co-operate, so that there should be a properlyrepresentative authority to whom we could hand overpower.      If the Viceroy was correct in his estimate that we should in any case be unable to continueeffectively to rule India beyond the early part of1948,  and if the announcement of our intention to leaveIndia b&quot;y a specified date might have the effect of bringing- the communities together,  then it would bewell to derive whatever advantage we could-from theearly announcement of action which would,  in fact,be inevitable.The Cabinet then considered what would bethe best method of securing Parliamentary approval for  the gradual devolution of authority in India.THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE explained that hisobject,  in putting forward the draft resolutionannexed to CP. (46) 468, was to secure for HisMajesty&apos;s Government a greater latitude in handling
a fluid situation which might well produce      - Odevelopments which could not he foreseen.      For      . &quot;this reason he would wish to avoid making a detailedpublic statement on all the specific points covered in the draft annexed to CP. (46) 406,  and would prefer to ask Parliament to adopt a resolution onbroader lines which would authorise His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to take such steps as might be requiredto ensure the orderly transfer of power to theappropriate authority or authorities  in India.On the other side it was argued that parliament would be reluctant to give the government so wide a discretion as was pre-supposed by the draft resolution annexed to CP. (46) 468-    that theGovernment spokesmen in the debate on such aresolution would in any event be obliged to give information on most of the specific points covered in the draft statement of policy annexed toC.P.(46) 456*    and that the more detailed statement was likely to produce a greater impact on publicopinion in India.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion on this point was that the preferable course would   be to make astatement of policy,  as    proposed by the PrimeMinister in CP. (46) 456,   and to invite Parliamentto approve that statement.      It would,  however, be advantageous if the resolution approving thestatement could be drawn in such terms as to affordsome sanction for departing;,  during the transition period,  from strict compliance with all theobligations resting on His Majesty&apos;s government under the Government of India Act.Discussion then turned on the form ofthe draft statement annexed to CP. (46) 456.      Theview was expressed that a statement in these terms would give the impression that we were being forcedout of India because we were unable to maintain ourposition there.      In fact,  our withdrawal would bethe final stage in a deliberate policy of encouragingIndia&apos;s development towards self-government,  towhich successive Governments in this country hadsubscribed for the last thirty years.      It was certainly the desire of the present Government thatthe Indian people should assume full responsibilityof self-government.      There was,  therefore,  no occasion to excuse our withdrawal:      we shouldrather claim credit for taking this initiative interminating British rule in India and transferringour responsibilities to the representatives of theIndian people.      For these reasons it would be preferable that the detailed proposals set out inthe draft annexed to C.P.(46)1 45:6 should be set ina wider framework.      The statement should recall themain stages in India&apos;s evolution towards self-government,  as a process to which successive governments in this country had been committed ever since the end of the last war,  and should present thetransfer of control to an Indian Government orGovernments as the final phase in this process ofevolution.      The specific proposals for the withdrawal1-3-
The Cabinet next considered the timing of such a statement.      The India and Burma Committeehad contemplated that the statement should not he made until it was known,  towards the end of January,whether the Muslim League were    unwilling to collaborate in the work of the Constituent Assembly.In support of this proposal for deferring thestatement until then,  it was pointed out that some members of the Muslim League were dissatisfied withMr.  Jinnah&apos;s present attitude and there was somepossibility that the League might be brought toagree to participate in the work of the ConstituentAssembly.      Other developments might occur in india during the next few weeks which might affect theposition.      Further,  there were strong arguments against making such a declaration of policy at atime when Parliament was in recess.On the other side,  it was argued that,as  the primary object of the declaration was to force the two Parties in India to face the realities of the situation and find means of collaborating with one another,,  there was much to be said againstpostponing it until after the Muslim League had taken a definite decision against collaboration.      It wasalso argued that it was not constitutionallynecessary that such a declaration should first bemade in Parliament-    and that,  even if it were thought expedient that this should be done,  it wouldhe possible to convene Parliament for this purposebefore the date on which it was now due to re-assemble,      This would have the further advantage that Parliamentary time for debating the declaration would not have to be found at the expense of other government business.The Cabinet decided to defer for thepresent their final decision about the timing ofthe proposed declaration.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINIONAFFAIRS said that it was most important that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take Dominion Governmentsinto their confidence in this matter at the earliestpossible stage.      He hoped that, as soon as theform of the proposed declaration had been settled.of British troops and officials should he presented as incidents in that transfer of authority.      Ifthe statement were re-cast on these lines, it shouldhe possible to include passages calling upon theIndian people to demonstrate their capacity for self-government and to make adequate provision for safe-guarding the rights of minorities.The Cabinet agreed that the draft statement annexed to CP. (46) 456 should be re-cast on thelines&apos; indicated above.
Cabinet Office,  S.W.   1.E ALP-he might be authorised to communicate it to dominion Governments,  so that they might havean opportunity for comment before the declaration was made.      This was agreed to.The Cabinet -(l)    Invited the India and Burma Committeeto revise, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, the draft statement annexed to C.P.(46) 456.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion ofthis matter when a revised draft ofthe statement .was available.
