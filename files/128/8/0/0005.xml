Cabinet Office, S.W.1.Cefie* Vo :      frt^vxt WtriSaVev ,   Home. SecvtVavVj FV^isVcr  of HeoAt-V,CM. (46) 95TH CONCLUSIONS7th November,  19h7      -     11 a.m.THE MINISTER OP HEATJlH said -chat he had recentlybeen asked whether any financial assistance could begiven to those who had suffered loss through the heavyflooding which had occurred in Salford in September.There could be no question of affording any relief from public funds;    and, from enquiries which he had made,he doubted whether the applicants would qualify forassistance from any of the main charitable funds,such as the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund.These enquiries had, however, led him to considerwhether  the Government should not institute some specialinvestigation into the constitution and administration ofthese charitable funds.      They held substantial sums ofmoney,  and he was not satisfied that these were being employed to the best advantage.It was the view of the Cabinet that this wouldnot be an opportune time for the Government to take theinitiative in proposing such an investigation.      If ademand for such an investigation were made by private members and appeared to command a substantial measure of support in the House of Commons, the Government might then take the matter up.      But it would be inexpedient for ministers to take any initiative at the present time, even to the extent of encouraging private Members to raisethe matter in the House of Commons.
x   This suggestion was in any event misconceived.     TheAct of 191+3 merely enabled the heir apparent orpresumptive to act as a Counsellor of State fromage eighteen.      It did not alter the fact that theheir to the Throne,  like any other subject, doesnot become of full age until 21.CM. (US)  95th CONCLUSIONS7th November, 1946        ___11 a.m.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Cabinet that.R.H. Princess Elizabeth would become 21 years of ageon 21st April, 191+7*     A private individual had made thesuggestion that subscriptions should be invited towards anational present to the Princess.     The Prime ministers aid that this suggestion did not seem to him to be ahappy one and he felt sure that it should not be given any official   encouragement.      He had, however, been considering whether the Cabinet should themselves make some presentation to the Princess or take some other actionin recognition of her 21st birthday;    and he would be glad to have his colleagues&apos; views on this point.      He had ascertained that the precedents did not call for any resolution or action by Parliament in recognition ofthe corning-of-age of the heir to the Throne.In discussion,  it was 56 suggested that by virtueof the Regency Act, 191+3* Princess Elizabeth could beregarded as having come of age on her eighteenth birthdayand that it would therefore be inappropriate   to take formalcognisance of her 21st birthday.      It was,  however, thegeneral view of the Cabinet that, if the Royal Familyproposed to celebrate the Princess&apos; 21st birthday, itwould be fitting for His Majesty&apos;s Ministers to take some
appropriate means of recognising it.     Discussionshowed that the Cabinet&apos;s preference would havebeen for entertaining the Princess at a dinner at10, Downing Street rather than giving her a present.It was, however, pointed out that under present arrangements Her Royal Highness would be inSouth Africa on the actual date of her birthday.THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s discussion he wouldmake further enquiries about thearrangements contemplated by theRoyal Family for celebrating the21st birthday of Princess Elizabeth.Cabinet Office, S.W.1
