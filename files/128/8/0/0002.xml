(46) 80th Conclusions, Minute confidential Annex(9th September,  1946 - 3 p.m.)JATIONING[previousleference:;,M. (46) 70thJonclus ions)The Cabinet had before them a Note bythe Secretary (CP. (46) 336) covering a minutesubmitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministerof Food regarding the continuance of bread rationingin the United Kingdom.THE MINISTER OF FOOD said that the stocksof wheat in the United Kingdom were now much larger than had at one time been expected.      At the endof September he expected to have in stock 669,000tons of wheat and 31.4,000 tons of flour.      Theearly harvest in Canada had added about 100,000tons to our stocks,-    and despite the very adverse weather it seemed that the yield from the UnitedKingdom harvest would not be far below the figureon which his estimate of stocks had been based.Administratively the rationing scheme was not wholly satisfactoryj    it   would be difficult toenforce the collection of bread units on thebakers and,  if bread were widely ohtained withoutsurrender of bread units, the points scheme forother foods could be undermined.      He appreciated that the shortage of cereals in some other countries was still serious, but in all the circumstances he took the view that the balance of advantage lay onthe side of discontinuing bread rationing in theUnited Kingdom at the end of the current rationingperiod on 14th September.     Rationing could bereimposed if the situation next spring or summerwarranted such a course.In discussion Ministers were reminded that the two factors which had mainly influenced themin their decision to introduce bread rationing hadbeen the uncertainty of the harvest weather in the JUnited Kingdom and the possibility of strikes in theNorth American seaports.      On both these counts  therewas still great uncertainty.As regards the United Kingdom harvest,THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE said that, while theestimated weight of the crop of wheat, barley and-oats was slightly in excess of the average for thelast ten years,  it was impossible to say what proportion of this crop would be harvested in&apos; millablecondition.      Nor was it possible to say how soon themillable grain harvested would reach the mills.      Some60,000 tons had. been delivered during August and,given good weather,  a further 200,000 tons might be delivered by the end of September.As regards the strikes in North America,if these were confined to the United States the direct effect on United Kingdom supplies might be small as we were only counting on receiving a further80,000 tons from the United States;    but there was the- . -
risk that the strikes might spread, to Canada andaccount must also be taken of their effect en the othercountries which were relying on supplies from theUnited States.For both these reasons,,  therefore.Ministers felt that it would be preferable to  retainbread rationing in this country until the outlook was more certain.The political arguments were also infavour of its retention.      It was by now fairly wellaccepted by the public;    and there was grave politicalrisk in abolishing it at a moment when the UnitedKingdom harvest was so obviously precarious.      Moreover,account must be taken of the food situation in otherparts of the world for which we had a responsibility.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA emphasised the serious situation which was likely to arise in India during thenext few months and the LORD PRIVY SEAL spoke of the paramount importance of maintaining a ration level ofat least 1,550 calories in the British and AmericanZones In Germany throughout the next year,  if therewas to be any economic rehabilitation there.     Finally,Ministers also felt that, once bread rationing had been removed in this country,  it would be very difficultto reimpose it,For all these reasons the Cabinet favoured the continuance of bread rationing at least for one further rationing period.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE urged that,if any relaxation of restrictions were possible, thefirst step should be to reduce the extraction rate of flour so as to make a larger quantity of feeding-stuffsavailable for animals.      While the abolition of bread rationing -would increase consumption by some 2+0,000 tonsa month, a 5 per cent,  reduction of the extraction rate would involve an increased consumption of only25,000 tons.      As at present arranged,  the major cut in -feeding-stuffs rations would begin early in October.This would inevitably lead to t. large reduction in thenumbers of pigs and poultry kept and in the yield of milk.      It would not be possible to make good forthese losses for a long time,      It was important,therefore,  if any alleviation were possible,  that  itshould be announced at once so that farmers should know that the full October cut would not be Imposed.In further discussion,  attention was alsocalled to the substantial reduction in consumptionwhich bread rationing had in fact achieved.    Consumptionhad fallen from 10h,000 tons of flour a week tofigures between 63,000 tons and 82,000 tons.      Therewas general support for the suggestion, made by theMinister of Food in his minute to the prime Minister,that a scheme might be worked out under which, byrestriction of deliveries by the millers, consumption would be kept more or less voluntarily at a level of90,000 tons a week.
The Cabinet -(l)    Agreed that bread rationing should becontinued for at least one furtherrationing period;    and that if beforethe end of that period the Minister ofFood considered that it could then be abolished,  he should submit the matter to the Cabinet again.(2)   Agreed that the extraction rate shouldbe reduced from 90 per cent to 85 percent and that an announcement to this effect should be made as soon aspracticable.(3)    Invited the Minister of Food to considerwhether an approach could usefully bemade,  in confidence, to the millerswith the object of securing that thetermination of bread rationing did not result in an immediate return to formerlevels of consumption of flour.      Inmaking any such approach it would be important not to imply that the Governmentwere intending to abolish bread rationingon any particular date.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.10th September,  1946.
