(46)  70TH conclusions confidential Annex(21st July, 1946 - 9.30 a.m.)The Cabinet had before them;-(i) a memorandum by the Minister of Food(CP. (46)  286) covering copies of minutes addressed &quot;by the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Minister of Poodto the Prime Minister suggesting that,in view of the information contained in telegram AMAZE 7488 from the BritishFood Mission in Washington, the intro-duction of &quot;bread rationing should be suspended;    and(ii) a note &quot;by the Additional Secretary to theCabinet (CP. (46)  289) circulating adraft of a public statement which theMinister of Food proposed to make if itwere decided to suspend the introductionof bread rationing.THE MINISTER OF FOOD said that it wouldprobably be convenient if he dealt with the points raised at the preliminary discussion of his proposala meeting of Ministers on the previous day.atIt had been suggested that,  as an alternative to the suspension of rationing, the flour extraction rate should be reduced.     A reduction from 90 per cent to 85 per cent would call for an additional 25,000 tonsof wheat a month and for technical reasons there couldbe no question of lowering the rate until September.Thus, whatever decision was reached about the introduc-tion of rationing, the date on which the extraction ratecould be lowered would not be affected.      He was,  how-rate down to 85 per centno reason why it shouldever, most anxious to bring&quot;theas soon as possible,  and he sawnot be possible to do thisintroduction of rationingi in September, even though thewere to be suspended.It had been urged that,  since the figures given in AMAZE 7488 were no more than a tentative guess,the Cabinet would not be justified in altering their decision.      It was true that the Canadian Wheat Board&apos;estimate of probable shipments was   given with certainreservations, but the fact that he now had even a tentative programme of shipments gave him a very muchfirmer basis on which to work than he had ever had before.      The British Food Mission in Washington were satisfied that the shipment of the 1^6,000 tons of wheat which the United States Government had undertaken to send to the United Kingdom was well up to schedule and thatthere was no need whatever to ask for any furtherguarantee of delivery. They had also assured him that the United States Administration saw no reason to
v suppose that there would he any hold up of shipmentsowing to strikes during the next few weeks.     While,therefore,  there could he no ah solute certainty thatstrikes would not take place or that some catastrophicchange in the weather would not ruin the North Americanharvest, he felt that the risk was not such as to justifythe immediate introduction of rationing in face of the newpromise of additional Canadian supplies during the criticalmonths of August and September.     He had verified that these supplies would still leave United Kingdom imports below thefigure fixed Toy the International Emergency Pood Council,so that there could he no question of our having to obtainthe consent of the Council before we could secure them.He- did not believe that the suspension of the introductionof rationing would embarrass the United States Administra-tion.      Indeed, when he had been in Washington Mr. ClintonAnderson had on two occasions expressed the hope thatbread rationing would not be introduced in the UnitedKingdom.     With regard to Germany,  the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster had stated at the meeting of the world food Supplies Committee on 12th July (W. F. S . (L6) 1kthMeeting, Minute 1) that at 18th August there would be a deficit of 56,000 tons of wheat in the British zone.The Control Commission had, however,   estimated that by30th August I6h,000 tons of wheat would be available fromthe harvest in the British zone, and it should surely be possible to cover the estimated deficit at 18th August by making strenuous efforts to secure early deliveries from german farms.      The Chancellor of the Duchy had also statedthat only 7^,000 tons of wheat were in sight from theUnited States.      But    in fact the United States government intended to send 80,000 tons in July and a further 80,000tons in August and these quantities might he raised to120,000 tons each month.      He could not,  therefore, believethat there was a real danger of breakdown in the british zone in August and it seemed clear that thereafter thewhole position would be altered owing to the good Europeanharvest and the establishment of economic co-operation betweenthe British and American zones.      In the last three daysan offer of 80,000 tons of wheat from Turkey had beenreceived and there had been indications that Roumania andeven Russia might have wheat for export.      This did not affect the immediate position, but it was significant ofthe hopeful prospects for the European harvest.     Hebegged the Cabinet not to underrate the inconvenience anddislocation which would arise&apos; if rationing were introduced.It was true that the organised opposition of the bakershad collapsed, but their preparations for operating thescheme had been inadequate and until their shops hadmastered, the coupon system there would inevitably be longqueues of customers waiting to be served.      He had con-sidered the possibility of advising bakers to givecustomers bread even though they were unable to producecoupons, but he was convinced that any relaxation of thiskind would rapidly make the scheme unworkable.      It wouldbe frivolous to introduce bread rationing unless therewere convincing reasons for doing so and he was now satis-fieds  on the hew facts before him,  that bread rationingcould not be regarded as necessary for the purpose of safe-guarding our supplies.      He was likely to be able to announce  the signature of the Canadian wheat contract onMonday or Tuesday and,  although this affected only thelong term position, it would obviously be regarded asmaking the United Kingdom supply position more secure.He did not believe that there was any collusion between mr. Gardiner and the Opposition, but it was clear that the
C Opposition already had an - inkling of the fresh facts givenin AMAZE 7488 and it would &quot;be disastrous to atterapt to withhold this information from then.      Once the newfigures had been disclosed he did not see how he coulddefend the introduction of rationing.      It would naturally be extremely embarrassing for him to have to announce the suspension of the rationing scheme, but it would beinfinitely better to face this immediate difficulty than to persist in introducing the scheme and be subsequentlycompelled to admit that its introduction had not been necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the cabinet had considered the matter on 18th July it had been agreedthat the deciding factor was not what would be available from Canada after September but what was likely to be theUnited Kingdom stock position at the critical period atthe end of August.      It had boon felt that it would be prudent to introduce bread rationing because the UnitedStates Government might fail to deliver the supplies whichthey had promised or might be prevented from doing sobecause of railway or maritime strikes.      The Cabinet had also had in mind that we could not be absolutely sure that the United Kingdom crop would not suffer through bad weather.      These uncertainties still remained,  and theonly new factor was the probability that some additionalCanadian wheat would be delivered to the United kingdom in August and September.      Looking to the fact that during august and September we should be working on a muchnarrower margin than ever before,  he felt that the situa-tion had not changed sufficiently to justify suspending the scheme.      The decision to impose bread rationing had made a very great impression in the United States and he felt sure that the suspension of the scheme would alienateAmerican opinion.     As to Germany,  it was admitted thatthe ration level in the British zone was pitifully low and,  despite what the Minister of Pood had said,  theCabinet could not exclude the possibility of a &quot;breakdown,which might well lead the United States Government to divert to Germany wheat destined for the United Kingdom.Nor could the position of India and other British terri-tories in the Par East be ignored.      If the Minister ofFood found it possible to bring the rationing scheme to anend after, say,  si:-: weeks or two months,  this would be all to the good; but to suspend the introduction of the scheme at  the present stage would convict the Government ofvacillation and would make it difficult,  if not impossible...to introduce it at a later date, should the situationchange for the worse.      lie saw no reason why the Ministerof Pood should not reveal the new figures and take theline that, while they were encouraging;  the position was still sufficiently uncertain to justify the Government inadhering to their decision,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that itshould be recognised that the Cabinet had never been ableto take decisions with regard to food supplies on a basisof absolute certainty.      it was therefore no answer to theMinister of Pood to say that the figures given in AMAZE7/488 were not absolutely firm.      The real test was whether,if those figures had been available at the time,  theCabinet would have decided in favour of bread rationingon 27th June or would have confirmed their decision on18th July.      In his view the original decision would havebeen against rationing and he doubted - whether even on18th July they would have confirmed the decision,   though
the Parliamentary situation then would have made it veryawkward to go hack on it.      It was undeniable that thescheme would impose very great inconvenience, and evenhardship,  on the long-suffering housewife;    and whenthe full facts came out - and it would be impossible to conceal them - the Government would be in much more serious trouble than if they suspended the scheme now.He accordingly felt that the Cabinet ought to accept theadvice of the Minister of Pood and Ms officials andsuspend the scheme,  even though this might expose themto the accusation of inconsistency;      He was not afraid of such criticism,  since he believed that in a matter ofthis kind the public expected the Government to change their policy to fit changing conditions.      So far as theUnited States was concerned, he did not believe that theefforts which they were making to raise their wheatexports had been entirely prompted by the British decisionto ration bread,  and,  indeed,  when he had been in washington both Mr. Clayton and Mr. Clinton Anderson had made it clear to him that they did not wish to see bread rationing introduced in the United Kingdom.      As for germany, it had been definitely agreed at the meeting ofthe World Pood Supplies Committee on 12th July that no more United Kingdom supplies should be sent to Germanyand he remained convinced that the right course was to face the United States with the consequences of a break-down in the British zone in Germany.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thenew information given in AMAZE 7U&apos;38 did not seem to him togive the Cabinet a sufficiently secure basis on which tochance the decision which they had already reached.      Hewas confirmed in this view by an interview given to the&quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; by Mr. Mclvor,  the Chairman of theCanadian Wheat Board, which made it clear that theCanadian crop prospects wore still uncertain.      He agreedthat there should he no question of diverting UnitedKingdom supplies to Germany, but he feared that if the rationing scheme were suspended the pressure to do so would be irresistible.      So far as concerned the politicalaspect,  it seemed to him that to suspend the scheme atthis stage would spread dismay among government supporters in Parliament.     He agreed that the figures in AMAZE 7k     should be disclosed, but he saw no reason why the Minister of Pood in giving them should not makeit clear that, while they made the outlook more hopeful,they did not provide a sure enough &quot;basis on which to suspend the operation of the scheme.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that he feared that if the scheme were  suspended the United states would relax their efforts to supply us.      We could not now rely on United States supplies with the sameassurance as during the war, when the United Kingdom wasa base for military operations.      Moreover,  to withdraw the scheme at this stage would greatly discourageGovernment supporters in the constituencies who hadbeen making loyal efforts to defend it.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES askedfor an assurance; regarding the supplies to Britishdependencies in Asia,   such as Ceylon, Malaya and HongKong.      Most of the inhabitants of these countries wereleading a hand to mouth existence on a very small ration of cereals,  and he suggested that they should be amongthe first to benefit by an improvement in available supplies.
THE MINISTER OF FOOD said that the saving whichwould he effected hy &quot;bread rationing in the United kingdom would not affect the possibility of assisting these territories.      On the other hand,  if the present hopes of a considerable improvement in the world conditions were not disappointed,  the chances of their receivinglarger supplies in the autumn were good.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he was most anxious as to the effect on opinion in the United Statesof a decision not to impose broad rationing.      he appreciated that the Administration might welcome such adecision, hut it would remove the urge to export as muchwheat as possible to the United Kingdom and the continent and make the Administration much more likely to yield to pressure from the isolationist groups whose influence wasve ry formidable.The sole change in the situation since 18th Julywas a change of prediction.      It was now predicted thatthe Canadian harvest would be larger, hut until thisprediction had been turned into a reality, the only safecourse,  in view of the very narrow margin of safety onwhich we wore working, was to bring rationing into force.The additional supplies now promised from Canada in theimmediate future amounted to less than a. week&apos;8 consump-tion.      Did the Cabinet believe that they could retainpublic confidence if they suspended the  scheme because ofthis relatively minor change in the situation?      Moreover,if the scheme were suspended, it would be impossible forthe Government to introduce it except in the gravestemergency.     The decision to ration bread had raised the moral stature of the United Kingdom throughout the world.If that decision wore now reversed all that would he lost.Again,  though the imposition of rationing would causeinconvenience ana even hardship,  the Cabinet should notforget that in the relief at its removal in two or threemonths&apos;  time these difficulties would largely bo forgotten.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that ho was impressed by the fact that owing to the additional supplies promisedfrom Canada, United Kingdom stocks at 31st August would heincreased from 513,000 tons to 59^,000 tons and at 30thSeptember from 590,000 tons to 693,:000 tons.      Though,like all figures of future stocks,  these figures wereestimates, it was clear that the Minister of Food regardedthem as considerably firmer and more reliable than thelower figures which the Cabinet had previously had beforethem.      Whatever the decision of the Cabinet might be, hourged that there should be no attempt to conceal the newfigures given in AMA2.E 7U88 .      Their disclosure need notbe incompatible with a decision to continue the rationing scheme since it could be stressed that they wereadmittedly only a &quot;tentative guess&quot;.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESrecalled that the primary object of the decision tointroduce bread rationing had been that we might have an insurance in case  the United States defaulted on hershipments during the- next critical two or three months and in case we did not get during that period what we expected from the home harvest.      It now appeared, unlikelythat the United States would default on her shipments and.in addition,  there were prospects of improved quantitiesfrom Canada.      The only serious uncertainty remaining wasthe yield of the home harvest.      If,  therefore, the object
of rationing was to have in existence a machine wherebyconsumption could be reduced if it became necessary,  andif it no longer appeared likely that a reduction of.consumption would be necessary,  then, he suggested,  circum-stances had so far changed that the earlier decision couldbe reconsidered.      He himself had always impressed uponthe Cabinet the disadvantage of a. high extraction rate which reduced animal feeding stuffs and he thought thatthe extraction rate should be reduced as soon as possible.The Minister of Pood, however, was now able to say that itshould be possible to reduce the extraction rate inSeptember even if rationing were not imposed.     this being so, he now took the view that the scheme should be suspended.THE MINISTER OP FUEL AND POWER suggested that,besides the uncertainty as to the yield of the home harvest,there was still uncertainty as to the yield of the Canadiancrop, which had not yet been harvested.      It was by nomeans impossible that adverse weather would seriouslyreduce the Canadian yield and it would be a mistake toput too much reliance on the new estimates now before theCabinet.      The experience of the last few months had not increased his confidence in the reliability of such estimates.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  saidthat in the last six weeks the prospects of the Europeanharvests had considerably improved.      The crops in theUkraine and in the Danube Basin were likely to be heavy;the North African harvest had been remarkable, and theFrench harvest was expected to be good.      Greece,  and perhaps Italy,   seemed to him to be the only countrieswhich would require substantial imports.As regards our own supplies, he had always beenin favour of taking some risk before imposing bread rationing.     He had himself thought that the risks were such as could be taken even when the low point of ourwheat stocks was expected to be just over 500,000 tons.If there was now reasonable ground to hope that they wouldnot fall below 594,000 tons,  there did not seem to be acase for rationing.      There was no doubt that rationingwould be a burden on the public,   and though the response to the scheme so far had been good,  he advised the Cabinetnot to strain the loyalty of their supporters by imposing a burden which could not be shown to be amply justified.It would be much easier to defend a change  of policy now than it would have been before the very satisfactory conclusion to the debate in Parliament on 18th July.      he did not suggest that the scheme should be scrappedaltogether - only that its operation should be suspendedfor a while, until the Cabinet were able to assure them-,selves that the more hopeful predictions would berealised.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that theCabinet should give full v/eight to the possibility oflabour disputes in Canada or the United States.      Therewas a threat of a strike on the Canadian railways withinthe next two or three weeks, and a demand by the CanadianSeamen&apos;s Union for an increase in wages, which if it ledto a strike would interrupt traffic on the Great Lakesand seriously affect wheat shipments to the United Kingdom.Further,   the; removal of price control in the United states had led the Conference of Industrial Organisations to demand that wages should follow prices.      Thus there was a
very serious risk of major disturbances in the UnitedStates,  and he was strongly against any suspension ofthe rationing scheme.      He was glad to know that thelong term Canadian wheat contract could now be regardedas safe, but what would be the effect of its signatureon opinion in the United States coupled with the armounce-ment that bread rationing was not to be imposed?      would it- not make the United States much less responsive to ourrequests for help from them?     The Cabinet should neverforget that when the Government was responsible for allimports they must work on a higher level of stocks than was necessary when there was a free market,  since theyhad to cover themselves not only against economicuncertainties but also against the often greater risk ofpolitical embarrassment.      It seemed to him that thepresent troubles had largely arisen through neglect ofthis principle.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE  said thatbread rationing was a precautionary measure in case-further economies became necessary.      This contingency now seemed much more unlikely.      In view of this and of the hardship of rationing he thought that,  whatever thepolitical consequences,  the Cabinet would bo fully justi-fiecl in revising their earlier decision.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that he was advised by the local officers of theMinistry of Labour that the rationing scheme was unlikely to work smoothly for the first week or two&apos;;.      If rationingcould be postponed, many of the difficulties could be gotover before it was introduced.In further discussion THE SECRETARY Op STATEFOR DOMINION AFFAIRS and THE HOME SECRETARY urged that thenow information before the Cabinet did not afford a sufficiently reliable basis for a decision to suspend thescheme,  and THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE TREASURYsaid that he was convinced that, if the scheme weresuspended,  it would be impossible to bring it into force at a later date.THE LORD PRESIDENT  said that he did not agreethat it would be impossible to introduce the scheme at alater date if there were any   new   development such as a major strike in Canada or the United States, whichobviously altered the situation.     The Government hadconstantly assured Parliament that they would be guided bythe facts and on the facts, which wore quite as firm asthose on which the earlier decision to ration had beentaken, it seemed to him that the case for suspension wasoverwhelming.      These facts were certain to become known and the Government would find it very difficult to defend themselves against the charge of obstinacy if,  in the face of them,  rationing were maintained.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed thatthe facts must be made public and he saw no reason whyin giving them the Minister of Pood should not indicatethat there was good hope that the rationing scheme wouldnot have to be maintained in force for long.      He didnot think,  however,  that those facts constituted;  either on economic or on political grounds, a convincing case for suspending the rationing scheme ;    and he was satisfiedthat the introduction of rationing as a measure of
insurance was still amply justified.     The fact thatrisks which were insured against often did notmateralise did not invalidate the principle of insuranceNot to proceed with rationing now at the eleventh hourwould cause dismay among the Government&apos;s supportersand would undermine the confidence of the public in theMinistry of Pood, which was a most valuable asset.He felt,  therefore,  that the Cabinet should decide toproceed with the rationing scheme.      At. the same time, hfully recognised the burden which this would entail forthe Minister of Pood and he was confident that all hiscolleagues would give the Minister their support in thedischarge of his difficult task.The Cabinet -(1) Reaffirmed their decision that bread rationing should be introducedforthwith.(2) Agreed that the information given in telegram AMAZE 7^-88 should be published.
