1A0VTB on. (46) 97th Conclusions18th November,  1946   -   12 noonIn the Debate on the Motion for an address in reply to the King&apos;s Speech a numberof Government supporters had tabled an amendment in the following terms: -&quot;And express the urgent hope thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will so review and recast its conduct of international affairs as to afford the utmost encouragement to, and collaboration with, all nations and Groups striving to secure fullSocialist planning and control of theworld&apos;s resources and thus provide a democratic and constructive Socialistalternative to an otherwise inevitableconflict between American Capitalism and soviet Communism in which all hope of world Government would be destroyed.&quot;Those supporting this Amendment, while they did not propose to press it to a d i Vision9were anxious to have an opportunity of expressing their views in the debate;    and Mr. Speaker had decided to call the Amendment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this group of Members had chosen a most inopportunemoment for the public expression of their views,and the debate could not fail to be embarrassing to the Government in their relations with theUnited States.      It was also unfortunate thatthis group should have chosen to raise these issuesby way of formal Amendment to the Address andshould have persisted in this course in spite of
the advice given to them on the Government&apos;behalf.      This issue of Party discipline wouldhave to be dealt with at an early meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party.THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER saidthat he could not condone the action of this group in raising these issues by way of an amendment to the Address.      While the Coalition Governmenthad been in office, he had at times been severelycritical of their policy;    but, in spite of this,he had made it a rule never to associate himself with any formal amendment in debates on the Address.At the same time, the Cabinet should recognise thatthis Amendment reflected a feeling of uneasiness inthe party about the Government&apos;s foreign policy;and he thought that this uneasiness was shared tosomesome extent by/members of the Government.      he himself had thought it necessary on two occasionsto question particular aspects of foreign policy.He had submitted to the Cabinet a memorandum on policy towards Germany which, in his view, had beenfully justified by subsequent events.      He had also informed the Prime Minister of doubts which heentertained of Government policy in the Middle East;but the Prime Minister had not thought it advisable to bring that issue forward for discussion by theCabinet.      Ministers who were not members of theDefence Committee were not perhaps fully informed of all the strategic considerations which werebeing taken into account in the formulation of
foreign policy.      It would be helpful if theCabinet itself could be given more opportunities for full and general discusaionson foreign policy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would consider means of enabling the Cabinet to holdmore frequent discussions on matters of foreignpolicy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was particularly concerned to find that about half-a-dozen Parliamentary Private Secretaries to ministers had added their names to this amendment to the Adoress.      As he had said, he regarded itas a breach of Party discipline for back benchsupporters of the Government to express theircriticism of Government policy by way of an amendment to the Address, which was tantamount to a formal expression of lack of confidence inthe Government.      It was an even more serious matter for Parliamentary Private Secretaries to lend their support to such an amendment.      They hadaccess to some information which was not availableto back bench Members and held positions of trust,if not of responsibility.     Acceptance of theseposts involved loyalty to the individual Ministerwhom they served and to the Government as a whole.A Parliamentary Private Secretary who found himself in disagreement with Government policy to  such an extent as to wish to support a hostile Amendment tothe Address should, in his view, resign hisposition.      It was for consideration whether theparliamentary Private Secretaries who had supported
this Amendment should be required to resigntheir posts.In discussion there was general support for the view expressed by the PrimeMinister.      Parliamentary Private Secretarieswere not members of the Government and were not therefore bound by the doctrine of collective responsibility.      They must, like other government supporters, be allowed a reasonable discretion to express criticisms of particular aspects ofGovernment policy;    and there need not be anyabsolute rule which would prevent a ParliamentaryPrivate Secretary from speaking in the Houseagainst the Government or even,  in an extreme case, voting against the Government.      He must,however, be careful to consider whether on anyparticular occasion such action would involvedisloyalty to his Minister or embarrassment tothe Government as a whole.     And it must not be overlooked that,  in view of the close relationsbetween a Parliamentary Private Secretary and his minister, public criticism of another Minister bya parliamentary Private Secretary might result inlack of confidence between Ministers and possiblyfriction within the Cabinet.Discussion then turned on the questionwhether the parliamentary Private Secretaries whohad supported this Amendment to the Address shouldbe required at once to resign their appointments,or whether it would suffice to warn them that ifany similar occasion arose in the future they would
have to choose between resigning their positionsor refraining from publicly supporting suchcriticism of the Government.      It was pointed outthat several of those concerned had been unaware of the impropriety of their conduct,  and that inthese circumstances the position could best bemet by a warning.      The point was also made that,if all these parliamentary Private Secretarieswere required simultaneously to resign,  it wouldbe assumed that this action had been taken inpursuance of a collective decision of the Government -and this would tend to arouse further dissatisfactionin the parliamentary Party.      The balance ofopinion in the Cabinet was in favour of explaining to those concerned the nature of the obligationsinvolved by acceptance of the position ofParliamentary private Secretary,  and warning themthat they could not exxject to retain that position if, on another such occasion, they associated themselves with a concerted attack on government policy.      The Ministers concerned undertook togive such a warning to their parliamentary PrivateSecretaries.      The Prime Minister said that he would ask the Minister of Pood (who was not present atthe Cabinet&apos;s meeting) to deal similarly with his parliamentary Private Secretary, who was among those who had supported the Amexidment.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.C%C^ Vd   ^rV^e.
