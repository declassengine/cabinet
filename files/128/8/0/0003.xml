CM. (k6) 86TH CONCLUSIONSll+th October, 19u7 - 11.30 a.m.HINA THE PRIME MINISTER said that an informalapproach had &quot;been made to H.M. Ambassador at Nankingupply ofjros (reported in Nanking Telegram No. 528 of 17th September) ,on behalf of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, with a viewto ascertaining whether His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldprovide him with arms to enable him to continue hostilitiesagainst the Communists.     This approach showed that theGeneralissimo&apos;s Government had abandoned the idea of coming to terms with the Communists and were notcollaborating fully with the United States Governmentin the attempt to halt the civil war.      It also showed that the United States authorities were reducing their supplies of war material as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Generalissimo&apos;s Government.     The foreign secretary had mentioned this approach in a conversation which he had held with the United States Secretary ofState in Paris on 13th October (Paris Telegram No. 930 oflU/th October).     Mr. Byrnes had been glad to receive this information and had indicated that the conduct of theGeneralissimo&apos;s Government, in their relations with theUnited States Government, had been increasinglyunsatisfactory.     As a result, the United States Governmentwere now considering whether they should not withdraw all their forces from North China.      The Foreign Secretary had informed Mr. Byrnes that this confirmed him in his view thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should not encourage theGeneralissimo to hope that he could obtain any supply of
arras from Great Britain;    and he would advise that Hierequest made through H.M. Ambassador at Nanking shouldbe rejected.The Prime Minister said that he had already informed the Foreign Secretary that he supported theline which he had taken in his conversation withMr. Byrnes.The Cabinet -Endorsed the view of the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should refuseto accede to this request for thesupply of arras to Generalissimo chiang kai-shek -shek&apos;s Government.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.
