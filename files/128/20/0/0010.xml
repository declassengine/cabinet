2. The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation that during the course of theElection campaign each of the main political parties should arrangefor one political speech to be included in the television programme.This would be in addition to the series of Election broadcasts onwhich agreement had already been reached between the parties.This suggestion was supported by the Conservative and LiberalParties.In discussion it was recalled that, when a similar suggestion hadbeen made at the time of the last General Election, the Governmenthad rejected it. Since then, however, television had come to play amuch larger part in the national life; and Ministers felt that it was now inevitable that use should be made of this new medium of publicity at the time of a General Election. Great care should betaken in selecting a suitable person to speak on behalf of the LabourParty in the television programme.The Cabinet (1) Decided to accept the suggestion of the British broadcasting corporation that during the course of the Election cam-paign the television programme should include one speech on behalf of each of the main political Parties; and invited the Deputy Chief Whip to make the necessary arrange-ments, in consultation with the Conservative and LiberalParties.GeneralElection.(previous reference:CM. (51) 59thConclusions).Television.The King&apos;s 1.   The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the latest newsIllness. regarding the progress of the King&apos;s illness.    Although there hadbeen no interruption in His Majesty&apos;s gradual progress towardsrecovery from the operation which he had undergone on 23rd Sep-tember, and no complications had so far arisen, there wOuld still because for some anxiety during a further period of about ten days.The Prime Minister proposed that statements about the King&apos;sillness should be made on behalf of the Government in both houses of Parliament on 4th October.The journey which the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of edinburgh were to make to Canada had been postponed, with theconcurrence of the Prime Minister of Canada. If, however, the tour was to be made, it would now be necessary for Their RoyalHighnesses to make the journey by air; and the Leader of the Con-servative Opposition had expressed the view that it would be wrong for the Princess to run this additional risk at the present time. ThePrime Minister said that, before advising Her Royal Highness on thispoint, he would be glad to hear his colleagues&apos; views on it.In discussion it was pointed out that in the course of their pro-posed tour Their Royal Highnesses would be obliged to fly fromplace to place in North America and that, judging by the record of accidents, there was nowadays no greater danger in flying the north atlantic than in making air journeys over land. It would be undesirable to establish a precedent which, by denying them the useof what was widely regarded as a normal means of travel undermodern conditions, might handicap Their Royal Highnesses for manyyears to come in the discharge of their public duties.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Princess Elizabeththat, if the state of the King&apos;s health were such that she could proceed with her projected visit to Canada, the cabinet would not advise against her making the journey across theNorth Atlantic by air.
Visit of The Prime Minister said that, before he had decided to&apos;ask theDr. Adenauer   King for a dissolution of Parliament, the Foreign Secretary hadto United        invited the Chancellor of the German Federal Republic to pay a visitKingdom.       to this country in the early part of October.   He suggested that thisvisit should now be postponed, as it would be undesirable that dr. Adenauer should be in this country during the course of theElection campaign.The Foreign Secretary said that he had, with reluctance, reachedthe same conclusion.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange that Dr. Adenauer&apos;proposed visit to the United Kingdom should be post-poned until after the General Election.Foreign Affairs.foreign secretary&apos;visit to north america.Japan.Germany.Spain.Italy.Austria.3. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on thediscussions which he had held on questions of foreign policy during his recent visit to the United States and Canada.The Conference at San Francisco for the signature of the peace treaty with Japan had, in. his view, proceeded very satisfactorily; andthere had been no feeling among the Western nations that Russia hadbeen treated unfairly in this matter. The Foreign Secretary had helddiscussions with the Japanese Prime Minister and had urged him notto embark hastily on treaty negotiations either with the Peking Gov-ernment or with the Chinese Nationalists. He had also emphasisedto Mr. Yoshida the concern felt in the United Kingdom aboutJapanese trade conditions, and the importance of strengthening thetrades union movement in Japan. The representatives of the other commonwealth Governments had made a very good impression atthe San Francisco Conference: the representatives of Pakistan and ceylon, in particular, had made effective contributions to thediscussions.At the meetings in Washington a satisfactory tripartite statement on the change in the international status of Germany had been drawnup, and it had also been possible to secure general agreement to theestablishment of a European Army. This proposal was strongly supported by the smaller Western European countries, who, in company with France, were anxious that there should be no avoidabledelay in carrying it into effect.The Foreign Secretary had obtained assurances from the UnitedStates Secretary of State that the United States Government had no intention of attempting to secure the inclusion of Spain in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation, and he had impressed on Mr. Achesonthe concern with which the United Kingdom Government had viewed the action already taken by the United States to associate Spain with western European defence.A statement had been agreed by the representatives of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and France on the revision of the peace treaty with Italy. No formal revision could be made without theconsent of the other signatories of the Treaty, but the three powers had agreed that in the meantime they would in practice ignore those provisions of the Treaty which were no longer regarded as acceptableor appropriate. The Foreign Secretary had had some success in dis-suading the Italian Prime Minister from pressing the Italian claims atthe meeting of the North Atlantic Council.It had been agreed that the Peace Treaty with Austria shouldbe discussed at further meetings of the Foreign Ministers&apos; deputiesto be held in November.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report.
North atlantic treaty.OttawaMeeting ofthe Council.(previous reference:CM. (51) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Defence each made a report to the Cabinet on theproceedings at the Ottawa meeting of the North Atlantic Council.They were all agreed that this had been a valuable meeting, at whichreal progress had been&apos; made towards a solution of some of thedifficulties confronting the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The.main points made by the Ministers in their reports were as follows:  (a) The Council had agreed in principle to the appointment of a middle East Command under a British Supreme Commander, and tothe admission of Greece and Turkey to membership of N.A.T.O.Many practical difficulties remained for discussion, including theFrench desire for fuller recognition of their position in the middle east. Moreover, it seemed doubtful whether the opposition of someof the smaller countries to Greek and Turkish membership ofN. A.T.O. had been entirely removed; and problems in this connection,and in connection with the United States views on the constitutionof the Middle East Command, remained for solution. The Dutch,in particular, were afraid that the membership of Greece and Turkeymight reduce the amount of military assistance available to western european countries; and they were also apprehensive lest Turkey&apos;sinclusion might lead to the addition of further Middle East countries to the Organisation.(h) The Minister of Defence said that he had taken the oppor-tunity to emphasise the urgency of making more military forcesimmediately available in Western Europe. This, in his view, was moreimportant than building up towards the creation of even larger forcesin 1954. He had also been successful in arranging for this problem to be discussed at a separate meeting of the N.A.T.O. defence ministers.(c) Decisions had been taken on the important question of the financing of &quot; Infra Structure,&quot; viz., the provision of airfields, com-munications, &amp;c, for the North Atlantic forces in Western Europe.The United Kingdom Government had agreed to make available 14 million out of a total of  80 million for the first stage of this programme.(d) In preliminary meetings in Washington with United Statesand French Ministers the Chancellor of the Exchequer had explained the financial consequences of attempting to carry out our share of the medium-term defence plan, which would call for expenditure greatly in excess of our current defence programme. The French had supported our view that the plan could not be carried out withouta fundamental reconsideration of its financial implications. At themeeting of the Council in Ottawa it had been agreed that a group of &quot; wise men &quot; representing the North Atlantic Treaty Powers shouldbe set up to analyse the position and make recommendations to governments. There was also some prospect that the United StatesGovernment would undertake a screening of the military requiremntsof the medium-term defence plan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, subject to the viewsof his colleagues, he felt that the United Kingdom representative onthis group should be the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The chancellor would obviously be unable himself to carry out the detailed work orattend all the meetings, but he might be assisted by a senior officialwho would act as his alternate. The Chancellor could thus retaingeneral control of what would be the most important financialoperation.In discussion it was pointed out that the work of this group would be done mainly outside London and might involve the Chan-cellor in such frequent absences as to make it difficult for him todischarge his Ministerial duties in London. At the same timeMinisters felt that it would be difficult for an official to exercise theinfluence which they would wish to see brought to bear upon this
group on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, and that on this account it might be preferable that, at meetings which the Chancellorcould not attend in person, the United Kingdom Government shouldbe represented by some other Minister. It was suggested that, if further international work of this character had to be undertaken on financial and economic questions, it might become necessary toappoint a Minister of State in the Treasury for reasons similar tothose which had led to the appointment of a Minister of State in theForeign Office.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the reports made by the Foreign Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of defence on the proceedings at the Ottawa meeting of the north atlantic Council.(2) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be theprincipal representative of the United Kingdom Govern-ment on the group which was to strike a balance betweenthe requirements put forward by the military advisers ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the economic consequences of meeting those requirements; and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider with thePrime Minister, in the light of the discussion recordedabove, who should represent the United Kingdom Govern-ment at meetings of this group which the Chancellor was unable to attend in person.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (51) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)Balance ofPayments.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (51) 251) reporting on the discussions whichhe had held in Washington regarding the economic situation of theUnited Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as soon as he had reached Washington he had handed to the United States authoritiesa memorandum (reproduced in Annex I of CP. (51) 251) giving full particulars of the serious deterioration in the United Kingdom balanceof payments. A deficit of $500 million for the third quarter of 1951had been forecast in July, and owing to a subsequent worsening of theposition (including recent movements of capital) the deficit was nowlikely to exceed $600 million. He had made no immediate proposalsfor United States assistance, but had emphasised in private conversa-tions the inevitable repercussions upon the carrying out of our defence programme, making it clear that the full execution of the  4,700million programme must depend upon United States action in some form. In public he had reiterated our determination to carry outthe programme with the co-operation of our Allies. He had found the United States authorities not unsympathetic, and they had been further impressed by the French explanation of France&apos;s financialposition, which was similar to our own.Later in his visit he had followed up this initiative by leaving withthe United States authorities a memorandum (reproduced in Annex ii of CP. (51) 251) suggesting ways in which the United States Govern-ment could assist us. Discussions on the suggestions made in thismemorandum would follow as soon as possible: he could not forecasttheir outcome, but he was at least convinced that the United StatesGovernment were now in no doubt about the seriousness of ourposition.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
United States The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the forth-and Canadian coming General Election, he thought it would be inadvisable for the loans. Cabinet to take any decision at this stage on the question whetheror not an application should be made for waiver of the interest due on 31st December on the United States and Canadian loans. It wouldbe highly undesirable that this question should become a matter ofpolitical controversy during the Election. If it &quot;should subsequently be decided ,to apply for the waiver, investigation by the international monetary Fund would be necessary; but even so it would not beimpossible to hold the decision over until early in November.Ministers endorsed the view expressed by the Chancellor of theExchequer. They pointed out, however, that they would be askedduring the Election campaign what the Governments intentions werein this matter, and suggested that a uniform reply should bereturned to such enquiries.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to devise, and make available to them, a suitable formula for answering such questions as might be asked during the Election regardingthe Governments intentions in respect of the waiver ofinterest on the United States and Canadian loans.Persia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 58thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet ; had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (CP. (51) 257) outlining the history of the oildispute with Persia.The Prime Minister said that the latest development in the situa-tion was the instruction given by the Persian Government that theremaining British staff in Abadan should leave the country in aweek&apos;s time. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tehran had been instructed to make strong representations to the Persian ForeignMinister against the proposed expulsions, and the Ambassador wasseeing the Shah that afternoon. It was difficult to get a clear picture of the political situation in Persia. In response to a message whichhe had sent to the President of the United States, he had now received a reply saying (i) that the United States Ambassador in tehran was being asked to inform the Persian Government of the grave concern of the United States Government at the proposed action;(ii) that the United States Government would be unable to supportany action involving the use of force to maintain the British staff inAbadan; and (iiij that it. seemed desirable for the United KingdomGovernment to put forward some fresh proposal to the PersianGovernment. The President added that he would send a further message in the next day or so dealing with the matter at greaterlength. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the attitude of theUnited States Government, he did not think it would be expedient to use force to maintain the British staff in Abadan. Moreover, an occupation of Abadan Island would not necessarily bring about achange in the Persian Government and might well unite the Persianpeople against this country, and neither the oil wells nor the refinerycould be worked without the assistance of Persian workers. If weattempted to find a solution by force we could not expect muchsupport in the United Nations, where the South American Govern-ments would follow the lead of the United States and Asiatic Govern-ments would be hostile to us. It would be humiliating to this country if the remaining British staff at Abadan were expelled, but this step would at least leave Dr. Mussadiq with the task of attempting to run the oil industry with inadequate facilities for refining oil and gettingit away from Persia and he might then be driven to accept some form of agreement with this country. The Prime Minister said thathe was seeing the leaders of the Conservative Opposition later in the
day, and would explain to them whatever policy was approved bythe Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that the United Kingdom Govern-ment had acted with great reasonableness in the face of muchprovocation from the Persian Government. The Persian Govern-ment .had failed to respond to the many endeavours made to find some compromise and had ignored the findings of the international court. In spite of President Truman&apos;s suggestion, it was difficultto see what fresh approach could be made by the United KingdomGovernment. If the remaining British staff in Abadan were expelledand the Governments handling of the Persian dispute appearedfeeble and ineffective, the repercussions throughout the Middle Eastand elsewhere would be very serious, Egypt might be emboldenedto take drastic action to end the military treaty and possibly to bringthe Suez Canal under Egyptian control, and British legal rights inmany other parts of the world would be placed in jeopardy. In thesecircumstances he was inclined to think that the Persian Governmentshould be toid that the United Kingdom Government could not tolerate the expulsion of the remaining staff from Abadan and would,if necessary, take the necessary steps to ensure that they were notexpelled. Recourse to the Security Council was unlikely to produce any effective result; but, if force had to be used, it would be necessaryto explain to the Security Council without delay the circumstances which had rendered military action unavoidable.The Cabinet first considered whether the military operation to seize Abadan Island, for which all preparations had been made,should be authorised, possibly after a final warning to the PersianGovernment. Preparations had been brought to a point at whichthe operation could be mounted in twelve hours. The Law officers had, however, advised that, unless the Security Council had sanc-tioned the use of force by the United Kingdom, military operationsdesigned to seize Abadan would in present circumstances be illegal.Some doubt was expressed whether this view took sufficient accountof the rights of self-defence, which were independent of any actionauthorised by the Security Council. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that, in the light of the United States attitude as revealed in the Presidents reply and as previously outlined by theUnited States Secretary of State in a discussion with the foreign secretary on 13th September, force could not be used to hold the refinery and maintain the British employees of the Anglo-iranian oil Company in Abadan. We could not afford to break with theUnited States on an issue of this kind. The United States Govern-ment would not oppose the use of force if it were necessary to save the refinery from a Communist Government or to protect Britishlives; but on the latter point the Chiefs of Staff had inclined to theview that military operations might endanger British lives and, fromthe strictly military point of view, they would prefer to postponelaunching any operation until after the British employees had leftAbadan. In any event, the use of force would not necessarily bringnearer a solution of the dispute.There was general agreement that, if the remaining British staff were expelled from Abadan, the prospects of re-establishing Britishmanagement of the Persian oil industry would be greatly lessened.Every endeavour should therefore be made to prevent the expulsionsfrom taking place. In a review of the steps open to the Governmentthe following points were made:  (a) Some good effects might result from the support which theUnited States Ambassador in Tehran was now to give to the representations already made by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador. Thefurther communication promised by President Truman might alsocontain useful suggestions.(b) The Security Council should at once be asked to take stepsto compel the Persian Government to respect the interim findings ofthe International Court.   Some Ministers thought that, in view of
the present composition of the Council and the possibility that russia might exercise the veto, it was unlikely that any useful outcome couldbe expected from a reference to the Council. Moreover, time wasshort and some days might elapse before an effective discussion couldbe arranged. Most Ministers considered, however, that, while the outcome could not be foretold with any certainty, there was somechance that, if the British case were put forcibly before the Council,a resolution might be secured which could be made the basis offurther action. United States opinion was more likely to supportdrastic action if it appeared to have the support of the security council or if that support would have been forthcoming but for theexercise of the veto by Russia. The Security Council could bebrought together at short notice; and it would be sufficient to give afew hours&apos; preliminary notice to the United States Government andto inform the Persian Government of what was proposed.(c) There was general agreement that at the appropriate stage the Shah should be informed that drastic financial and economicaction would have to be taken if the remaining British staff wereexpelled from Abadan. It was the general view of Ministers thatno sufficient advantage would be gained by severing diplomatic relations with Persia, since the presence of a British Ambassador in tehran afforded a channel of communication with the Shah, who might at some juncture be prepared to dismiss Dr. Mussadiq and finda more reasonable Government. Too much reliance should not,however, be placed upon any action by the Shah, who had repeatedlydisappointed the hopes which had been entertained that he woulddismiss the Mussadiq Government. The Aga Khan had in the pastshown a willingness to help; and the Lord Privy Seal, with whomthe Aga Khan had recently communicated, would consider, in con-sultation with the Foreign Secretary, whether the Aga Khan could usefully be asked to offer any advice to the Persians.(d) On the question whether any hope should be held out of fresh British concessions in any resumption of the negotiations, thegeneral view was that no concessions should be offered to Dr. Mus-sadiq. The Shah could, however, be told that the United KingdomGovernment might find it possible to make proposals which wouldbe more acceptable from the Persian point of view if they could dealwith a more reasonable Persian Government. As to the form which any concessions might take, some Ministers thought that the prospects of a settlement would be greatly improved if the United KingdomGovernment would offer the Persian Government a higher percentageof the profits than 50 per cent. On the other hand it was pointedout that any higher percentage would have serious repercussions onthe financial terms governing oil concessions in other parts of theworld, and would almost certainly be unwelcome to the United StatesGovernment. It might, however, be practicable, without formallyaltering the proposed basis for the sharing of profits, to give a higherfinancial inducement to the Persians by offering more generous com-pensation terms.(e) One method of avoiding the humiliation of having theremaining British staff expelled from Abadan would be to instructthem to withdraw at once. It was, however, the general view ofMinisters that the staff should remain at their posts and that thequestion whether they should withdraw or wait to be expelled shouldbe considered at the end of the period of warning which the Persianshad given to them.With reference to the public reaction to the latest developments in the oil dispute, it was pointed out that the public expected someeffective action to be taken, though not necessarily by the use of force. There might be a demand for a debate on Persia before the prorogation of Parliament; and it would be of advantage if then, or at some other time, public reference could be made to the attitude ofthe United States Government to the use of force.The Prime ministers aid that, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discus-sion, it was clear that, after a preliminary intimation to the United
States Government of what was proposed, the United KingdomGovernment should ask the Security Council to consider what action could, be taken to compel the Persian Government to respect thepreliminary findings of the International Court on the oil dispute.Meanwhile, the Shah should be informed that the matter was beingtaken to the Security Council and that, while the United KingdomGovernment might find it possible to improve on the offers whichthey had so far made, if they were dealing with a reasonable PersianGovernment, he must expect that serious financial and economic consequences would follow the expulsion of the remaining british staff from Abadan.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Persian oil dispute should be referred imme-diately to the Security Council, which should be asked toconsider as a matter of urgency What steps could be takento compel the Persian Government to respect the findings of the International Court.(2) Agreed that communications should be sent to the UnitedStates Government and to the Persian Government on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet also considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP. (51) 254) on the question whether the VulcanFoundry Company should continue work on locomotives which werebeing made under contracts with the Persian State Railways.After a short discussion, the Cabinet (a) Agreed that the Vulcan Foundry Company should continuework on the contract from the Persian State Railways, inview of the fact, that, if necessary, other markets could probably be found for the locomotives, when they were completed.The King&apos;sSpeech on the prorogation ofParliament.(previous reference:CM. (50) 64thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (51) 252) covering a draft of The King&apos;s Speech onthe Prorogation of Parliament.The Home Secretary said that he hoped that, as in previous years,the Lord Chancellor would supervise the preparation of the final draft.In discussion it was agreed that the references to the united nations and to the maintenance of peace should precede the referenceto rearmament.  Some drafting amendments were also approved.The Cabinet Subject to the amendments approved in the Cabinet&apos;s discus-sion and to any drafting amendments to be made by theLord Chancellor, approved the draft Speech on the prorogation of Parliament annexed to CP. (51) 252.bechuanaland protectorate:tshekedi khama.!(previous reference:CM. (51) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (5.1)250) proposing that the reports of the observers who had been sent toBechuanaland should be published under cover of a White Paperreaffirming the Governments policy of excluding both Tshekedi andSeretse Khama from the Bamangwato Reserve for a period of notless than five years.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatadministrative and political difficulties were likely to arise in
States Government of what was proposed, the United KingdomGovernment should ask the Security Council to consider what action could be taken to compel the Persian Government to respect thepreliminary findings of the International Court on the oil dispute.Meanwhile, the Shah should be informed that the matter was beingtaken to the Security Council and that, while the United KingdomGovernment might find it possible to improve on the offers whichthey had so far made, if they were dealing with a reasonable PersianGovernment, he must expect that serious financial and economic consequences would follow the expulsion of the remaining british staff from Abadan.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Persian oil dispute should be referred imme-diately to the Security Council, which should be asked toconsider as a matter of urgency what steps could be takento compel the Persian Government to respect the findings of the International Court.(2) Agreed that communications should be sent to the UnitedStates Government and to the Persian Government on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet also considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP.

agricultural prices.(previous reference:CM. (50) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)Bechuanaland if such an announcement were not made at an earlydate. Although the observers had not been able to submit a unanimous report, their findings supported the policy which theGovernment had been pursuing.In discussion attention was drawn to the undesirability of revivingpublic controversy on this subject during the Election.The Cabinet Agreed that the publication of a White Paper in the termsof the draft annexed to CP. (51) 250 should be deferred until after the Election.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (CP. (51) 253) recommending that, if the proposed increases in the wages of agricultural workers were confirmed by theAgricultural Wages Board on 10th October, the Government shouldconcede in a public announcement that there was a prima facie case for a Special Review of agricultural prices.The Minister of Agriculture said that in his view the Governmentcould not avoid holding a Special Review, having regard to thefinancial position of the farmers and the need to ensure that cultivationwas maintained at a high level. In 1950 a Special Review had beengranted when agricultural workers had been given a smaller wagesincrease than was now proposed. Investigation might show that anincrease in prices could be avoided by the reintroduction of thesubsidy on fertilisers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that nothing need to saiduntil after the consideration of the proposed wages increase by theAgricultural Wages Board on 10th October. If the increase in wages were then granted, it would be reasonable to say that the question ofa Special Review would be considered after the Election. The resultof a Special Review would almost certainly be to increase the pricesof agricultural products. Sufficient information was not yet availableto show whether a Special Review could be justified.In further discussion it was suggested that, if an increase in agricultural wages were granted, it would not be practicable to avoidsome indication of Government policy. As there were various ways in which the situation could be handled, it might not be necessary tosay specifically that there would be a Special Review, but some con-sideration of the financial position of the agricultural community would have to be promised.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the agriculture ministers and the Minister of Food, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, to settle the form of the Governmentannouncement which should be made after 10th October ifthe Agricultural Wages Board confirmed the proposed increase in the wages of agricultural workers.Cabinet Office, SWA,21th September, 1951.
