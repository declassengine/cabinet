Secretary 1.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that towards theof the end of the year Sir Norman Brook would be relinquishing his appoint-Cabinet. ment as Secretary of the Cabinet on transfer to an appointment inthe Treasury.  His place as Secretary of the Cabinet would be takenby Mr. T. Padmore, now a Third Secretary in the Treasury.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the services rendered by Sir Norman Brook during the period which he had spent in theCabinet Secretariat.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that Parliament would reassembleafter the Summer Recess on 16th October, and would be proroguedon 18th October. The new Session would be opened on 23rd October.Marketing of fruit and vegetables.(previous reference:CM. (50) 83rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLocal Government (CP. (51) 213) proposing that a public company should be formed to erect and operate one or more experimentalauction centres for the marketing of fruit and vegetables, or to assistby loans and grants any agricultural co-operative associations whichwould be prepared to operate such auction centres.The Minister of Local Government said that, after the Cabinefspreliminary discussion of this matter on 7th December, 1950, theCommittee on Distribution and Marketing had initiated the furtherinvestigations for which the Cabinet had asked. The financial prospects of the proposed auction centres had been examined, and preliminary discussions had been held with the principal organisationsrepresenting the growers. The results appeared to justify the Govern-ment in carrying the scheme a stage further.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Agricultural co-operative associations should be pressed to operate some of the experimental auction centres which were to beset up. n(b) The Committee on Distribution and Marketing had not givendetailed consideration to the form of organisation which should beset up to supervise the auction centres and probably to operate someof them. There were strong arguments in favour of a company ratherthan a public corporation, but the details of the organisation could befurther examined.(c) It had been considered that, since the auction centres might eventually displace some of the distributors, no useful purpose wouldbe served in discussing this project with the organisations representingthe distributors until the Cabinet had decided in principle to proceedwith the scheme.(d) It was estimated that, if five experimental auction centreswere set up in areas where they were likely to attract the necessaryturnover, the capital cost to the Government might be about 1,250,000.(e) If the Cabinet gave general approval to the scheme, the next stage would be to discuss it with distributors. It was not contem-plated that any public announcement would be made until October,and the form and timing of the announcement would be settled inagreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 2.13.
EgyptAnglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:CM. (51) 39thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 214) reporting the present position of the nego-tiations with the Egyptian Government about defence and the Sudanand proposing that, if the negotiations seemed to be likely to be broken off before the end of the present Egyptian parliamentary session, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should be authorised to informthe Egyptian Foreign Minister that the United Kingdom Governmenthad under consideration a new approach to the solution of the defencequestion.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he hoped that negotiations could be kept going, there was a risk that the Egyptian ForeignMinister might break, them off before the end of the Egyptian par-liamentary session. He had it in mind that a new approach might bemade to the defence problem by admitting Egypt as a partner in anew Allied Middle East Command, in return for which Egypt wouldbe expected to make available to the Allied Command at least thoseminimum facilities which she was reluctant to grant to this countryalone.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Ministers had not recently had any information about thepolitical situation in the Sudan. It would be unfortunate if the pro-Egyptian elements in the Sudan were able to strengthen their position at this juncture. In reply, it was stated that there was no reason tobelieve that there had been any radical change in the position, andHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Egypt had recently expressed the viewthat the Egyptian party in the Sudan had probably lost some ground.It was likely, however, that influential sections of opinion in theSudan would swing round in favour of Egypt if it was thought thatthe outcome of the current negotiations in Cairo would be unfavour-able to the United Kingdom.(b). The attitude of the United States Government towards these negotiations had not in the past been very helpful. When, however,they became more involved in the problems of Middle East defence,they might attach more weight to the factors which had influencedUnited Kingdom policy. At present they were still opposed to theidea that the headquarters of any Allied Middle East Commandshould be in Cairo.(c) The Prime Minister suggested that the Foreign secretary should circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum indicating the strengthand weakness of the position of the United Kingdom in relation to egypt if the negotiations broke down. It would be useful for theCabinet to know in what ways pressure could be brought to bear uponEgypt to adopt a more reasonable attitude.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (51) 214.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a memorandumindicating the directions in which pressure might bebrought to bear upon Egypt if the present negotiationsbroke down and the Egyptian Government sought toenforce our withdrawal from the Canal Zone.japanese peace Treaty.JapaneseShipbuildingCapacity.(previous reference:CM. (51) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 234) proposing consultation with the australian and New Zealand Governments with a view to a concerted approach to the United States Government urging that some limitation shouldbe placed on Japanese shipbuilding capacity by action outside theproposed Peace Treaty.The Foreign Secretary recalled that there had been general agree-ment that it would be inconsistent with the form of the proposed treaty to try to write into it a limitation of Japanese shipbuilding
capacity. Reliance had been placed on the outcome of Americandiscussions in Tokyo with a view to Voluntary arrangements for limiting Japan&apos;s shipbuilding capacity. Those discussions had not had a satisfactory outcome, since the United States representative had appeared to accept the Japanese contention that their present ship-building capacity was not excessive. e While it was true that Japancould not become an important maritime Power for some time tocome, there was a serious risk that, if she were left with a shipbuilding capacity of 676,000 tons a year, her mercantile fleet would continue to expand after 1956 beyond her requirements, or that her competition for shipbuilding orders would become intensified. There appeared tobe no sufficient economic grounds for a shipbuilding capacity in japan in excess of about 400,000 tons a year.The Minister of Transport said that he was satisfied that thefigure of 676,000 tons a year was an underestimate of the presentcapacity of the Japanese shipyards. He agreed with the foreign secretary that the aim should be to reduce the present capacity toabout 400,000 tons a year, and pre-war experience showed that even this figure could in time make Japan a formidable shippingcompetitor.In discussion attention was drawn to the widespread anxietywhich was felt in this country about Japan as a future competitorwith British industry generally. This anxiety was by no meansconfined to the shipbuilding industry. At the same time, it was widely recognised, that it would be unprofitable to seek to reduce thiscompetition by including restrictive provisions in the Peace Treaty.Japan&apos;s population was expanding rapidly; and, unless a democraticregime was allowed to find some economic means of supporting thispopulation, the country would fall into economic distress which wouldbe exploited by communism.The Cabinet agreed that the United States Government shouldbe pressed to find some means of securing an effective limitation of japan&apos;s shipbuilding capacity. The support of the Australian andNew Zealand Governments would be valuable, though they were interested primarily in the security, rather than the commercial,aspects of the problem.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in paragraph 9 of cp. (51) 234.Libya.Treaty of alliance.(previous reference:CM. (50) 79thConclusions,Minute 4 (2).)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 222) reporting the present political situation in libya and seeking approval for the text of a draft treaty of allianceto be used as a basis of negotiations with the Libyan Government.The Foreign Secretary said that in pursuing the aims indicatedin his memorandum we should have to overcome various political difficulties in&apos; Libya and in the General Assembly of the united nations. He was, however, advised that there was some prospect that we might be able to secure a treaty on the lines of the draft whichhe had circulated.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Treasury had assumed that the financial assistance to begiven to Libya would not exceed  1,000,000 or  1,500,000 a year.Expenditure of this order would be justified if we could thereby bringLibya into the sterling area and secure the strategic advantages whichwe should derive from the stationing of British troops in Libya. we might, however, become involved in much larger expenditure if wewere manoeuvred into the position of accepting full responsibility for
developing the economic resources of Libya and raising the standardof living of its people. Our original intention had been to securebases in Cyrenaica, which would have involved a more limited liability. As the United States Government had pressed for theunion of Cyrenaica with the rest of Libya, it seemed reasonable thatthey should join us in providing financial aid to the new State.(b) The treaty should make it clear that Commonwealth forces,and not simply United Kingdom forces, could be stationed in Libya.(c) It would be desirable to inform India, Pakistan and Ceylonof the present proposals (other than the secret provisions which wouldnot be disclosed until after the United Nations General Assemblyhad disposed of the matter) in order to secure their support when thequestion was discussed in the United Nations Assembly.(d) The Service Departments would prefer a treaty of 50 years&apos;,rather than 25 years&apos; duration.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 2 of CP. (51) 222.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether the UnitedStates Government should be asked to share with us anylarger financial liability which might arise in consequenceof extending to the whole of Libya a commitment whichhad originally been confined to Cyrenaica.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to seek to secure the support of India, Pakistan and Ceylonfor the proposals which were to be put before the united nations Assembly in November.Future of 7.   The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by thethe British Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, the Colonies and Common-Council, wealth Relations (CP. (51) 231) on &quot;the future of the British Council.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been some justifiedcriticism,.which he had supported before assuming his present office,about the activities and expenditure of the British Council. As aresult of action recently taken on the basis of that criticism, sub-stantial improvements had been carried out; and he believed that theposition was now not unsatisfactory, subject to further scrutiny (as recommended in the memorandum) of the size of the CounciFsheadquarters staff. It was, however, difficult for the Council to planahead without some assurance about the future of their work; and heand the two other Secretaries of State directly concerned thereforejoined in submitting to the Cabinet the recommendations summarised in paragraph 3 of the memorandum viz. (i) that the Council wouldbe allowed to continue its work indefinitely, subject to review at theend of ten years; (ii) that the existing non-official status of the council should be preserved; (iii) that the overseas Departments should workout, in consultation with the Treasury, a reasonable minimum figurebelow which, subject to exceptional circumstances, the CounciTsincome should not be permitted to fall over a number of years; and(iv) that there should be further scrutiny of the size of the CounciTsheadquarters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the second of these recommendations and strongly supported the fourth recom-mendation, which contemplated a further pruning of the Council&apos;headquarters staff. On the first and third recommendations, he was doubtful about the expediency of accepting a firm commitment toenable the work of the Council to continue indefinitely at a givenlevel of activity, and he was certainly not prepared to guarantee anannual income of the order which seemed to be contemplated. TheCouncil would probably couple with this a suggestion that their staff should be placed on an established and pensionable basis, and thiswas a suggestion which he would be reluctant to accept. At the sametime he recognised that it would be easier for the Council to plan their
work ahead if they had some assurance of financial stability; and he agreed that an attempt might be made by the overseas departments to reach agreement with the Treasury on a minimum annual income which the Council might expect to continue to receive over the nextfew years. Above that minimum they must expect variation accordingto general financial conditions and the other claims upon theExchequer.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Should not the Governments of the older commonwealth countries make some contribution towards the cost of the CounciFswork in those countries? In reply it was pointed out that much ofthe CounciFs work there was designed to present the United Kingdompoint of view and way of life; and the other Commonwealth Govern-ments could hardly be expected to contribute towards the cost ofthose activities.(b) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the council was doing valuable work in British Colonial territories.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff supported the proposals in CP. (51) 231, since it would be important in war tocontinue cultural activities in neutral countries and these could best beundertaken by the Council.(d) Some doubts were expressed about the expediency. of thearrangement by which the CounciFs activities in Venezuela were beingfinanced by the Shell Company.(e) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was doubtful about the whole basis of the CounciFs operations. Foreigners werenot deceived by the non-official status of the Council: they assumed that all its activities came under the policy direction of the Govern-nient. If these activities were to be continued indefinitely, there was much to be said for conducting directly by a Government agency thoseof them which could not be left to universities and similar institutions.In further discussion doubts were expressed about the wisdom ofmaking any public announcement at the present time about the futureof the Council. The Cabinet thought it should suffice if a privateunderstanding were reached with the Council on the basis of therecommendations summarised in paragraph 3 of CP. (51) 231, as modified in the CabineFs discussion. The Secretary of State forScotland said that in that event he need not press the point of view which he had advanced.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the British Council should be con-tinued in being, as a non-official body, for some years tocome on the understanding that a comprehensive reviewof its work would be held not later than 1961.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials of the Treasury and the overseas Departments toconsider what minimum income the British Council could expect to receive over the next few years, and to investi-gate in this connection the possibility of effecting further reductions in the size of the CounciFs headquarters staff.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the light of the decisions reached in pursuance of the consultations to be held under conclusion (2) above, to discuss privately with the british council the basis on which they should plan their workover the next ten years.8. The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to review the decision,taken by the Production Committee on 27th July (P.C. (51) 18thMeeting, Minute 2), that a building licence should not be granted forthe construction of a new hotel in central London, which was to havebeen built with British capital and managed by the Hilton HotelsCorporation of America.
The President of the Board of Trade said that plans for the g.e.e-tion of this hotel were far advanced and the Hilton Hotels Corpora-tion were believed to have spent about  50,000 on the project. their plans had been known to a number of Departments, and they wouldcertainly take it amiss if, at this relatively late stage, a building licencewere withheld. In that event strong representations must be expected from the United States Embassy in London and from the economic co-operation Administration. The number of North Americanvisitors to the United Kingdom had been less this year than last, andit was well known that this was largely due to the shortage of first-class hotel accommodation in London. It was evident that in thecoming months the dollar balance would be one of the Governmentsmain preoccupations; and there could be no doubt that the construc-tion of this hotel would make a direct contribution towards the relief of our dollar, difficulties. For all these reasons he urged very strongly that the decision of the Production Committee should be reversed.The Prime Minister said that, as he understood it, the main reason for withholding a building licence for this project was theshortage of structural steel. Would it be possible to allow the projectto go forward if the United States interests concerned were able toarrange for the necessary steel to be imported from the United States?The Minister of Works said that there would also be serious difficulty in providing the labour required for this project. Therewas a grave shortage of building labour in south-east England, whichwas already delaying important constructional work urgently requiredin connection with the rearmament programme and the housing programme. The only hope of providing the labour required for urgent defence projects and constructional work in connection with new towns in this area was to draw surplus labour out of London.There would be no hope of doing this if large new building projectswere started in London; and the grant of a licence for constructionof this hotel would be wholly inconsistent with the policy approved bythe Production Committee for attracting building labour from Londoninto the south-eastern region. Owing to shortages of labour andstructural steel, steps were now being taken to defer the starting dates of building projects which had already been approved; and it wouldbe exceedingly difficult, to justify this policy if sanction were now given to a project of this magnitude in an area where restriction on building activities was specially necessary.In discussion the further point was made that the Governmentwould find it difficult politically to justify the grant of a licence forthe erection of a luxury hotel in London at a lime when the progressof their housing programme in various parts of the country was likelyto be delayed by shortages of labour and raw materials.Further discussion showed that opinion on this question was divided. The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthe balance of opinion in the Cabinet appeared to be that, in viewof the serious shortage of building labour in south-east England, itwould be inexpedient to allow this project to go forward at the presenttime. Every effort should, however, be made to avoid antagonisingthe Hilton Hotels Corporation. It should be explained to them thatin principle the Government were in favour of their managing a newhotel in Central London; that shortages of building labour andstructural steel, due to the heavy demands of the rearmament pro-gramme, made it impossible for them to allow this project to go forward at the present time; and that the Government might find it easier to allow the project to proceed at a somewhat later date if arrangements could be made to import the structural steel required from the United States.The Cabinet CD Reaffirmed the decision of the Production Committee that a building licence should not for the time being be granted
Persia. 9.   The Foreign Secretary said that on his return to Tehran,(Previous Mr. Harriman had held further discussions with the Persian Govern-Reference: ment, as a result of which he had submitted revised proposals for anCM. (51) 56th exchange of communications between the United Kingdom Govern-Conclusions, ment and the Persian Government, which he understood would be minute 5.) acceptable to the Persian Government. If these revised proposalsPersian were accepted, our communication would be in the terms of that proposal for a agreed with Mr. Harriman on 28th July (and contained in ForeignResumption of Office telegram to Tehran No. 927), except that it would refer to theNegotiations. Persian Governments &quot; formula &quot; for negotiation, instead of their proposals, and to relieving &quot; the present atmosphere &quot; instead of&quot; the present tension in the south.&quot; The Persians would state in reply that they were pleased that the United Kingdom Government had recognised the principle of nationalisation and were sending a mission;that the Persian Government recognised the essentiality, in theinterests of the success of the negotiations, of both Governmentscreating the best possible atmosphere; and that they would enter intothe negotiations in the same spirit of goodwill as the United KingdomGovernment.The Foreign Secretary said that this placed us in a difficult position. The communications would now contain no specific reference to an improvement in the conditions in South Persia, but mr. Harriman had made it clear that in his view we could obtain nofurther concession from the Persian Government and that we shouldbe well advised to agree and send out the mission before the situation deteriorated. Mr. Harriman believed that any further debate aboutthe wording of the communications would seriously prejudice theprospect of successful negotiations. The Foreign Secretary felt thaton balance we should agree to Mr. Harriman&apos;s proposal. Once themission was sent, there was a real chance of improvement in thesouth, which would be greatly strengthened by the Lord Privy Seal&apos;visit to that area. If we missed this opportunity to resume negotia-tions, there was a grave danger of antagonising the United StatesGovernment and world opinion generally.In discussion some Ministers drew attention to the disadvantages of accepting this proposal: the attitude of the Persian Governmentwhich it revealed did not hold out much hope for successful negotia-tions, and its acceptance would have an adverse effect on the morale ofthe Company&apos;s staff in the south. Although Mr. Harriman had donevaluable work in Tehran, the primary reason for the Persian Govern-menfs change of front had been their belated realisation that theywere unable themselves to operate the oil industry in Persia, and weshould not take it for granted that if we stood firm on our previousoffer they would not agree to it before long. A failure ofMr. Harriman&apos;s mission might not be disadvantageous to our interestsif the reason for the failure was clearly explained.The general view of the Cabinet was, however, that although there were serious disadvantages in accepting the proposal we shouldbe in a still more difficult situation if it were rejected. It was not unlikely that the position of the Persian Prime Minister was in facttoo precarious to allow him to admit that he was responsible for thedisorder in the south, and he might be better able to re-establish orderthere once the mission had been sent. Moreover, there were indi-cations that world opinion would turn against us if we declined this for the construction of a new hotel in central London tobe managed by the Hilton Hotels Corporation of America.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to explain tothe Hilton Hotels Corporation the reasons underlying theGovernments decision, on the general lines indicated bythe Prime Minister in summing up the cabinets discussion.
offer to resume negotiations. If the proposed exchange of notes tookplace, we could indicate publicly that in our view the creation of thebest possible atmosphere, which the Persian Government would haveadmitted to be essential, clearly depended upon an improvement of conditions in South Persia.The Cabinet agreed that the proposal should be accepted, andthat in replying to Mr. Harriman we should add that we understoodthat he had made it clear to the Persian Government that in our viewrelief of the tension in the south was the most appropriate means ofsecuring the best possible atmosphere for the negotiations. Theexchange of communications would not be made public until it was certain that the Persian Government would accept the wording ofboth the messages proposed by Mr. Harriman, and when ourcommunication was formally sent it should be made clear that thePersian formula mentioned was the formula on nationalisation whichwas contained in Tehran telegram No. 925 of 24th July, and was basedon the Persian law of March 1951.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform Mr. Harriman of our acceptance of his proposals on the lines agreed in discussion.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Lord Privy Seal said that in discussing the position withhim Mr. Harriman had made it clear that he was prepared to accepta breakdown in the negotiations if the Persian Government continuedto be unreasonable. In that event the Mussadiq Government wouldprobably fall and might be replaced by a new regime with which asatisfactory agreement would more easily be reached.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it seemed very probable that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) as suchwould not be able to remain in control of the operations in Persiaunder any new agreement concluded with the Persian Government.It should be possible to make alternative arrangements which wouldbe financially satisfactory, but the A.I.O.C. would be able to retainonly a partial and indirect control. The Lord Privy Seal said that theA.I.O.C. were already aware of this probable development and thatthey had virtually accepted it as inevitable. The Prime Minister saidthat consideration should be given to the possibility of associatingIndia, Pakistan and possibly Turkey with any new joint companyformed to operate in Persia.(c) The Lord Privy Seal said that in his speech in the Debate on30th July the Prime Minister had referred to a partnership between ourselves and the Persians under which we would supply the technical knowledge and the Persians would &quot; manage the industry in theinterests of all.&quot; He assumed that the Prime Minister had then hadin mind only a very general supervision by the Persian Government,and had visualised that the day-to-day control of the operations would remain in the hands of a non-Persian company. The PrimeMinister said that this was his understanding of what we should seek to obtain.Payment by The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their last meetingthe A.I.O.C.    the Cabinet had invited him to give guidance to the A.I.O.C. in theto the Persian  light of the Law Officers&apos; views, on the question of a payment by themGovernment.    to the Persian Government, amounting to about  1 million, due tobe made on 31st July.  He had consulted the Solicitor-General, whohad furnished advice to the Company&apos;s legal advisers which had enabled the Company to make the payment;The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the Chancellor^ statement.
Persian The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not propose toDealings proceed for the time being with the issue of the Order controllingin Sterling.      Persian dealings in sterling unless there was evidence that the PersianGovernment intended to make improper use of the sterling which they held in London.Exports The President of the Board of Trade said that two ships carryingto Persia. steel rails to Persia were due to reach Basra on 4th August, and itwould be necessary to decide within the next forty-eight hours whether their cargoes should be sent through to Persia and also whether export licences for further consignments should be withheld. If the PersianGovernment agreed to the resumption of negotiations on the termsnow approved by the Cabinet, and the mission was sent, he recom-mended that the licences should be granted and that no action shouldbe taken at Basra to prevent the earlier consignments from reachingPersia. He proposed, however, to delay the granting of the licencesuntil it was clear that the mission would proceed, and if this was not clear when the two ships reached Basra on 4th August he would arrange for the unloading of the shipments there.The Cabinet (3) Approved the action proposed by the President of the Boardof Trade.Broadcasting. 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theReport of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Postmaster-Broadcasting General (CP. (51) 232) inviting them to reach final decisions on theCommittee. points in the White Paper on the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s Report(Previous (Cmd. 8291) which had attracted criticism in the ParliamentaryReference:       debates.CM.
