Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in      the House of Commons in the following week.the House It had been proposed that after 7 p.m. on 1st August there should of Commons, be a debate on the New Valuation Lists.. The Government might,however, be pressed to find time during the week for further discus-sion of various issues of Privilege which had not yet been finallydisposed of. One of these was to be discussed at a meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party that evening. The Cabinet consideredhow these matters could best be handled; and it was their general view that it would be preferable to allow the House of Commons to debate them on 1st August in lieu of the proposed debate on the NewValuation Lists.If all necessary business had been cleared, Parliament would be adjourned for the summer Recess on 2nd August and wouldreassemble on 16th October.Profit Margins 2. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, whenof Retail the Economic Policy Committee had discussed on 19th July the profitGrocers. margins of retail grocers, it had apparently been alleged that it wasthe practice of the Co-operative Societies to include in their costs apreconceived level of members&apos; dividends and it had been suggestedthat the Societies should not be allowed to increase their retail prices for the purpose of enabling them to continue to pay relatively highdividends to their members (E.P.C. (51) 17th Meeting, Minute 2).This suggestion was, in his view, misconceived and he did not wishit to pass unconnected.The Prime Minister invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster to send him a note of his comments on this point so thathe, as Chairman, might bring it before a later meeting of the economic policy Committee.Persia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 54thConclusions,Minute 1.)Persian offer to resume negotiations.410373. The Foreign Secretary said that the offer by the PersianGovernment to re-open negotiations in the oil dispute was a most encouraging development in the situation. The Persian Governmenthad made two substantial concessions to our point of view, in thatthey were now prepared to negotiate with a mission sent by theUnited Kingdom Government to represent the interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and they had accepted the principle that undernationalisation oil operations should be carried out under their authority and not directly by themselves. Unfortunately, however,there was no sign that interference with the Company&apos;s property and staff was decreasing, and recent telegrams from South Persia indicated that the morale of the staff was deteriorating. Mr. Harriman was anxious that we should send a mission to Tehran led by a Minister,with as little delay as possible, and the United States Governmenthad also urged us to do so. The Foreign Secretary said that he had pointed out in reply to these representations that, before a mission was sent, the Persian Government must do something to improve theposition in the south; but Mr. Harriman, while willing to put thispoint and our other requirements in general terms to the Persians,regarded them as outside the scope of his mission and as being more suitable for a direct approach by the United Kingdom Government.The Foreign Secretary said that the Persian offer represented inprinciple a basis on which negotiations could be resumed, and thatwe should not, if possible, lose the opportunity of sending a Minis-terial mission to Tehran. It was, however, necessary to consider what were the prerequisites for the despatch of such a mission. Itwas clear that the Persian Government must give us some assurance-2 b 2
about stopping their interference with the Company&apos;s staff, and thequestion also arose of restoring operational control to the Company.This last would not be easy to secure as a prior condition for sending a mission, and he felt that on balance we should demand only onesuch condition, namely, the undertaking to end interference with thestaff in the oilfields and in Abadan.If it was agreed that a mission should be sent, we should againpostpone the withdrawal of staff from the oilfields, and it might bedesirable to explain the position fully to the Company, in order tosupport the morale of their staff in Persia, and ensure that they stoodfirm for the time being and refrained from giving public expression to their reasonable dissatisfaction at the treatment they were receivingfrom the Persian Government.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that theoffer of the Persian Government should not be rejected, and that pre-reparations should at once be made for the despatch of a mission toTehran. The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to decide, in con-sultation with the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer, which Minister should lead the mission.In discussing the prior conditions necessary for the despatch ofa mission some Ministers suggested that, in order to avoid the humili-ating loss of prestige which would follow from an immediate failure to reach agreement, we should secure before the mission left a definiteundertaking from the Persian Government that all interference withthe Company&apos;s staff would cease, and evidence that their instructionsto this effect were being carried out. It was suggested that the PersianGovernment should recall Mr. Makki from the South, where his activities were making it inevitable that the staff should be withdrawnfrom the oilfields in the very near future. It was also argued thatthe negotiations could. not be conducted satisfactorily until theCompany had regained control of their operations, and that a Persianundertaking not to put forward unacceptable proposals about tankerreceipts should be obtained. While we could not hope for a completereturn to the status quo, we could insist that the Persian Governmentshould conform with the principles of the decision of the international court as a condition for the resumption of negotiations.On the other hand, the view was expressed that, so long as thePersian Government undertook to send immediate instructions thatinterference with the Company&apos;s staff should be stopped, we shouldnot delay the despatch of a mission. Those instructions might notin fact be fully carried out, but it would be unwise to risk losing theopportunity of negotiations which the Persian Government had nowoffered under United States pressure. We had accepted the principleof nationalisation, and there now appeared to be a real prospect of negotiating a settlement on this basis, under which the oil operations would remain in British hands. A refusal to enter into negotiations would deprive us of United States support, and would lead to theCompany&apos;s being driven out of Persia, since the staff would be willingto work under Persian ownership only if the operation of the industryremained under British control.After further discussion it was generally agreed that the issue bythe Persian Government of instructions to stop interference with theCompany&apos;? staff need be the only prerequisite for the despatch of a mission, and that a reply to this effect should be sent forthwith to thePersian Government. At the same time, however, His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tehran should be instructed to explain to the PersianGovernment informally that, unless their instructions were effectivelycarried out and interference was ended, the negotiations could not be successful and the mission would be obliged to return to this country;and that we should regard the recall of Mr. Makki as valuableevidence of their intentions in this respect. Mr. Harriman shouldalso be invited once more to impress upon the Persian Government
industrial disputes.Conditions ofEmploymentand NationalArbitrationOrder.(previous reference:CM. (51) 54thConclusions.Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (51) 221) and the Attorney-General (CP. (51) 224) onthe draft of an Industrial Disputes Order which would take the placeof the Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order,1940.The Minister of Labour said that, under the new Order, theprohibition of strikes and lockouts would be entirely repealed. - Theright to report disputes to the new Tribunal would be confined onthe one hand to employers and employers&apos; organisations and on theother to trade unions, and in practice break-away unions would be excluded. The effect of the new Order would be to reduce arbitration by the National Tribunal, since a dispute which had already been thesubject of an agreement or arbitration could not subsequently be dealt41037-2 b 3the importance of their compliance with the principles underlying thedecision of the International Court.The Cabinet (.1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Persian Govern-ment that we welcomed their offer to resume negotiations,and that, we were willing to send a Ministerial mission toTehran provided that they gave instructions that all inter-ference with the staff of the Anglo-Iranian Oil company in Persia should cease.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to impress upon the PersianGovernment informally, on the lines agreed in discussion,the importance, if the negotiations were to be successful,of the effective carrying out of these instructions.(3) Subject to a satisfactory reply from the Persian Government,invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the despatchof a mission to Tehran, headed by a Minister.(4) Agreed that the choice of a Minister to lead the mission should be left to the Prime Minister, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer.(5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should explain the position fully to their staff in Persia, urging them to stand firm at theirposts pending the outcome of the resumed negotiations.Exports The President of the Board of Trade said that the Cabinet hadto Persia. agreed on 23rd July that exports to Persia should continue to be held up for the time being, and that if necessary the consignors and shippersshould be indemnified for any breach of their contracts. Apart fromthe consignments of steel rails and sugar, various. minor shipments of materials which were not scarce were also being held up. He feltthat in view of the new developments in the situation these might now be allowed to leave, and it was for consideration whether the steel rails and sugar need be delayed further if a mission were sentto Tehran. He understood that the most recent shipment of sugarhad been allowed to leave on the understanding that, if necessary,steps could be taken to prevent it from reaching Persia, but, unlikeother consignments which had been allowed to leave on the sameunderstanding, the sugar had ceased to be British property when itwas loaded, and it might not be possible to requisition it en route.The Cabinet  (6) Agreed that minor exports of goods to Persia should not befurther delayed, and that the consignments of steel railsand sugar should be allowed to leave as soon as it wasdecided that a mission should be sent to Tehran.
with under the provisions of the Order. There would be no penalsanctions. If the Cabinet approved the draft Order it would be madein the following week and laid before Parliament, but there would beno opportunity to debate it until after the recess.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Professional bodies, such as the Society of Town Clerks,would probably not be able to avail themselves of the arbitrationprocedure provided under the draft Order, but they probably could,without difficulty, adapt their organisation so that it ranked as a trade union. It was undesirable that local authorities should be obliged to honour the findings of an arbitration tribunal in regard tothe salaries to be paid in respect of senior appointments which the holders had accepted on the basis of an advertised salary, but anysafeguard introduced into the Order with a view to preventing profes-sional organisations from ranking as trade unions might prejudice the general right of workers to organise themselves in unions.(b) At the suggestion of the Minister of Labour, the british employers.&apos; Confederation had agreed to consider favourably a sug-gestion that two or three members of the employers&apos; panel for thenew Tribunal should be drawn from nationalised industries. Theonly condition they were likely to stipulate was that these membersof the panel should not be called upon to adjudicate in casesconcerning private industry. An arrangement on these lines would meet the point which had been raised on behalf of the nationalised industries without involving the disadvantages likely to follow from a specific reference to nationalised industries in the draft Order.The Cabinet Approved the draft of the Industrial Disputes Order 1951,appended to CP. (51) 221.5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofTransport (CP, (51) 215), the Minister of Labour (CP. (51) 219), theMinister: of Defence (CP. (51) 223) and the Minister of Fuel and power (CP. (51) 226) on a proposal that a limited measure of defer-ment from call-up under the National Service Acts should be given torailwaymen in key grades at certain places vital to railway operation.The Minister of Transport said that he recognised the force ofthe views put forward by the Minister of Defence and the Ministerof Labour, and he had submitted his proposal for a limited defermentof railway workers with great reluctance. At the same time thenumbers involved were not very large, and he felt that the Govern-ment should make this concession at a time when the railway executive and the unions were examining drastic proposals: for meeting the labour shortage on the railways. There was, at present,the gravest risk that the railways would be unable to handle-the freight traffic which would be offering in the coming autumn and winter;and, if traffic began to pile up in marshalling yards, the measureswhich would then have to be taken would be far more drasjic than if anticipatory action were taken now- The Services, would lose, far more heavily if essential production were held up through transport difficulties than through the loss of the 3,000 railwaymen who. wouldbe deferred under his proposal. Admittedly, the drift to, other employment might continue, but those who were deferred could onlyretain deferment while they remained in railway employment^ andthe prospect of deferment should, make railway employment more attractive.british railways.Man-power position.(previous reference:CM. (51) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)
The Minister of Labour said that it was the principle of universalliability that had won parliamentary and public approval for theintroduction of national service in time of peace. The exception for agriculture was about to be withdrawn; and the coalmining industry,which would then be the only exception to the principle of univer-sality, was widely recognised as deserving exceptional treatment. Ifthe operating grades on the railways were given deferment there wouldbe irresistible pressure from other branches of industry, notably fromfirms engaged on essential war production. It had, moreover, to beborne in mind that the call-up was not yielding to the Armed forces the numbers that they required. He thought it would be wrong to entertain the suggestion that the making of staff economies in therailways could in any way be made dependent on the grant by theGovernment of a measure of deferment. In their evidence before theCourt of Enquiry which had examined the wage claim put forward by the railway unions the Railway Executive had used arguments which were inconsistent with those now advanced in favour of ameasure of deferment. There appear to be room for substantial economies in railway staffing, and the Court of Enquiry had drawnparticular attention to the wastages which occurred under the presentrules governing lodging turns of duty.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was seriously con-cerned about the prospective shortage of house coal in the comingautumn and winter. Stocks were far below those available last year.The consumption of coal generally was going up; and, if greater out-put were secured to match consumption, it was essential that the rail-ways should be able to move it. In the long term he believed that increased use of braked freight trains was one of the main means bywhich the railways could handle increased freight traffic.The Minister of Defence said that the Minister of Transport wasasking for the deferment of sufficient men to form an infantry brigade.The Services could not afford this loss, at a time when the call-up wasfailing to provide the numbers they required. He agreed with theMinister of Labour about the need to preserve the universality of the call-up; and even among railway workers the proposal that defermentshould be confined to men working at certain centres would causeacute discontent. He was, however, willing to examine the proposal that railwaymen called up should, after basic training, be returned tothe railways on reserve.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The most effective opportunity to secure staff economies,particularly in regard to lodging turns, would have been to make thegrant of a wages increase in February 1951 conditional on the unionsco-operating to secure greater efficiency. The Cabinet had, however,considered that the serious consequences of any railway dispute which led to a stoppage of work were too great to make it desirable to insist on the wage increase being linked with measures to secure greater efficiency. The Railway Executive were making every endeavour to cut out staff redundancies.(b) Labour shortages were arising in most of the basic industries and services, and it might be desirable to have a general discussionwith the Trades Union Congress General Council about the means bywhich a more efficient use of labour resources could be secured. Ifthe matter were taken up with the General Council, they were likelyto refer to the allegations of large increases in the office staffs of nationalised industries.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be undesirable to defer railway workers from call-up to national service in the Armed Forces.
(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for officials toexamine urgently the proposal (paragraphs 27 to 30 of thememorandum annexed to CP. (51) 215) that railwaymenwho were called up should, after basic training, bereturned to the railways on reserve.Emigration 6.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of StatePolicy. for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 218) and the Minister ofAssisted Labour (CP. (51) 225) regarding the renewal of the Assisted PassagePassage Agreement for emigrants to Australia.Agreement jne Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that hiswith Australia, conversations with the Acting High Commissioner for Australia had(Previous        been based on the Cabinet&apos;s earlier conclusion of 28th June that the reference:      system of assisted passages should be brought progressively to anCM. (51) 47th  end.  It seemed unreasonable that the United Kingdom GovernmentConclusions,    should continue in present circumstances to pay people to emigrateMinute 5.)      from this, country; and there was some risk that, so long as thisAgreement continued, New Zealand and possibly Canada might askfor similar facilities.  The Prime Minister of Australia had recentlystated that his Government might have to reduce their expenditure on immigration as part of their campaign against inflation; and in that event the Australian arguments for continuing the Agreement would lose much of their force. This therefore seemed a favourable moment for reducing the scale of our expenditure under the Agreement, andannouncing our intention to bring the whole scheme progressively toan end over the next three years.  It now seemed unlikely that theAustralian Government would be able to increase their contribution towards the cost of the emigrant ships by  100,000 a year, as suggestedin paragraph 2 (e) of CP. (51) 218. The Secretary of State therefore proposed that the amount of the financial assistance given to indi-vidual emigrants by the United Kingdom Government should bereduced from  25 to  10, and that the total expenditure of the UnitedKingdom Government under the scheme should be made subject toan annual limit of  250,000.In discussion it was argued, in favour of this proposal, that it wasanomalous that the United Kingdom Government should be financingemigration at a time when there was a high level of employment inthis country and many of its key industries were short of man-power.The policy of assisting emigration had been adopted at a time when there was large-scale unemployment in this country, and the situation was now very different. Moreover, emigrants to Australia were finding that conditions there were unsatisfactory, and numbers ofthem were seeking to return to this country.On the other side emphasis was laid on the importance of pre-serving, in the population of Australia, a due proportion of peopleof Anglo-Saxon stock. Although this was an asset to Australia andthe Australian Government ought themselves to be willing to meetthe major part of the financial cost of securing it, the United KingdomGovernment should not affront public opinion in Australia by with-drawing two precipitately their co-operation in this scheme. It wasthe general view of the Cabinet that these considerations warranted a somewhat larger financial contribution by the United Kingdom thanthat suggested by the Secretary of State.The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to offer to renew the Assisted Passage Agreementwith Australia for a period of, three years from 30th March,1951, on the basis that the assistance given to an individualemigrant would be reduced from  25 to  10 and that thetotal United Kingdom expenditure would be subject to anupper limit of  500,000 a year.
7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (51) 217) proposing further measures to strengthen theworks&apos; staff of the Service Departments.The Minister of Defence said that the measures hithertoauthorised had proved insufficient to secure the necessary increase inthese staffs and it was clear that, unless more drastic steps were now taken, the Service Departments would be unable to carry through the programmes of new works and maintenance which the Cabinet had approved as part of the rearmament programme. He therefore urged the Cabinet to authorise the additional measures summarised inparagraph 10 of his memorandum.The Cabinet discussed each of these proposals in turn.The first proposal was that the Treasury should operate a schemeof compulsory secondment of works&apos; staff, by which Departmentsengaged on other work would be called upon to make available forimmediate secondment to Departments engaged on defence workapproved percentages of their existing staff for periods not exceeding three years. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would beprepared to operate such a scheme if the Cabinet gave it firm support and approved the general principles on which the Treasury should determine which Departments were to be asked to second staff to defence work. The first principle, he suggested, should be that departments whose capital investment programme had been reducedshould surrender a corresponding proportion of their works&apos; staff.The second principle was that all work not immediately appertainingto the rearmament programme should be regarded as civil work forthis purpose, so that staff engaged on it would be available for second-ment to defence work. In discussion it was suggested that coal production and food production were essential to rearmament, andthat works&apos; staff engaged on opencast coal production or agriculturalbuilding programmes should be regarded as exempt from this scheme.The Cabinet agreed, however, that no such absolute exemptions couldbe contemplated. Departments would be free to represent to theTreasury the consequences of withdrawing staff engaged on suchprogrammes; but the scheme must be operated on the general principle that all work not immediately appertaining to the rearmament -ment programme should be regarded as civil work for this purpose.The second proposal was that Departments should suspendrecruitment of works&apos; staff for civil work. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that absolute suspension of recruitment would be inappropriate: some provision would have to be made for continuingrecruitment by Departments whose staff fell below the numbersneeded to carry on essential work, e.g., telephones.. Recruitment of established works&apos; staff was, however, organised centrally, and theCivil Service Commission could be instructed to ensure that defence work had first priority in the allocation of newly-recruited establishedstaff though, in the last resort, individual candidates could not be compelled to accept appointment in one Department rather than another. It would, however, be necessary to provide that temporary staff within these grades should not in future be recruited for civil work without specific authority from the Treasury.The third proposal was that an interim award should be madeon salary scales pending the receipt of the report of the GardinerCommittee. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this report was likely to be presented in the course of the next few days; and inthose circumstances he suggested that no interim measures need beconsidered.The fourth proposal was for a scheme of secondment of staff from local authority employment to the Service Departments.The Minister of Local Government said that he favoured this pro-posal in principle, though means would have to be found of ensuringDefence.Staff for service works programme.(Previous -Reference:CM. (51) 49thConclusions,Minute 6.)
that it did not prejudice the Governments housing programme.The Minister of Works said that this decision made it no less neces-sary that Departments should continue to press forward, in accord-ance with the decision taken by the Production Committee on 29thMay, with plans for reducing the demands for technical staff bymodifying approved standards of work.The fifth proposal was that special bounties should be paid to temporary staff or, alternatively, that extended use should be madeof staff hired from private firms at a premium over the normal salary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he preferred the second ofthese alternatives.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theTreasury to operate a scheme for seconding works&apos; staff from civil Departments to Service Departments, on thegeneral principles approved in the Cabinets discussion.(2) Agreed that until further notice Departments should notrecruit temporary staff for civil works programmes with-out Treasury authority; and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for the Civil Service Commission togive first priority to defence work in allocating to Depart-ments works&apos; staff newly recruited in established grades.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forprompt consideration to be given to the recommendations to be made by the Gardiner Committee.(4) Invited the Minister of Local Government and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to devise, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, a scheme for the secondment ofworks&apos; staff from local authority employment to service departments.(5) Invited the &quot;Service Ministers, in consultation where necessary with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for the extended use of works&apos; staff hired from private firms.Merchandise 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMarks. President of the Board of Trade (CP. (51) 204) proposing the amend-ment of the existing legislation relating to merchandise marks, with aview to removing certain anomalies and defects in the present Actsand giving additional protection to the customer against false or mis-leading marking of goods.It was suggested in discussion that the fine for a first offenceshould be raised beyond the proposed maximum of  50, but thegeneral view of Ministers was in favour of retaining the maximumproposed in the memorandum.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP.
