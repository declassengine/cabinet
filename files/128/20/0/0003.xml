Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in      the House, of Commons in the following week,the House The Opposition had not been willing to accept the Governmentsof Commons, suggestion of a three-day debate in which the House would be freeta hold a wide-ranging discussion on the international situation, theneed for rearmament and its impact on the national economy. Theyhad asked for a single day&apos;s debate on the report of the estimates committee on Rearmament, and this would be held on 23rd July.There would, however, be a general debate on foreign affairs on25th July, and a debate on the financial and economic situation on26th July. In addition, a debate on the Middle East would be heldin the next following week, on 30th July.Forestry The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had tabled aBill. number of amendments for discussion on the Report Stage of the forestry Bill. One of these would have the effect of requiring theMinister to give evidence, through one of his officers, at a localenquiry. This was objectionable in principle, since a Minister wasaccountable in such matters only to Parliament. A similar amend-ment had been defeated on the Committee Stage, and it was possibletherefore that this amendment would not be called on the report stage. If, however, it were called and were carried, it would prob-ably be necessary for the Government to abandon the Bill.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it had beensuggested to him by the Treasury that a declaratory provision mightbe inserted in this Bill for the purpose of removing doubts which had arisen regarding the power to make grants to the Duchy of Lancasterin connection with the scheme for the dedication of woodlands.The Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterto take immediate steps to obtain an opinion from the Law officers on this point.Mr- John On 3rd July Mr. John Lewis, M.P., when making his way to the lewis, M.P. House of Commons by car, had been delayed by traffic at the entrance to Hyde Park and, as a result of his efforts to extricate himself fromthe traffic, he had now been summoned to appear at MarylebonePolice Court on 12th September to answer charges of driving withoutreasonable consideration, refusing to stop and obstructing a policeofficer. After an unsuccessful attempt had been made to raise thismatter in the House of Commons as involving a question of privilege, Members of all Parties had now put their names to a motionasking for the appointment of a Select Committee to enquire into thematter. The Cabinet were asked to consider whether the Govern-ment should find time for the discussion of this motion.There was general agreement that, while it was desirable thatthe motion should be rejected, it would be inexpedient to seek toprevent its being discussed. The Cabinet agreed that the House ofCommons should be enabled to discuss the motion one day in thefollowing week, after 10 p.m.; and invited the Home Secretary andthe Chief Whip to consider on which day it would be most convenient to take this business.Broadcasting.Report ofBroadcastingCommittee.(previous reference:CM. (51) 49thConclusions,Minute 4.)410362. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat a substantial volume of public criticism was being directed against two points in the White Paper on the report of the Broad-casting Committee, viz., the composition of the proposed broadcasting councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the proposal that the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) should receive only85 per cent, of the net licence revenue. He therefore asked whether,in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons, the proposals inthe White Paper on these points should be presented as firm Govern-ment decisions or as provisional proposals which were open to modification in the light of the views expressed in the debate.-3 b 2
In discussion some doubt was expressed about the expediency ofinsisting, against strong opposition, upon the particular method sug-gested in the White Paper for selecting the members of the proposedBroadcasting Councils. There were, however, stronger reasons foradhering to the proposal that the B.B.C. should not retain the wholeof the net licence revenue.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Postmaster-General, who would be speaking on theGovernments behalf in the forthcoming debate, to make it plain that before reaching final decisions on the recommen-dations of the Broadcasting Committee the Governmentwould be prepared to take into account the views expressedin the debate.supplementary pensions in industry.(previous reference:CM. (51) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (5.1) 206) proposing that, notwith-standing the opposition of the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress, the Government should appoint a departmental committeeof experienced persons to enquire into the general problems presented by supplementary pensions schemes.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that a year ago the Cabinet had agreed that a departmental committee should beset up, but the committee had not yet been constituted because of theopposition of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.The grant of a supplementary pensions scheme for the miningindustry had sharpened the demand in other industries for similarschemes; and, since in socialised industries these schemes had to be approved by the responsible Minister, it was important that theGovernment should have authoritative guidance on the difficult problems which these schemes presented. The latest discussion withrepresentatives of the General Council had shown that the council was by no means unanimous in its opposition to an enquiry; and, asthe Government had said that an enquiry was required and the needfor an enquiry had become more and not less urgent, the socialisation of Industries Committee had decided to advise the Cabinet to proceedwith the enquiry. A full statement of the Governments reasons for doing so should be sent to the General Council, and it was hopedthat, faced with a firm Government decision, they would agree tohelp.There was general agreement that a departmental committeeshould be set up without further delay. It was suggested that, in theletter which was to be sent to them, the General Council should beasked to suggest persons who might serve on the committee torepresent the standpoint of the industrial workers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a departmental committee should be set up to enquire into the general problems presented by supple-mentary pensions schemes.(2) Approved the draft letter and explanatory memorandum tothe General Council of the Trades Union Congress,appended to CP. (51) 206, subject to the amendmentsuggested in the Cabinefs discussion.Persia. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous President of the Board of Trade (CP. (51) 210) regarding the stepsReference: which might be taken to prevent consignments of steel rails, sugar and cm. (51) 52nd other goods from reaching Persia.  Some shipments had already leftConclusions, the United Kingdom and others were due to leave during the&quot; nextMinute 1.) few days.
Exports fromthe UnitedKingdom.financial measures.withdrawal from the oilfields.military matters.The Secretary for Overseas Trade said that the paper put forwardtwo alternative courses of action, prohibition of- further exports orpermission to continue shipments on the understanding that steps would, if necessary, be taken to prevent the goods from reachingPersia. Even if the latter course were adopted, a certain amount of publicity could not be avoided. It now appeared that goods alreadyen route for Persia would have to be requisitioned by the UnitedKingdom Government if they were to be prevented from reachingPersia.It was the general view of the Cabinet that a decision on thismatter should be postponed for a few days until more was known about the result of Mr. Harriman&apos;s mission to Persia, and about thePersian reaction to our decision to withdraw the British staff of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company from the oilfields. In the meantime thepresent delaying tactics should be continued, with as little publicity aspossible; and, if it was necessary to allow ships to sail, the Depart-ments concerned should make the preparations needed to prevent the cargoes from being landed in Persia if it were subsequently decidedthat this should be prevented.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in collaboration with the other Ministers concerned, to continue for thetime being to delay the shipment of exports from theUnited Kingdom to Persia on the lines agreed in the cabinet&apos;s discussion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a Bill was now beforethe Majlis whose passage would enable the Persian Government tomake use of the sterling which they held in London as a reserve fortheir currency. It was not yet clear to what extent we should wishto prevent the Persian Government from doing this; but, in order tobe in a position when the Bill was passed to take any action whichhe thought appropriate, he proposed to prepare an Order-in-council under the Exchange Control Act, 1947, for issue as soon as it was clear that the Bill would become law. which would prohibit all Persiandealings in sterling except with our permission. The application ofthis Order would protect the Bank of England from a formal breach of their Memorandum of Understanding with the Bank Melli.The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval of the Chancellors statement.The Prime Minister said that on the previous day the group ofMinisters which was watching developments in Persia had agreed thatthe withdrawal of the British staff of the Anglo-Iranian Oil company from the oilfields could no longer be delayed. Subject to the views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tehran on the timing of an announce-ment, the Foreign Secretary would announce this decision in theHouse of Commons, and communicate it to the Persian Government,on the following day. The withdrawal would begin two or three days later, but it had been-felt desirable to give the Persian Governmentsufficient notice in advance to enable them to give the necessaryprotection to the British staff. He had informed the Leaders of theConservative Opposition of this proposal, and they were in generalagreement with it. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s -announcement wouldmake it clear that there was at present no question of an evacuation from Abadan.The Prime Minister said that the announcement of the withdrawal from the oilfields, or the carrying out of the withdrawal, might possibly result in disturbances in Southern Persia or in obstruction bythe Persian Government, and steps were being taken to put into execution at short notice the military operation for the protection ofBritish lives at Abadan. The force available was now sufficiently large to hold the island for a time, even against Persian opposition,and the force sent in for the purpose of protecting the British staff
would thus be able, if desired, to protect the continuing operationof the refinery. &apos; The Cabinet would, however, wish to give furtherconsideration to the general position in Persia and the Middle Eastbefore sanctioning military action for any purpose other than theprotection of Britisli lives, if this was made necessary through Persianfailure to carry out their obligations.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Livestock 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerand Meat. of Local Government and Planning (CP. (51) 202) submitting for theSlaughtering approval of the Cabinet recommendations by the Cabinet CommitteePolicy. on Distribution and Marketing in regard to slaughtering policy andraising the question whether the preparation of a national siting plan should be undertaken by the Minister of Food or by a centralslaughtering authority jointly responsible to the Minister of Food andthe Agriculture Ministers.The Minister of Local Government said that the Committee onDistribution and Marketing proposed a moderate concentration ofslaughtering, in preference to the very dispersed slaughtering whichhad existed before the war or to extreme concentration in a few verylarge abattoirs. But any concentration of slaughtering would makeit necessary to set up some central control of the number and siting of slaughterhouses. The majority of his Committee considered thatthis central control should be exercised by the Minister of Food, andthis arrangement had the additional advantage that it did not require any immediate legislation. The Minister of Agriculture, on the otherhand, favoured the appointment of an ad hoc central slaughteringauthority which would be responsible jointly to the Minister of food and to the Agriculture Ministers. An emergency building programme was proposed for the construction in the next few years of 24slaughterhouses in the areas where they were urgently required, with provision for at least seven in the year 1952; but the rate of progress would depend on the general financial position and on the investment programme. Where local authorities or other appropriate bodieswere unwilling to undertake this new construction, it would have tobe done by the Ministry of Works, in conjunction with the Ministryof Food.The Minister of Agriculture said that he favoured the establish-ment of a non-trading central slaughtering authority because hethought that a body of this kind would be able to reach agreementwith local authorities and the other interests concerned more easilyand more speedily than the Ministry of Food. In any event it seemed likely that a planning authority of this kind would be required inthe long run and it would be better to set it up without delay. Ifthe Cabinet wished to avoid immediate legislation, the precedent ofthe White Fish Authority could be followed and the slaughteringauthority set up on a provisional basis.The Minister of Food said that his Department were competent, to exercise the necessary central control over the number and siting of slaughterhouses. They had a great deal of experience and hadthe necessary contacts with the various interests concerned. Anadditional piece of machinery would be expensive and he would find it difficult to discharge his responsibilities for meat rationing if issues which would affect his ability to honour the meat ration were beingdecided by a semi-independent body.The general view of the Cabinet was against the setting up of a central slaughtering authority and in favour of leaving this responsi-bility with the Minister of Food. It was felt to be undesirable to setup yet another public authority, particularly since its work wouldbe of a planning rather than of an executive character. If the Minister
Defence.ServiceRetired Pay.(previous reference :CM. (50) 53rdConclusions.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (51) 203) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (51) 207) on the increases in retired pay and pensions whichshould be granted to senior officers of the three Services.The Minister of Defence said that he was in agreement with theChancellor of the Exchequer about the retired pay to be grantedto Colonels and officers of lower rank. In regard to Field-Marshalsand ranks down to Brigadiers, he proposed a rather higher level of retired pay than the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The differenceswere not large and the total cost to the Exchequer was small. he feared, however, that there would be a widespread sense of grievanceamong senior officers if the rates proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer were adopted, particularly since the most senior officers would contrast the pension provision made in their case with thepensions accorded to senior civil servants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the main point at issue was whether, in addition to increases in retired pay which could properly be made because of increases in the rates of Service pay,the proportion of retired pay to pay should also be increased. he saw no reason for doing more than to restore the relativities of retired pay to pay which had previously existed. He doubted whether anyvalid argument could be based on a comparison with the pensionsreceived by permanent secretaries and other civil servants, sinceService officers normally retired at an earlier age and only the mostsenior officers worked over prolonged periods with sufficiently close contact with civil servants to invite comparisons of this kind.In further discussion attention was drawn, on the one hand, tothe objection on general grounds to increasing in part of the field the proportion which pension bore to pay and, on the other hand,to the undesirability of leaving serving officers with any legitimateground for a sense of grievance when the sums involved were relatively small.The Cabinet-Approved the rates of retired pay for officers set out in column (3) (a) of Annex B to CP. (51) 203.InformationPolicy.(previous reference :CM. (51) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 179)drawing attention to the need for a renewed and vigorous informationcampaign in this country.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthere was a real risk that Government policies might be frustratedby public uncertainty and confusion about the need for rearmament.of Food wished for advice from an outside body he could set up an advisory committee. Attention was drawn to the desirability of inducing local authorities to build slaughterhouses under theemergency building programme in view of their successful adminis-tration of this service in the past and the need to give them freshresponsibilities to counterbalance the functions which they had lost in recent years. The assistance of the co-operative societies wouldalso be valuable.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 14 (i), (ii) and (iv)-(vii)of CP. (51) 202.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Food should be responsible forthe central control of the number and siting of slaughter-houses and that an ad hoc central slaughtering authority should not be set up.
He hoped therefore that Ministers would play their full part in bringing home to the public, in their speeches, the nature and import-ance of the Soviet threat to the peace of the world and the urgency of the need to strengthen the defences of the western democraciesagainst this menace to their freedom. He drew attention to theservices which could be rendered by the group of officials mentionedin paragraph 14 of his memorandum in providing Ministers withmaterial for such speeches.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with the analysis of the situation made in CP. (51) .179 and with the pro-posals there outlined for dealing with that situation. The followingparticular points were made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion:  (a) Ministers must play the leading part in this campaign ofpublic education on the need for rearmament. Newspaper reportsof Ministers&apos; speeches were not, however, always very full andafforded only a transitory record. . It would be useful therefore ifsonle of the more important speeches could be reproduced inpamphlet form by the. Labour Party or the trade unions.(b) Other types of pamphlet might also be used with good effect.A pamphlet had been drawn up, for use by officers in the armed forces in educating their men, in discussion groups and otherwise,about the nature of the Soviet regime and Soviet aims.(c) The Minister of Defence suggested that it would be useful if an authoritative factual statement could be made about the extentof Soviet rearmament. This would provide a justification for our defence policy. He had given instructions for the draft of such astatement to be prepared. There was general agreement that itwould be valuable if more could be said, with Ministerial authority,about the military strength of the Soviet Union.(d) It would also be valuable if more factual information couldbe given about our own military strength and the progress of ourrearmament. In particular, it would be useful if. our effort could be stated more in terms of numbers of men and equipment and lessin terms of financial expenditure. Ministers should review thesecurity objections which had previously limited the amount ofinformation published about the strength of the Armed Forces.(e) There was some tendency to under-estimate the military effort which wag being made by the United States. To counteract this tendency, it might be useful to publish comparative figures showingthe military effort of some of the Western Powers in relation to their national income:(/) It would be unwise for Ministers, in their speeches, to placeall the emphasis on the cost of rearmament. The public should alsobe reminded that, despite the cost of rearming, the Government were still spending very large sums on the social services and other policies.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 179.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th July, 1951.
