Persia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 51stConclusions,Minute 2.)evacuation of A.I.O.C.Staff.economic measures.1. The Foreign Secretary. recalled that in his memorandum cp. (51) 200, which had been before the Cabinet at their meeting on12th July, he had recommended that at the appropriate stage theUnited Kingdom Government should invite the Security Council tocall on the Persian Government to observe the recommendations ofThe Hague Court. The United Kingdom representative at the united nations had, however, advised that there was serious doubt whether we should get from the Security Council a resolution favourable toour point of view; and the Foreign Secretary said that he was nowreconsidering his earlier recommendation in the light of this advice.The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that, although there was to be no announcement of a phased withdrawal of the staffof the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from Persia until the results ofMr. Harriman&apos;s mission could be judged, the Company still haddiscretion to withdraw individual employees and, in the exercise ofthat discretion, they were in fact withdrawing quite substantial numbers of their staff from the oilfields. Conditions continued to deteriorate and, unless there was some radical change in the situation,it seemed unlikely that a general withdrawal could be deferred for very long.On 12th July the Cabinet had asked the President of the Boardof Trade to delay the sailing of ships which were about to leave thiscountry carrying consignments of steel rails and sugar for Persia.The Cabinet were now informed that, after discussion with theMinister of Transport, the President of the Board of Trade had decided that, while consignments not already loaded should be left for the time being on the quayside, ships which had already takenthese consignments on board should be allowed to sail on the under-standing that the shipowners might be required to refrain fromdelivering these consignments at Basra or to off-load them at anyintermediate port of call. By this means control over the cargoeswould be maintained and a final decision could be taken, in the lightof further developments, at any point up to the time of the ships&apos;arrival at Basra. If the matter were raised in Parliament the Govern-ment reply could be that, while these consignments had left thiscountry for Persia, it did not follow that they would necessarily reachPersia.Some Ministers were doubtful whether a reply on those lines would satisfy public opinion in this country; and the Cabinet agreedto consider this matter further at their meeting on 19th July.Egypt&apos; 2.   On 1st July an Egyptian corvette had stopped the BritishInterference steamship Empire Roach when she was in Egyptian territorial waterswith Merchant on her way to Akaba with supplies for the Arab Legion in Jordan.Shipping. The ship had been searched, the crew had been kept under hatches forsome hours, and there had been some damage and pilfering of theship&apos;s equipment and stores. A strong protest had been lodged withthe Egyptian Government, but no reply to this had yet been received.Meanwhile, the Cabinet were asked to consider whether one ofHis Majesty&apos;s ships should accompany the Empire Roach on her nexttrip to Akaba, with a view to preventing further incidents of this kind.The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Government would doubtless base their action on the claim that, as they were stilltechnically at war with Israel, they were entitled to search for contra-band ships passing through their territorial waters which might be^carrying military supplies to Israel. On the other hand the Empire. Roach and her sister ship were both owned by the United KingdomGovernment, they were cleared through the Egyptian customs at Suez,and the Egyptian authorities could have no reasonable ground to
doubt that the stores which they were carrying were in fact destined for. Jordan.The Attorney-General said that, although a naval vessel had theright of peaceful passage through territorial waters, a naval vesselescorting a merchant ship and intending to give it any necessaryprotection could hardly claim to be on peaceful passage. although he had not had time to consider the matter fully, he was inclined tothe view that it would be a breach of international law for one ofHis Majesty&apos;s ships to escort a merchant vessel through Egyptianterritorial waters.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was no doubtthat the Enterprise channel, which was the channel normally used by ships proceeding to Akaba, was within Egyptian territorial waters.There was, however, another channel, the Graf ton channel, passingnear the island of Tiran which, in our view, belonged to Saudi Arabia.It was true that the Egyptian Government had made a unilateral claimto sovereignty over this island; and, if that claim were valid, theGrafton channel would also be within Egyptian territorial waters.We had not, however, admitted the claim and it was open to us toproceed on the basis that this channel lay within the territorial waters of Saudi Arabia. He therefore suggested that on her further tripsto Akaba the Empire Roach should use the Grafton channel, and thatone of His Majesty&apos;s ships should be in her vicinity, though not actually escorting her, as she passed through these waters.In further discussion the point was made that, while the Egyptiancorvette might have been entitled to stop the Empire Roach withinEgyptian territorial waters, there was no justification for the subse-quent action of detaining the crew and damaging the ship&apos;s equipment.Firm action would therefore be warranted to prevent any repetition of such irregularities. The case for firm action was also strengthened by the fact that the Egyptians had no reasonable grounds for suspect-ing that the ship was carrying contraband to Israel. It was the general view of the Cabinet that in these circumstances the United KingdomGovernment would be justified in arranging for the Empire Roach,on her next trip to Akaba, to proceed through the Enterprise channelunder the cover of one Of His Majesty&apos;s ships.The Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange that theEmpire Roach, when passing through the Enterprise channelon her next trip to Akaba, should be covered by one of HisMajesty&apos;s ships, whose commanding officer would haveorders to prevent any interference by Egyptian naval vesselswith her passage to Akaba.tod&quot;3- 3.   The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidIndo-Pakistan   that the Prime Minister of Pakistan had recently drawn public relations.      : attention to the heavy concentration of Indian troops in East Punjab(Previous        and in Jammu and Kashmir.   He had said that 90 per cent, of the reference:    &apos; Indian Army was now concentrated on the borders of Pakistan and cm. (50) 15th  that this constituted a grave threat to the security of Pakistan and to conclusions,    international peace.   At a private meeting which he had held with minute 4.)      representatives  of  other  Commonwealth  countries  in  KarachiMr. Liaquat Ali Khan had said that he regarded the situation as so serious that he had felt obliged to order Pakistan troops to move upto the frontier.The Secretary of State said that a very dangerous state of tensionwas developing and the United Kingdom Government would have toconsider whether there was any action which they could take to relieve the tension. He did not, however, wish to put forward any specific recommendations at that meeting; for the Prime Minister and he
would wish first to discuss the situation with the United kingdom high Commissioner in Delhi, who was due to arrive in London later in the day.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations.Judges&apos;Salaries.(previous reference:CM. (50) 76thConclusions,Minute 10.)EnglishJudges.4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 199) and the Lord Advocate (CP. (51) 201)on the increases in salaries which should be given to County court judges and Metropolitan Magistrates, to Sheriffs and Sheriffs Sub-stitute and to Puisne Judges in Northern Ireland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the proposals in his memo-randum in respect of English Judges represented a compromise whichhe had reached in discussion with the Lord Chancellor. No increasein the salaries of High Court Judges could be contemplated at thepresent time. There was, however, a case for giving an increase in salary to County Court Judges, whose present salary had been fixed in 1937. He proposed that, in future, County Court Judges shouldreceive  2,750 on appointment, rising to  3,000 after five years&apos;service.   A lower scale was proposed for Metropolitan Magistrates.The Cabinet first considered whether it was right that the salaries of judicial officers should be fixed on a scale with annual increments.The proposal in CP. (51) 199 was essentially a compromise betweenthe view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the salary of county court Judges should be fixed at  2,750 and the Lord Chancellorsview that it should be fixed at  3,000 a year. There might be public criticism and repercussions on the policy of wages restraint if the salary of County Court Judges were increased from  2,000 a yearto  3,000 a year; but at the same time the Lord Chancellor was doubtful whether he could secure members of the Bar of thenecessary ability at a fixed salary of  2,750. Many other salarieswere based on an incremental scale; and, as the incrementswould be granted automatically, there need be no implication thata Judge had to perform his duties in a manner satisfactory to theGovernment. The general view of Ministers was, however, that a judge&apos;s salary should be a fixed amount, without annual variation.A County Court Judge had to be fully competent to discharge theduties of the office from the time of his appointment. Litigants andothers might feel that they were receiving less than full justice if their cases were tried by a Judge who was receiving a salary at the bottom of a scale. Higher appointments in the civil service were at fixedrates because it was assumed that, when a member of a professionhad reached a certain level of seniority, he should be fully competent to perform the duties of any grade to which he might be appointedwithout any probationary period. In these circumstances the cabinet agreed that the salaries of County Court Judges and the other judicialofficers covered by the proposals in CP. (51) 199 should be at a fixedrate and not on a scale.Ministers then discussed the level at which the salary of county court Judges should be fixed. In support of a salary of  3,000 a year it was argued that, since this salary would include remuneration forany divorce work which a Judge, might do, the effective average increase in salary was from  2,330 a year to  3,000. It was argued that this increase could be justified by reference to the change in thestandard of money since the salaries were fixed in 1937, and by theadditional work which had since been thrown upon County court judges. The general view of the Cabinet was, however, that anincrease of salary from  2,000 to  3,000 a year might have serious repercussions. It had to be borne in mind that a County court judge received a non-contributory pension of a substantial amount
after a relatively short period of service. While a salary of  3,000 ayear might attract better men than a somewhat, lower salary, it was difficult to say what difference a few hundred pounds would make.After a full discussion it was agreed that the salary of county court Judges should in future be fixed at  2,800 a year.The Cabinet then considered. what salary should be paid toMetropolitan Magistrates. In order to ensure that members of the bar of the necessary ability were willing to accept such appointments,a substantial increase of salary above the present level of  2,000 ayear was necessary. At the same time it was desirable to maintainthe differential which had grown up in recent years between the salaries of County Court Judges and Metropolitan Magistrates,because of the fees paid to the former for divorce work. The cabinet agreed that in these circumstances the salaries of metropolitan magistrates should be fixed at  2,500 a year.The Lord Advocate said that, as it was not proposed in presentcircumstances to increase the salaries of High Court Judges in England,he did not wish to propose any increase in the salaries of Court of session Judges in Scotland. He hoped, however, that a more generousexpenses allowance could be given to Scottish High Court Judgeswhen they went on circuit. It had long been a grievance that they received no allowance in respect of their expenses on circuit; and,while these expenses were not as high as those of an English HighCourt Judge on circuit, the Scottish Judges had to live in a mannerconsonant with the dignity of their office and had to do a certainamount of entertaining. They would not be satisfied with the scale of allowances paid to members of Royal Commissions, which he believed worked out at about 305. a night.As regards Sheriffs Substitute, he was having great difficulty in finding candidates of the necessary ability. In his view the SheriffSubstitute had more responsible work than the County Court Judge,since he had concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Session on all matters except divorce and other questions of status, and he had a criminal jurisdiction which covered the work done in England bystipendiary magistrates and recorders. There were at present threegrades of Sheriff Substitute, according to the volume of work withwhich they had to deal, and he proposed that the first two gradesshould be amalgamated and should receive the same salary as an english County Court Judge, but that the lowest grade should con-tinue to receive less salary. His proposals would not cost the Treasurymore than  20,000 a year. The differentiation in salary between theCounty Court Judge and the Sheriff Substitute had never been justified, and there was no reason why this injustice should be per-petuated. Legal advisers in Scottish Departments received as muchas their English counterparts, and Government Departments andsocialised industries did not differentiate against Scottish appoint-ments in the way which was done with Scottish judicial appointments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that members of theScottish Bar earned less than English barristers, and this made it possible to fill the Scottish judicial appointments at lower salaries thanin England without any lowering of standards. On the informationbefore him he was not prepared to accept the argument that the workof a Sheriff Substitute, taken as a whole, was of equal quality to thatperformed by a County Court Judge. The removal of the differentialbetween English and Scottish rates of pay would increase the pressure in England for higher rates to be paid to County Court Judges and.Metropolitan Magistrates. If the salaries of Sheriffs Substitute were increased in the manner proposed by the Lord Advocate, it would bedifficult to resist an increase in the salary of the Sheriff Principal ofLanark, which would bring his emoluments very near to that of a scottish High Court Judge. He was prepared to consider a more generous expenses allowance to Scottish Judges on circuit than thatpaid to members of Royal Commissions, but he could not agree toallowances on the scale paid to English Judges on circuit.ScottishJudges.
Erection of a 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterWar Memorial of Defence (CP. (51) 197) regarding the erection of a war memorialat Dunkirk. at Dunkirk. The Imperial War Graves Commission were proposing to erect in the Dunkirk civil cemetery a memorial commemoratingthe names of about 4,600 members of the British Army who fell inthe campaign of 1939-40 ending with the evacuation from Dunkirkand have no known grave elsewhere. The question raised in thememorandum was whether the Government should allow the Corn-mission to go forward with this proposal, or whether they should seek to mark the special significance of Dunkirk by contributingtowards a more noteworthy memorial to be placed, if possible, ona site overlooking the beaches.In a short discussion Ministers expressed some doubts about theproposal for a modest memorial in the civil cemetery at Dunkirk.On the other hand, it was argued that there was little public support for the more imposing type of memorial. The view was also expressed that a larger memorial should not, in any event, be erectedat Dunkirk unless it could be placed on a site overlooking the beaches.The general view of the Cabinet was that it might be inexpedient to proceed at the present time with any proposal for erecting a war memorial at Dunkirk.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for War to undertake further consultations about this project with the Imperial war graves Commission, in the light of the views expressed bythe Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, SWA,\6th July, 1951.The general view of the Cabinet was that the present review ofthe rates of salary of County Court Judges was not an opportuneoccasion for considering the removal of the differential betweenEnglish and Scottish judicial salaries or the regrading of the SheriffSubstitute service. The Lord Advocate could, however, say that thepresent adjustments in salary scales would not prejudice any later consideration, on their merits, of proposals for removing thisdifferential.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the salary of County Court Judges should be fixed at  2,800 a year and of Metropolitan Magistrates at  2,500a year.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord chancellor and the Lord Advocate to settle, in relation to the decisionrecorded in Conclusion (1) above and on the basis of preserving the differential between English and Scottishrates of salaries, what salaries should be paid to SheriffsPrincipal, Sheriffs Substitute and the Chairman of theScottish Land Court.(3) Agreed that the salaries of Puisne Judges in Northern ireland should be increased from  3,000 to  3,500 a year.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle, in consul-tation with the Lord Advocate, the scale of expenses to beallowed to Scottish High Court Judges on circuit.(5) Approved the other proposals regarding the expenses of judicial officers outlined in paragraph 6 of CP. (51) 199.
