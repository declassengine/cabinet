Washington 1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Prime Ministerand Ottawa (CP. (51) 239) reviewing the policy to be followed (i) in the discus-Meetings, sions which the Foreign Secretary Was to hold in Washington first with Mr. Acheson and then with Mr. Acheson and M. Schumantogether, and (ii) at the North Atlantic Council meeting in Ottawa.In the course of a general discussion the following points weremade:  (a) Containment of the Soviet Union and SatellitesThe United Kingdom Government had done as much as anyother Government to support this policy. It was still their convic-tion that war was not inevitable, and this must be brought home tothe United States Government. It was as necessary to restrain themore impulsive elements in America as it was to avoid provokingthe Soviet Union.(b) European IntegrationWhile we were willing to collaborate actively in all forms ofEuropean co-operation, we attached great importance to our mem-membership of the Atlantic Community, and since the European membersof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) were uneasyat its predominantly military nature, we should seek to forwardeconomic, social and cultural objects in the Organisation.Dr. Stikker, who had sponsored the recent declaration of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)regarded this as a first step in gaining popular support for the atlantic concept. While Mr. Acheson was expected to put forward proposals for developing these wider objects of N.A.T.O., weshould not appear to be following an American lead in this matter,and should encourage Dr. Stikker to rally the support of theEuropean countries, who would be suspicious of a purely Anglo-American initiative.      v.(c) The Middle east the Foreign Secretary said that the United States were now beginning to take an interest in Egyptian affairs: this was a welcomedevelopment even though the crudeness of American thinking had its embarrassments. The breakdown in negotiations between theUnited Kingdom and Egypt had left as the most hopeful course thatdescribed in the Prime Minister^ memorandum, viz., Egyptian par-ticipation in the new Allied Middle East Command. This wouldmean Egyptian representation on the various organs of the command, and the present British base in Egypt becoming an Alliedbase with all British troops located in Egypt forming part of the Alliedintegrated Command. An offer on these lines (about which it was proposed tentatively and without commitment to inform the Ameri-cans) ought to satisfy not only Egyptian amour propre but alsoParliamentary criticism in this country. The main disadvantagewas that, if United Kingdom troops were required for purely UnitedKingdom purposes in the Middle East, they could no longer bedrawn from the new Allied Command.The Chiefs of Staff said that this offer was at any rate a lesserevil than giving up a base in Egypt altogether.Some doubts were expressed about the value of the proposed arrangements, which would put the United Kingdom in the positionof occupying only one out of a number of places in the Middle east command. A settlement was in any case unlikely to be reached with the present Egyptian Government or with any other partyGovernment in Egypt. Only an all-party administration in Egypt,and the influence of the King could lead to a helpful compromise.A solution was urgent, since the present Treaty expired in 1956 andthe longer a settlement was delayed the less we should gain by it.Doubt was also expressed about the wisdom of withholding,as had been suggested, the announcement that the United Kingdom41281-1B 2
would provide the Supreme Commander until the Egyptians had accepted the offer to participate in the Middle East Command. the egyptians would in any event require to be informed Of the nationality of the Supreme Commander.As for the Sudan, the Foreign Secretary said that the Sudanesedespite our pledge to give them self-government as soon as possible,were looking somewhat critically at the fact that Libya was to begiven self-government in 1952. We must do all we could to developinternal self-government in the Sudan, even though defence andforeign affairs might continue to be reserved. The Egyptians alsowanted to give the Sudan self-government, but on their own terms,including bringing the Sudan under the Egyptian crown-a proposi-tion which the Sudanese would never accept. It was pointed out,however, that no agreement about bases would be possible with anyEgyptian Government if the Sudan question were not covered.Some gesture on the point might be appropriate.(d) Italian treaty the Foreign Secretary said that, since the Prime minister&apos;s memorandum was circulated, he had learned that the United StatesGovernment did not agree with the two-stage approach to theproblem there proposed. He was convinced, however, that thematter could not be rushed, and he would endeavour to persuade the americans to accept the United Kingdom programme.(e) AustriaThe Foreign Secretary said that his view had been that it was too soon for the Deputies to meet again on the Austrian Treaty. But he understood that the French favoured an early meeting and had authorised their High Commissioner in Vienna to tell the Austriansso. The Americans appeared to think that it might be worth while to hold a Deputies&apos; meeting &quot;at an opportune moment,&quot; i.e., not muchbefore the end of the year. He proposed to maintain the line onAustria suggested in CP. (51) 239.(/) SpainThere was general support for the proposals in CP. (51) 239. Itappeared that the United States Government had both underestimatedpublic feeling in this country against American military aid to Spain,and overestimated the value of the contribution which Spain might make to Western defence.(g) Protection of Nationals in Eastern europe the question was raised whether Mr. Sanders was to continue indefinitely in prison in Hungary: was there not some means ofsecuring his release, as the United States had secured that ofMr. Vogeler? The Cabinet were informed that the Americans had secured the release of Mr. Vogeler only at the expense&apos; of ill-advisedconcessions. To follow their example would serve only as an incentive to persecution of foreigners. We had already gone as far as welegitimately could to bring pressure to bear on the Hungarian Govern-ment, including the virtual cessation of all trade with Hungary.Nevertheless, the Foreign Secretary might try the effect of a further approach to the Hungarian Government, accompanied by themaximum publicity.(h) Atlantic and Mediterranean CommandsThe Minister of Defence said that the Command arrangements now proposed for the Mediterranean were not wholly satisfactory,but would be practicable in peace-time provided we obtained theappointment of a British Supreme Commander for the Middle East,who established effective liaison with Admiral Carney, and provided the Turks agreed to take their place.in that Command.

(51) 240) seeking approval, for the guidance of the reference: Foreign Secretary in his discussions with Mr. Acheson and cm. (51) 56th M. Schuman, of certain principles upon which to base the futureConclusions, relations of the German Federal Republic with the Occupying PowersMinute 6.)       and German participation in Western defence.Contractual The Foreign Secretary said that United States opinion nowRelationship, favoured the concept of a European Army which would includeGerman German forces, because such an arrangement would both meetDefence German claims to equality of treatment in defence matters and lessenContribution. French apprehensions of a resurgence of German militarism. Wecould accept the force of these arguments, recognising the danger that,unless Germany were satisfied both about her future political relation-ship with the Occupying Powers and about her participation in thedefence of Europe, she might tend to look to the Soviet for the satis-faction of her aspirations. He was, however, concerned to ensure thatthe plan for a European Army could be made militarily effective, andsome examination of the proposals by the Standing Group was desirable.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The United States military authorities had initially con-sidered the concept of a European Army to be militarily unpractical,but they now favoured it, probably under the influence of general eisenhower who, while recognising the many military difficulties,believed that the political difficulties of obtaining French approval tothe raising of National German forces were insuperable. He was understood to be preoared to serve both as Commissioner for the advance planning for convoy operation and protection of lines ofcommunication, but that, if war came, a Supreme Commander forthe Mediterranean area as a whole would be necessary. It was agreed,however, that since the question of the Mediterranean Command wasto be on the agenda of the North Atlantic Council, and would beaffected by the question of Turkish membership of N.A.T.O., it wouldbe useful if the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Defence were to give further consideration to themanner in which this question should be handled.(/) Greece and Turkey and N.A.T.O.The Foreign Secretary said that we wished to ensure that, ifTurkey and Greece were admitted to N.A.T.O., Turkey would still be primarily associated for defence purposes with the Middle east command under a British Commander. The extent to which the americans would support our views was doubtful, since AdmiralCarney was believed to want the Turks as part of his Command. Hehad found the Turkish Ambassador a stubborn negotiator; and,although the Ambassador had categorically assured him that theTurks would in fact join in the Middle East Command, no writtenconfirmation of this had been forthcoming or could be expected untilthe North Atlantic Council had decided whether Turkey was to beadmitted to N.A.T.O.The Cabinet considered that we should make it clear to the Turksand to the Americans that our support for Turkish membership ofN.A.T.O. must be subject to an undertaking of Turkish participation in Middle East Command, which might be announced simultaneously with the admittance of Turkey to N.A.T.O.The Cabinet Subject to the points made in discussion, took note with approval of CP.&quot; (51)239.
European Army and as Supreme Commander of the N.A.T.O. forcesin Europe, and to believe that in this dual capacity he would be ableto integrate German forces into a European Army which would form part of his N.A.T.O. forces.(b) There were still serious divergences of opinion among thecountries concerned on the form which a European Army should take.On the one hand, it had been proposed that national forces should be merged into an Army with a European uniform, common pay scalesand full integrated units. M. Schuman had, in his letter to Mr. Achesonof 9th August, stressed the need to ensure that the firsts Germanrecruits should wear the European uniform. Such a concept offeredpolitical advantages, but would present formidable difficulties in execution. General Eisenhower, however, was understood to favour the raising of German forces as national units in the first instance,which, after completion, of training, would come under his control as European Defence Commissioner and he would then decide how they should be fitted into the N.A.T.O. forces available to him. It was probably because the details were so uncertain that the French and american representatives on the Standing Group had been unwilling to consider the military aspects of a European Army in advance of the tripartite discussions.(c) It was suggested that it would be inadvisable for us to become involved in detailed consideration of the form and structure of a european Army at the tripartite talks, and that in order to permitprogress we should express agreement in principle to the european army concept, leaving the details for later settlement through theMilitary Committee of N.A.T.O. It was pointed out, on the otherhand, that, unless we first established precisely the manner of german participation and the degree of control over German forces to beexercised, we might find that we had permitted the creation of forcesover whose use we had little say. There were already signs of aresurgence of extreme nationalism in Germany, as instanced by a recent speech of a Minister of the Federal Government calling for therestoration of the Eastern provinces lost to Poland. While too much attention should not be paid to claims of this nature to territory whosefuture, in our view, still depended on an eventual peace treaty, it was important that the forming and arming of German forces should not get out of step with the rearmament of the war-time allies.(d) It was, in any event, essential to ensure that the equippingof German forces was not done at the expense of the need for arms of ourselves and our N.A.T.O. partners.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform Mr. Acheson andM. Schuman that, while we were disposed to favour theplan for a European Army, of which German forces should form part, the arrangements proposed should be worked out in more detail and examined by the appro-priate military authorities of N.A.T.O. before final approval could be given to the raising and incorporation of German units.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek the agreement ofMr. Acheson and M. Schuman to the principle that theprovision of arms to the members of the North atlantic treaty should receive priority over requirements for german military forces.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) above, approved the con-clusions in the Prime Minister&apos;s memorandum (CP. (51)240).Economic and The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by the PrimeFinancial        Minister (CP. (51) 238) covering a report by. an interdepartmentalImplications.    committee of officials regarding the economic and financial impli-cations of raising a German defence contribution.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that, if the Germansmade a military contribution to Western defence, they would argue that they should be relieved of occupation costs. If we ceased toreceive occupation costs altogether, the additional charge on theBudget and on our balance of payments would be at the annual rateof about  150 million in the current year rising to  180 million in subsequent years. It was essential that the United States authoritiesshould be brought to understand that such an additional burden onthe United Kingdom could not be accepted; and he proposed tobring this matter up in the course of his talks with the Americans oneconomic and financial matters, so that they could be fully seized ofit before the Foreign Secretary began his discusions with Mr. Achesonand M. Schuman. He was in agreement with the report, except forthe proposal in paragraph 26 that German arms production shouldcontinue to be severely restricted. He was concerned at the threat to our overseas markets which German industry, unhampered by heavy arms production, might present; and he considered that, if itwas impossible to reach satisfactory arrangements on occupation costs,and if the creation of a European Army afforded adequate safeguards against German militarism, there might be a case for a measure ofGerman arms manufacture.In discussion the following points were made:  (e) While CP. (51) 238 concluded that the economic capacity of western Germany was adequate to meet both the probable defencecosts which would fall on the Federal Budget and essential Allieddeutschmark expenditure, this did not appear to accord with the viewsof the Allied High Commission. In any event, if these costs could notbe met by Germany, it was clear that the United Kingdom couldnot meet the additional burden, and the Americans should find means to preserve us from any additional charge.(/) Any question of permitting the revival of German munitionsmanufacture on an extensive scale would need careful and separate consideration.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the question of permitting the manufacture of heavy arms and equipment in Germany would require futher consideration if satisfactory arrangements couldnot be made for the continued payment of occupation costs.(5) Subject to Conclusion (4) above, approved the recom-mendations contained in the Report annexed to cp. (51) 238.Persia.^previous reference:CM. (51) 57thConclusions,Minute 9.)Persiandealings in sterling.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 241) explaining the special facilities at presentaccorded to Persia in the use of her sterling for dollar payments andfor the purchase of scarce supplies, and recommending that the Orderplacing all Persian transactions in sterling under control should nowbe made, after consultation with the United States Government, andin any event if abnormal movements of sterling should be attempted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Order had beenheld in abeyance for some time lest the negotiations undertaken by theLord Privy Seal should have been prejudiced, but in present circum-stances we could not afford the continued drain of dollars, which might give rise to justified criticism in this country. We should, however,first inform the United States Government of our intentions. If theOrder were issued, a public statement should also be made of thereasons for the withdrawal of the facilities in order to counter anyPersian accusation of economic pressure.
In discussion, consideration was given to the effects of making an export control order revoking existing licences for exports of scarcegoods complementary to the proposed control Order.Exports to (a) The Secretary for Overseas Trade reported that the VulcanPersia. Foundry Company were seeking guidance on an order, obtained inthe face of severe German and American competition, for 64 loco-motives for delivery starting in January. It was not certain that, ifmanufactured, these locomotives would be suitable for use elsewherethan in Persia.The point was made that the productive capacity being devotedto the locomotives might be useful for other purposes.(b) While we could properly refuse transfers of sterling for trans-actions relating to oil, and for other scarce commodities such as ironand steel, it was suggested that different considerations arose inconnection with sugar. We should be accused of depriving the Persianpeople of a basic food, and this might serve to consolidate Persianopinion behind the present Prime Minister rather than weaken hisposition. On the other hand, we purchased this sugar for dollars andthen made it available to Persia for sterling, and it would be illogicalto stop dollar transfers while at the same time permitting the purchaseof sugar for sterling. Nor would this be understood by the public in this country, where sugar was still rationed.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations of the Chancellor of theExchequer contained in CP. (51) 241.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for an appropriatepublic statement to be prepared in consultation with theLord Privy Seal and the Minister of Fuel and Power, tobe issued simultaneously with the Sterling Control Order.(3) Invited the Board of Trade to make an Export Control order as proposed in paragraph 3 of CP. &quot;(51) 241 when the sterling Control Order was issued.(4) Agreed that sugar should not be excluded from the operationof the Export Control Order.(5) Invited the Secretary for Overseas Trade to investigate andreport on the possibility of alternative markets for thelocomotives being manufactured by the Vulcan FoundryCompany for later consideration.Payment of The Foreign Secretary reported that the Anglo-Iranian OilPersian Company&apos;s (A.I.O.C.&apos;s) representative in Tehran, Mr. Sedden, hadEmployees in recommended the cessation of payment of wages to Persian employeesAbadan. in Abadan. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tehran was of the opinionthat we should not be deterred from this step for fear of consequences to the British staff remaining in Abadan, since the Persians were deter-mined to ensure the protection of British personnel in order to give usno excuse for landing British forces there&quot;. Nor did he think that thetermination of these payments would of itself lead the Persians to cancel residence permits for the British staff.The Cabinet considered, however, that the cessation of payments to the Persian staff in Abadan might have more serious consequencesthan the cessation of payments to Persian staff in the oilfields fromwhich British personnel had been withdrawn, and that furtherinformation was required before a decision could be taken.The Cabinet (6) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a full apprecia-tion of the risks involved to be obtained for subsequent consideration.Reservation of The Foreign Secretary reported that the A.I.O.C. proposed toA.I.O.CS. issue a general warning to prospective purchasers of oil from theLegal Rights.   National Iranian Oil Company to the effect that any such purchases
would be Of oil to which the title was in dispute and that they wouldtake action, wherever available to them, to protect their rights.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that there was no objection to the issue of such astatement by the A.I.O.C.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (51) 47thConclusions,Minute 4.)Balance ofPayments.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 242) on the balance of payments positionand also a memorandum by the Ministry of Defence (CP. (51) 243)on supplies of finished military equipment from the United States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the outlook described in his memorandum was serious. The prospective dollar deficit for1951-52 might approach $1,200 million. The three main causes all new factors since June were the need to replace Persian oil, our july and August deficit in the European Payments Union and the fall inprices of Commonwealth sterling products. The  4,700 milliondefence programme could not be blamed for the deterioration of thesituation since June. The situation had serious domestic implications,about which he would make further positive proposals after his return from North America. His immediate purpose, however, was todiscuss the line he was to take while in North America. While wemust take all possible steps to reduce this deficit by cutting dollar imports and encouraging dollar exports, these would be only partialremedies, and if substantial United States assistance were available on conditions which were politically satisfactory our position would end-Item Aid. be much easier. He did not wish to seek general economic aid, butwished to be free to explore the possibilities of using United Statessupplies of finished military equipment in relief of our difficulties sinceaid in this form was free of political objection. There were threeaspects to our defence planning. First, there was the  4,700 millionprogramme, for which we now seemed unlikely to receive any directUnited States dollar aid. If, however, some of the military supplies required could now be provided as &quot; end items &quot; by the United States,and our own production programmes reduced accordingly, we could use capacity thus released for exports and thus relieve our own position. Next, there were the forces we should have to equip on mobilisation to meet both our interim contribution commitments toN.A.T.O. and strategic requirements elsewhere. After completionof the  4,700 million programme there would still remain a deficiency in the equipment needed for these forces of the order of  2,000million. Finally, there was the full medium-term defence plan,implementation of which might impose still larger requirements onthe United Kingdom. In CP. (51) 243 the Minister of Defencesuggested that we should not at present approach the United states with a full statement of the prospective deficiencies in the equipment of our forces, but should confine ourselves to a request for adequate supplies of raw materials and machine tools. In these particularfields the United States had been fairly generous, but their help had had little or no effect on our dollar position. In his view, the right course was fully to inform members of the United States Admini-stration of the worsening of our situation, making it clear that the carrying-out of the  4,700 million programme would give us con-siderable difficulty; that the equipment of the forces available on mobilisation could be achieved only with considerable help; and thatwe could certainly make no additional contribution for the purposeof the full Medium-Term Defence Plan.The Minister of Defence said that, while discussions with the americans on our general economic position and the particular problems of rearmament were desirable, he did not believe that weshould at this stage make a request for any specific relief, partly because were were unlikely to receive aid and partly because of the41281-5 c
conditions which might be attached. Nor was he in favour of requests for considerable supplies of military equipment. Moreover,our defence programme did not arise solely out of our North atlantic treaty Organisation obligations. Much of the  4,700 million pro-gramme was to be devoted to other commitments, e.g., in the middle east and the Colonies. The receipt of free military equipment might make it difficult for us to continue exporting arms to some of thesecountries. He suggested that it was of greater importance to secureAmerican help for our raw material and machine tool requirements,not only for our defence programme but also to maintain domesticinvestment and exports.In discussion it was pointed out that our difficulties on externalpayments could not be met on one front alone and that we should need American help on supplies of steel, on a reasonable approach to East-West trade, on raw material supplies and a number of othermatters. The Cabinet felt that we should keep open the possibilityof switching orders for some of our military requirements from theUnited Kingdom to the United States, and that the Chancellor of theExchequer should be free to discuss this if it should seem appropriate.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform theUnited States Government of the worsening of our dollarsituation, and to discuss possible remedies on the lines proposed in CP. (51) 242.Atomic Energy 5. The Prime Minister said that at a Tripartite ConferenceSecurity. between officials of the United Kingdom, Canadian and the UnitedStates Governments it had been suggested that United Kingdomsecurity arrangements in connection with staff to be employed on atomic energy work should be brought into line with the methodsin force in Canada and the United States. A group of ministers under his Chairmanship had considered a new procedure which would replace the &quot; negative &quot; vetting of the past by a form of &quot; positive &quot;vetting. The chief feature of this was that the candidate for atomic energy work, whether already in the Civil Service or a new recruit,would be required to complete a questionnaire. This would ask,among other things, whether he was or ever had been a member of theCommunist or Fascist Parties or of allied bodies, and would requirehim to name referees of whom (and indeed of other persons) enquirieswould be made on the specific question of his suitability for employ-ment on atomic energy work. The Ministry of Supply, and in par-ticular Lord Portal, had been most anxious that this new procedure should be adopted, in the hope that the Americans might be induced to be more forthcoming in the sharing of atomic energy information.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington had been asked to informthe United States Government of the proposed new procedure, but had now sought further instructions on the ground that this step was unlikely to lead to any immediate positive results, in particular theamendment of the McMahon Act which severely limited the amountof atomic energy information which the United States could impartto the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister said that, in the lightof this, he was in some doubt whether the new procedure should beadopted, particularly as, in his view, existing United Kingdom security. precautions were probably as effective as American, and would not\ really be improved by the new procedure. Moreover, he felt somedistaste for United States methods, with their tendency to disregard\      the liberty of the subject.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) At the Tripartite Conference United Kingdom officials had given an undertaking that the new procedure would be adopted.
They had had no authority to do so, but the fact was that we were committed.(b) The new procedure did not appear to constitute a grossinfringement of the liberty of the subject, and could in any event bejustified by the extreme importance of atomic energy security. Theprocedure to be adopted was current also in Canada, where its administration lacked the objectionable features of American securityprocedure.(c) It had never been expected that United Kingdom adoptionof the new procedure would lead forthwith to amendment of theMcMahon Act. The constitutional position made it in any eventimpossible for the United States Administration to give a firm under-taking about amending legislation. Adoption of the new procedure would, however, improve the atmosphere, with the result that, if thequestion of amending the McMahon Act arose, the prospects of amending it favourably to ourselves would be better. The foreign secretary, when in Washington, might endeavour to ascertain whether this result could be expected. *The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to discuss with the United StatesGovernment the probable effect of adopting a &quot; positive &quot;vetting procedure in connection with new appointments to atomic energy work.(2) Subject to the outcome of the discussions referred to at(1) above, approved in principle the adoption of the new procedure.japanese peace Treaty.San FranciscoConference.(previous reference:CM. (51) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that the attendance of the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics at the San Francisco Conference for the signing of a Peace Treaty with Japan might make it difficult to com-plete the proceedings by the date agreed. While we did not wish theConference to be unduly prolonged, he considered that some extensionof perhaps two days would be reasonable and proposed to inform mr. Acheson accordingly.The Cabinet took note with approval of the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s proposal.Cabinet Office, SWA,4th September, 1951.
