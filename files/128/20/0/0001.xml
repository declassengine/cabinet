Persia. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary (CP. (51) 200) on the situation in Persia.   This discussedReference:      the question of military intervention in Persia for the purpose of cm. (51) 50th  protecting British property, as distinct from British lives, and reachedConclusions,    the conclusion that military intervention for the former purpose would minute 2.)      be undesirable.  It also recommended (i) that we should announce aphased withdrawal of the staff of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company(A.I.O.C.) from the oil-fields and from Abadan, (ii) that theInternational Court should be informed of this decision, (iii) that thedispute should be referred to the Security Council, and (iv) that weshould inform the United States Government of the steps we were taking and seek their support in the Security Council.The Foreign Secretary said that, since this memorandum was prepared, the situation had again been changed by the Persian PrimeMinisters acceptance of President ,Truman&apos;s offer to sendMr. Harriman to Tehran for discussions. The United StatesGovernment, who had been informed of the. general lines of theproposals in the memorandum, had suggested that in these circum-stances reference to the Security Council would be premature. TheForeign Secretary said that he accepted that view: action on therecommendations made in his memorandum must at least be post-poned until the effects of Mr. Harriman&apos;s mission could be judged.He hoped that Mr. Harriman would not seek to act as a mediatorbetween the two parties to the dispute; and he intended to urgeMr. Harriman to impress upon the Persian Government their duty to conform with the interim ruling of the International Court as anessential basis for a settlement of the dispute.Evacuation The Foreign Secretary said that he had not yet received the viewsof A.I.O.C. of the United States Government on the proposal to announce a staff. phased withdrawal of A.I.O.C. staff.   Both the Company and HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tehran were strongly in favour of adoptingthis course as the best method of demonstrating to the Persians our determination not to yield to their demands. Moreover, some with-withdrawals were already taking place, and an early statement was needed to prevent these from being regarded as a sign of weakness. He had now been convinced that this was the right course; but, in view ofMr. Harriman&apos;s mission, he suggested that any announcement should now be delayed for a few days. .   . &apos;Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the Houseof Commons.Persia. It was agreed that, if a debate on the Persian situation were heldon 17th July, the Government spokesmen should be the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary. If, however, the circumstance were then such that a full Parliamentary discussion might prejudice the situation, the Opposition might be persuaded to agree that the debate should be postponed.The Cabinet also considered what arrangements should be madeto enable the House of Commons to discuss foreign affairs andeconomic questions during the week beginning 23rd July. they agreed that it would be preferable if a three-day debate could be heldfrom 23rd-25th July, in which the House would be free to hold a wide-ranging discussion on the international situation, the need forrearmament and the impact of rearmament on the national economy.In that event the Foreign Secretary might speak on the first day, theChancellor of the Exchequer on the second and the Prime minister on the third. The Cabinet invited the Home Secretary and the chief whip to seek to persuade the leaders of the Opposition to accept suchan arrangement.
In discussion some Ministers expressed the view that evacuationwas bound to be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and that theCompany ought to hold on, at least at Abadan, as long as possible.Evacuation would be regarded throughout the Middle East, as wellas in the United States and in this country, as a capitulation to Persianpressure, and it was unlikely that the Company would be able toreturn once they had left. The Australian Government had for these reasons urged great caution in reaching a decision to withdraw. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that withdrawal, from the oilfieldsat least, could not be deferred much longer, and that it must berepresented as an act of deliberate policy when it took place.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in view of Mr. Harriman&apos;s forthcoming discussions with the Persian Government, no announce-ment should be made for the time being regarding aphased withdrawal of A.I.O.C. staff from Persia.Military In discussing the possibility of military intervention in Persia,Action. the Cabinet were reminded that they had at one stage asked theChiefs of Staff to consider the military implications of seizing Abadanand holding it, if necessary against Persian opposition, for the purposeof refining there crude oil brought from Kuwait. The Cabinet were,however, impressed by the arguments developed in paragraphs 2-3of. CP. (51) 200 against the use of force for the protection of british property, as distinct from British lives. They agreed that military action in excess of that required for the protection of British livesshould not be contemplated unless there were some far-reachingchange in the&quot; general situation, such as the fall of the present government and the establishment of a-Communist regime in Persia.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that military action in Persia, on a larger scale thanthat necessary for the protection of British lives, shouldnot be contemplated unless there were some fundamental change in the general situation there.Negotiations The Prime Minister said that Dr. Mussadiq had been able to with the form his Government owing to the support of Persians who werePersian dissatisfied with former rule by a corrupt clique.   We could notGovernment. safely assume that if we succeeded in upsetting the present Govern-ment their successors would be less unsatisfactory, and we shouldrisk identifying ourselves with support of an equally undemocraticregime. If negotiations could be resumed it would be wise to stress,not only our acceptance of the principle of nationalisation, but alsoour willingness to operate the oil industry, on behalf of the PersianGovernment, on a basis of friendly partnership: we must not alienategenuine nationalist feeling in Persia by clinging to the old technique of obtaining concessions and insisting upon exact compliance withtheir terms.In discussion attention was drawn to the need for considering how far we should be willing to go to enable the Persian Governmentto avoid making concessions which they regarded as humiliating.We had no legal right to interfere with Persian expropriation and operation of their oil industry but we had the right to require com-pensation for the A.I.O.C., and the Persian Government could onlypay this if the industry was profitably operated. Mr. Harrimanmight be able to impress this point upon the Persian Prime Minister,and it might also be desirable to make it clear to the United StatesGovernment that we should not insist on the withdrawal of the nationalisation law if amendment could make it workable.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment that we considered acceptance by the PersianGovernment of the interim ruling of the International
Court to be the necessary basis for a settlement of thedispute, and that we did not regard it as appropriate thatMr. Harriman should act as a mediator between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Persian Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not wish to make a state-ment on Persia in the House of Commons before the results ofMr. Harriman&apos;s visit were known. If it was necessary to say some-thing in the meantime, he would confine himself to a factual statement about the visit, emphasising that we were in close touch with theUnited States Government. He would not mention the withdrawalof the A.I.O.C. staff or a reference of the dispute to the security council.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The Prime Minister said that he had been informed by theChancellor of the Exchequer, who was unable to be present, thatafter considering further the question of suspending the Memorandumof Understanding with Persia he had reached the conclusion that thiswould not be desirable unless we could show quite definitely thatPersia was abusing the understanding. Unless this could be shown,suspension of the Memorandum would involve a clear breach of anagreement between two central banks, which might destroy theconfidence of other countries holding gold and sterling in London.Moreover, we were in a position to check any Persian applicationto convert sterling into dollars, and the Cabinet would be able toconsider whether action should be taken if there was evidence thatany large and unwarrantable conversion was contemplated. To be effective such action could not be confined to simply suspending theMemorandum of Understanding, but would have to extend to block-ing Persian sterling balances and Persian gold under our control. Inthe meantime a close watch would be kept on Persian dollar transfers.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the Memorandum of Understanding with Persiashould not be suspended for the time being.The President of the Board of Trade said that consignments ofsteel rails and sugar for Persia were due to leave United kingdom ports during the following two or three days. The ruling of theInternational Court no longer stood in the way of our stopping theseconsignments, since the Persian Government had made it clear thatthey rejected that ruling; but it was for consideration whether action should be deferred until the effects of Mr. Harriman&apos;s mission couldbe judged. The Government would be exposed to severe criticism ifthey allowed scarce goods to go to Persia while the Persian Govern-ment showed no sign of altering their intransigent attitude. If they held up these consignments, the Government would be liable to pay compensation to the consignors and shippers.It was the general view of the Cabinet that action should betaken to prevent these goods from leaving for the time being. Asfar as possible no publicity should be given to this action.The Cabinet (6) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange thatno consignments of steel rails and sugar should leave theUnited. Kingdom for Persia for the time being.
bechuanaland protectorate.tshekedi khama.(previous reference:CM. (51) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 198) out-lining the arrangements which he was making for the holding of akgotla in the Bamangwato Reserve to ascertain the views of the tribeon the question whether Tshekedi Khama should be allowed toreturn to the Reserve as a private individual.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe Opposition parties had declined to nominate back-bench membersof their parties to act as observers at the kgotla, and it was thereforeimpracticable to send out a Parliamentary delegation as observers.He had, however, arranged for three individuals of standing to goto Bechuanaland and be present as observers during the preparations for and the holding of the kgotla. Immediately on the arrival ofthese observers in the Reserve, the High Commissioner and his officers would hold a meeting with tribal leaders with a view to persuading the tribe to summon a kgotla and to agree that Tshekedi and his followers might attend it. It was by no means clear that the triballeaders would agree to the holding of a further kgotla, and it was important on that account that the independent observers should be present at the preliminary discussions. The conditions in the Reservewere not satisfactory and the High Commissioner had had to call onSouthern Rhodesia for police reinforcements.In discussion the Cabinet were informed of certain indications that some Government supporters in the House of Commons werenot satisfied with the procedure which the Government had adopted for determining whether Tshekedi Khama should be allowed toreturn to the Bamangwato Reserve. It was important, from the pointof view of meeting possible criticisms, that the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations should be able to say that he had taken all practicable steps to ensure that Tshekedi Khama would be givenreasonable facilities to put his views, either in person or through arepresentative, in the preliminary discussions about the arrangementsfor a kgotla.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in paragraph 6 of CP. (51) 198,and authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, in answer to a Question in the House of Commonslater that day, to outline the procedure to be adopted andto give the names of the observers who would go toBechuanaland from this country to attend the kgotla.Tied Cottages.        4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of(Previous Local Government and the Minister of Agriculture (CP. (51) 196)Reference: proposing that the Government should announce their intention toCM. (49) 5th introduce legislation to repeal a provision of the Rent and MortgageConclusions, Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1933, which enabled farmersMinute 3.) , to create new tied cottages.The Minister of Local Government explained that under para-graph (g) (ii) of the First Schedule to the Act of 1933 a farmer couldbuy a house in a village and then, if he secured a certificate from theCounty Agricultural Executive Committee, evict the tenant withoutproviding alternative accommodation and give possession to an agricultural worker. The number of certificates granted appeared tobe increasing and was the subject of complaint in the countryside.The Minister of Agriculture and he had considered whether theycould suspend the issue of further certificates by administrative action, but they had been advised that this would be unlawful. Hesuggested that he should be authorised to announce that legislation would be introduced at an appropriate time to repeal the statutory provision under which these certificates were granted. Representa-tives of the trade unions concerned had expressed strong support forthis course.
The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotlandsaid that the Secretary of State had not been afforded an opportunityto comment on the proposal before it was submitted to the Cabinet.The proposed Bill could be represented as a breach of undertakings given during the passage of the Hill Farming Act, 1946, and of theHousing Act, 1949. Under the Act of 1946 a hill farmer whoimproved housing accommodation on his farm, with Exchequerassistance, had to give an ordinary tenancy; and, in reply to criticismsthat a service tenancy should have been allowed, the Government hadargued that in case of need a certificate could be granted under theAct of 1933. Similarly, in -December 1950, the Government had opposed the second reading of a Private Member&apos;s Bill to allow thecreation of service tenancies under the Hill Farming Act, 1946. on theground that farmers had adequate protection under the procedure for the grant of certificates. This aspect of the matter required further examination before legislation was promised.The Minister of Agriculture said that his information suggestedthat certificates were being granted at the rate of about 600 a year,which represented about half the number of applications made forcertificates. Although representatives of the trade unions concerned had indicated that they would be satisfied with a measure on the lines proposed, the National Union of Agricultural Workers had conducteda long agitation against the tied cottage system as a whole,, and it was difficult to believe that there would not be considerable pressure fora wider Bill.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It might be desirable to confine any repeal of the 1933 pro-vision to houses which were outside a farm. This would leave theprovision to operate in respect of houses on farms, as had been contemplated in the debates on the Hill Farming Act, 1946, and the hill Farming Bill, 1950.(h) The proposal to proceed with a measure of the kind proposed would make it less easy for the Government to plead that they couldnot make piecemeal amendments, however desirable, in the RentActs. There were other aspects of the law relating to tied cottageswhich caused greater hardship and seemed to call for earlier remedial action.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal in CP. (51) 196 to repealparagraph (g) (ii) of the First Schedule to the Rent andMortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1933.(2) Invited the Minister of Local Government and the Ministerof Agriculture to discuss with the Secretary of State forScotland whether, having regard to the statements made during the passage of the Hill Farming Act, 1946, and onsubsequent occasions, the scope of the repeal should be restricted so as not to cover houses on farms improvedunder the provisions of the 1946 Act.(3) Subject to the outcome of the discussions under Conclusion (2)above, authorised the Minister of Local Government andthe Agriculture Ministers to announce that at an appro-priate time legislation would be introduced to amend theAct of 1933 in the manner proposed.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\2th July, 1951.
