CONFIDENTIALRLIAMENTARYFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.vention ofrrorismmporaryovisions Act)THE HOME SECRETARY said that the House of Commons would beasked on 18 March to approve the Order continuing for a furtheryear the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism (TemporaryProvisions) Act 1976.    The Opposition were deeply divided on theirattitude to the Order, and their spokesman on Home Affairs(Mr Hattersley) had approached him with the suggestion that theGovernment might institute a review of the necessity for the Act.When he had replied that he did not think that the Government wouldconsider any form of review which called in question the continuingneed for the legislation, Mr Hattersley had proposed a review of theworking of the Act, to the findings of which the Government need notbe committed:  if the Government proposed such a review, he wouldadvise the Opposition not to vote against the renewal of the Act. Ifthe Government did not promise some form of review, theOpposition vvere likely to put down a motion asking for a review ofthe neces-aity, for the Act, which would be debated before the motionon the Order continuing it in force.    The powers in the Act hadgreatly contributed to the successful combating of terrorism andthere could, in present circumstances, be no question of consideringabandoning them.    He saw no case for a further review of theoperation of the provisions since Lord Shackleton had carried outsuch a review in 197 8.    While he would have preferred to obtain ameasure of all-Party support for the continuance of what wereundoubtedly difficult provisions, he did not think it right to accede toMr Hattersley&apos;s suggestion, and proposed, therefore, that theGovernment should not recommend a review of the working of the Act.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thathe agreed with the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal. The Act remainedof value in Northern Ireland as well as in Great Britain.The Cabinet -1.       Agreed that proposals by the Opposition for areview of the need for the Prevention of Terrorism(Temporary Provisions) Act, or of its operation,should be resisted.&apos;Wlife and&quot;itryside BillTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the ReportStage of the Wildlife and Countryside Bill in the Hou^e of Lords hadbegun on 10 March.    He hoped that it would be possible to send theBill to the House of Commons by the end of March or early in April,but considerable difficulties would arise during the remaining Lords&apos;1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALstages.    These would be most acute during the debates on theGovernment amendments on sites of special scientific interest which,in accordance with the decision of the Home and Social AffairsCommittee, would strengthen the position of the agricultural interestsat the expense of the conservationists.mpaniesBilleviousference::(8l) 4thillusions,.ute 1.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he was verydoubtful whether it would prove possible to carry at CommitteeStage in the House of Lords the provisions of the Companies Billwhich dealt with the abolition of ths Register of Business Nameb,These provisions were strongly opposed by the relevant consumerinterest groups, and had attracted virtually no support at SecondReading.    If they were deleted, the Bill would contain little of majorinterest, apart from the proposals on companies&apos; purchase of theirown shares, although consideration was currently being given toadding provisions on the disclosure of interest in shares which,because of lack of Parliamentary time, had not been included in theBill as introduced.rriage of theince of Waleseviousference:(81) 9thnclusions,nute 4THE PRIME MINISTER said that the proposal for a public holidayon the occasion of the marriage of the Prince of Wales on 29 Julyhad now been agreed with the palace.    She intended to announce thedecision that afternoon in a Written Reply to a long-standingunstarred Parliamentary Question by Mr Arthur Lewis MP.The Cabinet -2.Took note.ernal AuditoceduresTUB CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Comptrollerand Auditor General (C and AG) had prepared a highly critical reportfor the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) about the state cf internalaudit in Government.    The report would probably be published withinthe next week or two.    The C and AG had found that internal audit inGovernment, particularly in the area of computer audit, had sufferedfrom a lack of professionalism and top management support.Similar criticisms of internal audit in local government had recentlybeen made by the Chief Inspector of Local Government External Audit.Although the C and AG had not identified specific cases of fraud, hehad suggested that systematic abuse was unlikely to come to lightunder existing procedures.    These criticisms were soundly basecj,and when the report was published the Government had to expectadverse publicity on the grounds that they were apparently unable toexerci se effective overall control of the administration.    There wasCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALan urgent need for the central Departments to adopt a morepositive role on standards of financial management and controlthroughout Government Departments.    The Permanent Secretary tothe Treasury and the Head of the Civil Service intended to send ajoint letter to other Permanent Secretaries suggesting a long-termprogramme of reform, and asking them to take a close personalinterest in their Department&apos;s internal audit arrangements including,in particular, the level and quality of staffing of the sectionsconcerned.    He hoped that all Ministers in charge of Departmentswould ensure that swift and effective action in response to thisinitiative was taken by their officials.The Cabinet -3.       Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALeignAIRSeviousrence:}1) 9 thelusions,ute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe London negotiations with Guatemala had ended successfully withHeads of Agreement being signed by the Guatemalan Foreign Minister,Ing Castillo, by the Prime Minister of Belize, Mr Price, and by theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Ridley. Thisrepresented a considerable personal achievexnent by Mr Ridley, whohad over a long period devoted much effort to winning and retainingthe confidence of both the Guatemalans and the Belizeans.    A fullagreement was not yet assured, and the Guatemalans in particularmight still encounter strong domestic opposition to the proposedsettlement, but it would be harder for either side to puj.1 back now thatHeads of Agreement had been signed.    If a full settlement werereached, it might not be necessary for British forces to remain inBelize for long after independence, but the Belizeans would needBritish help in building up their own forces.    A complicating factorwas that, while Britain1 s main concern had been the danger ofGuatemalan attack on Belize, the United States Government were moreworried about the possibility of Belize being used as a base for left-wing subversion against Guatemala.COTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad had an interesting talk with the Mexican Foreign Minister,Senor Castaneda, who had come to London for a meeting of MexicanAmbassadors.    He was clearly eager that the United States President,Mr Reagan, should attend the proposed &quot;North/South&quot; Summit meetingin Mexico.    To that end he seemed ready to contemplate a shortpostponement of the proposed date.    But he had expressed his concernthat, if the Mexico meeting took place after the industrialised countries&apos;seven-power Summit meeting in Ottawa, the developing countries wouldlikewise hold a preliminary Summit meeting of their own, which wouldincrease the danger of a systematic clash between the two groupswhen they got to Mexico.    He had also spoken about the situation inEl Salvador and had insisted in somewhat extravagant terms that Cubaninvolvement was not a major factor there./Iranviouserence:181} 8thelusions,ute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePrime Minister and he had had useful meetings with the Iraqi ForeignMinister, Dr Sa&apos;adoun Hammadi, who had recently visited London.The Iraqi regime was not an attractive one.    But Britain&apos;s trade withIraq had developed substantially from a very low base over the pasttwo years, and there was now a prospect of substantial arms sales,since the Iraqis seemed determined to move away from their previousreliance on Soviet arms supplies.    There was little prospect of acease-fire between Iraq and Iran, and fighting might indeed intensifywhen the rainy season ended.    The Iraqis were strongly opposed toBritain supplying Iran with spare parts or other military equipment.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSuch supplies were in any case out of the question until the Britishbusinessman detained in Iran had been freed.    He hoped that he hadpersuaded the Iraqi Foreign Minister that it would be ridiculous to seeany threat to Iraq in Britain releasing thereafter the fleet auxiliaryvessel Kharg which had been built for the Iranian navy but was verylightly armed and at present unseaworthy.    If other military suppliesto Iran were aljo resumed, however^ the chance of securing largemilitary orders from Iraq would be much reduced.i AfricaIviouserence:81) 8thiclu sions,mte 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that acrisis over Namibia was approaching, and it seemed likely that newmandatory sanctions against South Africa would be demanded at ameeting of the United Nations Security Council in mid-April. Inter-national hostility to South Africa was mounting.    It was not yet clearwhat would be the effect of the list of persons involved in sportingcontacts with South Africa which the United Nations Centre againstApartheid was reportedly about to publish.     This issue might wellcause difficulty at the next Commonwealth Heads of GovernmentMeeting at Melbourne in September, if damaging attempts were madeto extend the scope of the existing Gleneagles Agreement.Ited Nations THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that afterof the Sea nearly seven years the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference hadiference almost reached agreement on a major new International Convention.But the new United States Administration, apparently under theinfluence of American companies hostile to the proposed regime fordeep seabed mining, had now replaced their delegation with a newteam headed by a known opponent of the proposed Convention, andwere refusing to proceed further until they had had time to review thepolicy issues involved.    This had caused considerable dismay both inEurope and among the developing countries.    The matter was of majorimportance to Britain on a number of counts, and he would be consultingclosely with his colleagues concerned.&apos;iet UnionNousjference:|(81) 9thMusions,ke 2THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Soviet Ambassador, Mr Popov,had delivered to her on 9 March a personal message from PresidentBrezhnev. The Soviet Government were clearly making an effort toappear reasonable in their approach to arms control negotiations anda possible Summit meeting with the Americans. Their hope was nodoubt to sow division between the United States and Europe.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMUNITYairseriescyviousrence:81) 9thelusions,ute 33. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that, following the unsatisfactory proposals on fisheries accesswhich the Commission had adopted, the Foreign and CommoiiwealthSecretary and he had met the President of the Commission,M Thorn and M Kontogeorgis, the Commissioner responsible forFisheries, on the morning of Monday, 9 March.    The British casehad been fully explained to them, but at the subsequent meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Fisheries) the Commission had been consistentlyunhelpful and had even sought to dissuade the Dutch Presidency fromputting forward compromise proposals closer to the British position.It seemed that M Thorn, who had gone on to visit the French PrimeMinister in Paris on 9 March, was supporting the French point of view.moncultural&apos;cyTHE PRIME MINISTER reported that, at a meeting earlier that day,the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had decided that, in theforthcoming negotiations on agricultural prices, we should argue forincreases in general no higher than those proposed by the Commissionand lower increases on cer als and Mediterranean products.    It wouldnot be realistic to advocate increases significantly lower than thoseproposed by the Commission.     Moreover seme price increases werenecessary to meet the needs of the British farming industry,especially in the grassland areas.    If price increases above thoseproposed by the Commission were in question, it would be necessaryto consider some revaluation of the Green Pound.    In the negotiationsthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would oppose theextension of co-responsibility levies applied to production generally,but support the so-called super levy on additional milk production, andseek continuation of the premium payments for beef.    It would also bean object of policy to seek agreement that the level of agriculturalexpenditure within the Community should be held down to a rate ofincrease markedly lower than the increase in the Community&apos;s ownresources.The Cabinet -Took note.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL1LSERVICE PAYviouserence:(81) 9thfusions,ute 14. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatthe response to the civil service unions&apos; call for a one day strikeof the non-industrial Civil Service on Monday 9 March had met witha response of about 60 per cent of the union membership of thenon-industrial Civil Service.    Selective industrial action wascontinuing:  on 11 March some 1, 200 people had been on strike.The consequences of this industrial action had so far beenmanageable, but it was not yet clear what forms further selectiveaction might take.    He would be considering the Government&apos;sfurther action with the Prime Minister shortly.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the responseto the call for strike action had been relatively high in the InlandRevenue, in the Department of National Savings and in particularin Customs and Excise.    Action at Customs and Excise hadmainly taken the forms of withdrawal of coverage on the borderbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic, an attempt to blocktrade between British and Irish ports, and the withdrawal ofdata processors from work in the VAT computer at Southend.If this last action was continued for much longer, the point wouldbe very quickly reached where there vvould be no work for son eof those not now on strike and they would have to be sent homewithout pay.The Cabinet -Took note,Cabinet Office12 March 19817CONFIDENTIAL
