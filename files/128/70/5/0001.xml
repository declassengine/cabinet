The Cabinet were informed of business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.Iron and Steel BillTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that Legislation Committee hadconsidered the draft Iron and Steel Bill the previous da.y. TheBill had been drafted to give effect to decisions of the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy on the corporate plan of theBritish Steel Corporation (BSC) and to make provision for furtheradvances to the BSC after their present borrowing limit wasreached at the end of February.    The Solicitor General hadadvised the Committee that the rse of this measure to provide forthe increase in the Corporation&apos;s borrowing limit was of doubtfullegal propriety, since it would in effect mean that the borrowingin excess of the existing Umit would not have statutory cover untilthe Bill received Royal Assent, which was not likely to be untilthe end of June.      In these circumstances, Legislation Committeehad felt unable to approve the Bill in its existing form, and hadinvited him to discuss the problem further with the Ministersconcerned.    As a result of these further consultations, it hau nowbeen agreed, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, that theraising of the borrowing limit would be dealt with in a separateshort Bill (which would be a money Bill) to be passed by the end ofFebruary;  the main Bill, modified as necessary, would thenproceed on the original timetable.    The Secretary of State forIndustry would be seeking the agreement of the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy in correspondence to tf~e termsof a statement on the BSC&apos;s corporate plan to be made as early aspossible the following week.    The statement would be followedimmediately by the publication of both Bills.    A day would be setaside in the week beginning 16 February, in which he hoped it wouldbe possible for the Bill on the borrowing limits to pass through allits stages in the House of Commons.    This woula give a firstopportunity for a general debate on the corporate plan, and theGovernment&apos;s response to it.   He invited the Cabinet to give theirapproval in principle to the introduction of both Bills and theirpublication as soon as the Secretary of State for Industry had madea statement, with the final texts of the Bills being cleared formallyby Legislation Committee without the need for a special meeting.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, supporting theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General&apos;srecommendation, said that it would be convenient if the short Billon borrowing limits could complete all its stages in the House ofCommons by close of business on 18 February, so that it could beprinted in time to be taken through the House of Lords in the weekbeginning 23 February.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that a separate Bill raising the borrowing limitof the British Steel Corporation should be prepared as soon aspossible and introduced into the House of Commons at the same timeas the Iron and Steel Bill containing the necessary legislativeprovisions to implement the Government&apos;s policy towards the BSC.The Secretary of State for Industry should outline that policy ina statement to be made o*i the same day as the Bills were published*The Cabinet also agreed that the passage of the Bills throughParliament should be on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General.The Cabinet -1, Invited the Secretary of State for Industry -i. to circulate a draft statement on the corporateplan of the British Steel Corporation to theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy forapproval;ii, to circulate the text of a Bill to raise theborrowing limit of the British Steel Corporationand the revised text of the Iron and Steel Bill toLegislation Committee for approval;iii. subject to i. and ii., to arrange with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andPaymaster General and the Chief Whip to makethe proposed statement in the House of Commonsand for the introduction of the two Bills in thatHouse.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General, in consultation with the Chief Whipand ifce Lord President of the Council, to seek to arrangefor the passage of the short Bill to be expedited as heproposed.fgislative&apos;gramme10-81&quot;viousjference:F) 3rdfusions,pute 1THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL recalled that at their meeting on22 January the Cabinet had agreed that the Petroleum andContinental Shelf Bill should be published and introduced into theHouse of Commons as soon as possible, with the intention ofmaking further progress in the current Session only if sufficientParliamentary time could be made available.    The text of the Billhad been approved by Legislation Committee at their meeting theprevious day, but no decision had been reached about itsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALintroduction.    He was concerned that once the Bill had beenintroduced, there would be constanc pressure on the businessmanagers to find time for it to make further progress.    It wasnow virtually certain that this would be impossible this Session.Apart from the likelihood that a significant amount of time wouldhave to be provided for legislation on the Canadian constitution,the Opposition were now demanding a whole day&apos;s debate cn the Billthat had become necessary to raise the borrowing limit of theRedundancy Fund, and a further day would probably have to beprovided for another unforeseen Bill, to give additional financialassistance to the Port of London Authority a id the Mersey Docksand Harbour Company.    If the Petroleum and Continental ShelfBill were to be handled in the way agreed by the Cabinet, therefore,it should be clearly understood that the prospects for proceedingbeyond First Reading in the present Session were negligible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet accepted that the severe pressures on the legislativeprogramme in both Houses meant that it was very unlikely that anysubstantive progress could be made with the Petroleum andContinental Shelf Bill in the current Session.    On the other hand,the issues dealt with in the Bill were central to the Government&apos;seconomic and industrial strategy, and their cm supporters wouldneed to be reassured that any failure to pass the Bill this Sessiondid not imply a loss of political momentum.    For this reason, theCabinet confirmed their earlier decision that the Bill should beintroduced and published as soon as possible.    The Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General should considerwith the Secretary of State for Energy how best to make it clearthat, although it would probably not be possible to make progresswith the Bill in the present Session, it would in that event bereintroduced as a matter of priority at the beginning of &apos;lie1981-82 Session.The Cabinet -3. Reaffirmed their decision that the draftPetroleum and Continental Shelf Bill as approved byLegislation Committee should be introduced in theHouse of Commons as soon as porsible.4. Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation .vith the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and Paymaster General and the Chief Whip,to make arrangements accordingly.5. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Energy, to consider further themost appropriate way of announcing the Government&apos;sintentions about the further handling of the Bill.3CONFIDENTIAL

TH:.J FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe future course of events in Poland remained difficult to predict.The latest compromise between the Government and the Solidaritymovement had been once again in the latter&apos;s favour.    It was notclear how long the Government could continue to give way, not leastbecause of the country&apos;s worsening economic crieis.    He had recentlydiscussed the situation with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr Fahr,who was regarded as a good judge of Polish affairs.    Dr Pahrbelieved that compromises would continue to be reached, althoughhe acknowledged that others were less optimistic;  he also thoughtthat in the last resort the Polish army might prefer to undertake anynecessary military repression themselves, if the alternative was forthe country to be subjected to a Soviet invasion.    It was notable thatthe Polish communist party leader, Mr Kania, had recently beengetting rather less publicity than one of his colleagues, Mr Olszowsky,who was believed to be more of a hard-liner and might be beinggroomed as a successor. or wayTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that themilitary strategy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation could beundermined by the proposal for a nuclear-free zc^ie in northernEurope which was currently being canvassed by the ruling LabourParty in Norway and wa&lt;- having some influence on public opinionelsewhere, notably in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. Itappeared, however, that the new Norwegian Prime Minister,Mrs Brundtland, though a member of the Labour Party, was likelyto be more resistant to this idea than her predecessor;  and it wasin any case expected that the Norwegian general elections inSeptember would be won by the right wing rather than by the LabourParty.The Cabinet -Took nc te.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi0MNJTNITYirjfAlRS3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said itwas clear from the talks he had recently had with Madame Flesch,the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, that there was likely to be a rowin the European Community over the siting of the institutions. Inparticular, the French Government, in spite of its reserved attitudetowards the European Parliament, was determined that Strasbourgshould become its permanent site.    On the other hand, the LuxembourgGovernment was equally determined not to give up the significantfinancial and political advantages which derived frcm having the staffand some meetings of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.While the Belgian Government were not taking any public stance, theywere working behind the scenes to enhance the claims of Brussels.The Members of the European Parliament were understandablyanxious to avoid the perpetuation of the present inconvenience ofmeeting in three places, and had called on the Council of Ministers totake a decision by June of this year.    It was unlikely that agreementwould be reached, and the problem would still be outstanding duringthe British Presidency.    In the meantime, since there was nomajor United Kingdom interest at stake, the British Governmentneed not take up a position.In a brief discussion, reference was made to the damaging publicityfor the Community following Press stories about expensive overseasvisits by Members of the European Parliament, including those fromthe European Democratic Group.    The costs involved seemed likelyto be excessive both in relation to any benefits which might accrue andin relation to the costs of overseas visits by Members of the BritishParliament.    Subject to checking the figures to which publicity hadbeen given, the Government could reasonably express its concernabout lavish expenditure of this kind.It was aloo noted that a recent opinion poll commissioned by theConsumers Association suggested a worrying fall of public supportfor British membership of the European Community.    It also showedthat this reflected a very large measure of misunderstanding andignorance.The Cabinet -1.Took note.Serieslicypiousjference:F) 4th[fusions,Pte 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said hehad met the French Minister of Fisheries in Paris on J Februaryand after an amicable, full and promising discussion it had been agreedthat officials should follow up the various issues in preparation forthe forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on9-10 February.    The following morning, however, the FrenchMinister had informed the Commission and the Dutch Presidency thathe saw no prospect of agreement and officials had subsequently beenCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALinformed that the French side saw no point in a further meeting. Itwas difficult to understand this sudden change in the French position.He had fully informed the German Government of his efforts to reachagreement with the French, in the hope that, during the currentFranco-German summit talks, the Federal Chancellor would have jomsinfluence on the French position.    The Germans had a strong interestin an early settlement of the Common   Fisheries Policy. Meanwhile,the leaders of the fishing industry continued to support theGovernments negotiating position and would, as usual, be inattendance during the forthcoming Fisheries Council.The fishing industry was nevertheless in grave difficulties. TheScottish fieet had already stopped fishing, and other ports wereincreasingly finding it unprofitable to continue.    The high value ofsterling made it possible to sell fish imported from the Netherlandsand other Community countries in this country at prices with whichit was impossible for the British fishing industry to compete. TheGermans and the Danes, as well as the Dutch, were landing fish inHolland which was subsequently freighted at low cost to ports in bothScotland and England.    The industry had also produced invoiceswhich suggested that they were having to pay considerably more forfuel than their French or Dutch competitors.    The French industryhad for some time enjoyed a fuel subsidy to which the Commissionhad raised no objection, and it seemed as if the French Government,no doubt with the forthcoming Presidential elections in mind, hadrecently increased the rate of subsidy.    This was available to allfishing vessels taking on fuel in French ports, not just to Frenchvessels, and some British owners were refuelling in French portsto take advantage of this.    The financial position of the industry rowappeared to be worse than at the time when the Government haddecided to give the temporary financial assistance which was due tolast until 31 March.    He had spoken to the Dutch Minister responsiblefor fisheries who had undertaken to try to moderate the level of Dutchexports, but this would be difficult since the trade was not illegal.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said there would beanother protest meeting on 6 February of fishermen at Peterhead andFraserburgh.    Another covert attempt by Scottish Nationalistswould undoubtedly be made to oust the current moderate leadership;so far, the Government had not been able to give the moderates muchhelp.In the following discussion, questions were raised as to whetherBritish fishermen really were disadvantaged over fuel costs. Pricesfor diesel, petrol and gas oil were now if anything lower than thosein other European countries, and only in the case of heavy fuel oilwere we near the top of the range.    The suggestion that subsidiesbrought down the cost of fuel oil in France needed to be checked.Nevertheless, it was clear that there was a serious risk of a furtherrun   down or cessation of fishing activity in ports like Fleetwood,6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLowestofc and Whitby, as well as in Peterhead and Fraserburgh.It would be difficult to stop imports from other Community countriesbenefiting from lower exchange rates.    Some additional action tosupport the fishing industry appeared to be necessary irrespectiveof the progress of negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy,and despite the potential embarrassment to the Government ofsingling out this particular part of the private sector for specialassistance.    If further help were given to the industry, it would beimportant to stress its special characteristics.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discu-si on, said theCabinet agreed that it was necessary to give some immediate indicationof the Government&apos;s concern over the plight of the fishing industry.She would take an early opportunity of indicating that the Governmentwas ready to review the amount and duration of aid to the fishingindustry.   The Minister of Agriculture F-i*h.*ri6  an.dJTffod and thoSecretary of State for Scotland should review the financial etate of theindustry, as a matter of urgency, and-report, with proposals asappropriate, to the Ministerial Cciamitte  on Economic Strategy.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3. Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland to reviewthe financial state of the fishing industry and to report tothe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on &lt;necase for further Government assistance.MMUNITY 4. THE HOME SECRETARY   said that he had the previous dayLATI^NS received a deputation of the Joint Committee against Racialism whichhad presented him with a dossier on the activities of the BritishMovement.    He did not welcome the publicity given to this occasionby The Times that morning, but the Cabinet should be under noillusions about the fact that the British Movement, a neo-fascist group,had replaced the National Front as the main promoter of racialharrassment, was actively engaged in violent attakes not only oncoloured* communities but also on the Jewish community, and wasrecruiting supporters in schools as well as in groups of older people.He had told the deputation that he would discuss with the police thepossibility of setting up special police units to monitor and investigateracialist attacks.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOR.EIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, inthe course of his talks with the British Board of Jews on othermatters, they had also voiced their growing disquiet at th^ increasingscale of attacks on the Jewish community in this country, although forobvious reasons they did not wish to draw public attention to them.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office5 February 19818CONFIDENTIAL
