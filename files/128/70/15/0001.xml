SECRETARLIAMENTARY      1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken infFAlRS the House of Commons during the following week.ermanagh and5uth Tyrone-ElectionTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the res&quot;.lt of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-electionwould probably be declared the following afternoon, and the writwould be returned at Westminster or. Monday 13 April,    One ofthe two candidates was Mr Robert Sands who had served 4 yearsof a 14 year sentence for terrorism.    The Forfeiture Act 1870had imposed a statutory disqualification on any person convictedof felony and sentenced to any term of imprisonment exceeding12 months.    These provisions had, however, been repealed by theCriminal Law Act 1967, which had abolished the distinctionbetween felonies and misdemeanours, Convicted prisoners, thoughdisqualified from voting in Parliamentary elections, were nowfree to stand as candidates and to be elected.    If Mr Sands wereelected, and did not (as he had suggested he might) immediatelyweek to resign the seat, there would be strong pressure for him tobe allowed to attend the House, to see constituents, and to writeand receive letters on constituency matters.    Refusal of suchfacilities would provide the occasion for demonstrations and furthercivil unrestin the Province.    His own view was that the bestresponse to the election of Mr Sands would be for an immediateresolution to be moved in the House of Commons expelling him asan unfit person, though this would not prevent Mr Sands fromstanding again at the ensuing by-election in the same constituency.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL agpsed that the right course would be forMr Sands if elected to be expelled as an unfit person.    The presentindications were, however, that an immediate Government Motionto this effect might be highly controversial.    It might be preferableto inspire a backbench Member to table an early day motion, andfor the Government not to declare their hand until strong and ifpossible all Party support for Mr Sands&apos;s expulsion had becomeclear.In discussion, it was agreed that there would be considerabledangers if Mr Sands&apos;s expulsion from the House of Commonsbecame a matter of great controversy.    On the other hand, if theGovernment took no action, the Ulster Unionists were very likelyto move an expulsion motion, and to seek to make political capitalout of the Government&apos;s alleged dilatoriness.    There wereprecedents for expelling Members elected after they had beenconvicted of serious offences, though these all predated theCriminal Law Amendment Act 1967.    It might be undesirable tochange the law in such a way as to give a returning officer the1SECRET
power to preclude a convicted offender from standing as acandidate but there was a strong case for passing a short Billdisqualifying any person who had been convicted of specifiedoffences, or sentenced to more than a specified minimum term ofimprisonment, from becoming a Member of Parliament. Anvsuch legislation should not be retrospective.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should be seen to takeimmediate and effective action in the event of Mr Sands beingelected as Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Subjectto further study of the legal position, the best course appeared tobe for the Government to move a Motion expelling Mr Sands fromthe House as soon as the writ had been returned, and then tointroduce a short Bill restoring the position on statutory disqualifica-tion substantially to what it had been before 1967.    The mattershould be urgently considered by a group of Ministers comprisingthe Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the ChancelL r of theDuchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General, the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland, the Chief Secretary, Treasury and vheAttorney General, which should agree the text of a statementwhich the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might if necessarymake the following afternoon.The Cabinet1.       Took note.fclect CommitteesIteviousperence:31) 3rdInclusions,finute 1THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that a reportpublished the previous day by the Select Committee on the Treasuryand Civil Service had criticised the Government&apos;s budget strategy.Although this was formally an agreed report, the accompanyingPress conference had revealed deep divisions of opinion within theCommittee.    Because of absences by Conservative Members, theOpposition had been in the majority at some important sittings ofthe Committee.    The way in which the report had been draftedand presented did not reflect to the credit of the Committee, andthe report was unlikely to do serious damage to the Government.The incident was, however, illustrative of the difficulties whichhad arisen, largely because of the attitude or absence of theGovernment&apos;s own supporters, in several of the DepartmentalSelect Committees.In discussion, it was noted that the Committee of Selection haddecided as a matter of policy not to select officers of backbenchParliamentary groups as members of Select Committees. Thishad been a bad decision, since such officers were among theMembers best qualified to deal with the subjects for which theSECRETSECRET
SECRET#Committees were responsible.    It was, however, possible for amember of a Sslect Committee subsequently to accept office in aParliamentary group.    Some Conservative Members of SelectCommittees appeared to place their loyalty to the Committeeshighei than their loyalty to the Government, and to attach toomuch importance to facilitating the preparation of unanimouslyagreed reports.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had previously had occasion to express their dissatisfactionwith the attitudes and attendance records of some ConservativeMembers of Departmental Select Committees.    They noted thatthe Chief Whip had already raised this issue strongly with theConservative Chairmen or majority leaders of the SelectCommittees, and that he and the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster would continue to take every opportunity over the comingmonths to reiterate the Government&apos;s concern that its ownsupporters on Select Committees should attend all meetings andensure that the Government&apos;s views were adequately representedboth in discussions and in any published reports.    Other Ministersshould also maintain informal contact with Conservative Membersof their Departmental Select Committees.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, andinvited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General, the Chief Whip and otherMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.fence Matters THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that it mightprove necessary for him to make a Parliamentary statement,before the House rose for the Easter Recess, on certain defencematters.    If he judged that such a statement was necessary, hewould circulate a text in advance to the Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Defence to consult the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster and Paymaster General about thetiming of his statement, if it proved necessary tomake one.3SECRET

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat for the moment some of the tension had gone out of theinternal situation in Poland, but the crisis had not been resolved.At the recent Czech Party Congress, which had been attended byPresident Brezhnev on behalf of the Soviet Union, Poland had beenrepresented by a hard-liner, Mr Olszowsky;  and the atmosphereon that occasion had not augered well for the Poles. Meanwhile,Western contingency plans in the case of Soviet action againstPoland were as well prepared as was possible in the circumstances.Western agreement was also in process of being reached on how tohandle the problem of Poland&apos;s debts; but this was of coursesubject to any overriding political or military developments.BelizePreviousReference:X(81) 14thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Belize was confused.    The Constitutional Conference inLondon was proceeding satisfactorily, but the Premier, Mr Price,and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Aranda, were not themselvesparticipating in it.    The Conference was expected to end thefollowing week, and the implications for British policy ought then tobe clearer.    He would be consulting the Prime Minister on the nextsteps.pina/Hong KongTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that onhis recent visit to Hong Kong he had found the businesscommunity apprehensive, not so much about what might happenwhen the New Territories lease expired in 1997, but rather aboutthe implications for investors&apos; confidence of the fact that normal15-year mortgages would soon be running into the post-1997 period.The danger of a general collapse of business confidence in HongKong could not be ignored.    During his subsequent visit to Peking,he had raised the matter with the Vice-Chairman of the ChineseCommunist Party, Mr Deng Xiaoping, who had replied with astrong reaffirmation of his earlier assurances that investors hadnothing to fear.    This statement had for the time being had abeneficial effect on Hong Kong opinion, but investors were notlikely to be wholly reassured by general assurances of this kind,particularly from someone of Mr Deng&apos;s advanced age.    It had -lot,however, been practicable to press the matter further on thisoccasion.   Although the Chinese leaders valued Hong Kong&apos;sexistence, they clearly regarded it as a minor matter, dwarfed bythe magnitude of their domestic affairs and internationally of muchless immediate concern to them th^.n the problem o* Taiwan,Among the leadership, Mr Deng, despite his age, appeared to bethe only outstanding personality.    The Prime Minister, Mr ZhaoZiyang, was not impressive,    Mr Hua Guofeng&apos;s likely successoras Chairman of the Farty, Mr Hu Yaobang, was spoken of as apotential leader of quality;  but he had not met him and had nottherefore been able to judge,4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN /. ND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that onhis visit to Tokyo he had been primarily concerned to underline theunacceptability of the large imbalance of trade between the UnitedKingdom and Japan,    The Japanese Government had not beenunresponsive on the subject, although the arguments available to himwere not easy to sustain.    In their international outlook the Japaneseclearly attached far more importance to the United States than toEurope;  and he had had to emphasise strongly the need for Japan&apos;spolicies to take account of European interests.PakistanPreviousReference:CC(81) 12th(Conclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGovernment in Pakistan, which he had also visited, seemed in morerobust mood than earlier, particularly in relation to Afghanistan.Following the resolution of the crisis over the Pakistani airlinerhi-jacked to Kabul and Damascus, the internal position ofPresident Zia&apos;s government had  strengthened;  and early Pakistanirecognition of the present Afghan regime was now unlikely. ButPakistan&apos;s relations with the United States were not close, and thePakistanis attached special importance to their relations withBritain.    It could be useful, and would be much appreciated, if thePrime Minister were able to visit the country eg on her way homefrom the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.Ned StatesPreviousReference:|CC(81) 14thConclusions,inute 2In the course of a brief discussion it was pointed out that the newUnited States Administration tended to ignore the interaction of onemajor international issue on another, and to see the problems ofeg Africa or Arab-Israel relations too much in terms of East-Westconfrontation.    It would be important to try to guide them towardsmore sensitive attitudes and a less simplistic view of the world.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, in adiscussion on restructuring of the Community Budget at an informalmeeting of Finance Ministers over the previous weekend, the Germanrepresentative, Dr Schulmann, had reiterated his Government&apos;sdissatisfaction with the present budgetary arrangements and theirwish to see the German net contribution subject to a ceiling in thesame way as the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution, and had alsoemphasised the need to maintain the existing 1 per cent VAT limiton own resources, and to reduce the proportion of the budgetallocated to agriculture.    The Chancellor said that he had supportedthe German statement, as had the Greek representative.    The IrishFinance Minister had expressed some anxiety; the French hadremained silent.    The latest estimates suggested that France hadstill been a net beneficiary from the Community budget in 1980, andthat she would only be a small ret contributor in 1981 after con-tributing towards our budget refunds.    He would inform colleaguesas foon as these estimates were officially published by theCommission.:oposed THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the mainluncil on discussion at an informal meeting of Employment Ministers had beenlemployment the arrangements for a joint Council of Finance, Economic andEmployment Ministers, as already agreed in principle by the:evious European Council.    We did not wish to organise such a meetingiference: during our Presidency, and if an early meeting could not be arranged-(81) 13th under the Dutch Presidency we would hope to ensure that theinclusions, necessary preparatory work would carry the date of such a meetinginute 3 into 1982.In a brief discussion it was suggested that the Dutch Government,which faced an election, was not anxious to hold such a &quot;jumbo&quot;Council which would not be able to produce any instant solutions tothe problem of unemployment within the Community.    On the otherhand, it was argued that, since no positive outcome from such ameeting could be expected, there was much to be said for holdingit as soon as possible.    It might be difficult to postpone a meetingwhich had already been agreed to in principle for a further ninemonths.Idements by THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theesident recent statements by the President of the French Republic during?Car^ an election interview casting doubts on the United Kingdom&apos;s fitness staing for membership of the European Community were unacceptable.He welcomed the replies which had been given by the Prime Ministerin her speech to the Diplomatic and Commonwealth WritersAssociation and by the Lord Privy Seal in the Commons debate, theprevious day.    These statements could not have been allowed togo unanswered.6CONFIDENTIAL

SECRET5DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINETCOPY NO9LIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(81) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 9 April 1981 at 10.00 amm SERVICEAYsviousference:;(81) 13thondusions,inute 4The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(81) 14), to which was attached a note by officials,on Civil Service pay.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there was nosign that the current industrial action in the Civil Service wasweakening.    3, 500 staff were on strike and the unions were havingno difficulty in pulling out key staff in the areas they had chosen.Many wf those not on strike were sympathetic to the unions&apos;objectives of securing the reintroduction of satisfactory payresearch and arbitration arrangements.    In his judgment, thestrikes would not peter out, and the longer they went on the moredifficult it would be to reach an agreement.    He recommended thatthe Government should stand fast on the offer of a 7 per cent increasein pay from April 1981.    If this were accepted, it would be necessaryto negotiate the ending of the present industrial action on the basis ofproposals for longer term arrangements and for arrangements forthe 1982 settlement.    The unions had already been told that theGovernment wished to find a new, ordered and agreed system ofdetermining Civil Service pay for the longer term.    A group ofofficials (MISC 54) would be making proposals in a report immediatelyafter Easter, but any proposals which the Government put forwardwere likely to be unwelcome to the unions, by comparison with theold arrangements, and his provisional judgment was that in orderto find a sufficiently authoritative basis for a new system it wouldbe necessary to set up a high-powered independent inquiry.    In themeantime it would be necessary to reach agreement on the arrange-ments for the 1982 settlement:  he believed that the Governmentwould need to agree to negotiate with the unions and, should the needarise, to go to arbitration.    He could not be certain that a packageof this type would bring the industrial actien to an end;  but, if theunions were not to accept it, it would give the Government a goodbasis on which to appeal to moderate opinion in the Civil Service.1SECRET
SECRETIn discussion it was noted that industrial action was spreadingand in some areas the more militant strikers were becomingopenly and even violently aggressive.    Those continuing to workin the offices affected by strikes were coming under increasingpressure from their colleagues, and their morale was sufferingfrom uncertainty over the Government&apos;s objectives for dealingwith the situation.    Morale among non-striking staff was also low,and seme senior staff had felt moved to endorse the action of theirjunior staff in pressing for satisfactory arrangements for thelonger term.    So far the general public were unsympathetic to thestriKe but there were daggers in letting the action drift on.Although the Government could probably win if they were to hoid outfor a few months, this would be at the expense of serious long termdamage to Civil Service morale and probably of increasinginconvenience to the general public.In further discussion the following points arose:-a  It was generally agreed that the Governmentshould stand fast on the pay offer of 7 per cent frorrApril 1981.b. There was no guarantee that the pacKage proposedby the Lord President of the Council for the 1982 settlementwould bring the dispute to an end.    The unions would belooking for firm assurances that negotiations in 1982 couldnot in the last resort be overridden by the cash limitimposed by the Government, and would therefore want thedecision of any arbitral b*dy to be binding on both sides.c. The Government could not give up itsresponsibility to determine in the last resort the cashavailable for pay.     To do so would be to risk pre-emptingdecisions on the balance oi the public expenditure pro-gramme and an outcome in which public sector pay againincreased at the expense of public sector investment. TheGovernment could not therefore agree to be committedwithout qualification to accepting the results of arbitration.d. It was necessary to establish that at the end of theday the Government must have the final 3ay on the amountof cash available for Civil Service pay;  but having said that5the Govei&apos;^tjnent rhould bend all their energies to ensure that thearrangements for determining pay were such that it seldomor never came to that.    The objective should therefore beto find a way of reconciling the introduction of genuinenegotiations on pay with the Government&apos;s right in the lastresort to determine the amount of money available. Tothis end it might be necessary to consider changes in thetiming of negotiations and in the timing and arrangements2SECRET
SECRETfor settling and for announcing cash limits such thatunbridgeable gaps between sensibly negotiated paysettlements and cash limits would only very rarely occur.It would be important to take account of the timing of thesettling of the Rate Support Grant cash limit, and of theimplicatiors of local authority pay settlements for CivilService settlements.    The proposal in the report byofficials attached to C(81) 14, for fixing Civil Service paynext year by linkage with a general indication oi paymovements, or with those of a related group, would posevery difficult presentational problems and could set anunwelcome precedent.e. Consideration should be given to the other factorswhich might be taken into account in opening  a dialoguewith the unions and in building on the undertaking alreadygiven to them that the Government intended to review thearrangements for determining pay with the object ofestablishing as soon as practicable an ordered and agreedsystem which took account of all relevant factors andwhich would command the widest possible acceptance.f. The case for setting up an independent inquiryinto the longer term arrangements could be consideredfurther in the light of the report which officials werepreparing.   There was a danger that such an inquiry couldlead to unnecessary delay, followed by recommendationswhich were unacceptable to the Government.    It might,therefore, be better to agree on proposals which couldform a basis for direct discussion with the unions.g. In the meantime, the Government should take stepsto win greater support for its stance, both from thegeneral public and from moderate opinion within the CivilService, by making more widely known some of the factson Civil Service pay and employment.    For example, inthe last decade the pay of both manual and non-manualcivil servants had improved relative to the pay of thosedoing similar work in the private sector;  over the sameperiod redundancies in the Civil Service had been verymarkedly lower.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be no increase in the offer to theCivil Service of a 7 per cent pay increase from April 1981. Theyfurther agreed that the present dispute should not be allowed todrift on.    They would discuss as soon as possible &lt;_fter Easter thereport which a grcup of officials (MJSC 54) was preparing on thepossible basis of an ordered and agreed system for the longer term;they would decide then whether that report might form the basis3SECRET
SECRETfor direct negotiations with the unions or whether the Governmentshoula set up an independent inquiry into the longer-term arrange-ments.    In the meantime, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the Council should circulate, :n time fordiscussion by Cabinet on Tuesday 14 April, proposals for the basison which a dialogue might be opened with the unions on thearrangements for 1982.    The aim would be to reach agreement ona basis for negotiating the 1982 pay settlement which would alsopave the way for an ordered and agreed syrtem for the longer termsuch as would offer the prospect of fair terms and conditions ofservice for the Civil Service while recognising that in the lastresort it was for the Government to determine the amount of moneyavailable for Civil Service pay.    To this end, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Lord President of the Council should makeproposals for the factors to be taken into account -such as iobsecurity and the value of index-linked pensions - in the 1982negotiations, and also on any changes which might be made in thet:&lt;ming of negotiations and the arrangements for settling andannouncing cash limits which would provide the necessary elementof flexibility to accommodate genuine negotiations.    It was essentialthat the revised arrangements for the Civil Service should takeaccount of the implications for the setting of the Rate Support Grantcash limit.   Any proposals which included arbitration would have torecognise that the recommendations of the arbitral body could not bebinding on Government.    In the light of these proposals, theCabinet would decide on 14 April whether the Lord President of theCouncil should be authorised to open discussions with the unionson the 1982 arrangements in advance of the decisions which Cabinetwould be taking after Easter on how the longer term arrangementsmight be bandied.    In the meantime, Ministers were free to listento the views of their Departmental staff sides but they should avoidany impression that they might be entering into negotiations withthem.    They should take the opportunity to make clear to theirstaff that the Government was fully appreciative of the work of theCivil Service and of the need to agree on the terms and conditionsof service necessary to recruit and to retain an efficient CivilService.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Presidentof the Council should circulate to Members of Cabinet as soon aspossible a note of some of the facts on Civil Service pay andconditions of service, and on recent pay movements, on whichMinisters could draw in such discussions.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that there should be no increase inthe 7 per cent increase in pay already offered to thenon-industrial Civil Service from April 1981.4SECRET
