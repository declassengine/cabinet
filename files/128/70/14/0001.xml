CONFIDENTIALLIAMENTARY   1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDAIRS PAYMASTER. GENERAL said that the Report Stage of the BritishTelecommunications Bill in the House of Commons had begun the[Sh previous afternoon, and was still continuing.    It had originally beencommunica~       agreed through the usual channels that Report and Third Reading of the, gill Bill would be completed within a single day, but the Opposition Whipsappeared unable to control a number of their backbenchers who weredetermined to delay the progress of the Bill because of the Government&apos;sinsistence on resisting and where necessary reversing the insertion inthe Bill cf provisions on the interception of postal or telephonecommunications.    In spite of various overtures from the Opposition, hehad agreed with the Chief Whip that the sitting should continue until theremaining stages of the Bill had been completed.    There were still alarge number of amendments to be considered on which divisions mightbe forced.    The closure had been successfully carried at 9. 30 thatmorning, and would continue to be moved as appropriate throughout theremainder of the debate.    It was possible that opposition to the 3illwould collapse shortly before 2. 30 pm, but it seemed more likely thatthat day&apos;s business would be lost.    There should be no great difficultyabout adding the essential items to the business planned for the followingweek.    The morale of the Government&apos;s own supporters was high, andhe did not foresee any major damage being done to Government businessas a result of the obstruction by the Opposition Members concerned.He then informed the Cabinet of the business which it was intended totake in the House of Commons during the following week, including theadditions which might be necessary as a result of the possible loss ofthat day&apos;s business.The Cabinet -Took note.PEIGN 2. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the decision by the Solidarity^AIRS national co-ordinsting committee to call off the proposed general strikehad brought Poland back from the brink of a major crisis. The&apos;an&lt;* Solidarity leader, Mr Walesa, had come under considerable criticismfrom extremists in Solidarity for the way in which he had condjeted theevi us negotiations, but the Polish Government appeared to have madeferen.ee: significant concessions.    The Soviet armed forces remained at a highl81) 13th state of military readiness.    The decision of the Communist CentralElusions, Committee Plenum on 29 March that an extraordinary party congressnute 2 should meet by 20 July seemed to have resulted from pressure byreformists, and would be a further cause of concern to che Soviet Union.Meanwhile the group of representatives of Poland&apos;s creditors werecontinuing to meet to consider the best way of dealing with Poland&apos;sfinancial difficulties.    The European Community had already made somefood aid available, which had included a British contribution.1CONFIDENTIAL

The Supreme Court of Canada had agreed to begin on28 April its hearing of a Provincial appeal against the judgment by theManitoba Court of Appeal which found by a majority of three to two infavour of the Federal position.    On 1 April the Newfoundland Court ofAppeal had found unanimously that the Federal plan to bring home theconstitution from Britain without Provincial consent was legally invalidbecause it affected Provincial rights and privileges.    The CanadianPrime Minister, Mr Trudeau, had now offered in the Canadian House ofCommons that, if the Canadian Conservatives would allow the resolutionat present before the Canadian Parliament to come to a vote, he wouldundertake not to forward the proposed request to the British Governmentfor action until the Supreme Court of Canada had reached a decision onthe Manitoba appeal.    Although this offer was still under discusssion inCanada, if accepted, it would represent a very considerable easement inthe political problem which the British Government was facing on thisissxie.Iizeevious[erence:(81) 11thDelusions,mite 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, despite considerable violence inBelize, arrangements for the Constitutional Conference in London weregoing ahead.    There was a possibility that the Opposition might notattend.pilandTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the cause of the attempted coup againstthe Thai Government was obscure.     The existing Prime Minister,General Prem, had withdrawn to the North East of the country with theKing and Queen, and still claimed the majority support of the Thai armedservices.    It seemed possible that the attempted coup would fail.ibabweeviousference-181) 7th&apos;&quot;elusions,&quot;Me 2THE LOPD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Government ofZimbabwe was well satisfied with the outcome of the aid donors&apos;conference in Salisbury which he had just attended.    The PrimeMinister, Mr Robert Mugabe, had got the amount of aid for which he wasasking, which was probably more than he had been expecting. Hisrecord of firm government was building up confidence in the country.Within the next year he seemed more likely to encounter economic thanpolitical difficulties, although the attitude of President Reagan&apos;sAdministration to the problems of Namibia and South Africa would be ofcritical importance to him.

The presence andassistance of British officers and other ranks was essential to thisprocess.    Without them, there would almost certainly have been abreakdown in law and order in Zimbabwe.    They were doing a fine job.IviousLrence:181) 11th[elusions,lute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Iranian.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODreported chat, after three days of negotiation, during which therehad been violent demonstrations by farmers from certain Communitycountries, the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) had agreed onagricultural prices and economy measures.    The effective averageincrease would be 8,9 per cent, or 9. 5 per cent if measured by thelevel of target prices.   These would increase the food price index inthe United Kingdom by 1. 0 per cent and the retail price index by0.2 per cent.    There would be no revaluation of the green pound, andhe had secured agreement to continuation of the Community-financedbutter subsidy and the beef premia scheme.    The premium claw-backarrangements on exports of sheepmeat both to third countries andwithin the Community had been improved.    The additional aid measuresfor the Irish Republic would be extended in full to Northern Ireland.The decision to maintain the level of subsidies on starch productionwould help to preserve jobs in the United Kingdom.    Agreement hadfinally been reached on the retrospective payment of refunds on whiskyexports.    Decisions on continued access for New Zealand butter andAustralian beef, which had previously been blocked by the Italians,would now be implemented.    Changes in the arrangements for beefand fruit and vegetables would produce substantial savings, and theprinciple of co-responsibility for cereals had been agreed, althoughfor administrative reasons its application would be deferred until nextyear.    The Council had agreed to take additional measures if thebudgetary cost of surpluses in the milk sector rose above theprovision in the 1981 Budget.    It had also endorsed a Commissionstatement that the price decisions were consistent with ensuring thatthe rate of increase of agricultural guarantee expenditure would notexceed the rate of increase in the Community&apos;s own resources. AUnited Kingdom declaration that the rate of increase in such expendi-ture should be markedly lower than the rate of increase in ownresources had been endorsed by the Germans and the Dutch.In discussion it was noted that the settlement would bring a significantimprovement in farm incomes, especially in the livestock sector.The benefits of this to the countryside should be stressed.    In spiteof a small increase in the co-responsibility levy on milk, there wouldbe a significant net increase in the price paid to producers for dairyproducts.    This should help to secure greater stability in the retailprice of liquid milk.    The figures quoted in the Press for the effecton prices of individual commodities were unofficial and tendentiousestimates.    It would be important for the Government to make clearwhether or not th se figures were correct.    It was in practicedifficult to estimate the precise effect on individual commodities.The German Minister of Agriculture had done very little to supportthe United Kingdom in securing restrictions on the growth ofagricultural expenditure.    It was not possible to predict what theprovision for agricultural expenditure in the 1932 budget would be, butthe British Government would be in a position to press for furthereconomies at that time.    The price settlement had not contributed torestructuring the Community budget and the Government would need tocontinue its efforts in this direction.CONFIDENTIAL

Assurances had however been given tothe Germans and the Dutch Presidency that the French would begenuinely ready to negotiate after their elections.    It remained to beseen whether they would do so, or would seek either to link a settlementon fisheries with discussions on restructuring of the CommonAgricultural Policy and of the Budget or to postpone decisions untilthe end of 1982 when the present access arrangements came to an end.ransportTHE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT reported that, at a recent meetingof the Council of Ministers (Transport), the Germans had once againblocked the attempts being made by his Department to secure morepermits for road haulage on the Continent.leieviousference:(81) 9thnclusions,mute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that efforts tosecuie a voluntary agreement on continued restrictions on steeldeliveries within the Community had made some progress but had notyet been completed.
