The Cabinet were informed of the business provisionallyarranged to be taken in the House of Commons during the weekbeginning 1 June 1981.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the debate on the pay of Ministers and Members ofParliament was at present the only item of business proposed for Friday5 June.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and PaymasterGeneral should consider whether there was any additional business whichcould usefully be taken on that day, though the Cabinet recognised thedifficulties of changing the programme, which had already been seen bythe Opposition, at this stage.The Cabinet -1.        Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and Paymaster General, in consultationwith the Chief Whip and other Ministers concerned,tc consider whether any business in addition to thedebate on the pay of Ministers and Members ofParliament could be taken in the House of Commonson Friday 5 June.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that the Supreme Court of Canada wasexpected to deliver its judgment on the constitutional issues now beforeit at the end of May or early in June.    The judgment was unlikely to beunanimous, though the general expectation seemed to be for a majorityfor the view that the Federal Government&apos;s proposals were notunconstitutional.    Mr Trudeau had undertaken not to pursue theproposals in their present form if tie Supreme Court ruled against them.If the Federal Government&apos;s views were upheld by the Court, anAddress to The Queen requesting the enactment of the appropriatelegislation at Westminster would be sent to London as soon as thenecessary Resolution had been passed in the two Houses of the CanadianParliament.    He would bring proposals on the handling of any suchrequest before the Cabinet as soon as the Supreme Court verdict wasavailable, but it was already clear that, if the Government were to seekto enact a Canada Bill before the Summer Recess, it might be necessaiyto consider postponing until the autumn Royal Assent to at least one otherBill which it had been hoped to pass by the end of July, and forParliament to sit into August.    In the meantime, he had agreed withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary that the Government&apos;s reply to1CONFIDENTIAL
the two reports      the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs should notbe published until /he Supreme Court judgment was available, and that xtshould be amended as necessary to take account of the Court&apos;s findings.The Cabinet -2.       Invited tht Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General, in consultation with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the LordPresident of the Council, to bring further proposalson the handling of any request from the FederalGovernment and Parliament of Canada before theCabinet as soon as the expected judgment of theSupreme Court of Canada was available.REIGNdIMMUNITYFAIRS anonviouserence:81) 19thdelusions,tote 3inceeviousference:81) 19th&apos;elusions,lute 32. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthere appeared to have been some easing of the confrontation betweenSyria and Israel over Syrian SAM 6 missiles in the Lebanon. ThePrime Minister of Israel, Mr Begin, seemed to have overreachedhimself and might now be seeking a more moderate posture. TheUnited States Government were not being informative about their effortsat mediation, which were still continuing.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMonsieur Francois Mitterrand would assume office that day asPresident of the French Republic.    Monsieur Pierre Mauroy wouldbecome Prime Minister and Monsieur Claude Cheysson would probablybe appointed Foreign Minister.    It was not known who would replaceMonsieur Cheysson as one of the French Commissioners.Mr Ivor Richard would like to secure the Development portfolio butrecognised that, if the French wished to retain it, he would probably notbe successful.    His present responsibilities for Social Affairs were ofsome importance to the United Kingdom, and it would not be worth whilefor the British Government to have a row with the new FrenchAdministration on this issue, though they might wish to reiterate theirview that the French should expect to give up this portfolio on the ne:ctoccasion.    In the meantime the proportion of business under theEuropean Development Fund which came to British contractors wasincreasing.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reportedthat, apparently on instructions from Monsieur Mitterrand, the twoFrench Commissioners had absented themselves from a recent meetingof the Commission, thus preventing proposals to modify the restrictionson exports of British lamb.    This was causing serious disturbance toour market and threatening the closure of abbatoirs. Moreover,French poultry dealers were engaged in a campaign to otsp up exportsof turkeys and other poultry to the British market.    Turkeys for theChristmas market were being offered at heavily subsidised prices,below the cost of production, and threatened to absorb a substantialproportion of the British market.    He had drawn the problem to theattention of the Commission and was considering what further actioncould be taken.pnitedlingdom&apos;residencyTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he hadrecently met the members of the Commission to discuss the forthcomingUnited Kingdom Presidency of the Communities.    If the Frenchlegislative elections were completed on 21 June, it seemed unlikely thatthere would be any postponement of the European Council scheduled for29-30 June, but it was unlikely that the new President would be ready tosay much about his attitude towards budget restructuring, on which ureport from the Commission was due.    It would be necessary to pushhard for progress during the latter part of the British Presidency.apan&apos;reviousReference::C(81) 7thConclusions,Minute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the Association ofEuropean Car Manufacturers had expressed serious concern about thestrong Japanese challenge in the European car market.    The Council ofMinisters on 19 May had adopted a resolution calling on Japan not toincrease the level of car exports to the European Community over thelevel of last year and to avoid deflection of trade resulting from therecent United States/Japan agreement on car imports. Effectivecontrol in practice lay with the different arrangements in each memberstate.    The latest statistics suggested that the level of Japanese carexports to the United Kingdom was coming into line with the limitsagreed between the two industries.    Recent criticisms bySir Michael Edwardes of Japanese car exports probably represented inpart an attempt to divert attention from the internal difficulties ofBritish Leyland.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhRTHERNJCLAND|F AIRSHevicusyference:|(81) 19thDelusions,aute 23. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat a third hunger striKer, McCreesh, had died in the small hours ofthe morning.    Though there had been a number of incidents, includingan attack on a police station, the level of violence was lower than afterthe two earlier deaths.    A fourth hunger striker, O&apos;Hara, was likely todie at the weekend.    The next one would not be in mortal danger forsome weeks thereafter, unless he chose to refuse water as well as food.The security forces remained able to cope with the disturbances and haddone well to confine them to Catholic areas.    The Provisional IrishRepublican Army (PIRA) had been prevented from provoking widespreadviolence between the tv/o communities and might well now revert toconcentrating on attempts to kill members of the security forces (eg therecent blowing up of five soldiers near Newry).    Meanwhile strongefforts were being made to reverse the advances which the PIRA hadrecently achieved in publicity terms, particularly abroad, and therewere some signs that these efforts were succeeding.    It was essentialto make the PIRA realise that they were wrong to expect the pressure ofinternational opinion to force the Government to give way to theirdemands.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that in some sections ofBritish public opinion support was increasing for a policy of withdrawingall British troops.    The Government&apos;s publicity efforts would need tocombat this vigorously.    British opinion was also increasingly criticalof the ceremonial shots which the PIRA were able to fire over the graveat the funerals of those who had died on hunger strike.    The largenumber of mourners present on these occasions meant that these whofired the shots could not be arrested without provoking a riot and therebyplaying into the PIRA&apos;s hands, but more publicity could perhaps be givento the fact that they were in some cases arrested later and successfullyprosecuted.    It was further noted that there were some initialindications of the Scottish Republican Army being now disposed toemulate and perhaps co-operate with the PIRA&apos;s campaign of violence.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
