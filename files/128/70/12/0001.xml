CONFIDENTIALLIAMENTARYAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of business to be taken in the Houseof Commons during the following week.ds BillTHE PRIME MINTSTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the Lloyds Bill would be considered by the House ofCommons as opposed private business on Tuesday 24 March. Althoughthe Government attached importance to the enactment of the Bill in thecurrent Session, Ministers who were names at Lloyds should refrainfrom voting either on any closure motion or on the Bill itself. OtherMinisters present should support the Bill.    Similar considerationswould apply during the passage of the Bill through the House of Lords.The Cabinet -Took note.(nationalputerstedTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he intended tomake a statement to the House of Commons that afternoon aboutInternational Computers Limited (ICL).    The recession had had adamaging effect on all computer manufacturers, particularly those who,like ICL, specialised in the production of large computers.    ICL&apos;s cashflow position had been made worse by the scale of its leasing operations.At the company&apos;s Annual Geneial Meeting on 3 February, the Chairmanhad reported that there had been a sharp drop in profits in the secondhalf of the previous year, that the company was currently trading at aloss, and that adverse trading conditions could continue well into thecurrent financial year, although there was a good prospect for a returnto profitability in the longer term.    Since 3 February the company&apos;sposition had deteriorated, and earlier in the week the banks had saidthat they were not willing to continue their overdraft facilities to ICL atthe present level.    If these banking facilities had been even partly with-drawn, it was very doubtful whether ICL could have continued trading.Confidence in the company would have collapsed, and there would havebeen little prospect of making progress with a possible merger with oneor more of the other companies who had shown some interest in therecent past.     Putting the company into receivership would have hadwholly unacceptable consequences for the Government as a user of ICLequipment.     Some  300 million had been invested in ICL computers in20 Departments, and the Government was heavily dependent on thecompany for development and maintenance.    In these circumstances, itwas vital that confidence in ICL should be maintained by putting it in aposition to continue trading until more satisfactory arrangements couldbe made for its future.     His officials, led by his Permanent UnderSecretary of State, had accordingly concluded an agreement early that1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmorning under which the banks would continue their existing support fora further two years, in return for a loan guarantee of up to  200 millionby the Government under Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 for asimilar period.     Urgent consideration would have to be given toimproving the management of the company, wbich had been shown to beweak.    It was hi   hope that there would be no need for any calls to bemade on the proposed loan guarantee, and that in due course a satis-factory merger could be arranged.    In the meantime, it was importantthat the Government should avoid any action which might further under-mine confidence in ICL     Dealings in ICL shares had been suspended forthe time being.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that,although the steps now contemplated were intended to restore and main-tain customer confidence in ICL, and it was important that a y publicspeeches by Ministers should reinforce that confidence, Ministers shouldbe careful to make no statements which could be interpreted asconstituting any commitment for support to the company that went beyondthat now to be announced.    She would arrange for the advice given by theAttorney General on the legal position to be circulated to all members ofthe Cabinet.    The additional Government support now proposed for ICLwas not to be taken as a precedent for help for other companiessuffering from similar cash flow difficulties, and in defending thedecision it would be necessary to place the main emphasis on theunacceptable financial implications for the Government as a major userof ICL equipment of allowing the company to go into liquidation.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatdiscussion with the visiting President of Nigeria and his party had shownthat the present Nigerian Administration was in favour of private enter-prise and moderation.    But Nigerian aspirations to be the leader ofBlack Africa meant that their public speeches were inclined to beextremis* and unhelpful to British interests.    Nigerian actions weremore likely to be in accordance with these public utterances than withthe private views of the Administration.    The report published inThe Guardian to the effect that as a result of Nigerian representationsthe Government&apos;s policy in regard to overseas students was going to bereconsidered was untrue.    He had, however, undertaken to look againat any particular cases.    In fact the number of Nigerian students in thiscountry had actually increased since the rise in charges for overseasstudents was announced.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALstan THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thehijacking of a Pakistani airliner had created a hostile reaction to thevjoUS hijackers which had strengthened President Zia&apos;s position in Pakistan.e: It was believed that the son of thfi late President Bhutto had been behind79) 22nd the hijacking and was closely in touch with the present regime inelusions, Afghanistan.    The hijackers had received arms while the airliner hadte 2 been in Kabul, and one of the prisoners released in Pakistan as a resultof their demands had apparently been a Soviet agent:  these factssuggested a degree of Soviet complicity in the hijacking.g0 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theproposed &quot;North/South&quot; Summit meeting in Mexico had now been post-icus poned until 22 and 23 October to meet the wishes of the new United Stateserence: Administration.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported that at themeeting of the Council of Ministers (Economics and Finance) on16 March he had pressed, in accordance with the decisions reached inthe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee last week, for a cautiousprice policy to be followed in the current negotiations on agriculturalprices.    He had also argued for the growth rate of agriculturalexpenditure from the Community budget to be markedly lower than theincrease in the Community&apos;s own resources.    He had received strongsupport on this point from the Germans, but from no-one else. Thequestion would be taken up again in the April Council meeting. TheCouncil had also reviewed the position on the draft directive on non-lifeinsurance services and had instructed the Committee of PermanentRepresentatives to examine the outstanding problems and come back withproposed solutions in May.    The United Kingdom stood to gainconsiderably from the liberalisation of insurance services, but mostother member states apart from the Netherlands were less enthusiastic.It would therefore be important to get an acceptable directive adoptedduring either the Dutch or the United Kingdom Presidency.rricultur etuncil&apos;eviousiference:(81) 11th[inclusions,pnute 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reportedthat on 16 March the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) had had a fir Ftround of discussions on the Commission&apos;s proposals for the 1981 Common|Agricultural Policy price fixing.    Most member states had opposed theCommission&apos;s levy proposals, and the Greeks had joined the Italians indemanding big increases in the prices of Mediterranean products.There were some indications that the Italian Government would refuse tolift their reserve on the earlier package of measures covering NewZealand butter imports and other issues unless they were given supporton Mediterranean prices.    The Council would resume for the customarymarathon session beginning on 30 March, with the aim of concluding theprice fixing.ireignfairsmncil:eviousTerence:f(81) 8th&quot;delusions,inute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 16 and 17 March, agreementhad beer reached, subject to clearance of a number of technical points,on a common format passport.    This was not a change which would bewelcomed in the United Kingdom, but the Government were committed inprinciple by a decision taken by Sir Harold Wilson at a Heads ofGovernment Meeting in 1974, and other member countries had met eachsuccessive point of difficulty that the United Kingdom had raised. Theproposed new format would be very similar in appearance to the presentBritish passport, and the agreed arrangements included a provisionenabling the United Kingdom to defer its introduction in this country untilthe time came for the change to a passport in machine readable form.This would avoid a double change, while the introduction of machinereadability would bring practical advantages to the public.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussions in the margins of the Council, the Spanish ForeignMinister had been reassuring about the implications of the recentabortive coup in Madrid.    He had expressed confidence in the loyalty ofthe Army as a whole, whose attitude he had characterised asconservative but not extreme.    Senor Perez-Llorca had neverthelesssaid that faster progress in the accession negotiations would help.nmonheriesicyiviouserence:81) Hthiclusions,lute 3THE PRIME MINISTER reported that, at a meeting earlier that day, theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee had noted the worrying prospectof a continued failure to secure agreement in the Community on arevised Common Fisheries Policy.    If this issue could not be resolvedbefore the derogations on access in our Accession Treaty expired inDecember 1982, there was a risk that boats from other member statescould thereafter fish up to our beaches.    Attempts to reach agreementbilaterally with the French had twice foundered at the last minute,apparently on instructions from President Giscard.    The Committee hadaccordingly agreed that she should probe the position in the margins ofnext week s European Council in Maastricht, with a view to using theforthcoming sequence of Agriculture and Fish Councils to the besttactical effect.    Meanwhile, despite the difficulties this would cause withChancellor Schmidt, the United Kingdom could not lift her reserve on theproposed fisheries agreement between the Community and Canada unlessthe Council could agree marketing measures that would protect theUnited Kingdom fishing industry against imports of Canadian and otherfish.In a brief discussion it was noted that the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food would bring forward next week proposals for furthersubsidies to the United Kingdom fishing industry.    So far as opinion inthe House was concerned, the risk of the Government being defeated onan eventual Common Fisheries Policy package was still a real one.The best defence against this risk was to ensure that the Governmentcarried the industry with them on whatever was finally agreed, as theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had been careful to dothroughout the negotiations so far.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that thecontingency arrangements to deal with the current industrial action inthe Civil Service were working satisfactorily, with Departments onnotice to consult the Civil Service Department on any unexpected ormajor difficulties.In a brief discussion reference was made to the biased and unhelpfulreporting on British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Radio of ademonstration outside Bush House that morning.    It was for considera-tion whether this should be made the subject of a complaint to the B3C.The CabinetTook note.TEMENT 5. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State forthe Defence (C(81) 11) to which was attached a draft of the 1981 Statement onence the Defence Estimates.IMATESTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that this year&apos;sDefence White Paper was in the same general format as the previousvious year&apos;s Defence White Paper.    It had already been considered in drafterence: by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee and following their80) 4th discussion a number of amendments had been made.    In addition, inelusions, accordance with their conclusions, he had now prefaced the White Paperute 6 with an introduction which stated in guarded terms that a fundamentalreview was taking place to relate the defence programme to theavailable resources.    In writing this introduction it had been necessaryto take care to avoid causing alarm within the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation or among the Government&apos;s supporters.In discussion there was general agreement with the format, contents andtone of the draft White Paper.    Some concern was expressed about theneed to present the Government&apos;s policy on nuclear weapons anddisarmament, in view of the growth of nuclear pacifism in the countrywhich tended to be over-publicised.    It was important to take everyopportunity to deploy the case which was fully set out in the draft WhitePaper.     The Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s reply to the Member forMelton concerning the views of the British Council of Churches onnuclear weapons and disarmament, which had been published as aWritten Answer in Hansard of 2 March 1981 (cols. 29-30), ought to bewidely circulated, as it stated the Government&apos;s policy in particularlyforceful and succinct terms.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, subjectto drafting amendments which should be sent to the Secretary of State forDefence as quickly as possible, the Cabinet approved the draft Statementon the Defence Estimates 1981.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to arrangefor the publication of the Statement on the DefenceEstimates 1981, subject to minor drafting amendments.Cabinet Office19 March 19S17CONFIDENTIAL
