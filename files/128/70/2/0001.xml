An announcement wouldbe made that afternoon that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would openhis Budget on Tuesday 10 March.The Cabinet -Took note.EIGNAIRSndviousrence:51) 1stlusions,jute 22. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that more strikes had taken placein Poland and the political situation remained very tense.    The two mainissues currently in dispute were Solidarity&apos;s demand for a five-day weekand the proposal for an independent farmers&apos; union.    The tone of Sovietcomment had sharpened again.    The current visit of the SovietCommander-in-Chief of the Warsaw Pact forces, Marshal Kulikov,might also be designed as a reminder of the possibility of Soviet inter-vention.ibiaviousrence:80) 42ndelusions,ute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the failure of the United Nationsconference on Namibia at Geneva was regrettable, although it had so farproduced less recrimination than might have been expected.Responsibility lay with the South Africans, who had told theParliamentary Under Secretary of State, Foreign and CommonwealthOffice (Mr Luce), at Geneva that they did not want to see agreementreached.    This might be because of internal South African factors crbecause they now believed that the Scuth West African People&apos;sOrganisation would dominate any free elections in Namibia;  but themost likely reason was their hope that their Namibianpolicies would beviewed more sympathetically by the incoming United States Governmentthan by President Carter&apos;s Administration.    Discussion of Namibia inthe United Nations General Assembly might now resume in the nearfuture.    But a crisis point, in terms of a move in the Security Councilfor sanctions against South Africa, was unlikely to be reached until theattitude of the new United States Government was clearer. Meanwhilethe interests of Britain and the West would be best served by playing thewhole matter down as far as possible.1CONFIDENTIAL

Libyanintervention had been deplored in a public statement by the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary during his current visit to Egypt.    France hadalso condemned Libya, but bad at the same time concluded a Franco-Libyan oil agreement.    Most African Governments had unfortunatelybeen slow in realising the dangers inherent in Libya&apos;s expansionistpolicies, but President Sadat of Egypt had been aware of the threat forsome time, and the Nigerians had now been alerted by Libyan involve-ment in the recent riots in Kano.Spain evious(ference:;(80) 22ndanclusions,|nute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had recently visited Madridprimarily to discuss Spain&apos;s accession to the European Communities.There had however been considerable talk about Gibraltar. TheSpanish Government had asked for undertakings about the future statusof Spanish citizens in Gibraltar which Her Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot give, but it had been agreed that contacts at official level shouldcontinue.    The Spanish Government were hopeful that during the forth-coming British Presidency   it would be possible to give further politicalimpetus to the negotiations for Spanish entry into the EuropeanCommunities.    He had made clear that this would be easier if in themeantime Spain had made improvements on the trade front and had alsoimplemented the Lisbon agreement on Gibraltar.    He had also taken theopportunity to urge the Spanish Government to buy Rapier missiles.The CabinetTook note.)MMUNITYAFFAIRSJeviousleference*:C(81) 1stfonclusions,pnute 33. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, following the sudden death ofCommissioner Gundelach, the Danish Government had nominated theirMinister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr Dalsager, as a member ofthe Commission, with the hope that he would be given the Agricultureportfolio.    Responsibility for Fisheries would now pass immediately tothe Greek Commissioner, Mr Kontogeorgis, who, while not familiarwith the subject, had proved to be an able negotiator during Greekaccession to the Communities.THE MINISTER OF AGP.ICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatMr Dalsager had strong claims to take over the Agriculture portfolio,given both his European and agricultural experience.    While he hadpersonal limitations, he was well disposed to this country and it wouldbe a mistake to alienate him by attempting to oppose his appointment asCONFIDENTIAL

The French might support the appointmentof Mr O&apos;Kennedy, but it would not be in British interests to have an IrishCommissioner responsible for Agriculture.     Other possibilities includedthe Dutch Commissioner, Mr Andriessen.    Discvssions he had had theprevious day with the French Minister of Agriculture confirmed thatthere would be major difficulties over the forthcoming agricultural pricenegotiations,  since the French were pressing for large price increases,a revaluation of the Green Pound and changes in co-responsibility levieswhich the British Government wculd have to oppose.    He also reportedthat difficulties had arisen over the receipt of refunds on whisky exportswhich it had been agreed during last year&apos;s price fixing should be paid tothe United Kingdom.     These payment? had been delayed because of therefusal of the European Parliament to give an opinion.

The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.rice FactorsTeviouseference:C(80) 39thonclusions,linute 3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Lord President of the Council (C(81) 3) to which wasattached a copy of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry, under thechairmanship of Sir Bernard Scott, into the value of pensions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Report had beencommissioned in response to the widespread public criticism of theprivileged position of public sector employees in the enjoyment ofinflation-proofed pensions.    In setting up the Inquiry, the Cabinet hadrecognised that there would be severe difficulties in abolishing inflation-proofing of public sector pensions, and had considered that the best wayto reduce disparities would be by increasing public sector pensioncontributions.     The Report recognised the disparity in pensions treat-ment between public and private sector schemes, but did not condemn theinflation-proofing of public sector pensions.    It made no firmrecommendations, but a number of suggestions for further action or study,including the introduction of Government-issued index-linked bonds. Asa first step he, and the Lord President of the Council, recommended thatthe Report should be printed as a Command paper and presented toParliament around the end of January.     The Government should welcomethe Report, and offer a number of initial comments on the lines indicatedin paragraph 15 of C(81) 3, but without any commitment on particularpoints.    The proposals and ideas in the Report should then be the subjectof farther study within Government.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Report washelpful in refuting a number of misconceptions.    It offered the Govern-ment a good basis for proposing increases in the contributions - eitherdirect or through abatement of pay - of public sector employees to theirpensions.    There would, however, be difficulties in bringing allcontributions up to the levels of those made, by salary abatement, bycivil servants;  and there were obvioi^s objections to increasingcontributions to a level which implied that the Government was endorsingpessimistic assumptions about prospective real rates of return on invest-ment.In discussion the following points were made -a.       The private sector would be highly critical of the Report.Many private sector companies were currently facing severedifficulties in maintaining the terms of their present pensionschemes.     They would not welcome the proposal in the Reportthat the disparity could be reduced by strengthening of privatesector occupational pension schemes.    The Report would also becriticised for failing to comment on the value of job security inthe public sector;  and for not putting forward firm recommen-dations for the introduction of a cut-off point to limit the extent ofinflation protection.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. Although the Government might wish to make changes in thepresent arrangements, it should, in fairness to its employees,acknowledge that the Report had identified a number of miscon-ceptions about public sector schemes.c. The recommendations in the Report, and the issues raiped,were highly complex and difficult.    It would therefore be betterfor the Government to publish che Report without any comment onit, and then to consider i*s response in the light of public reaction.The Treasury and Civil Service Committee might well take theinitiative, without any prompting from the Government, inexamining the Report&apos;s findings.THE PB.IME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the Report should be published by the end of January. TheGovernment should offer no comments on it at the time of publication, butbefore then the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord President of theCouncil should&quot;prepare a guidance note on&apos; what Ministers might say inresponse to questions.     Officials of the Departments concerned, underthe chairmanship of the Treasury, should examine the issues raised bythe Report, and should report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the Council, who would then make proposals toMinisters.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the Council:a. To arrange for the Report of the SccttInquiry into the value of pensions to be printedas a Command paper with the aim of presentationto Parliament around the end of January.b. To circulate to the Cabinet a note ofguidance on the line which Ministers shouldtake in response to questions on the Report.2. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet toarrange for an interdepartmental group of officials,under Treasury chairmanship, to examine the findingsof the Inquiry, and to report further in due course tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Presidentof the Council.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(81) 2) on the introduction of performance-related pay forcivil servants.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, followingdiscussion in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, he hadcirculated proposals for the introduction of a performance-related payscheme for the Under Secretary grade from 1 April 1981.    A majority ofMinisters had considered that, rather than deal with that grade alone, itwould be better to considei launching a wider scheme at lower levels.He accordingly invited the Cabinet to agree that he should now arrangefor further interdepartmental work on proposals, for implementationfrom April 1982, covering the grades of Principal, Senior Principal andAssistant Secretary and the equivalent specialist grades.In discussion it was generally agreed that, while it was desirable toreward merit in the Civil Service, the proposed performance-relatedpay scheme should not be pursued.    To ran such a scheme, and toassure the civil servants concerned that it was being operated fairly,would mean the setting up of elaborate new bureaucratic machinery.This would be likely to add to staff numbers and would be wasteful ofthe time of senior managers.     A much better approach would be toreward outstanding merit by accelerated promotion and to facilitate theearly departure from the Civil Service of those who were not pullingtheir weight.    It was recognised that pension and gratuity arrangementscould be an impediment to such early retirement, but the possibilitiesshould be examined further.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the possibility of introducing a performance-relatedpay scheme, on the lines set out in the Lord President of the Council&apos;smemorandum (C(81) 2), shouJd not be pursued further.     Instead theLord President of the Council should consider the proposal thatmeasures should be introduced to provide for rewarding merit byaccelerated promotion and, at the same time, for better arrangementsfor the early retirement of officials who were no longer fully effective.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the proposals in C(81) 2 forintroducing a pay and performance scheme for CirilService grades should not be pursued further.2. Invited the Lord President of the Council toarrange for examination of the possibilities ofrewarding merit by accelerated promotion and, atthe same time, of providing for early retirement ofofficials who were no longer fully effective, and to report.6CONFIDENTIALAY AND&apos;ERF OR MAN C E
CONFIDENTIAL[UNERATIONiF JUNIOR[INISTERS INHE HOUSEF LORDSreviouseference:C(80) 42ndonclusions,.&apos;inute 77. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(8l) 4) about the remuneration of junior Ministers in theHouse of Lords.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that at their earlierdiscussion the Cabinet had agreed that the remuneration of juniorMinisters in the House of Lords should be increased, had concluded thatany such increase should be paid by means of a tax-free allowance, andhad invited him to consider the best way of introducing such an allowance.The table attached to C(81) 4 showed that, because of the Parliamentarysalary and allowances available to Commons Ministers, juniorMinisters in the Lords were subject to a very considerable disadvantage.A Minister of State in the House of Commons could receive up to 37, 59? a year, while his counterpart in the Lords received a maximumof  18,284.    This disparity could not be justified entirely in terms of theParliamentary responsibilities, burdens and expenses of CommonsMinisters, and it created real financial hardship for many junior LordsMinisters.    He considered that it would be reasonable to increase theremuneration of junior Lords Ministers, including Lords Whips, andother office holders, including the Leader of the Opposition and theOpposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords, by  3, 50C a year. Thiswould be about half the amount of the Parliamentary salary payable toCommons Ministers.    It would, however, be difficult to pay this as anallowance.    It was not possible to identify specific expenses incurred byjunior Lords Ministers which should be reimbursed and would thereforejustify the payment of a tax-free allowance on the scale envisaged; andthe payment of a responsibility allowance would raise questions about thespecial responsibilities and burdens to be rewarded.    He had come tothe conclusion that the most straightforward way to improve the positionof junior Lords Ministers would be to give them a different and higherrate of pay from junior Ministers in the Commons;  the pay of Lords andCommons Cabinet Ministers should remain the same.    He believed thatthe proposed increases could be readily defended by reference to thedisproportionate size of the present differential between the remunera-tion of junior Ministers in the Commons and the Lords, and thedifficulty of recruitment and retention of Peers of adequate calibre toserve as junior Ministers.    In presenting the proposals to Parliament,the Government could indicate that the cost of any additional remunera-tion given to junior Lords Ministers would be contained within the over-all increase in Ministerial salaries for the current year. Legislationwould be required to implement these proposals.    He recommendedthat the appropriate powers should be taken in the same Bill as thatalready planned on Parliamentary pensions.    If that were agreed, heproposed that the Bill should also remedy the existing lack of power topay Ministerial salary increases retrospectively.    He invited theCabinet to approve the proposals set out in C(81) 4.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was reaffirmed that there was a strong case for anincrease of the order proposed in the remuneration of junior LordsMinisters.    It was, however, argued that it would be politically andpresentationally unacceptable to provide for an increase of some 25 percent in the salaries of Government Ministers at a time when efforts werebeing made to hold public sector pay settlements down to about 6 per centand when the Government still faced a debate in the House of Commonsarising from their refusal to implement in full the recommendation bythe Top Salaries Review Body fo~ increases in the pay and pensions ofMembers of Parliament.    Adding the proposals to the forthcoming Billon Parliamentary pensions would turn what should otherwise be a non-controversial Bill into a contentious one, would throw the increases intosharper relief, and might be used by the Opposition as part of theirattack on the continued existence of the House of Lords.    The inclusionof powers to pay the increases retrospectively would be particularlycontentious and would set an unfortunate precedent for future pay andpension negotiations.In further discussion it was argued that Ministers should receive thesame Ministerial salaries to whichever House they belonged. Theadditional allowances received by Ministers in the Commons related totheir membership of that House, and what was needed was a freshexamination of the allowances that might be appropriate for a Ministerwho was a member of the House of Lords.    At one time Ministers in theLords had been entitled to draw part of the attendance allowance payableto other members of the House of Lords, bvtt they had lost this entitle-ment when they had been given the non-taxable secretarial allowance.If they were able to draw the attendance allowance in full, perhapscombined with the introduction of a subsistence allowance and of travelallowances for their spouses, such as were already available toMinisters in the House of Commons, there would be a substantialimprovement in their total remuneration.    The tax implications ofpaying such allowances to Ministers in the House of Lords would,however, need further study.    It was particularly important that itshould not lead to the whole system of allowances in the House of Lordsbeing made subject to tax.    The particular circumstances in whichjunior Ministers in the House of Lords had to work seemed to justifyspecial tax arrangements to take account of their need to retain a secondhome if they did not live in London when appointed.    These might, ifnecessary, be introduced either by means of an administrativeconcession by the Inland Revenue, or by means of legislation in the nextFinance Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, srio. that theCabinet reaffirmed the need to improve the remuneration of juniorMinisters in the House of Lords, but remained of the opinion that it wouldbe unacceptable in present economic circumstances to pay increases ofthe order proposed to junior Ministers and other office holders in theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHouse of Lords by way of an increase in salary.    They also acceptedthe arguments put forward in discussion against including any provisionson the remuneration of junior Lords Ministers in the forthcoming Bill onParliamentary pensions.    They agreed, however, that it would bereasonable and defensible for junior Lords Ministers to be eligible forthe attendance allowances available to other members of the House ofLords, and that consideration should be given to thp possibility ofpermitting them to claim subsistence allowances and the travellingallowance for spouses already available to Ministers in the House ofCommons.    It would be preferable that the attendance allowance shouldbe non-taxable to Ministers in the House of Lords as well as to otherPeers;   it might be possible to achieve this by means of an InlandRevenue concession or by legislation in the Finance Bill.    If that was notfeasible, the allowance could be paid as taxable provided that that couldbe done without calling in question the tax immunity of allowances forother Peers.    Consideration should also ba given to the question whetherthe payment of attendance and other allowances to junior Minipters andoffice holders in the House of Lords could be effected by Resolution ofboth Houses of Parliament or would require legislation.    The LordPresident of the Council should now examine the implications of thisapproach, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, andshould make a further report to the Cabinet setting out the increasedremuneration which would become available, the tax position, and themethod of implementation.    In the light of this further report, theCabinet would decide on what action needed to be taken, including, ifnecessary, the inclusion of any necessary legislation in the 1980Finance Bill.The Cabinet -Invited the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to consider what further allowances might be madeavailable to junior Ministers and other office holaersin the House of Lords, and to report further to theCabinet as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup.Cabinet Office16 January 19819CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINET^81-82 CASHIMITS ANDOTESrice Factorsreviouseference:C(80) 39thconclusions,inute 3LIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(81) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 15 January 1981 at 10,30 amTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy had decided on 14 January that thepay factor in the 1981-82 cash limits for the National Health Service(NHS) and the Civil Service should be 7 per cent rather than 6 per centas in the cash limits for the Rate Support Grant.    He now recommendedthat the price factor in the NHS and Civil Service cash limits should be10 per cent rather than the 11 per cent which he had announced asapplying generally following the Cabinet&apos;s decision on 6 November.He did not however propose that the price factor should be amendedfor cash limits, such as the Rate Support Grant, which had already beer,promulgated.    A reduction to 10 per cent in the price factor for theother cash limits was justified by developments since November whichLad led the Treasury, and independent forecasters, to take a moreoptimistic view of inflation.    The last published figures for the RetailPrice Index (RPI) showed increases at an annual rate of 8j per centover the last six months, and slightly below that over the last threemonths.    He did not expect the figure to be as good as that betweenthe average of 1980-81 and the average of 1981-82, but on presentprospects he judged that the forecasts which he would publish at thetime of the Budget were likely to show an increase of 1 per cent lessthan he had assumed in November      The use of a 7 per cent payfactor in 1981-82 would cost some  120 million for the Civil Serviceand the NHS together, and the savings from reducing the price factorby 1 per cent would partly offset this.    If both the cash limit factorswere changed in this way, the Government could still point out to thelocal authorities and others that central government and the NHS weresubject to broadly the same financial disciplines as those applying tothe local authorities.In discussion the following points were made:-a.       The price factor of 11 per cent had already beenannounced.    To reduce it now, on the basis of uncertainforecasts, would be contrary to the principle that once acash limit was set it should not be amended, either up ordown, to take account of changing circumstances, and woulddamage the integrity of the cash limits system.SECRET
SECRETb. It was highly unlikely that the pay settlements forthe NHS groups would be less than l\ per cent, and itwould therefore be necessary to find savings to accommodatethe coetawithin the pay provision for 7 per cent. Thesesavings would be on top of the  25 million which it had beenagreed should be found in 1981-82 from improved efficiencyin the NHS.    A reduction in the price factor by 1 per centwould add further to the pressure on the NHS cash limit andlead to more volume cuts on hospital services, which couldonly fall upon the  non-pay elements in NHS expenditure.These would be contrary to the Government&apos;s undertakingto maintain these services, and would moreover bedamaging to private industry which would lose, for example,maintenance contracts and equipment orders.c. If in the event a price factor of 10 per cent turned outto be optimistic, this would cause serious difficulties forthose cash limits where non-pay items were significant -for example, the prison service and the cash limits ondepartmental administration costs which were alreadyvulnerable to relatively high increases in postal, telephoneand travel charges.d. Although 11 per cent had already been announced asthe price factor for inclusion in all cash limits, it would bewrong to persist with it for those limits yet to be set whenthe up to date forecasts justified a more optimistic view ofthe prospects for inflation.    The Government would becriticised for unnecessarily relaxing its control of publicsector expenditure.    Failure to control the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement would be highly damaging to privatesector industry who were looking for lower interest ratesand for Government help in reducing the cost burdens on them.e. The Government were committed to uprating pensionsin November 1981 by one percentage point less than theassumed rate of inflation.    If the assessment at the timeof the Budget was for a 10 per cent rate of inflation theuprating factor for pensions would be 9 per cent.    In thesecircumstances it would be very difficult to hold at the sametime to the proposition that the prices factor for inflationin public expenditure should be held at 11 per cent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that onbalance the Cabinet agreed that the price factor should be 10 per centfor those cash limits yet to be promulgated.    The factor of11 per cent would stand for the cash limits which had already beenannounced or on which commitments had already been based. If,contrary to bis expectations, the Chancellor of the Exchequer latertook a more pessimistic view of the path of inflation the Cabinetwould consider the implications of this further.    If possible neither2SECRET
SECRETthe 7 per cent pay factor nor the 10 per cent price factor should beannounced before the end of January, although the Cabinet noted thatthere was a risk that the figures would leak in the course ofpreparation of the Estimates for publication with the Budget. TheChancellor of the Exchequer should consider this problem, and thetiming of the announcement, further with those Ministers concernedwith current pay negotiations in the public sector.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the price factor in the 1981-82 cashlimits yet to be announced should be 10 per cent.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General, the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretaries of State for Employment, Environment,Social Services and Education and Science, to considerfurther the timing of the public announcement of the7 per cent pay factor and the 10 per cent price factor forcertain of the 1981-82 cash limits.Cabinet Office16th January 19813SECRET
