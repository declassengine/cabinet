CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.THE HOME SECRETARY said that at a meeting earlier that weekThe Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee hadendorsed the view of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General and the other business managers thatthere were likely to be serious difficulties about fitting theLegislative programme for 1980/81 into the available Parliamentarytime, particularly if a major spillover of the kind experiencedat the end of the last Session were to be avoided in the autumn of1981.    The Committee had been grateful to the Secretary of Statefor Health and Social Services for agreeing to drop the Healthand Social Services Bill, and had left the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster to discuss with the Ministers concerned thepossibility of shortening the Companies Bill so as to concentrateon those parts of it which offered significant staff savings. Themajority of the Committee also supported the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster&apos;s proposal to drop the Petroleum andContinental Shelf Bill from the current programme.    For mainlypolitical reasons, the Secretary of State for Energy had beenunable to accept this conclusion.    The Cabinet were now facedwith a choice between abandoning the Bill for the present Session,and accepting that this would lead to some criticism from itsown supporters as well as giving the Opposition a chance to makepolitical capital, or running the risk of another long spillover,which would also be a source of political difficulty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that policydecisions on the Petroleum and Continental Shelf Bill had beendelayed from June to September 1980 because of the need to takeaccount of strong representations from its own supporters aboutthe proposed sale of shares in the equity of the British NationalOil Corporation (BNOC).    Thereafter, the preparation of the Billhad proceeded to the expected timetable.    The Bill had beenannounced in the Queen&apos;s Speeches on the opening of both the1979/1980 and the 1980/1981 Sessions of Parliament, and both heand the Prime Minister were publicly committed to the introductionof the Bill this Session.    If there were any further delay in passingthe legislation, an opportunity to offer shares in BNOC infavourable market conditions might not occur in the lifetime ofthe present Parliament.    T^he introduction of private capital intoBNOC was a central part of the Government&apos;s economic andindustrial strategy, and any loss of momentum would be takenby at least some of the Government&apos;s own supporters as a failureof political will.    Although the Bill would undoubtedly becontroversial, there was a strong argument in Parliamentary termsfor early introduction while the Opposition were still in a stateof some disarray.1CONFIDENTIALPARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRSI ..egislativeProgramme980/81&apos;reviousReference:;C(80) 37thJonclusions,dinute 4
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that after discussion with theresponsible Ministers, he had come to the conclusion thatshortening the Companies Bill on the lines suggested by TheQueen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee would notlead to significant savings of time on the floor of the House ofCommons, and that it would be best to proceed with the Bill &gt;as at present envisaged.    Despite the agreement to drop theHealth and Social Services Bill, the legislative programmewas still far too congested, with many major Bills beingbrought forward much later than originally expected.    It wasalready clear that a substantial spillover in the autumn wouldbe necessary, and the main objective of the business managersnow was to ensure that this did not become so extended that the1931/82 Session had to start as late as the present one* Anyattempt to push through the present excessive weight oi legislationwould inevitably lead to confusion and obstruction, and wouldexpose the Government to severe political criticism from allsides.    He was not clear that introducing the Petroleum andContinental Shelf Bill as a matter of priority at the beginningof the next Session would in practice materially delay the offerof shares in BNOC.    He understood the political objections topostponing the Bill; but against those the Cabinet had to set thebroader political interests of good Parliamentary management,and he remained convinced that the orderly conduct ofParliamentary business demanded that the Bill should bedropped from the programme for the present Session.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet reluctantly accepted the view of the businessmanagers that the pressures on the legislative programme meantthat it would probably be undesirable to seek to enact thePetroleum and Continental Shelf Bill during the present Session,and that there were political and Parliamentary objections tointroducing  h.e Bill with the intention of taking it only as far asSecond Reading.    It would, however, be difficult to explain tothe Government&apos;s supporters why time could not be found for aBill which had twice been mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speeches,and which formed the subject of a firm public commitment. Inorder to allay any fears that the Government might be weakeningin its resolve to introduce private capital into BNOC, the Cabinetconsidered that the Bill should be published and introduced as soonas possible.    At the same time, it should be made clear to theGovernment&apos;s supporters that if for reasons of business manage-ment it did not prove possible to proceed further with the Bill thisSession, it would be introduced as a matter of priority at thebeginning of the 1981-82 Session.    This would leave open thepossibility of enacting the Bill in the current Session ifParliamentary time unexpectedly became available. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster Generalshould discuss with the Secretary of State for Energy the mostappropriate way of making this decision known.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtThe Cabinet -1. Agreed that, subject to the approval ofLegislation Committee, the Petroleum and ContinentalShelf Bill should be published and introduced into theHouse of Commons as soon as possible, with the intentionof making further progress in the current Session only ifsufficient Parliamentary time could be made available,2. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Energy, to consider the most appropriate wayof making this decision known, as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet noted with concern that,because of the absence of the Conservative Members of the SelectCommittee on Social Services at the relevant time, the report of theSelect Committee which was due to be published shortly had beendrafted by Opposition members, and consequently amounted to anunqualified attack on the underlying principles of the forthcomingSocial Security Bill.    The Chief Whip should urgently considerwith the Chairman of the 1922 Committee the best way of ensuringthat in future there was no unnecessary loss of the Government&apos;smajority on departmental or other Select Committees.The Cabinet -3.

2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,now that the United States hostages in Iran had been releared, he wasseeking to take advantage of those in Iran who might now be in a moreconciliatory frame of mind to press for the freeing of the fou_* Britishsubjects who were still detained there without trial and wnose plight hadbeen highlighted by the hostages&apos; release.    The Minister of State,Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Hurd) had spoken to the IranianCharge d&apos;Affaires on 21 January;  the Swedish Ambassador in Tehran,who was in charge of British interests there, was in touch with theIranian authorities;  assistance was being sought from the AlgerianGovernment, in view of their constructive role in the agreement on theUnited States hostages;   the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s special emissarywould probably be returning to Tehran;  and at their Brussels meeting on20 January the Foreign Ministers of the European Community hadsupported Britain&apos;s call for the release of the detainees.    These effortswould be less likely to succeed if the Americans were now to go back onthe terms of the agreement over the hostages and he would arrange forthis danger, as well as the danger of the United States appearing notmerely to condone but actually to perpetrate breaches of internationalagreements, to be brought to the United States Government&apos;s attention.British sanctions against Iran were now being lifted, since theirimposition had been specifically linked to the detention of the UnitedStates hostages.    The Attorney General&apos;s view on the exact legal basisfor that linkage was being sought.    Sanctions had in any case provedineffective;  British trade with Iran had actually increased in 1980. Butthe revocation of che sanctions Orders would leave the Government free,if they wished, to continue to withhold export licences for arms supj&apos;iesto Iran.    In his view public opinion would expect that to be done whileBritish subjects remained unjustifiably imprisoned, but he was aware thatnot all his colleagues shared this view, and he would therefore beputting forward a paper on the subject for discussion in the Defence andOversea Policy Committee.    Non-committal answers would meanwhilecontinue to be given to public questions on the suhject.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Libya&apos;sintervention in Chad had provoked a serious crisis.    The reaction ofneighbouring countries had been hostile and apprehensive. TheNigerians had taken the lead in securing condemnation of Libya at ameeting of the Organisation of African Unity.    President Sadat of Egypthad told him, at their recent meeting, that Egypt would not tolerate theLibyans&apos; action, by which their leader, Colonel Qadhafi, had in effectsigned his own death warrant.    The French Government had also issueda strong statement.    But it was not clear what actual countermeasureswould actually be taken.The Cabinet -Took note.4PORTIONAFFAIRS!ranPreviousReference:C(81) 1stConclusions,Minute 2|bya/ChadteviousTerence;-(81) 2nd&quot;iclusions,inute 2

Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer neednot formally announce the pay and price factors nowapproved, but should give instructions for Estimates to beprepared on the basis of those factors.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C(8l) 6) on the future of the InnerLondon Education Authority.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that he had been invited by the Cabinet on 8 January to giveurgent consideration with the Home Secretary, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Environment toways in which controls on the Inner London Education Authority(ILEA) might be strengthened and to other changes which might bemade in the structure and financing of the education service inLondon.    The Ministers concerned had met twice under thechairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer;  the Minister ofStr.te, Department of Industry (Mr Eaker) had also been present.He had also seen the Leader of the Greater London Council (GLC)and Professor David Smith, the Leader of the Conservative groupon ILEA.    They had reviewed the options put forward to deal withILEA&apos;s shortcomings.    None of those concerned favoured theproposal originally put forward by Lord Marshall or its latervariant for members of ILEA to be nominated by the boroughs, whichwas likely to worsen the position of the minority party and would notbe welcomed by the Government&apos;s supporters on ILEA.Professor Smith now favoured a directly elected authority. Theturn-out at elections for such an authority could not be predictedand pressure groups, including those seeking increases in expendi-ture, might well be able to exercise excessive influence on theoutcome.    A directly elected single service authority would in anyevent have little or no incentive to economy.    Neither he nor hiscolleagues would favour a directly elected authority.    To grantindividual boroughs the right to secede from ILEA was not compatiblewith maintaining a unitary authority;  it was simply one way ofachieving break-up.    If Westminster and the City of London secededand the loss of income to the rest of ILEA had, under block grant,to be made up by the rest of the country, the result would more thancounterbalance the shift of grant away from London to the shirecounties in the last Rate Support Grant settlement.    The alternative,which the Minister of State, Department of Industry (Mr Baker)accepted, would be to make fundamental changes in the London rateequalisation arrangements so that Westminster and the City, thoughseceding from ILEA, would continue to contribute to the cost ofeducation in other inner London boroughs.    Their ratepayers wouldnot then benefit financially from secession, though they would beable to provide and control their own schools and further education.There were strong educational arguments against break-up,because of the small school population in some of the boroughs andthe need for some services to continue to be provided for innerLondon as a whole.    There were also strong political arguments.Break-up would not be welcomed by many of the Government&apos;ssupporters in inner London, particularly those representing innerLondon constituencies.    Public opinion appeared at present over-whelmingly against it, and for the Government to appear to be6CONFIDENTIALUTLR.E OF THEINER LONDONDUCATION[JTHORITYeviouseference:C(81) 1stnclusions,inute 4
CONFIDENTIALsupporting it would have a damaging effect on the outcome of theGLiC elections.    In his view, and that of most of the colleagueswhom he had consulted, there was no alternative to a unitaryauthority.    While there was widespread concern about the reports ofILEA&apos;s provisional spending plans for 1981-82, a substantial part ofthe proposed 40 per cent increase in the precept was attributable tothe effects of the Rate Support Grant settlement and the high level ofpast expenditure.    It would not be possible to legislate in time toimprove financial controls for 1981-82.    Looking ahead, it was clearthat the only way in which absolute control could be achieved would beby means of a direct limit on expenditure or rate income Thiswould be a majbr change in the constitutional relationship betweencentral and local government.    Such powers could not be taken &quot;inteirorem&quot;, but would probably have to be exercised;  this might welllead to confrontation of the Clay Cross kind.    It was, however,possible that indirect means such as a differential precept moreclosely related to population would significantly improve financialcontrol.    The Secretary of State for the Environment would becirculating shortly a paper cn the measures that might be taken inrespect of authorities, including ILEA, if they continued to overspendfrom 1982-83 onwards.    It would, however, be desirable for theGovernment to announce its conclusions on the review of ILEA assoon as possible.    Having discussed the matter with the Leader ofthe GLC, he was now inclined to favour publication of a Green orWhite Paper which would discuss the various options, making it clearthat the Government shared the views of those who favoured retentionof a unitary authority but leaving scope for further consultation.It would be desirable for this paper to be published before10 February, when ILEA was due to approve its budget and itsprecept for next year, and for the Government to make clear that itwas considering possible ways of controlling overspending.In discussion, there was general agreement that ILEA&apos;s record as aneducation authority was poor.    Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate&apos;s reportmade it clear that there was continuing cause for concern,particularly about secondary education.    Here the publication ofinformation about individual schools might be of assistance, andthere were powerful arguments against the general educationalpolicies of ILEA which the Government might be able to deploy:nevertheless the risk was that the Government would be criticisedboth for the poor results that ILEA had achieved and for theirfinancial irresponsibility.    The Rate Support Grant settlement hadfaken account of the high level of past expenditure by ILEA, and itwas unrealistic to think that dramatic reductions could be made in asingle year.    ILEA, however, were now proposing tc increase theirexpenditure.    Against that background there were good argumentson democratic grounds for allowing individual boroughs to secedeand thus to control cheir own schools even if their ratepayers stillhad to contribute to the cost of education elsewhere in Inner Londonthrough a modified London rate equalisation scheme.    The presentarrangements for the transfer of housing functions to the boroughs7CONFIDENTIAL
provided a model under which changes could be made subject toMinisterial and Parliamentary approval and a rate equalisationscheme could be devised which placed a limit on the cortribution ofany one borough*    On the other hand, the possibility of secessionwould lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty.    Public opinionwas at present opposed to change, and the Government&apos;s supportersin Inner London how favoured retention of a unitary authority. Itwould be politically damaging if changes were represented as athreat to educational standards.In further discussion, the following points were madej-a. If there was to be no change in the structure ofILEA, it was the more important to improve its financialdiscipline.b. Ministers would need to give further considerationto the control of expenditure by certain profligate localauthorities if block grant failed to have the desired effect.Such authorities placed excessive burdens on industryand small businesses, and any proposals for differentialprecepting might make such burdens even heavier.c. The existence of the Government&apos;s review wasknown, and there was Parliamentary pressure for anearly announcement.    The leader of the GLC favouredthis.d. It would be difficult to draft a satisfactory Greenor White Paper, with extended discussion of the optionsthat had been considered and rejected, until theGovernment could announce proposals about the controlof local authority expenditure and the future of the ratingsystem.    It might therefore be preferable for theSecretary of State for Education and Science to make anoral statement in the House of Commons.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that ILEA&apos;s performance as an education authoritygave continuing cause for concern, but accepted that all the optionsfor changes in its constitution gave rise to considerable difficultiesand would involve difficult and controversial legislation. Onbalance they accepted that a single authority would have to be retained,at least until there were substantial changes in methods of financialcontrol on profligate local authorities and in the rating system. TheSecretary of State for the Environment should bring forward proposalson these matters for collective consideration as soon as practicable.The Cabinet agreed that there was nothing to be gained at this stagefrom the issue of either a Green or a White Paper, and the8
CONFIDENTIALSecretary of State for Education and Science should therefore makean oral statement in the House of Commons as soon as possible.The statement might be to the general effect that for the time beingthe Government accepted the case for continuing with a unitaryeducation authority for Inner London, but was looking at the methodsand arrangements for financial control of the authority.    She wouldwish to give further consideration to the form of that statement andwould consult the Leader of the  GLC on the handling and timing ofthe announcement.    She would then arrange for the outcome to bereported to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for Education andScience, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for the Environment,to prepare the draft of an oral statement announcing theoutcome of the Government&apos;s review of ILEA on the linesindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of theirdiscussion.2. Noted that the Prime Minister would then considerthe draft statement with the Ministers concerned and wouldconsult the Leader of the GLC about the handling andtiming of the statement.3.

The discussionof this question showed that there was a difference of  pinion on therole of cash limits in relation to pay, which could be resolved onlv byfurther discussion in the Cabinet.    The Lord President cf the Council,supported by the Secretary of State for Employment, wished not toannounce a new pay factor f r the present, so that he could opennegotiations on Civil Service pay with an offer of 6 per cent, and indue course to set the cash limit to accommodate a pay settlement ata higher iigure than 6 per cent if necessary.    On this approach thecash limit would not be announced until February, after negotiationson Civil Service pay and after the special conferences of Civil Serviceunions planned for 28 and 29 January.    In the view of the Chancellorof the Exchequer there were strong arguments against this course.Te set cash limits in response to the outcome of negotiations, ratherthan to use them to determine expenditure, would no doubt give greaterfreedom of manoeuvre to those who had to negotiate pay settlements,but it would be a radical departure from existing policy and woulddestroy the credibility of the cash limit system.    To amend the cashlimits at a later stage would be construed as weakness in response tounion pressure and would necessitate the presentation of SupplementaryEstimates to Parliament.    It would be strongly criticised by privatesector and local authority employers.    He recommended, therefore,that he should announce on Monday 26 January that the pay and pricefactors for the cash limits yet to be promulgated would be 7 per centand 10 per cent respectively.    These cash limits could be presentedas providing for the settlement of pay in the Civil Service and theNational Health Service within broadly the same financial disciplines1SECRET
SECRETas the 6 and 11 per cent factors implied for local government. Thiswould enable preparation of the Estimates to go ahead w&apos;thout risk ofleaks, and the Secretary of State for Social Services could authorisethe management side of the National Health Service (NHS), who wouldbe meeting on 28 January, to negotiate on this basis.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES supported theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal.    He said that, if themanagement side of the NHS were authorised to negotiate on the basisof pay and price factors of 7 and 10 per cent, there was a reasonablechance that they could secure a pay settlement not exceeding l\ per cent*If, however, they were forced to open negotiations on the basis of a payfactor of 6 per cent, the union representatives were likely to walk outof the negotiations.    Industrial action would probably follow and theresult could well be settlements of higher than l\ per cent.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there would betactical advantage in opening the negotiations with the Civil Serviceunions at 6 per cent and then being able to move, if necessary, to7 or 7^ per cent.    The union leaders could then say that they had beenable to negotiate on the offer, and the risk of industrial action in theCivil Service would be reduced.    On this approach the factors for theCivil Service could be announced by mid-February.In discussion the following points were made:a. To announce pay and price factors of 7 and 10 per centon 26 January could upset other public sector pay negotiations.If the Government were to appear to be relaxing its approach topay in the NHS and the Civil Service, there was a risk that,contrary to present expectations, the local authority manualsmight not endorse on 27 January the l\ per cent offer made tothem.    The water workers would be encouraged to push formore concessions.    The chances of getting the localauthorities to assume 6 per cent rather than 7 per cent inmaking their rating decisions would be reduced.    This pointedto deferring the announcement of the factors for the NHS andfor the Civil Service for as long as possible.b. Given the need to avoid prejudicing these othernegotiations, there was a case for reverting to the previousassumptions of 6 and 11 per cent for the pay and price factors.These were the factors which the public were expecting to beset and there would be no need to make any further announce-ment for the time being.    There was a chance that settlementscould be negotiated within cash limits set on this basis, since(quite apart from the scope there might be for compensatingfor higher pay increases by reducing numbers) 11 per cent forprices was now judged to give some headroom.    The apparentillogicality of reducing the price factor to 10 per cent, on2SECRET
SECRETaccount cf a more optimistic view of inflation, butincreasing the provision for pay to 7 per cent w^uld beavoided.    The disadvantage was that it could prove impossibleto negotiate settlements within these factors either for theNHS or the Civil Service, and the cash limits would then haveto be re-opened and Supplementary Estimates presented.Although an 11 per cent price factor would give some headroom,it would not be sufficient for the NHS where 70 per cent of thecosts were on pay.Ct The cash limit system was always intended to be astrict discipline but it should not be allowed to become anabsolute straitjacket.    It was not intended that a cash limitshould be absolutely invariable in all circumstances; thepossibility of revision must be kept open, but the systemshould and did ensure that cash limits once set could not ber viced save in exceptional circumstances and for compellingreasons.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that inview of the disadvantages, brought out in their further discussion, ofgoing ahead with an announcement of pay and price factors of 7 and10 per cent the Cabinet agreed on balance that the factors for thecash limits and Estimates for 1981-82 should be 6 per cent for payard 11 per cent for prices.    On this basis there was no need for anannouncement at this stage.    If it proved impossible to negotiate thesettlements for the NHS or for the Civil Service within cash limitsincorporating these factors, the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Lord President of the Council would have to put furtherproposals to Cabinet.    In the meantime the Secretary of State forSocial Services should consider with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord President of the Council what advice he should give tothe management side of the NHS before their meeting on 28 January,The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the Estimates and cash limits for1981-82 should incorporate a pay factor of 6 per centand a price factor of 11 per cent,2.
