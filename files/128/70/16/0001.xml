Mr Sands had been legally elected underthe existing law, and any attempt to expel him would merely exhancehis propaganda, victory.    There was a strong case  tor changing thelaw to prevent persons serving more than a minimum term ofimprisonment from serving as Members of Parliament, but theintroduction of such legislation should not be directly related to theelection of Mr Sands.    One possibility would be to include appropriateprovision in the Criminal Justice Eill proposed for next Session, butthat would mean that no change in the present law could be madebefore July 1982 and would not prevent another convicted prisonerstanding in a further by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, ifMr Sands were to carry out his stated intention of continuing hispresent hunger strike until death.    The Home and Social AffairsCommittee were to consider a memorandum on this subject by theHome Secretary the following day.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, in the light of current Parliamentary opinion,no steps should be contemplated to expel Mr Sands from the House ofCommons.    They noted that he would not be entitled to draw hisParliamentary salary until he had taken the oath as a Member ofParliament (though in that event it would be payable retrospectivelyfrom the date of the return of the writ).    He had made it clear thathe was unwilling to take the oath, and in any case he would not beallowed to attend the House of Commons for this purpose. TheCabinet noted that he had already forfeited substantial remission ofhis sentence, and consequently, even if he abandoned his hunger strike,would not expect to be released from prison before the next GeneralElection.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the Government should not seekMr Sands&apos;s expulsion from the House of Commons.2. Noted that the Home and Social Affairs Committeewere to give early consideration to the possibility oflegislation on the position of convicted persons standingfor Parliamentary election.1CONFIDENTIAL

A draft negotiating brief for discussionswith the unions on the arrangements for the 1982 Civil Ser-dce paysettlement, referred to .in paragraph 9 of the memorandum, wascirculated at the meeting.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that the Cabinethad agreed not to increase the present offer of a 7 per cent increasefor non-industrial civil servants from April 1981.    To secure an endto the present industrial action it would be necessary to assure theunions of the C?overn.tnent&apos;s good faith in seeking to establish anordered and agreed system for the longer term and to agree on thearrangements for the 1982 negotiations, assuming that the longer-term arrangements would not be in place by then.    The unions wouldundoubtedly seek an assurance that the outcome for 1982 was net tobe predetermined by inflexible cash limits set, as for 1931, in advanceof negotiations.    He proposed that some elements of flexibility shouldbe introduced into the settlement of cash limits in relation to pay ofthe Civil Service and the National Health Service (NHS) with the aimof providing a pay negotiating margin that would be sufficient at leastfor normal circumstances.    Under these arrangements provisionaldecisions would be taken in autumn 1981 on the cash provisions in1982-83.    These decisions would need to incorporate a provisionalfactor for pay, but it mighr at that stage be possible to adopt a singleinflation factor to cover both pay and prices.    To avoid whateverfigure was chosen for the pay factor becoming at once a floor and aceiling for subsequent negotiation, it would be set lower than thejudgement of the likely outcome of the pay negotiations. Flexibilityto allow for the initial cash figure to be increased might be foundfrom prompt action to reduce manpower and administrative costs,perhaps from changing the structure of Votes, and from providingin the Contingency Reserve additional money to be made available ifsome modest upward adjustment in the cash provision becamenecessary following negotiations.    Use of the Contingency Reservein this way would in principle be available for all staff employed by1SECRET
SECRETCentral Government, including the Armed Forces and the NHS. Thedraft negotiating brief was intended to serve as a basis for discussionswith the unions on the 1982 settlement.    It listed factors which theGovernment would expect to take into account in the negotiations. Itexplained that, if a claim were referred to arbitration, and if in thelast resort the Government did not feel able to be bound by tne awardof the Arbitration Tribunal because cf its consequences for the levelof public expenditure, the Government would not modify the awardwithout seeking and obtaining the authority of Parliament. Thisapproach built on the procedure which had existed since 1925 byintroducing a new provision for the Government to take the initiativein inviting Parliament to override or modify an arbitral award.This formula would leave open for decision at the time the questionwhether in the event of failure to reach agreement the claim shouldbe referred to arbitration.    He recommended against any firmcommitment now to let a claim go to arbitration in the event offailure to negotiate a settlement in 1982; given the Government&apos;sgeneral stance on unilateral access to arhitiation, it would bepreferable for the Government not to be bound in advance to aparticular course of action in this way.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he and theChancellor of the Exchequer agreed on the proposed approach, saveon the question of arbitration.    He would be willing to open dis-cussions with the unions on the basis that there would be nocommitment by the Government to arbitration.    He did not, however,believe that this would suffice to bring the present industrial disputeto an end.   If he were right in this judgement, he would wish,,at asuitable stage in the negotiations, to cffer a commitment to let theclaim go to arbitration in 1982 should the negotiations then nototherwise be capable of resolution.    There would be some scope forclosing any gap between the cash available and whatever settlementfigure emerged through reductions in staff numbers, but this wouldonly be likely to offset about one percentage point or so, and theCabinet should realise that this course would add to the pressurealready on Departments to achieve -or  surpass the Government&apos;starget for reductions in Civil Service numbers.    He invited theCabinet to give him freedom to decide when to open discussions withthe unions.    If the decision to use servicemen to break the strike ofciviliar staff at the nuclear submarine base on the Clyde led to amajor escalation later in the day in industrial action elsewhere, hewould want to postpone the opening of discussions in order to avoidany impression that the Government was responding to pressure.If, however, there was no significant increase in industrial action,he would then be ready to open negotiations.In discussion the following were the mnixz. points made -a. The proposed arrangements for introducing greater flexibilityinto the financial provisions for Civil Service pay could be at the2SECRET
SECRETexpense of capital investment and of other essential currentexpenditure in the public sector.    This could arise cither ifinsufficient amounts were made available from the ContingencyReserve to Departments to finance pay settlements, or if too muchof the Contingency Reserve was tuken up by additional provision forCentral Government pay.    The proposed arrangements couldtherefore limit the scope for using the 1931 Public ExpenditureSurvey to restore and increase public sector capital investment byxottixig tight cash limits on public service pay.    On the ether hand,the arrangements were designed to ensure that public expenditurein total would not be increased and the decisions on the initialprovision for pay and on any allocations from the Contingency Reservewould be taken by Cabinet collectively.    It should be possible,therefore, to guard against the risks which had been identified.b. &apos;        The proposed arrangements for Central Government paycould cause difficulties for the arrangements for the Rate SupportGrt-nt (RSG).    If the pay factor incorporated in the RSG cash LimitIn November was higher than the provisional pay factor for CentralGovernment, the Civil Service unions would be encouraged by that,and by the knowledge that there was some further provision in theContingency Reserve, to increase their claims and to hold out foragreement to them.    If on the other hand the pay factor for the RSGeach limit was the same as the provisional pay factor for CentralGovernment, and the use of the Contingency Reserve made possiblea higher settlement for the Civil Service than for ?.ocal governmentstaff, the local authorities would argue that the Government had letthem down by imposing tighter disciplines on them than on theCentral Government staff for which they were directly responsible.On the other hand, the local authorities already had greaterflexibility beeause of their reserves and of their income from therates; the effect of the proposed new arrangements would be to giveCentral Government a broadly similar degree of discipline andflexibility.    It might, nevertheless, be necessary to reconsider theRSG arrangements in the light ot the proposed Central Governmentsystem and to see whether any changes were called for.c. Although there were imperfections and difficulties in theproposed arrangements, no perfect solution would ever be found tothe preblem of reconciling cash limits with a measure of freedomof manoeuvre in negotiating on pay.    The proposals&apos; in the memo-randum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Presidentof the Council appeared to offer the best practicable way of intro-ducing the necessary flexibility to enable genuine negociations on payto take place.d. Though public opinion was currently against the Civil Serviceunions, it could not be counted on to stay that way. It v/ould be pre-fcrcLbletajop&apos;ennegotiatioxic soon rather than to let the present disputedrift on in the hope that it would eventually come to an end as public3SECRET
SECRETopinion hardened against the Civil Service.    A settlement of 7 percent for 1981, and agreement on a reasonable framework fornegotiations in 1982 and later, would present a considerable successfor the Government.e. There were considerable risks in conceding now the right toarbitration in the event of failure to negotiate a settlement. Thiscould have adverse repercussions on other public sector arrange-ments, and would seem inconsistent with the Government&apos;s recentdecision to withdraw the right of unilateral access to arbitration inother parts of the public sector as soon as possible.    The greaterflexibility now proposed for determining the pay cash limit could bejustified only if the Government retained its right to take a finaldecision on the amount of money available for pay.    On the otherhand, the reality was that it would probably be necessary to accepta commitment to allow the 1982 claim to go to arbitration ifnecessary in order to bring the present dispute to an end aud toconvince the unions of the Government&apos;s good faith.    This would notnecessarily be damaging.    The Civil Service Arbitration Tribunalhad an independent Chairman and a good record of responsibleawards.    The Government could retain the power to modify an awardsubject to the approval of Parliament.f. Since public finance would be at issue, there was a strongcase in principle for confining to the House of CommonsParliamentary consideration of any Government proposals tomodify an arbitral award although there were precedents, notablyin the Remuneration of Teachers Act, for both Houses to be involvedin such decisions.    Further consideration should be given to whetherthere was any constitutional or other objection to excluding the Houseof Lords from the proposed arrangements.    In practice it was likelythat the Government would have a majority in both Houses if theymade proposals.    There might, however, be some reluctance topress for an award to be modifier1 if, for example, it was notsubstantially over the amount which the Government was preparedto offer.g. The Cabinet were due to decide after Easter whether topropose negotiations on the long-term system for determining CivilService pay or to offer,      independent inquiry ..sifter Eaotor whenthey would consider the report of MISC 54.    It would then benecessary to consider whether such an inquiry ran the risk that theGovernment might find it difficult to reject findings which wereunacceptable to it.    On the other hand, an independent inquiry couldwell bring improvements in the present system which it would beimpossible to agree in direct negotiations with the unions.    The offerof such an inquiry would, moreover, be attractive to the many civilservants of moderate opinion who strongly disliked strike action butwho were, nevertheless, deeply concerned over the arrangementsfor the longer term.    If such an inquiry were to be offered now, itmight then be possible to end the present dispute without concedinga commitment to let the 1982 claim go to arbitration if necessary.4SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that oztbalance the Cabinet agreed that the proposals in paragraph 6 ofC(81) 15 provided an acceptable basis for introducing elements offlexibility into the application of the cash limit system in relationto the negotiation and determination of pay in the Civil Service andother public services for 1982-1983, while retaining the essentialdiscipline of cash limits on the course of expenditure during thefinancial year to which they related6   It was recognised that thenew procedures would carry implications for the arrangements fordetermining the cash limit for the Rate Support Grant in 1982-1983;and would entail difficult decisions for the Cabinet, both on theamounts of cash limitB and on the size of the central contingencyreserve, if room was to be kept within planned overall levels ofpublic expenditure for some increase in spending on capitalprogrammes.    On the basis of the proposals for introducingflexibility into the cash limit system, the Cabinet was able to agreethat the Lord President of the Council should have authority to tellthe Civil Service unions, in the context of negotiations to seek toresolve the current dispute, that, on the assumption that a newlong-term system for determining Civil Service pay would not havebeen established in time to be used for the 1982 settlement, theGovernment wculd be prepared at the appropriate time to enter intonegotiations on the Civil Service pay settlement due in April 1982without a predetermined limit on the cost of any settlement.    As toarbitration in 1982, the Ca.binet would prefer net to be committedin the course of the current settlement to referring the 1982 payclaim to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, if it c?,uld not besettled in negotiation.    The Lord President of the Council shouldtherefore seek in negotiations to avoid any commitment to refernext year&apos;s claim to arbitration under the Civil Service ArbitrationAgreement:  that was a matter for decision at the time. If,however, the Lord President of the Council was unable to reachagreement on that basis, and if he judged that a commitment onaccess to arbitration next year was an essential part of the pricefor calling off the present dispute, he should consult theChancellor of the Exchequer:   the Cabinet accepted that in thosecircumstances the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the LordPresident of the Council should have authority to decide that ifnecessary the unions should be told that, if it was not possible toreach a settlement by negotiation next year, the Government wouldbe ready to promise now to let next year&apos;s claim go to arbitration.If that offer was made, the Lord President of the Council should makeit clear to the unions that the Government would endeavour to findmeans of financing an award following arbitration within the plannedoverall levels of public expenditure, for which purpose the numbersof civil servants employed would have to be considered, and shouldgo on to explain that, if in the last reso-t the Government did notfeel able to be bound by the award because of its consequences forthe level of public expenditure, it would rot modify it without seekingand obtaining Parliamentary authority.    Since questions of publicfinance would then be at stake, it was in principle desirable that5SECRET
SECRETthis r.uthority should be sought from the House of Commons alone,although there were precedents for involving both Houses ofParliament in such decisions.    The Lord President of the Councilshould consider further whether there were any constitutional orother objections to excluding the House of Lords from the proposedprocedure.    The Cabinet further agreed that the Lord President ofthe Council should have authority to offer the unions anindependent inquiry into the longer-term arrangements for deter-mining Civil Service pay.    The membership and terms ofreference of this inquiry would be for further consideration. Theoffer of this inquiry could well be attractive to the large body ofmoderate opinion in the Civil Ser^ce, and the Cabinet consideredthat if such an offer, together with the proposed commitment tonegotiate for 1982 without a pre-determined limit on the cost ofany settlement, would lead to the settlement of the current dispute,that concession   was preferable to a commitment now to let theclaim go to arbitration in 1982,    The Cabinet confirmed that thereshould be no increase in the 7 per cent increase for the non-industrial Civil Service already offered for 1981,    The Cabinetagreed that the Lord President of the Council should be free todecide when to open negotiations, and they took note that hisdecision would be influenced by the extent to which the intensifiedindustrial action which the unions intended to mount later in theday was supported by the staff.The Cabinet -1. Approved in principle the proposals inparagraph 6 of C(8l) 15 for introducing flexibility intothe settlement of the 1982-19o3 cash limits in relationto pay in the Civil Service, the Armed Forces and theNational Health Service2. Invited the Lord President of the Council toenter into negotiations with the Civil Service unions onthe settlement of their 1981 pay claim.3. Invited the Lord President of the Council inhis negotiations to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.4. Agreed that the Lord President of the Councilshould not enter into a commitment to let the 1982claim go to arbitration unless such a commitment wasnecessary in order to secure a settlement of the currentdispute, and then only with the agreement of theChancellor of the Exchequer^6SECRET
SECRET5. Invited the Lord President of the Councilto consider further, in consultation with otherMinisters concerned, whether, in the event of theGovernment wishing to seek Parliamentary authorityto modify an award by the Civil Service ArbitrationTribunal in 1982, it would be acceptable to seekauchority only from the House of Commons.Cabinet Office15 April 19817SECRET
