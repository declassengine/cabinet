CONFIDENTIAL&apos;lIAMENTARY   it The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the,^jftS House of Commons during the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that during the CommitteeStage of the Finance Bill that afternoon he intended to announce theGovernment&apos;s intention of reducing the increase in the duty on oieselroad fuel (derv) announced in his Budget Speech from 2Op to lOp a gallon,at a revenue cost of aDout  80 million in the current year.    He wouldalso be announcing a concession on the duty on hydrocarbon oil used forheating horticultural greenhouses.    The Commission of the EuropeanCommunities were taking action against the Dutch Government inrelation to their existing subsidy for such costs, but had agreed that inthe meantime other member states might take any necessary counter-vailing action to ensure that their own horticultural interests were notdisadvantaged.     The cost would be  5j million, of which  2 millionwould be met from the vote of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food.    Both changes would have effect from 1 August 1981. Hehoped that these concessions would be sufficient to secure the supportof the majority of those Government backbenchers who had beenthreatening to vote against the proposed increases in the duty on bothpetrol and derv, thus enabling the Government to defeat amendmentswhich sought to reduce the 20p increase in the petrol duty.THE CHIEF WHIP said that from sounaings he had taken with theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s agreement it seemed likely that about adozen of the Government&apos;s own supporters would still vote for areduction in the 20p increase in the petrol duty and a few others mightabstain or not be present in the House that evening.    On the basis of theproposed concessions, it should, however, be possible to defeat anyamendments on the petrol duty, though with a low majority. Rumourswere circulating in the House of Commons that the proposed reduction inthe increase in the derv duty would be financed from cuts in capitalprojects.    This could clearly be damaging to the Government, and it wasdesirable that these rumours should be countered as firmly as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted that a group of Scottish Members of Parliament hadprepared a paper about the differential pricing policy of the oil com-panies, which imposed heavy premia on the prices charged fo.- petro1 andderv in rural areas, and at some service stations, particularly those onmotorways which were monopoly suppliers.    This was a matter ofcommercial policy, but it would be presentationally helpful if theGovernment could be seen publicly to have expressed their concern tothe companies.    The Cabinet noted that the Secretary of State for Energyhad seen the Members of Parliament concerned and was alreadycommitted to discussing the matter with the industry.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer should now consider with the Secretary of State forEnergy whether and in what terms it would be appropriate to refer tothis during the relevant debate on the Finance Bill.1CONFIDENTIAL
tCONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Took note.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer toconsider, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Energy, what he shouM say in the House ofCommons that afternoon about a possible Governmentapproach to the oil companies on the effect of theirpresent pricing policies.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that abouteasions 100 Labour Members of Parliament had assembled outside theDepartment of Employment that morning to protest against thecontinuing rise in unemployment.    This appeared to be a prelude to theplanned demonstration in and march from Liverpool by the &quot;right-to-work&quot; campaign and also to be part of the Labour Party&apos;s protestagainst the general ban on public processions recently imposed inLondon and some other parts of the United Kingdom.2CONFIDENTIAL
tCONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRE1 ARY said that there was a high risk, especiallyfollowing the Brixton disturbances, that various groups could exploitpublic processions in the London area to create further trouble and toincrease the burden on the Metropolitan Police.    The present ban ;nLondon had been imposed for only 28 days and did not apply totraditional parades.    He had also agreed to allow the normal politicalMay Day rally in London.    The Labour Party (whose leader was notwilling to co-operate on this issue) and other organisations mightcontinue to seek ways of circumventing the ban, as they had thatmorning, but he was in no doubt that it had been right to impose the banon marches in London and (on the initiative of the local authoritiesconcerned) in other parts of the country, in order to lessen the risk ofmore serious disturbances.The Cabinet -3.       Took note.EIGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that aAIRS critical point had mow been reached at the Unite 1 Nations, where therepresentative oi Uganda, on behalf of the Africa Group, had put forwardibia in the Security Council a series of extreme and unacceptableresolutions on Namibia which called for comprehensive economic&apos;ious sanctions against South Africa, including an oil embargo.    A comp-rence: romise resolution had been put forward by the Irish, who were in theII) 8th chair at the Security Council.    This would be acceptable to Britain; andlusions, there was now some prospect that the Americans would also accept it,lte 3 despite a number of difficulties it presented from their point of view.The Africans might still reject it in favour oi their own resolutions.In that case there would be a triple veto by the United States, Britain andFrance.     The Africans knew this and were indeed prcbably relying on itsince they themselves would suffer severely if comprehensive economicsanctions were ever implemented.    Even so, some damage to Britain&apos;seconomic interests in Africa could not be ruled out if a British veto hadto be used.    Tension in the area was in any case certain to be increasedand with it the danger of further involvement on the part of the Russiansand their allies.inon THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Lebanon was extremely complicated, and there was now areal danger of the super-powers becoming militarily involved. TheIsraelis had shot down two Syrian helicopters in central Lebanon; theSyrians were in consequence introducing SAM 60 missiles;  and, if theIsraelis sought to destroy those missiles, the Syrians might appeal to the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSoviet Union to intervene.    The underlying problem was that theSyrians wanted to take over the Lebanon, whose separate existence theyhad always disliked;   while the Israelis for their own security reasonswere not prepared to see this happen and preferred a continued state ofuncertainty.    The Lebanese Government were almost powerless and thecountry had in effect been partitioned,    There was little that the. UnitedNations force in the south could do;  and the Syrians, mth other Arabsupport, were opposed to further international action, eg of the kindrecently suggested by the French, whose motives the Syrians distrusted.It was the French who had originally detached the Lebanon from Syria;and they had always championed the interests of the Lebanese Christians.The Americans meanwhile v/ere doing their best to calm things down andhad appealed to the Soviet Union to co-operate.    British representativeswere urging caution in the relevant Middle Eastern capitals.The Cabinet -Took note.MJNITY 3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said he wouldFAIRS shortly be visiteu by the Dutch Minister for Social Affairs about theproposed Joint Council of Finance, Economic and Employment Ministersposed on the unemployment problem of the European Community (EC). Thewil on Dutch would suggest that adequate preparations could not be made to holdmployment the meeting during their Presidency and that it should be held under theBritish Presidency towards the end of the year.    While such a meeting&quot;ious would be unlikely to produce positive results., expectations woulderence: inevitably be built up by the media.    The Community would be heavily)l) 15th involved in discussing budget restructuring later in the year, and Heads&apos;elusions, of Government would be meeting in London at the end of November.Mte 3 Neither the United Kingdom Government nor the French and GermanGovernments had any enthusiasm fc r such a meeting, but they werecommitted to it by decisions of the European Council,    He would discusswith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary what line he should take with his Dutch colleague.Sof THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theea*s to United States Government&apos;s recent decision to abandon the embargo on^sr- grain sales to the Soviet Union following the invasion of Afghanistan hadin fact been taken because of commitments given during the Presidentials election campaign.     There was bound to be some disillusionment withrence; United States foreign policy, and the Japanese in particular, who had^ 4th. supported United States policy, now felt let down.    The EC would see nofusions, option but to follow suit, and the Commission had already decided to re-^ establish export restitutions for sales of cereals to the Soviet Union.This would be welcome to the French Government, which was anxious tosell 600,000 tons of wheat.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discussion it was noted that the gram embargo had not beezt.particularly effective, since the Soviet Union had secured svppliesindirectly through eastern Europe.    This experience was another to addto the long history of ineffective economic sanctions, and would be boundto influence consideration of any suggestion for similar policies in thefuture.    It was now likely that there v/ould be a race among cerealsuppliers to sell to the Soviet Union, and at current world prices the ECwould not be able to do so without an element of subsidy.    It wouldnevertheless be cheaper for the EC to export than to keep the cereals instore.    The decision to export wheat to the Soviet Union was not oneover which the British Government could exercise a veto.    As regardsexports of butter, the Commission did not intend to reinstate exportrestitutions because stocks within the EC were low.The Cabinet -Took note.il[VICEiiviousierence:(81) 16thiclasions,lute 24.

CONFIDENTIALTHERNLANDFAIRSviouserence:(81) 16thelusions,ute 16. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat Mr Sands, the newly-elected Member of Parliament for Fermanaghand South Tyrone, was now in the 6lst day of his hunger strike at theMaze Prison.    He remained lucid and able to talk, but his eyesigb* wasfailing and he was now so weak that if he continued to refuse food andmedical attention he was unlikely to live more than a few days.    He badconsistently made clear, both orally and in writing, that he did not wishto be treated medically.    Nevertheless, if he went into a coma, thedoctors would revive him once, provided that his relatives so wished;and this would give them a final opportunity of asking him if he wouldaccept treatment.     On the other hand, it waj quite possible that hewould now die of heart failure without losing consciousness first. Fromthe Government&apos;s point of view it would be preferable to move him fromthe prison to an outside hospital before he died.    In order to avoidpossible accusations of contributing to his death, however, that could bedone only on the basis of medical advice.    At present the doctors&apos; viewwas that, unless he required and would accept positive medical treatment,there was no case for moving him from the prison hospital where hecould be well cared for.    But he would be moved if he had tc be revivedfrom a coma.Meanwhile the Pope had sent one of his Private Secretaries,Father Magee, an Ulsterman, to visit Mr Sands.    He himself had seenFather Magee, who had made clear that he had not come to negotiate orto mediate but to convey to Mr Sands the Pope&apos;s urging that he shouldabandon the hunger strike.    Mr Sands had refused to do so, though hehad offered to suspend it if the authorities would start negotiations withhim on his demands for special status.    It had been made clear that suchnegotiations were impossible, and Father M:gee had neither expectednor requested them.    Father Magee, who was currently in Dublin butexpected to return to Belfast, had also seen the other three hungerstrikers in the Maze and urged them to desist.    In their case it waspossible that his appeal might have more effect.     One of them,Mr Francis Hughes, had gone on strike two weeks after Mr Sands but oneweek before the others, but was now considerably weaker than Mr Sandshad been at the same stage, and might well die not long after Mr Sandsunless he desisted.Mr Sands&apos;s condition had led to rioting in Northern Ireland, particularlyin Londonderry, where about 100 youths had been involved eac&apos;i night.The security forces had responded magnificently, showing great patienceunder violent provocation and using only the minimum of forcethemselves.    So far they had succeeded in containing the incidents andisolating the trouble spots;  and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who werenow much stronger and more professional than in earlier crises, werereasonably confident that with the Army&apos;s help they couicl continue to keepthe situation under control, although some military reinforcement of theProvince (eg with a spearhead battalion) might be temporarily necessary.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHe himself and the Chief Constable were keeping in close touch withcommunity leaders and others in a position of responsibility Butthere was considerable public unease, particularly in Belfast, with eachcommunity afraid of attack from the other if Mr Sands died. TheProvisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) were energetically fomentingsuch fears.     Mr Sands himself was now largely discredited in the eyesof the local Catholic community, after failing to take advantage of theopportunities *or ending his strike which had been successively offeredby his election to Parliament, by the visit of three members of theDublin Parliament, by the action taken by the European Commission forHuman Rights, and by Father Magee&apos;s appeal.    International interestwas intense, and nearly 400 foreign journalists were at present inBelfast.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet fully endorsed the measures which the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland had taken and offered him their whole-hearted supportat a time of such particular difficulty.    Although cTather Magee had verycorrectly said nothing to the Press, it was helpful that he wss widelyknown to have urged Mr Sands and his associates to end their hungerstrike.    The decline of support for Mr Sands among the minoritycommunity was also an important factor, particalarly as regards inter-national opinion, although it might be minimised by Press represen-tatives who preferred sensationalism.    The Home Secretary would givefurther consideration to the possibility of reminding the broadcastingauthorities of the need for extreme care over any reporting which mightprove inflammatory.    The threat of renewed PIRA violence in Britainshould not be played up;  but signs of it were already evident andMinisters should bear in mind the need for special precautionsparticularly as regards letter and parcel bombs.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office30 April 19817CONFIDENTIAL

The Councilhad written to him in reply to the effect that 7 per cent in 1981 wasinadequate, that the assurances for the basis of negotiations in 1982were insufficient, and that for the later years the right course was ajoint review of the Pay Agreement rather   than in independent inquiry.It was unlikely that the union leaders would make any further movesuntil the Civil Service union conferences in May were over. Herecommended that the Government should not, before the end of theseconferences, increase the pressure on the unions to reach a settle-ment.      To try to do so could encourage militant opinion in the unionsto use the opportunities of the conferences to press for increasingindustrial action and then to blame the Government for provoking this.In the meantime, the Civil Service Department would consider withother Departments what further pressures could be put on the unionsafter the conferences and what further incentives might be offered tosecure a settlement.    In particular, consideration should be given tothe possibility of giving an indication to the unions, and to the CivilService at large, that the Government could not indefinitely becommitted to back-dating the 7 per cent increase to the settlementdate of 1 April 1981.    In the meantime, public opinion seemed toaccept that the Government had made a reasonable offer to the unions,both for 1981 and as a basis for agreeing on acceptable arrangementsfor the future.    No doubt this could change tc criticism of theGovernment if the dispute were to continue for too long and if theinconvenience to the public were to increase.    The contingency plansfor dealing with the present action were working satisfactorily.1SECRET
SECRETTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that traffic was notbeing seriously held up by action by the Customs and Excise, andthat about 80 per cent of Value Added Tax revenue was still beingreceived.    The problems of industrial action were greater in theInland Revenue;   70 per cent of revenue was still being received,but it would be difficult to increase this flow.    The total net effectso far on the Central Government Borrowing Requirement (CGBR) wasabout  2^ billion, and this would lead to a sharp increase in the Aprilfigures both for the CGBR and for the money supply.    These effectswould, however, be unwound in due course, and in the medium termthere would be no significant effect on the Government1 s economicstrategy,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TFJ\.DE said that, although theair traffic controllers were no longer civil servants, they remainedmembers of the Civil Service unions.    Most airports had beenaffected by industrial action by the controllers, and this could beintensified over the coming Bank Holiday by action at the Londonairports.    If this were to happen, he would publicly condemn theaction.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatindustrial action was beginning to affect the preparation of recordsof National Insurance contributions for the purpose of dealing withapplications for benefits.    The problems could be contained,provided that industrial action did not continue for more than aboutthree weeks.    He was encouraged by the skill with which managersin his Department had kept their staff substantially employed evenwhen computers were out of operation.    Any threat not to backdatethe 7 per cent increase to 1 April would L&gt;  liable to lose ihe goodwillof the more senior staff who were working under stress to maintainthe service.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. SCOTLAND said that industrialaction was affecting the Sheriff&apos;s Courts in. Scotland, and that it mightbe necessary for him to propose urgent legislation to extend the timelimits for action in civil cases.    The Government was speciallyvulnerable to industrial action by civil servants in Scotland becauseso many of its activities were dependent on one central computer.Once the dispute was over consideration should be given to meansof reducing this vulnerability and to the desirability of reversing thepolicy of civilianisation in the police and the Ministry of Defence.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, until the conferences of the Civil Service unionswere over, the Government should not seek to raise the level of theirresponse to the industrial action in the Civil Service.    The LordPresident of the Council would, however, consult other Ministersconcerned on ways in which pressures could be brought to bear uponthe situation after the conferences.    When the dispute was over theSecretary of State for Scotland should consider, in consultation with2SECRET
SECRETother colleagues concerned, whether and how to reduce the vulnera-bility which resulted from dependence on a single central computerin Scotland.    It was not possible to reverse the process ofcivilianisation of armed forces and police functions without majorimplications for the cost and control of armed forces and policenumbers.    The Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should reach agreement as soon as possible on the factsheet which they had undertaken to circulate to Ministers for usewhen meeting representatives of unions in their own Departments andin public discussion of the dispute.The Cabinet -1.

SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(8i) 17th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 30 April 1931 at 10.00 amCOPY NO20p SALARIES,ED FORCESD DOCTORS&apos;D DENTISTS&apos;Y REVIEWDIES REPORTSThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (C(81) 17) on the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) ReportNo. 16, a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence(C(81) 19) on the Tenth Repoit of the Armed Forces Pay ReviewBody (AFPRB), and a memorandum by the Secretary of State forSocial Services (C(81) 18) on the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; ReviewBody (DDRB) Report for 1981.    They also had before them a lettero* 27 April from the Lord Chancellor to the Chancellor of theExchequer on the salaries of the judiciary, and a note by the  &gt;Secretary of the Cabinet (C(81) 16) covering the reports of the threeReview Bodies.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in considering the recommendationsof the three Review Bodies, the Cabinet would need to take accountof the recommendations for the pay for Members of Parliament (MPs)and for Ministers which they had considered on 9 April(CC(8l) 15th Conclusions, Minute 5) and of the pay settlements beingsought by the non-industrial Civil Service and by the nurses andother National Health Service (NHS) groups.    The problem was oneof achieving a defensible consistency of treatment between this widerange of different groups in a situation where past decisions had lefteach with a different starting point and where each group would belooking across at the treatment afforded to the others.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, in their ReportNo. 16 on the pay of senior civil servants, senior officers of theArmed Forces and the higher judiciary, the TSRB made no newsalary recommendations for 1981 but urged the Government toimplement in full, and as soon as possible,  the rates recommendedin 198 0in their Report No. 14.    That implied an average increaseof 12 per cent, which could not be justified when many groups in thepublic sector were settling at around 6 to 7 per cent. Herecommended that there should be a 7 per cent increase on the salarybill for the TSRB proups. ir line with the settlement proposed fox thenon-industrial civil servants.    The TSRB had not put forward anyproposals on how an amount of 7 per cent might be distributedbetween the Civil Service and the Armed Forces&apos; grades concerned,but they had made proposals, set out in their Chairman&apos;s letter of1SECRET
SECRET28 April to the Secretary of the Cabinet, on the distribution of theaward for the judiciary.    Limiting the increase to 7 per cent in1981 would add to the problems which were building up for thefollowing year, when the TSRB would be making recommendationson the basis of a fundamental review of salary levels which they werenow starting;  allowing for the 5 per cent short-fall which stillremained on their 1980 recommendations, and for inflation in themeantime, that could well result in recommendations next year inthe order of 20 per cent.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, although he remained deeplyconcerned over the problems of recruitment to the judiciary, heaccepted &apos;hat they should be awarded increases averaging 7 per centin 1981 and distributed as recommended by the TSRB.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the AFPRB,which dealt with the combatant ranks up to and including Brigadier,had recommended ii.creases averaging 10, 3 per cent gross and9.4 per cent net when increased charges for food and accommodationwere taken into account.    These increases were net of a deductionfor th^ value of Armed Forces pensions which had been increased toli per cent     Although they would be higher than those proposed forother public sector groups, the Government was firmly committed toimplementation of the recommendations of the AFPRB. Therelatively higher increases could be justified on the grounds that theArmed Forces, like the police but unlike other public sector groups,did not go on strike.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theDDRB Report recommended increases close to 9 per cent across theboard, though a proposed recoupment of over-payments in previousyears to dentists v/ould reduce the overall increase in the pay bill in1981-82 to 8.3 per cent.    Other NHS groups, including the nurses,would expect increases comparable to those for the doctors anddentists.    If the DDRB Report were to be accepted, and similarincreases were conceded for other NHS groups, the cost for the NHSae a whole would be about  200 million more than the provision in thecash limits;  excesses of this order could be offset only by makingvery substantial cuts in services.    He recommended, therefore, that,with the aim of securing pay settlements within the cash limits, forthe NHS groups as a whole, the doctors and dentists should be offeredincreases averaging 6 per cent, with some small margins to ease theproblem of securing recoupment of the earlier over-payments to thedentists.    Although the doctors and dentists were unlikely to takeindustrial action, they would undoubtedly object strongly;  the juniorhospital doctors in particular might once again withdraw from thepresent arrangements for pay determination.    It was possible thatthe Review Body would resign.    To ease these difficulties, herecommended that the Government should announce its decisions onall three of the Review Body Reports at the same time, and explainthe basis for its decisions and the reasons for the different levels of2SECRET
SECRETincrease awarded.    It would be  helpful if, before these decisionswere announced, the Prime Minister could explain them to theChairman of the DDRB.    He (The Secretary of State for SocialServices) would also wish to explain the decisions in confidence tothe General Secretaries of the British Medical Association (BMA)and of the British Dental Association (BDA) and to inform representa-tives of the professions of the Government&apos;s decision on the day ofthe announcement.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that, on 13 June, MPs and Ministerswould receive the third and final stage of the increases which theTSRB had recommended for them in their Twelfth Report in 19 79as modified by the Government in 1980.    In the case of MPs thisincrease would be of 11.9 per cent     He and the Lord President ofthe Council had recommended, in C(81) 13, that in addition MPsshould receive a further b per cent which would give a 3alary of18. 7 per cent above that now in payment.    MPs would deoply resentany move to confine their increase to the implementation of thethird stage of the 1979 award, and he strongly recommended that thefurther uprating of 6 per cent should now be approved.    In addition,the Review Body had been asked to advise on the up-dating ofParliamentary allowances in the usual way.In discussion there was general agreement with the recommendationsof the Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of State forDefence and the Secretary of State for Social Services on, respective-ly, the proposals in the Reports of the TSRB, the AFPRB and theDDRB, and the following points were made:-a.      Although the total increases proposed for MPs andMinisters could be justified, on the grounds that 11.9 per centresulted from deferment of increases from earlier years,they would be represented by critical commentators as18. 7 per cent for MPs and Ministers at a time when the publicsector generally were being called on to settle at 6 or7 per cent.    The increase could well make it more difficultto persuade the civil servants to settle for 7 per cent, andwould be seized on by militant opinion, particularly if itwere announced while the Civil Service union conferenceswere still in progress.    It would also encourage the othergroups covered by the TSRB and by the DDRB to challengethe Government&apos;s decisions on their pay.    There was,therefore, a case for confining the increase to 11.9 per cent.On the other hand, the proposed total of 18. 7 per cent couldbe explained and defended, and it was desirable to avoid along-running argument in Parliament over MPs&apos; pay.3SECRET
SECRETb. The fact that the average net award by the AFPRBwas 9.4 per cent could enable the Government to point outthat the settlement was within single figures.    Care should,however, be taken in deploying this argument, since nursesand junior doctors living in and paying for hospitalaccommodation could then be ecouraged to point out thattheir net increases were well below the 6 per cent gross nowproposed for them.c. Although the Government was firmly committed toimplementation of the recommendations of AFPRB Reports,it would become increasingly difficult to defend this bycomparison with the decisions taken on the pay of othergroups; particularly if the problems of recruiting andretaining armed forces personnel were to ease and whenmany civil servants, who were declining to strike forsettlements in excess of 7 per cent, were working alongsideService personnel who had been given highei increases.d. It would be preferable to avoid bringing the methods ofsettling the pay of the police into the present public debateson the pay of other groups, but this could not wholly beavoided in the case of ambulancemen who were claimingparity of treatment with other emergency services.e. It was public knowledge that the three Reports hadnow been submitted to the Prime Minister and the expecta-tion would be that they would be published by around themiddle of May.    Some of the Civil Service unionconferences would scill be in progress then, and theannouncement of the Government&apos;s decisions wouldundoubtedly affect the line being taken on the proposedsettlement of 7 per cent for the non-industrial CirilService.    The acceptance of the AFPRB Report wouldencourage the Civil Service to continue to press for morethan 7 per cent, although the level of the Armed Forces&apos;award might be less than they had been expecting. Thedecisions on 6 per cent for the DDRB groups and of 7 per centfor the TSRB groups would, however, underline theGovernment&apos;s resolve to settle at 7 per cent for theService generally.    There might be a case for deferring theannouncement of the increase for MPs on the grounds that itwas based on considerations different from those applyingto the other groups and that a further report from the TSRBwas expected shortly, on the other hand it was probablypreferable to deal with all the Review Body groups at thesame time.4SECRET
