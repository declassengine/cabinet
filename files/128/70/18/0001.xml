THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary had attended the Ministerial meetingof the North Atlantic Council which had taken place in Rome on4 and 5 May.    The United States had agreed to begin discussionswith the Soviet Union, before the end of the year, on the limitationof Theatre Nuclear Forces (TNF).In return, the American Secretary of State, Mr Alexander Haig,had wanted the Council&apos;s communique to include strong wordingon the need for increased defence expenditure, but had in the endaccepted a compromise formula which kept the question open forfurther discussion by NATO Defence Ministers, who were due tomeet in the following week.    On strategic grounds alcne it wasarguably v/rong to negotiate on the limitation of TNF in Europe ata time when Soviet SS-20 missiles were already deployed and wereetealily increasing in number but before the deployment of UnitedStatec ground launched cruise missiles (GLCMs); but the Europeanallies needed the assurance that such negotiations would take place,if they were to be able to overcome the political and publicresistance to the stationing of United States GLCMs in theircountries.amibiareviouseference:C(81) 17thonclusions,nute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in tLe United Nationb SecurityCouncil on 1 May the United Kingdom, together with the UnitedStates and France, had vetoed a series of resolutions calling forsanctions against South Africa.    Initial African reactions had beenrelatively calm.    Officials of the five Western countries which hadtaken the lead in seeking a solution to the Namibian problem wouldshortly meet in Rome to discuss the possible addition ofconstitutional arrangements to the proposals which South Africa hadhitherto found unacceptable.    The South African Foreign Minister,Mr Pik Botha, was due to visit the United States, whose governmentwas best placed to put pressure on the South Africans to committhemselves to reaching agreement.panonre viouseference:C(31) 17thInclusions,Invite 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s previousdiscussion of the situation in the Lebanon, the fighting had dieddown.    Negotiations between the Syrians and the Ciiristian forceswithin the country were proceeding satisfactorily;  but the dangerof further hostilities between the Israelis and the Syrians remainedacute.    Both the United States and the Soviet Union were despatchingspecial emissaries to the area.CONFIDENTIAL
The Cabinet -Took note.[MUNITY 3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said tnat theAIRS Dutch Government were now less willing to hold the proposed JointCouncil cf Finance, Economic and Employment Ministers during theirI ped Presidency.    He had told the Dutch Minister for Social Affairs that itJicil on would be difficult to contemplate holding the meeting in July or October,I nployment or indeed at any time during the British Presidency, given the adversepublicity which it would generate at a time of high unemployment figuresI ,ious in the United Kingdom.    If an early and low-key meeting could not be| rence: held in June, he had proposed to the Dutch that emphasis should be laidil) 17th on the need for thorough preparation.    This was acceptable to the Dutch,iusions, who were facing an early election, provided that it was not said publiclyI ite 3 that there was no intention of calling the meeting during the BritishPresidency.The Cabinet -Took note.THERN 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said&apos;^ND that the situation in Northern Ireland remained tense. Following^IRS Mr Sands&apos;s death early on 5 May there had been considerable disorderin West Belfast.    This mainly took the form of hooliganism, in which10us young people attacked the security forces, rather than of organisedrence; inter-community violence.    But a police officer had been killed by&apos;1) 17th sniper fire the previous night, and it appeared that a renewal oflusions, Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorism was to be expected.&quot;e 6 The police and security forces were doing a magnificent job and weretaking pains to prevent an outbreak of violence between the twocommunities.    Later that day the funeral of Mr Sands would take place.A very large procession was expected, numbering between 20,000 and30, 000, and the occasion would certainly be marked by the flaunting ofthe Irish tricolour, the wearing of military uniforms, and a funeralvolley by masked men.    All this, and the diversion of the processionfrom part of its intended route through a Protestant area, would be thefocus of international media attention.    The Government would be thesubject of unfavourable publicity abroad and vigorous criticism at homefor its failure to prevent the illegal manifestations of support for theIRA.    Within Northern Ireland, however, it was generally acceptedthat each community should bury its dead in the way it considered fitting.2CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThere was no doubt chat intervention by the security forces would beextremely dangerous unless it were on such a massive scalp as toprovoke even worse publicity.    The security forces were at full strength,and prepared for the trouble which was likely to follow immediately afterthe burial.    With the agi eement of the Secretary of State for Defence,the Spearhead battalion had been moved to Northern Ireland the previousnight to provide an additional reserve.    Looking ahead, it wasreasonable to hope that the disorders would die down over the weekend,but they could be given fresh impetus if another hunger striker died.Mr Hughes, although he had begun his fast two weeks later thanMr Sands, might well die in the middle of the following week, unless hewere persuadsd to give up.    This possibility could not be excluded,since there were indications of a division of opinion between those in theProvisional IRA who wished to make the most cf the present publicity intheir favour and those who wished to increase the pressure on theGovernment by any means possible.    In either case the Governmentwould be subjected to international pressure to show greater flexibility.He himself would continue to take every opportunity to make clear theissue of principle involved, and would be going to Belfast immediatelyfor that purpose,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that thepolice and Army were fulfilling their role superbly.    The risks ofintervening to prevent manifestations of support for the IRA during thefuneral of Mr Sands were unacceptable, and the Government would haveto put up with the resulting criticism of its inaction.    There stillappeared to be widespread ignorance, part of it genuine, about the highstandards of the Maze Prison and the extent to which the Governmenthad already shc/wn flexibility in matters of prison administration. Thoseresponsible for television reporting within the United Kingdom wereaware of the Government&apos;s concern not to give the IRA gratuitouspublicity.    Internationally, a good deal had already been done, butfurther efforts should be made through overseas posts to deploy theGovernment&apos;s case.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, toarrange for further information to be disseminatedoverseas in support of the Government&apos;s position.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlieENDIT UREVEY 1981ELINESiousrence;1) 8thlusions,te 65. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(81) 20) on the guidelines for the conduct of the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she would arrange for a generaldiscussion of economic policy by the Cabinet in the first half of June.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he was not askingthe Cabinet to take decisions on public expenditure now, but was seekingapproval for guidelines for the preparation by Departments of the SurveyReport which would be the basis of the Cabin jt&apos;s discussions of publicexpenditure in the autumn.    He recommended that the Report shouldpresent costed options showing the implications of reductions of 3 and5 per cent in 1982-33 and of 5 and l\ per cent in 1983-84 and 1984-85,with the percentages applying to the cash figures for each programme;for social security the options should be for reductions of 5 and 7j percent in a full year.    Where a Department found it necessary to make abid for additional expenditure for whatever reason, including anyprovision required for cost increases over and above the standardfigure, it jhould also make proposals for offsetting reductions. TheCabinet had agreed on 24 February that the discussion of the plans for1982-83 should be in cash terms.    He now recommended that theprogrammes for ^982-83 should be put on a cash basis by using theprovisional working assumption that all costs would rise by 7 per centbetween 1981-82 and 1982-83.     This procedure would avoid making anyspecific assiimption at this stage about increases in pubxic sector pay;it took account of the Treasury s unpublished forecast that the averageincrease in the Retail Price Index from 1981-82 to 1982-83 would bearound l\ per cent.    The assumption of 7 per cent would beprovisional and open to revision in the autumn, when it would also benecessary, in preparation for determining the 1982-83 cash limits, tomake separate specific assumptions for pay and for other costs. Theassumption of 7 per cent should be given to lecal authority expendituregroups and should also be available for discussioxi with the nationalisedindustries of their expenditure plans.    The programmes for the lateryears should also be put on a cash basis, using provisional workingassumptions of inflation factors of 6 per cent for the change from1982-83 to 1983-84 and of 5 per cent from 1983-84 to 1984-85, broadlyreflecting the Government&apos;s strategy and objectives over the period.This procedure avoided the disadvantages of a hybrid set of figures,partly in cash and partly in constant prices, which would result if thealternative of using estimated 1982-83 prices were to be adopted for thetwo later years.    He would wish to avoid putting substantive proposals toCabinet too early, with the risk that they would have to be reopened later,and this might mean concentrating discussions of specific proposals forprogrammes in the autumn, but in time for the Rate Support Grant (RSG)negotiations.    The Cabinet would, however, probably wish to take stock4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin July, and to consider giving some preliminary advice to the localauthorities, beyond that already in the Public Expenditure White Paper,in order to influence their planning for 1982-83, on the understandingthat this advice would be subject to later reconsideration.In discussion the following were the main points made -a. Although it was right that the Cabinet should consideroptions for public expenditure cuts, there wei e considerabledisadvantages in calling for costed options for every programmeat the levels proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Forsome programmes, cuts of this order would be politicallyindefensible and impracticable.    The fact that the Cabinet hadasked for such cuts to be costed would, nevertheless, becomepublic knowledge (in some cases it would be necessary to discussthe options with outside bodies, such as the Manpower ServicesCommission), and this would create needless and damaginguncertainty and misunderstanding.    These difficulties might beless if the possibilities for cuts could be examined in bilateraldiscussions between each Department and the Treasury with aview to establishing what was feasible, rather th?.n calling onofficials to prepare a comprehensive report on the basis of thepercentage options proposed.b. On the other hand, there were advantages in calling for asystematic examination of the consequences of applying thepercentage cuts proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer toeach programme.     The Cabinet would then have a comprehensiveanalysis which would enable them to j idge what reductions inpublic expenditure were feasible wJien, later in the year, theyconsidered the balance to be struck between the Government&apos;sobjectives for public expenditure and for the burden of taxationand the balance between capital and current expenditure Whatwere prepared would be options amongst which choices could bemade;  they would not be proposals or decisions.    While eachDepartment should seek to find practicable and desirable savingsin their programmes, it was open to Departments to drawattention to the disadvantages of the possibilities which they hadidentified.c. In examining the options, Departments should take theopportunity to look again at the possibility for cutting out generalfunctions and for making radical changes.    It might tu^-n out thatsuch fundamental changes could not be made without newlegislation.    Such legislation would cause considerable problemsif it had to be accommodated within the 1981-82 legislativeprogramme which already excluded a number of Bills whichMinisters judged to be desirable.    The need to create moreflexibility in the programme could however be discussed in thefollowing week when Cabinet was due to consider the legislativeprogramme as a whole.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd.       If capital investment were to be stimulated, andunemployment reduced, it would be essential to avoid repeatingthe pattern of previous public expenditure exercises in which cutshad tended to fall on investment rather than on consumption andpublic sector pay.    These links between pay, unemployment andinvestment had been raised by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment in his letter of 6 May to the Chancellor of theExchequer, and there would be an opportunity to consider theseissues further when the Cabinet discussed economic policy inJune.    Any increased provision for capital investment withinexisting public expenditure programmes could, however, bejustified only if the offsetting savings on public sector payrepresented realistic assumptions rather than unattainableaspirations.    Further consideration should be given toencouraging private sector investment in areas, such as the roadprogramme, which had hitherto been a public sector preserve.e. If firm decisions on expenditure were not taken until thelate autumn, this would reduce the chances of influencing thelo-al authorities to make significant cuts in their programmes in198w-83.    Local authority treasurers were influenced not bygeneral statements of intent by the Government in July but by theactual RSG settlements;  and on the timetable now proposed thesecould not be made until January.    If the local authorities were tobe influenced to make significant cuts, the Government wouldneed to give very clear indications of its intentions in July, andto take firm decisions in September with a view to RSG settle-ments in November.f. It was argued that it would be better to use estimated1982-83 prices for 1983-84 and 1984-85 rather than to attempt toput the programmes for those years on a cash basis. Theproposed inflation factors of 6 and 5 per cent would be criticisedas misleading, and wouJd have to be revised at a later stage;volume changes in the programmes would be obscured and wouldnot be replaced by cash figures with any firm basis;  it was notclear that there was an operational need to make this change now.On the other hand, even though the cash figures would beincreasingly provisional in the later years, there were advantagesin considering programmes in cash terms throughout *he Surveyperiod, and in avoiding a &quot;broken-backed&quot; series between1982-83 and the later years.    Consideration could be given at alater stage to whether the figures for programmes in 1984-85should be published in the Public Expenditure White Paper,although the period covered by White Papers had already beenreduced by one year.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said tnat theCabinet agreed that the guidelines for the 1981 Public Expenditure Surveyshould be on the basis proposed by the Chancellor oi the Exchequer inC(81) 20.    Each Department should aim to identify realistic option^ forcuts, taking the opportunity to review the possibilities for radicalchanges and for the cutting out of main functions, and to bring out fullythe implications of making the cuts identified.    It should be clearlyunderstood that the ievel of the costed options which were to be identifieddid net in any way represent a view by the Cabinet of the reductions inpublic expenditure which it might wish to make.    The object of thepresent exercise was no more than to provide the Cabinet with acomprehensive analysis on which it could draw later in the year when itcame to its substantive discussions of the public expenditureprogrammes.    If the local authorities were to be influenced in good timein their decisions on their programmes, it would be desirable to announcethe RSG settlements in November;  this pointed to substantive decisionson local authority expenditure in September, v/hen three meetingi of theCabinet were provisionally planned.    It would be for later decisionwhether figures for 1984-85 should be published in the PublicExpenditure White Paper.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Approved the proposals in paragraph 19 ofC(81) 20.6. The Cabinet considered further a memorandum by the LordPresident of the Council and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General (C(81) 13) and also a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(81) 21) on the pay of Members of Parliament and Ministers.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.Cabinet Office7 May 19817CONFIDENTIAL

Minute 5) the Cabinet had approved the proposals which he and the Lordlusions, President of the Council had made in C(81) 13 for dealing with thete 5 remuneration of junior Ministers in the House of Lords and they hadnarrowed the choice for the pay of MPs and Ministers to Options B andD in that memorandum.    Option B was for the figure ci  13,150, fixedlast year to take effect on 13 June 1981, to stand unchanged;  Option Dwas for the  13,150 to be increased by 6 per cent to  13,950.    He andthe Lord President of the Council had recommended Option D;following further consultations, he strongly recommended that thisOption should now be approved.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, although Option Dincorpoiated an increase of only 6 per cent on top of the increase for1981 agreed last year, the total increase would be of 18. 7 per cent on thisyear&apos;s salary.    This would undoubtedly be misrepresented andcriticised;  he agreed, nevertheless, that in the light of the advice of theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Option D should now be approved.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the pay of MPs should be increased to  13,950 from13 June 1981 and corresponding changes made to the salaries ofMinisters and other office holders on the lines set out in Option D of theAnnex to C(81) 13.
