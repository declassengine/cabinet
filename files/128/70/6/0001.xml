CONFIDENTIALbMOMENTARYFFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of tho business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.and Pensionslembers ofrliamentfevious Terence:1(80) 44thfrclusions,tiute 1THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that the Government were committedto putting down further motions on the pay and pensions of Membersof Parliament in the light of the reaction to the factual memorandumcirculated to all Members by his predecessor.    He had completedconsultations, and now intended, in preparation for the debatearranged for the following week, to table motions on the rate of payfor pension        purposes, linkages between the pay of Members ofParliament and other groups, and the accrual rate for pensions.He had originally intended to table a single unamendable effectivemotion setting pensionable pay at the actual level of  13,150 ratherthan at the notional level of  13, 750 recommended by the TopSalaries Review Body and embodied in one of the motions passed bythe House of Commons on 21 July.    His consultations had shownthat this could lead to unnecessary difficulties in the course of thedebate, and he therefore intended to put down a further amendablemotion which would give the House an opportunity of expressing itscollective view on the level of pensionable pay without binding theGovernment.    He would make clear the importance the Governmentattached to basing pensionable pay on the lower figure, and theconsequences of a decision to base it on the higher figure. Onlinkage, he intended to move a resolution referring the matter to aSelect Committee for further consideration of the desirability andpossible metnod of conducting reviews of Members&apos; salaries by anindependent body during the first Session of each Parliament, andof adjusting salaries between reviews by reference to a so celledbasket of outside comparators.    The motion on accrual rates wouldretain the existing Government proposal of a one-sixtieth rateinstead of the one-fortieth rate recommended in earlier motionspassed by the House of Commons, but would alter the arrangementsfor the purchase of additional years.    The Chief Whip was makingarrangements for all Ministers and their Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries to vote in support of the Government motion and hethought that there was a reasonable chance of being able to carrythis package.The Cabinet -1.Took note.^ Security THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that hehad chaired a meeting of the Home and Social Affairs Committee theprevious day which had re-examined the Government&apos;s proposals forCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALan employers&apos; statutory sick pay (ESSP) scheme in the light of thestrong opposition to them which continued to be expressed by theemployers&apos; organisations and by many cf the Government&apos;s ownsupporters in the House of Commono.    The Committee had agreedthat there was a high risk that the proposals in the form in whichthey appeared in the draft Social Security Bill circulated toLegislation Committee would be defeated in one or both Houses.The Committee had concluded that the Bill would either have to beamended to take account of the latest compromise proposals putforward by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), or postponedto the next Session of Parliament.    The latter course might givethe impression that the Government were no longer committed tothe principles of the scheme, but might also give further time fordeveloping more fully worked out proposals which were likely tocommand wider Parliamentary support.    He had subsequentlyreported the outcome of the Committee&apos;s discussion to the PrimeMinister, who had decided that the Government should not proceedwith legislation on ESSP until they were sure that it embodied a fullyworked out and defensible scheme, and that the relevant legislationcould be carried in both Houses.    Because there had not beensufficient time to examine the implications of the latest CBI schemeand other alternatives in detail, she had decided that the ESSPprovisions should be deleted from the Social Security Bill.Arrangements were in hand to introduce a shorter Bill, dealingmainly with the November 1981 social security benefit uprati.ng, bythe 3nd of that week.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government&apos;s originalscheme, as amended in the light of reactions to the Green Paperpublished in April of 1980, would have brought manpower savingsof 5, 000 staff in 1982-8 3 and public expenditure savings of 400 million in the same period.    The latest CBI scheme wouldpermit a staff saving of oily 2, 500, while leaving the publicexpenditure benefits almost intact.    Equivalent staff savings wouldnow have to be found elsewhere.    The introduction of an ESSPscheme was a central part of the Government1 s overall strategy,and it should be made clear that there could be no question of itsbeing abandoned in principle.    It seemed essential that thelegislation eventually introduced should provide for specialtreatment for small businesses; this had been incorporated ir theGovcciment&apos;s revised scheme, but did not form a part of theCBI s proposals.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet remained firmly committed to the introduction of an ESSPscheme in principle.    It would, however, have been damagingpolitically to have proceeded on the basis of proposals which hadnot been properly thought out, and which could well have run intoserious practical difficulties at a later stage.    The Secretary of2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALState for Social Services should now proceed as a matter ot urgency withthe preparation of detailed proposals which would command widerParliamentary support while retaining the public expenditure and man-power advantages of the scheme.    The Cabinet noted that theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had agreed to the employment ofParliamentary Counsel on any legislative drafting which might benecessary for this purpose.    Draft legislation on a revised ESSP schemecould not now be ready for passage this Session, but should beavailable for introduction at the beginning of the 1981-82 Session. Theadditional legislative time which would thus become available in thepresent Session might be used to make progress with other Bills whichhad been introduced but held back because of pressures on theParliamentary timetable.     In the meantime, the Cabinet, noted that theshorter Social Security Bill dealing with the November 1981 upratingand miscellaneous provisions would be introduced by the end of thatweek.     The Lord President of the Council and the Chief Secretary,Treasury,  would wish to consult collea.gues on ether ways of achievingthe expected manpower and public expenditure savings in 1982-83. Shewould be ready to announce the decisions on the content of the SocialSecurity Bill in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet -2. Took note that the Social Security Bill to beintroduced that week would not now contain provisionson the introduction of an employers&apos; statutory sick payscheme.3. Invited the Secretary of State for SocialServices, in consultation with other Ministersconcerned, to prepare further proposals on anemployers&apos; statutory sick pay scheme in time forlegislation to be introduced at the beginning of the1981-82 Session of Parliament, as indicated in thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4. Invited the Lord President of the Council andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider furtherthe public expenditure and manpower implications ofthe decision to postpone the introduction of anemployers&apos; statutory sick pay scheme.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFIGN|IR5[da1ious ence:I) 45th usions,lute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Canadian Government&apos;s problems over their proposals for thepatriation of the Canadian Constitution had been complicated by theunauthorised disclosure of some of their High Commissioner&apos;sconfidential reports to Ottawa.    It was in the British Government&apos;sinterest to play the matter down as far as possible. Meanwhile,briefings on the subject given by the British High Commissioner,Sir John Ford (who was due to retire later in the year and whosesuccessor had now been publicly designated)   had led to accuoationsthat he was over-involving himself in Canada&apos;s internal affairs. Hewould shortly be visiting London for consultations and there was somedanger that he would be thought to be being reprimanded.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that the Governmentwould wish to do all they could to defend Sir John Ford againstunjustified criticism.     The wider problems connected with thepatriation proposals would require early discussion in the Defence andOversea Policy Committee.    For that purpose it would be helpful tohave an assessment of the legal position from the Attorney General;but it was clear that the issues involved were without exact precedent,and in any case more political and constitutional than legal incharacter.jab we|iousfence;I) 33rdlusions,bte 1THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that confidencein Zimbabwe was liable to be damaged by the factional fighting which hadbroken out inside three of the twelve integrated battalions of the newNational Army.    This was a more disturbing development than earlieroutbreaks between elements of the two former guerrilla armies whichhad not yet been integrated.

CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the fourBritish detainers in Iran seemed likely to be released in the near future,but the confused situation there made it impossible to be certain. Hewas in close contact with the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose specialemissary had been playing a helpful role in Tehran.    Meanwhile the warbetween Iran and Iraq continued at a low level of intensity, in conditionsdominated by rain and mud.    Between them, the two countries were nowexporting about one million barrels of oil a day.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODreported that the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) had ended alter threedays of discussion without agreement on major outstanding issues on theCommon Fisheries Policy.     Progress had been impeded by theinexperience of the new Commissioner responsible for fisheries,Mr Kontogeorgis, who was unfortunately supported by officials fvomcouncries not likely to be well disposed to the United Kingdom&apos;s point ofview.     The French Minister responsible for fisheries had assured hisindustry that the French Government would not agree to any restrictionson French vessels outside the 12-mile limit, and the weekly meeting ofthe French Council of Ministers had reaffirmed the French insistence onmaintaining historic rights within 12 miles.    In the absence of agreementon access, he had not been able to agree to German demands fox theconclusion of a fisheries agreement with Canada which would give theCanadians tariff concessions on 20, 000 tons of cod which would be sold onthe British market.    Given the difficulties the British fishing Industrywere currently facing fvom low-priced imports, United Kingdomacquiescence in such an agreement with Canada could not be justifiedexcept in the context of a satisfactory overall settlement.    This wasprivately recognised by the Germans, who had been annoyed with theimpression given by President Giscard at the Press conference followingthe recent Franco-German Summit, in which he had implied that theFederal E.epublic had agreed to join France in putting pressure on theUnited Kingdom.    Although a further meeting of the Fisheries Councilhad been fixed for 9-10 March, he did not see any prospect of a settle-ment before the French Presidential elections.     The French werebeing asked to accept restrictions in areas where they had traditionallyfished for many years.     Unless they could be offered something else inreturn - and no doubt the price would be a high one - there appeared tobe no advantage to them in an early settlement.     They well understoodthat  further delay brought us closer to 1 January 1983, when the presentderogation from the principle of equality of access came to an end.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said the leaders of thefishing industry fully supported the line which the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food had taken during the negotiations andwere hopeful that fishing activity would now be resumed.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, with theendorsement of the Cabinet, congratulated the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food on the successful way in which he had handled boththe domestic presentation and the fisheries negotiations themselves.On the previous day, trie Ambassador of the Federal Republic ofGermany had delivered a demarche urging the need for an early settle-ment of the Common Fisheries Policy.    A similar approach was beingmade in Paris, and the Ambassador had let it be understood that thedemarche was principally directed at the French.THE PRIME MINISTER reported that, during her visit to the DutchPrime Minister, Monsieur van Agt, on 6 February, she had urged theDutch Presidency to use its influence to bring about a speedy conclusionof the negotiations for a Common Fisheries Policy.    She had alsosought to stiffen the position of the Dutch Government over the stationingof United States nuclear weapons on Dutch soil.    All the religiousparties in the Netherlands were now campaigning for nucleardisarmament.     If the Dutch Government were unable to play their part inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;s programme for themodernisation of long-range theatre nuclear forces, the resolution ofother countries which had agreed to do so,  such as Italy and Germany,mignt be adversely affected.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office12 February 19816CONFIDENTIAL
