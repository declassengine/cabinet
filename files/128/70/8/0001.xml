CONFIDENTIALIGAGEMENT OF{  PRINCE OFALES1. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that theengagement of the Prince of Wales tc Lady Diana Spencer wasbeing announced in a statement issued on behalf of The Queen thatmorning.    The marriage was expected to take place in July, Shewould take the opportunity of an Audience arranged for that eveningto express to Her Majesty the Cabinet&apos;s great pleasure at theannouncement, and to offer their warmest congratulations.The Cabinet -Took note, with warm approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.ARLIAMENTARYFFAIRS2. The Cabinet were informed of the business likely to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.he Strategicuclear Deterrentreviouseference:C(80) 29thonclusions,inute 1THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that the Secretary of State for Deforce would makeboth the opening and the closing speeches for the Government in thedebate on nuclear defence policy arranged for Tuesday, 3 March.There would be considerable advantages if the Government Motionfor the debate were drafted in such a way that the differing factionswithin the Parliamentary Labour Party could not all vote against it.The Motion should therefore emphasise the need for the UnitedKingdom to continue to maintain an effective strategic nucleardeterrent, and should not refer to the deployment of Cruise missiles.A reference to the proposed purchase of Trident missiles wouldenable the Government to obtain the specific approval of *he Houseof Commons for the Trident programme, though the Cabinetrecognised that such a reference might be exploited to unite theParliamentary Labour Party in a vote against the Government.The Secretary of State for Defence should consider the precisewording of the Motion further in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General and the Chief Whip,The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and the Chief Whip, to consider furtherthe form of the Motion for the debate on Tuesday,3 March, as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoreionpaiareviousference:-C(81) 2ndonclusions,Aaute 23o THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the attempted coup d&apos; tat in Spain appeared to have failed.The Army in the Valencia military region had beei involved, aswell as the members of the paramilitary Civil Guard who had seizedthe Parliament building in Madrid.    But the King had stood firm andseemed to have the support of the rest of the Army,    The episodewas a major set-back for Spain, coming as it did at a time of seriousdifficulty on both economic and regional affairs.    The newGovernment under Senor Calvo Sotelo might not now take office.The effect on Spanish policy, eg towards the European Communityor the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or Gibraltar, remainedto be seen.amibiareviouseference:C(81) 4thonclusions,inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that inview of the deadlock in the Namibian negotiations the membergovernments of the Organisation for African Unity, who were atpresent meeting in Addis Ababa, might decide on precipitate actionat the United Nations.    A General Assembly debate on the subjectin early March might now be difficult to avoid, and there might wellbe pressure for an early Security Council vote on sanctions againstSouth Africa.    Some African Governments, including the Nigerians,privately recognised that it would be unwise to press forward beforethe new United States Administration had been able to consider theirpolicy.    But public African attitudes remained uncompromising.If a sanctions vote took place, it would almost certainly be vetoedby the United States, and Britain would be bound to support the veto.Even if France also vetoed, as was possible in the present climateof Franco-American relations,  serious damage would be done toBritish economic interests in Black Africa, notably in Nigeria whereBritish visible exports alone had been worth  l, 200 million in 1980and were still rising.    The Prime Minister and he would need todiscuss the problem urgently with the United States Governmentduring their forthcoming visit to Washington.    One possible devicefor heading off an early crisis might be if the new AmericanAdministration offered to send a high-level fact-finding mission tothe area, comparable to the Rhodesia-related mission whichLord Harlech had undertaken for the British Government soon afterthey took office in 1979.hadreviouseference:C(81) 3rd^elusions,frnute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that onhis recent visit to Nigeria he had found President S?.agari verypreoccupied over the situation in Chad.    The President of Chad,Mr Goukouni, had told President Shagari that when he visited Libyathere had been no discussion of a union with Libya;  then at theairport he had been presented with a communique in Arabic, whichhe could not read, and had not been made aware that an agreementon union with Libya was part of its contents.    It was a remarkableCONFIDENTIAL

It might now be possible to restart those negotiations,which had recently broken down when the Belize Government failedto respond adequately to an important modification in Guatemala&apos;sposition.    The Guatemalans were no longer demanding the c-essionof territory and wanted only to be allowed to lease a number ofuninhabited Belizean islands.    The Uniied States Government,whose support Britain needed if the negotiations were to be successfulhad shown sympathy with the current Guatemalan posivion andcorresponding impatience with Belize.    This was not necessarilyhelpful, since it remained desirable to keep up the pressure onGuatemala, and the United States Government could have a role inthis.ranre viouseference:C(81) 7thonclusions,inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thethree British detainees who had now been released from prison inIran were expected to be allowed to leave the country in the nearfuture.    The position of the fourth detainee, who was a businessman,remained uncertain.    It would be made clear to the Iranians asnecessary that British relations with Iran could not be improveduntil he too was freed.    A most helpful role continued to be playedby the Swedish Government, who were in charge of British interestsin Iran.    They would be publicly thanked at an appropriate moment.olandre viouseference:C(81) 7thonclusions,-inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Poland appeared to be improving.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) was currently consideringimports of New Zealand butter.    If no agreement or a long-termarrangement could be reached, it now seemed likely that the Frenchwould agree to a roll forward of the existing arrangements. TheAgriculture Ministers would meet again ir. the middle of March todiscuss agricultural prices for 1981-32, with the aim of reachingdecisions by the end of the month.    The position to be adopted on thelevel of prices, the grt an pound and other aspects of the Commission&apos;sproposals would need to be considered by Ministers collectively in duecourse.owmonisheriesolicyreviouseference: C(81) 7thonclusions,inute 3THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had recently had talks with thePresident ot the Commission, M Thorn, and with CommissionerTugendhat.    She had emphasised to the former the importance of aspeedy settlement of the Common Fisheries Policy.    The prospectswere not good, however,  since the French were showing no signs offlexibility.    She had urged on Mr Tugendhat the necessity of maintain-ing the present ceiling of 1 per cent on VAT contributions.uropeanonetaryfstemreviouseference:C(80) 12thonclusions,inute 5In a brief discussion, reference was made to a speech the previous dayby Mr Tugendhat advocating adherence by the United Kingdom to theexchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS).He had not referred to his intention to do so during his recent meetingswith the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Thespeech appeared to have had some effect in weakening the pound on theexchange markets.    While a number of Government supporters hadwritten to the Chancellor of the Exchequer advocating full Britishmembership of the EMS, there had been no recent discussion of thispossibility within the Community.    At least until very recently therehad been no change in the factors which had led the Government not tojoin the exchange rate mechanism, particularly the opposing effectsof oil price rises on sterling and the Deutschemark.    In thesecircumstances, the inclusion of sterling might add to the existingtensions within the EMS.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALATRIALI AIRSeviousference:.(81) 7thnelsons,ute 4ter5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat all the unions in the water industry had now rejected the iO per centoffer.    Discussions on the pay of manual water workers in England andWales were resuming on that and the following days.   The outcome wasuncertain, though it was possible that ths National Water Council (NWC)would make a new offer aimed at an immediate settlement. Mostregional Water Councils had now fixed the level of water rate they wouldcharge in 1981-82.    As a result of the activities of the accountants whomhe had introduced to examine the costs of the industry, the proposedwater rate increases over 1980-81 had been Drought down from anaverage of 19 per cent to an average of 13 per cent.In discussion it was suggested that the striking success in reducing costsachieved by outside accountants in the water industry suggested that thetechnique might profitably be used more widely, ior example in localauthorities and the National Health Service.    A pilot operation had infact already been launched in one local authority area in Greater Londonand would be seeking to extend the technique to other local authorities.He was also examining whether legal obstacles existed to the appoint-ment of private firms of accountants a* District Auditors.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion,  said that theCabinet was not disposed to take any step  to influence the outcome ofthe negotiations in the water industry at this stage;    the balance ofthe argument was against taking such a step.The Cabinet -1.Took note.pi Service THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had met theCivil Service unions on the previous day.    He had told them that the6 per cent pay factor in cash limits was firm, but that it should bepossible, within this limit, to squeeze out a 7 per cent settlement. Hehad also told them of the Government&apos;s willingness in principle to worktowards an ordered and, if possible, agreed scheme for settling CivilService pay in future years.    The unions had not accepted the 7 per centoffer but had been very keen to discuss possible longer term arrange-ments.    This latter proposal might well prove to be the rr.eanr by whichserious industrial disruption in the Civil Service could be avoided,though some difficulties were inevitable.    In particular, it seemedlikely that the one-day strike called for 9 March would take place.The Cabinet -2.Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALI PUBLICpENDlTUREVEY6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(81) 10) on the conduct of the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey (PES).    They also had before them a letter fromthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Prime Ministerdated 23 February 1981.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he proposed changesin the conduct of the 1981 Public Expenditure Survey (PES) designed inpart to strengthen control and pressure for economy and efficiency butmainly to enable the Cabinet to see more clearly throughout the processof planning and determining public expenditure programmes theprospective cash costs of expenditure.    The need for such changeswould be illustrated vividly by the figures about to be published in thePublic Expenditure White Paper, which would show total cash expendi-ture rising from  77 billion in 1979-80 to an estimated  104 bullionin 1981-82 - an increase greater than that in the rate of inflation overthe same period, and resulting in a sharp rise in the proportion ofGross Domestic Product taken for public expenditure.    This increasewas in part attributable to the economic recession, to inheritedcommitments on public sector pay, and to the problems of thenationalised industries and the local authorities;  but it was also inpart due to the present system of public expenditure planning and tothe continued dependence on volume planning at constant prices.Particularly in periods of high, and varying, inflation, it was difficultto know until very late in the process the implications for actual cashexpenditure of decisions taken earlier in the course of the Surveydiscussions.    He recommended that in the 1981 Survey all plans anddiscussions of the principal target year of 1982-83 should be conductedfrom the outset in terms of the estimated cash costs which would arisein that year.    The Cabinet would need to decide in March 1981 whatwere the provisional inflation assumptions to be used to arrive at1982-83 prices.    This would be on the under standing that theseassumptions would be open to revision in the light of developments untilthe autumn, when they would be finalised.    With greater weight givento the constraints on cash costs, mere would no longer be a presump-tion of entitlement to some particular volume or level of services;adjustments of cash provision would be made only if they could be shownto be justified, and not, as at present, largely automatically. Theform of revaluation proposed would have the effect that any squeeze orslack which might have emerged from operating within cash limits inone year would normally be carried forward into the next year, unlessand until a specific decision was taken to the contrary.    As a resultof these changes, some of the burien of uncertainty inherent inunpredictable price movements would be transferred to spendingDepartments.    These changes would focus attention on a number of veryreal and difficult problems, which the oresent system tended to mask,and would thus provide the opportunity for them to be collectivelydiscussed in good time.    He did not, at this stage, wish to proposecash planning for the years beyond the focal year of each Survey; thiswould raise problems whick would need further consideration. For1981-82 he recommended that, as part of the move towards a greaterCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALemphasis on cash control, any decision taken to increase a cash limitshould be a charge on the contingency reserve, regardless of whetherit was a volume or pay or price change.    If the Cabinet approved theseproposals, he would wish to announce   them in general terms in hisBudget Statement, though without any commitment to the details of thearrangements, and so to demonstrate that the Government were takingpositive steps to deal with the cash overruns, which the PublicExpenditure White Paper would reveal, and with the widespreadcriticism of the present dependence on planning in terms of constantprices.    After the Budget he would seek the approval of Cabinet tothe detailed guidelines for the 1981 PES, including the provisionalinflation assumptions to be used in constructing the 1982-83 figures.In discussion there was general support for a move to greateremphasis on planning public expenditure in the focal year of the PESin cash terms;  subject to the following main points which were madeon the system proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:-a. The choice in March 1981 of the general inflation factorsnecessary to arrive at estimated cash costs in 1982-83 wouldpose severe problems.    If the factors turned out to be too low,that would impose an unintended squeeze on volume plans.Either that squeeze would have to be accepted, possibly at theexpense of major policy objectives, or the inflation assumptionswould have to be changed with the risk of discrediting the newsystem.    The magnitude of the problem was illustrated by thefact that in recent years Treasury forecasts of the averagelevel of retail prices in any given year made four or fivequarters before that year began had been wrong by 4j - 6percentage points:  that was a measure of the possible effectson volume spending of excessive optimism in inflationassumptions.      If the system were to work, it was essentialthat the inflation assumptions used should be fully realistic.Unlike private sector firms the Government were bound topublish their inflation assumptions, and this could beembarrassing, particularly in any year when the forecastspointed to a rising rate of inflation.b. A particular problem would arise from the forecastsfor public sector pay.    Although these might not be separatelyidentified, they would be bound to become known, with theresult that the position of those negotiating public sector paysettlements would be made unnecessarily difficult.c. There would be a further squeeze on volume plans if allreductions resulting from the application of cash limits werecarried through into later years.    The system should notprovide for it to be axiomatic that cash squeezes were carriedthrough, but rather for the question of carrying through to beconsidered case by case.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd. Even with the emphasis switched to cash planning,volume planning would have to continue both for departmentalprogrammes and for local authority and National HealthService programmes.e. Several Ministers shared the view of the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Fcod that some of these difficultiescould be reduced if the conversion to cash were made earlierthan at present, but not so early as the start of a Surveyexercise.    The 1981 Survey, for example, might be carried outinitially on the basis of 1981 Survey prices (that is, actualprices in autumn 1980) and early in the autumn of 1981 theresulting volume programmes could be then revalued to1982-83 prices using inflation assumptions agreed at that timeby the Cabinet.   Alternatively the survey discussions could beopened on the basis of estimated 1981-82 prices with conversionto 1982-83 prices in the autumn.    Either way the problems offorecasting inflation for a long period ahead would be reduced,and the Cabinet would have a clearer and more reliable basisfor looking at programmes.f. More thought should also be given to the introduction offlexibility between years to ensure that long term equipmentand capital expenditure programmes were not unduly disruptedby sudden changes in expectations of inflation.    In additionfurther thought should be given to the problems of controllingthe expenditure of the nationalised industries which was amajor source of the current difficulties in controlling publicexpenditure.    The implications of the proposed system for theplanning of local government expenditure would also requirefurther consideration, and there was a possibility thatlegislation might be necessary to amend the statutory arrange-ments for determining the Rate Support Grant.g. Whatever the changes made, and particularly if thesystem proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer were to beintroduced, there would be a case for other changes at thesame time.    Given the crucial importance of the collectivedecision on the inflation factors to be used, and the greatergeneral emphasis on cash planning, it was a corollary of theChancellor&apos;s proposals that the Cabinet should have anopportunity to consider collectively the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s view of the prospects and possibilities for revenuealongside those for public expenditure.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that, in the 1981 Public Expenditure Surveythe discussion of the plans for 1982-83 should be in cash terms, on thebroad lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    They hadidentified a number of particular problems in discussion, and theChancellor of the Exchequer should take these into account in thefurther memorandum, which he would put to the Cabinet in Marchafter his Budget statement, making his recommendations on thedetailed guidelines for the 1981 Survey, including the inflation assump-tions to be used.    In the meantime, the Chancellor of the Exchequershould announce the proposed   change in general terms in his Budgetstatement, but he should avoid any commitment on the detailedarrangements which the Cabinet had yet to approve.The Cabinet -1. Agreed in principle to changes in the conduct of the1981 Public Expenditure Survey, broadly on the lines ofthe proposals set out in C(81) 10.2. Endorsed the proposed changes, in paragraphs 13 - 15of C(8l) 10, on the management of the contingency reservein 1981-82.3. Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldannounce in general terms, in his Budget statement on10 March, their decision to give greater weight to cashplanning in the focal year of the Survey period.4. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to takeaccount of the points made in their discussion in thememorandum which he wculd be putting to them in March,inviting approval of the detailed guidelines and inflationassumptions for the 1981 Public Expenditure Survey.Cabinet Office24 February 19819CONFIDENTIAL
