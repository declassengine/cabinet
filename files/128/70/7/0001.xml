CONFIDENTIAL= IAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be tcken in thejRS House of Commons during the following week.EIGNMRSv10us|ence:6thlusions,ite 22. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that hopes for the early release ofthe four British detainees in Iran had so far been disappointed.Comments by an Iranian Government delegation recently in Britain hadbeen discouraging.    But a more helpful stat merit had since been madeby the President of the Iranian Supreme Court, Ayatollah Beheshti.lousfence:I 6thfusions,|e 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the new Prime Minister of Poland,General Jaruzelski, appeared for the moment to have achieved thedouble feat of reassuring the Soviet Union and at the same time reducingthe pressure of strikes inside Poland.    A number of potentiallydangerous issues remained unsettled, eg in relation to censorship and totrades union legislation.    But for the moment the threat of S ~vietintervention seemed to have receded.pbwe|ousfence:6thlusions,|e 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the recent internal fighting inZimbabwe had been the worst since independence.    But it now seemedto have been brought to an end.    The political leader of the formerZimbabwe .People&apos;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) .guerrillas,Mr Nkomo, and senior ZIPRA officers in the national Joint Head-quarters had played a constructive role in pacifying the?r followers inthe troubled areas.The Cabinet1.Took note.CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that a group including one British subjectworking in Iraq had been kidnapped by Kurdish rebels.    It had beenmade clear to the Iraqi Government that they were responsible forensuring his safety.     Similar cases in the past had onded satisfactorily.
CONFIDENTIALIn the course of a brief discussion it was pointed out that e fierce debatewas expected in the Federal Parliament in Ottawa over the CanadianGovernment&apos;s proposals for the patriation of the Constitution. Theassociated proposal for a Bill of Rights already appeared to have beensignificantly modified.    A request for action by the WestminsterParliament was likely to be received in about a month&apos;s time. Mean-while the legal, constitutional and political issues involved would beconsidered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.     The Britishmedia were beginning to report more favourably on the CanadianGovernment&apos;s case and on the strength of their popular support.    But itwas not clear how far that support extended beyond patriation itself toinclude also the proposed amending formula and Bill of Rights.The Cabinet -?4.       Took note.3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported that at the16 February Council of Economics and Finance Ministers (Ecofin) we hadsucceeded, with German support, in securing agreement that thereshould be a full discussion of the Commission&apos;s 1981 agricultural priceproposals at the March Ecofin Council.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported that the Germans had taken anaggressive line on external fisheries questions at the 17 FebruaryCouncil of Foreign Ministers.    They had sought, with some success, toisolate the United Kingdom by arguing that the fisheries agreementbetween the Community and Canada should go ahead independently of asettlement on the Common Fisheries Policy as a whole.    The DutchPresidency had nevertheless been helpful and we had maintained ourreserves on the Canada and Faroes agreements.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the same Councilhad adopted a further declaration voicing the Community&apos;s concern atthe inadequate Japanese response to their last statement and agreeing onarrangements to introduce retrospective Community surveillance oiimports from Japan of cars and other sensitive products.    The Councilhad also received a report from the Commission on recent talks inWashington about trade relations with the United States, on whichdiscussion would be resumed at the March Council.In a brief discussion it was suggested that the only hope for worthwhileprogress in achieving a better trading balance with Japan lay inconcerting action with the United States.    It was noteworthy that in 1973the Americans had been able within 12 nonths to turn a deficit of$6 billion in their trade with Japan into a surplus of $1 billion.    They haddone this by threatening the Japanese that failure to respond to theirpressure would result in a worsening of their relations with the UnitedStates, in the defence field in particular.    While a united Communityapproach, to which the Germans held the key, was important, it wasunlikely ^o have a major impact on the Japanese unless we could secureAmerican support to convince them of the political risks they wererunning.The Cabinet -Took note.trials4. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached have beenrecorded separately.Cabinet Office19 February 19813CONFIDENTIAL
