CONFIDENTIALIjAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theFAIRS House of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that thedebate on the economic situation for which the Government had giventime on Thursday 5 February would take place on a Government motion.She would open the debate, and the Secretary of State for Trade wouldmake the winding up speech for the Government.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.igislativeogramme0-81fevious&apos;erence:(81) 3 rdInclusions,e 1THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER AND PA YMASTmGXNJ3RAL aaid thatthe Companies Bill had come before.LegialationCommittee at -thrsir meeting the previous day, wi th a proposal by theSecretary of State for Trade thatproTiaiong on two further subjects should beaddedat Committee Stage in the House of Lards- provisions dealing with thedi s closure ofinterest.cn shares and th a pure ha serby. companies of their o-wnshares.    The s e provisions-had not yet been drafted, andLcould not now beready until the end of February. The disclosure provisions, which had not yetrecived policy approval, woul-d.be highly controversial, while those on thepurchc.se of own shares, though likely to be generally welcomed by smallbusiness interests, would nevertheless occupy a good deal ofParliamentary time, particularly in the House of Lords.    The Secretaryof State for Trade had pointed out that, if these proposed provisionswere not included in the Bill by the Government, amendments on thesame subjects would probably be moved by backbenchers, and that it wasin the nature of a Companies Bill that there would be scope fordiscussion on a wide range of other issues.    The Companies Bill in theform now proposed was likely to be more controversial and to occupymere Parliamentary time than originally expected.    Beaming in mindthe severe strains on the legislative programme, the need to avoid alengthy spillover in the autumn and the increasing probability that timewould have to be found for legislation on the Canadian constitution in thepresent Session, the business managers thought that the Cabinet shouldbe given an opportunity to decide whether, despite the undoubted strengthof the arguments for enacting the Bill this year, it would be better topostpone its introduction until the beginning of the 1981-82 Session.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the provisions onthe abolition of the Register of Business Names were essential if theDepartment of Trade was to achieve its required manpower savings byApril 1982.     These provisions would certainly be controversial, buttheir passage through Parliament would be greatly eased if they werecombined with the other measures, including the implementation of theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEuropean Community Fourth Directive on Company Accounts, nowincluded in the draft Bill.    If they were left until next Session, theywould have to be considered at the same time as the proposed newmeasures on bankruptcy and insolvency, which held out the prospect ofmuch larger staff savings.    This would pose very severe problems ofParliamentary management, both for bis own Department, and for thebusiness managers.     It had not been possible to include the twoprovisions mentioned by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andPaymaster General in the draft Bill circulated to Legislation Committeebecause of the need to consider the response to consultative documents.The provisions on the purchase of own shares were highly attractive inpolitical terms, and he considered that it would be a mistake not toproceed, with them.     The provisions on disclosure could if necessary beomitted, but it had to be recognised that the Opposition would certainlyraise the subject during the debates on the present Bill, and new clausesmight well be proposed in the Committee Stage.     He accepted that thepassage of the Bill through the House of Lords would occupy a good dealof time on the Floor of that House, but by far the greater part of the timerequired for discussion in the House of Commons would be in StandingCommittee.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Companies Bill should be kept in the legislativeprogramme for the current Session, although there would then be verylittle room for manoeuvre to meet unforeseen demands on Parliamentarytime, especially in the House of Lords.     They agreed on balance thatthe Bill as circulated to Legislation Committee should be introduced inthe House of Lords as soon as possible.     The proposed provisions onthe purchase by a company of its own shares were an attractive part ofthe Government&apos;s programme of help for small businesses, and theCabinet agreed that appropriate provisions should be added tc the Bill atCommittee Stage in the House of Lords.    The enforcement of thedisclosure proposals appeared, however, to raise difficult and contro-versial policy issues, and the Cabinet agreed that the Government shouldnot s ek to add them to the Bill during its passage through Parliament.The Cabinet -2. Agreed that the Companies Bill should beretained in the legislative programme for the 1980-81Session on the basis indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.3.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that anumber of satisfactory appointments to senior posts in the StateDepartment were being made by the new United States Secretary ofState, Mr Haig.     His Deputy, Judge Clark from California, was (unlikeMr Haig himself) a close personal friend of President Reagan;  and thenew Under Secretaries were mostly experienced professionals. HerMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, who had recently spent two hourswith Mi Haig, had been imprersed by his attitude to the main problemsof the day and by his favourable disposition towards Britain.tiousrence;l)2ndJsions,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the newUnited States Administration were now working actively with the otherWestern countries involved, including Britain, to mitigate the currentcrisis over Namibia, which was causing serious concern. Westernpolicy was under attack, most recently from the Liberation Committeeof the Organisation of African Unity;   and it would be important to doeverything possible to avert a debate in the United Nations SecurityCouncil and a potentially damaging call for the extension of economicsanctions against South Africa.     Black African leaders were oftenmoderate as individuals, as the Foreign Minister of Mozambique,Mr Chissano, had proved during his recent visit to London; butcollectively they remained extremist.     The general election now calledin South Africa might help to secure a breathing space but was not likelyto produce changes in South African policy.s tee*|2ndUsions,Pe 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Poland appeared increasingly serious. Conf-ontationcontinued over the five-day week issue, on which it would be verydifficult for the Polish Government to give way.     The workers&apos;Solidarity movement was split between those who wished to press forfurther gains, those who advocated caution and an intermediate groupunder the movement&apos;s principal leader, Mr Walesa.    The militaryCONFIDENTIAL

They might well conclude that the dangers of doingso would be less than the dangers of allowing the present situation tocontinue.stanusnee:33rdsions,1THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatPresident Giscard of France&apos;s public proposals for an internationalconference on Afghanistan had to be seen in the context of his campaignfor re-election.    Advance notice of several days had been given to theSoviet Union, and of a few hours to Britain and France&apos;s other principalpartners.    The proposal would not please the main Moslem powers, whohad shown at their recent summit meeting in Saudi Arabia that theypreferred the more robust line hitherto taken by the United NationsGeneral Assembly.     But the Un;ted States Secretary of State, Mr Haig,had felt able to welcome the French proposal;  and it should be possiblefor Britain and others to accept it, with friendly dismissiveness, as aprocedural device which might help carry forward the policies longadvocated by all members of the European Community.usnee;2ndsions,2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Westerneconomic measures remained in force against the Soviet Union becauseof the Afghanistan crisis.    These included restrictions on sales of ^,-ainand of certain categories of high technology products.     But Britishexports to the Soviet Union were still worth nearly  500 million a yearand could not be neglected at a time when other Western countries wereactively developing their economic opportunities there.     It was againstthis background that British and Soviet officials had recently held talksin Moscow on the co-operation programmes conducted under the aegisof the Anglo-Soviet Joint Economic Commission,snee;32ndsions,2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theleader of the Israeli Labour Party, Mr Peres, had called on the PrimeMinister and himself during a recent visit to Britain.     He seemedlikely to win the general election which had been called by the presentPrime Minister of Israel, Mr Begin.     Mr Peres was both more open-minded and more subtle than Mr Begin.     He seemed aware of the needfor Israel to make concessions in the search for a settlement with theArabs and to have far-reaching ideas on how this might be done. Buthe perhaps exaggerated the chances of reaching an early understandingwith King Hussein of Jordan.4CONFIDENTIAL

For the time being it would be best rot to make too muchof a public issue of this, in order not to encourage the Iranians to thiakof the detainees as a potential lever on British policy.     But if noprogress were achieved within a month or so, the pressure of Britishpublic opinion might require stronger measures to be taken.The Cabinet -Took note.[IMMUNITYlAIRSnouslerences:JO) 45thelusions,^lute 3, andjl) 2nd:lusions,nute 33. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid there was now a distinct possibility that negotiations on theCommon Fisheries Policy would break down, with serious consequenceswithin the Community and for our fishing industry.    At the recentmeeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries), the Federal GermanMinister for Agriculture and Fisheries had adopted a threateningattitude over the continued restrictions on the right of the Germanfishing industry to fish off Canadian waters.     The French Minister hadexpr jssed his political will to settle and had proposed a bilateral meeting,which would take place early next week, but he had told the Germans thatthere could be no compromise on access.     The Irish Minister hadgiven unexpected support to the Germans, explaining privately that thiswas the result of an understanding between them over agricultural prices.The Fisheries Council would resume on 9 February but, whereas tneterms which had been proposed in December would have been acceptableto the British Government, it was not possible to settle on the basis ofwhat the French were now proposing on access.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food further reported thatthe Commission rmght propose increases in agriculture prices rangingfrom 6-11 per cent, including large increases for cereals and greaterco-responsibility levies of the kind which were objectionable to theUnited Kingdom.     They might also propose the abolition of subsidiesfrom which the United Kingdom benefited in order to have some leveragewith which to secure British support for price increases.     The FederalGerman Minister of Agriculture had also recently shifted his position andspoken of the need for substantial price increases.In a brief discussion, it was noted that French Ministers had stressed toBritish Ministers and officials the necesfity for agricultural priceincreases to be decided upon before the forthcoming FrenchPresidential elections.     It was likely that President Giscard could counton continuing support from Chancellor Schmidt;   and, so far asCONFIDENTIAL
agricultural prices were concerned, the Benelux countries wouldsupport the French position.    The French Finance Minister hadsuggested recently to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that agriculturalprices might be raised in two stages this year, the first before theFrench elections and the second after a review in the autumn.     Even inthe fisheries negotiations, where the French had put themselves- in aminority position in December, the interests of Belgium and theNetherlands lay in supporting the French position on access. Therewas therefore the prospect of considerable difficulties during thecoming weeks on both these fronts.     On the other hand it was arguedthat the United Kingdom was not without negotiating cards, given theFrench need for higher agricultural prices.     The aggressive positionwhich they were taking up might prove to be a miscalculation on theirpart.     It was important to continue to maintain the support of othermember states and to keep the French in the minority.The Cabinet -Took note.1nnualerutinyEPART MENTAL[inning|0STSbviousperence;JC(79) 16thInclusions,pnute 54. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(81) 5) on the 1980 Annual Scrutiny of DepartmentalRunning Costs.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that this was the firsttime that Departmental running costs had been identified and s-immarisedjin this way.     This first exercise was a pilot run;  the figures were raw,and he accepted that there were mistakes in them - as, for example, theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland had pointed out to him in hisletter of 20 January.     The fact that a Department ranked high in ananalysis of particular costs did not necessarily call for criticism: thetravel costs of some Departments were inevitably higher than those ofother&quot;:   and some Departments had a higher proportion of senior staff.The exercise was, nevertheless, useful in helping to alert DepartmentalMinisters to areas which they should probe.    There was no doubt thatsuch action was necessary.     The total cost of Government Departments,excluding the Northern Ireland Civil Service, had risen from 6, 680 million in 1979-80 to the provision in the 1980-81 Estimates of 8, 340 million.     The largest single element in Departmental costs waswages and salaries, where the increases had been influenced by stagingover this period, but there had also been large increases in the non-payareas of expenditure.     He proposed that Departments should nowinvestigate their figures critically, looking particularly at areas wherethey were high and, where appropriate, ensure that action was taken tobring costs under greater control.    Departments should consult theCivil Service Department and the Treasury where necessary, and theyCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALshould report to the Civil Service Department, using a standardquestionnaire which he would now arrange to be circulated, by 13 March.He would then report on the outcome of this further work to the Cabinetafter Easter.     In the meantime he would arrange for a working group ofofficials to look into outstanding technical questions in consultation withSir Derek Rayner and in time for the results to be taken into account inthe next annual scrutiny.     He recommended that a decision on whetherthe detailed figures in the 1980 review should be published should bedeferred until Cabinet discussed his further report after Easter.In discussion the following points were made -a. It was generally agreed tnat, while the details were open toquestion, the exercise was valuable in providing Ministers witha further basis for scrutinising their Department&apos;s running costs.It was essential that the substantial increases in these costs,which had partly offset other public expenditure savings, shouldbe brought under control.    Where the constraint of cash limitsled to savings in one year, these savings should be carriedthrough into later years and not, as often happened, offset bysubsequent increases.b. While Ministers collectively were responsible for wagesand salaries, Departmental Ministers had insufficientresponsibility for the costs of their own Departments. Furtherconsideration should be given to allowing each Minister morelatitude tc offset necessary increases under one sub-head of hisvotes - for example, travel expenses - by savings elsewhere.The present review of the arrangements for payments forservices provided by the Property Services Agency would becompleted shortly.c. The timetable of the 1981 annual scrutiny should beexamined so as to ensure that returns were not required while thefigures were still only provisional, and so as to fit in with thetimetable for the public expenditure and other annual exercises.While the system should be improved, in the light of experienceof the 1980 exercise, it should be kept as simple as possible sothat it did not itself take up too much staff time and money.d. The increasing amount of correspondence with Members ofParliament (MPs) and the public, and the care which necessarilyhad to be taken in drafting these letters, was a major impedimentto reducing Departmental costs.     Last year Home OfficeMinisters had signed 22, 000 letters-   and other Ministers hadsimilar, or even greater, burdens of correspondence. Privatesector firms were not faced with this &quot;cost of democracy&quot;.Details of the numbers of letters to the public, and the cost of7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpreparing them, should be assembled and made known toParliament and the public as a basis for seeing whether therecould be some acceptable reduction in this burden. Alreadysome progress had been made in reducing the burden on Ministersthough not officials, by encouraging MPs to write in the firstinstance to, for example, local tax and social security offices.Although a number of MPs had complained of this, it hadgenerally worked well and some Members had warmly welcomedthe closer relationship which they had formed as a result withlocal offices.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, while theCabinet recognised that there were flaws in the 1980 pilot exercise, theygenerally welcomed the introduction of annual scrutinies as a basis forthe crucial task of bringing Departmental running costs under control.Each Minister should now arrange for his Department to examine the1980 returns and to reply by 13 March to the questionnaire which theLord President of the Council would now circulate.     The Lord Presidentof the Council should report on the outcome of this further work to theCabinet after Easter.     The Cabinet were concerned that the mountingburden cf correspondence, both with MPs and with the general public,was adding to Departmental costs.     These costs were insufficientlyrecognised by Parliament and, as a basis for discussion cf whether theycould be reduced, they shot-.ld be made known to Parliament and thepublic.     To this end, each Minister should new send to the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General an estimate of thenumbers of letters in 1980 sent by Ministers to MPs and by Departmentsto the public, together with a broad estimate of the costs of thiscorrespondence.The Cabinet -1.        Agreed that each Minister should:i. Arrange for his Department to seed to theCivil Service Department by 13 March answersto the questionnaire, which the Lord Presidentof the Council would now circulate, on the 1980annual scrutiny of Departmental running costs.ii. Send the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and Paymaster General an estimateof the numbers of letters sent in 198 0 a. byDepartmental Ministers to Members of Parliamentand b. by Departments to members of the public,with an estimate of the approximate cost of preparingthose letters.8CONFIDENTIAL
