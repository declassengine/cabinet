CONFIDENTIALrliamentaryfairs1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.y of MembersL EuropeanrliamentTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the European Assembly (Payand Pensions) Act 1979 fixed the salaries of Members of theEuropean Parliament (MEPs) at the same level as that ofMembers of Parliament (MPs) at Westminster.    The pay of MEPscould legally be increased only by means of an effectiveresolution of the House of Commons bearing The Quean&apos;srecommendation.    The Queen&apos;s recommendation was notrequired for increases in the pay of Westminster MPs as such, butwas needed for the consequential increases in their pensionablepay.     Pay increases for both MPs and MEPs would thereforenormally be dealt with in the same effective resolution. When,however, the pay of MPs was increased in June 1980 from  10, 72 5to  11, 7 50, the House of Commons had rejected the Government&apos;sproposals on the rate of pensionable pay, and the pay increase forMPs had been effected from 13 June 1980 on the basis of aresolution framed as an expression of opinion on pay alone withoutThe Queen&apos;s recommendation being signified.    It had beenwrongly assumed that this resolution applied also to MEPs whohad been paid at the higher figure.    First Parliamentary Counselhad now pointed out that the absence of an effective resolutionmeant that there was no legal authority for paying the increase toMEPs, and the Comptroller and Auditor General (C and AG) hadsaid that he could not authorise further payments at the higher ratefrom the Consolidated Fund unless he were given an undertaking bythe Government that the position would be regularised at the earliestopportunity.    There was a statutory obligation to keep the pay ofMEPs in step with that of MPs, and he considered that there was norealistic alternative to giving the C and AG the required undertaking,and to moving an appropriate effective resolution as soon aspossible, probably in the week beginning 6 April.The Cabinet1. Invited the Home Secretary:i. in consultation with the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster and Paymaster General, toarrange for the moving of an effective resolutionin the House of Commons at an early date to increasethe salaries of Members of the European Parliamentto  11, 750 per year, with effect from 13 June 1980;ii. to notify the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral of the action proposed.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnadian THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDnstitution: PAYMASTER GENERAL said that an agreed draft of thesponse to the Government&apos;s reply to the report by the Select Committee onport by the Foreign Affairs about the expected request from the Parliament|eCt of Canada for the amendment e.nd patriation cf the Canadianmmittee on constitution was now ready.    The Government had undertaken thatreign Affairs they would normally reply within two months to reports fromDepartmental Select Committees, but he considered that it wouldeVioas be tactically unwise in the present case to publish the Government&apos;seference: response before the current debates in the Canadian ParliamentC(8l) 7th had been concluded.    The response would not only be the firstnclusions, public indication of the Government&apos;s attitude towards the substancenute 2 of the Canadian proposals but would commit the Government toattempting to secure the passage of the necessary United Kingdomlegislation.    Its timing, which was one of the few factors in thisarea wholly within the Government&apos;s control, should be determinedprimarily by the need to facilitate the difficult Parliamentaryhandling of the request.    Although the Lord Privy Seal, wiJi whomhe had discussed the matter, was inclined     favour rather earlierpublication, he was prepared to accept his judgment of theParliamentary situation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brxef discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that the legal and constitutional argumentsadvanced by the Select Committee and by these in Canada opposedto the Federal Government&apos;s proposals had so far remainedlargely unchallenged in this country.    It was desirable that theGovernment&apos;s reply, which set out clearly the arguments foracceding   to the Canadian request, should be available tw membersof both Houses of Parliament in time for it to have the maximuminfluence on their consideration of the request.    The Cabinetagreed, however, that for the tactical reasons outlined by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster publication should be deferrecuntil after the current debates in the Federal Parliament had beencompleted.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should brinjproposals on the Parliamentary handling of the expected Canadianrequest before the Cabinet in the near future.The Cabinet -2, Agreed that the Government&apos;s response tothe report by the Select Committee on ForeignAffairs on the expected Canadian constitutionalproposals should be published after the completionof the current debates on the subject in the CanadianParliament.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3  Invited the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary to agree the date of publication of theresponse with the Chancellor of the Duchy cf Lancasterand report this to the Cabinet.4. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council,to bring eaily proposals on the Parliamentary handlingof the expected Canadian request before the Cabinetfor consideration.IcurityrvicesTHE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet of the lines of thestatement which she intended to make in the House of Commonsthat afternoon about the serious allegations made against formermembers of the Security Services and others in Mr ChaomanPincher&apos;s book &quot;Their Trade is Treachery&quot;.The Cabinet5.Took note. sit of the PopeTHE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been suggested that aninvitation should be extended to the Pope to address both Housescf Parliament during his pastoral visit to the United Kingdom in1982.    Such addresses had in the past been given only by a fewof those who were on official visits to this country as Heads ofState or Government or of international organisations.    For thePope to address both Houses would be wholly inappropriate to thenature of his visit and would add to the already formidable securityproblems surrounding it.    Subject to the views of colleagues, sheproposed that the Government should not respond to this suggestion.The Cabinet -6. Agreed that no invitaticn should be extendedto the Pope to address both Houses of Parliament.CONFIDENTIAL

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe political situation in Poland was once again causing seriousconcern.    The Solidarity union were threatening national strike actionfrom 31 March, with preliminary action on 27 March, unless there wasa successful outcome to their latest negotiations with the Government,which were still proceeding.    The future course of events wasunpredictable.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE PRIME MINISTER reported on the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil in Maastricht on 23-24 March.    On fish, it had emerged thatFederal Chancellor Schmidt had not fully appreciated the degree towhich the French were responsible for the breakdown of negotiations ona revised Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in December, nor that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s insistence on settling the internal and external aspectsof the CFP in a single package was in line with the relevant provisionsof the 30 May 1980 budget agreement, to which all member States hadsubscribed.    Once these points had been explained, it had seemed thatthe formal discussions on fish might take place in a less acrimoniousatmosphere than had earlier been expected.    In the event, htwever,President Giscard had raised the temperature by criticising the refusalof the United Kingdom to lift its reserve on the Canadian fisheriesagreement and had been followed in like vein by Chancellor Schmidt.Attempts in the margins of the Council to reach agreement on marketingarrangements designed to safeguard our industry against additional lowpriced imports made insufficient progress to justify the lifting of theUnited Kingdom reserve.    In these circumstances, as agreed in lastweek&apos;s Cabinet (CC(81) 12th Conclusions, Minute 3), she had probedPresident Giscard&apos;s intentions with him privately.    He had denied thatFrance wanted to put off further CFP negotiations until after the FrenchPresidential elections.    She had therefore suggested, and PresidentGiscard and the Council had agreed, that the date of the next FisheriesCouncil should be advanced to 27 March with the aim of resolving theproblem then.    All Heads of Government had professed to be anxiousto reach agreement at this Council.    A confidential bilateral meetingbetween the Minister of Agriculture and his French counterpart, wh-.chwas taking place while the Cabinet were in session, had also beenarranged in an attempt to reach agreement on the main outstandingissue of access on lines acceptable to the United Kingdom industry.Fisheries apart, the European Council had discussed unemploymentat some length, and had confirmed that a joint Council of Ministers ofEconomic Affairs, Finance, Social Affairs and Employment shouldconsider the problem further.    It was to be hoped that this combinedCouncil, which was unlikely to resolve the problem, would take placeCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALunder the Dutch rather than the United Kingdom Presidency. Inagreeing that the Agriculture Council should be requested to continueits discussions on prices with the will to reach agreement by 1 April,the United Kingdom had insisted that equal stress should be placed onthe need for agricultural economy measures.    The European Councilhad also reaffirmed the need for the Commission&apos;s proposals on budgetrestructuring to be presented by the end of June, and had issued auseful communique on Poland.In discussion, it was noted that if the 27 March Fisheries Council wasunable to reach agreement, it would be necessary for the Ministersconcerned to decide urgently whether the potential linkage with theagricultural price fixing negotiations that would be resumed on30 March should be exploited by the United Kingdom.    The attitudedisplayed by the French in that day&apos;s bilateral talks would give someindication of the likely outcome of the Fisheries Council.    It wassuggested that the Government should in any event not allow the UnitedKingdom fishing industry to dictate the terms of a final CFP settlement.They should be pressed to accept whatever could be negotiated in theCommunity;  any further subsidies agreed by the Government shouldhelp to make an agreement acceptable to them.    It was further nwtedthat the recent devaluation of the Italian lira should make it easierto settle on the Commission&apos;s agricultural price proposals, since Italy,France, Denmark, Ireland and Greece would be able to increase theirproducer prices by devaluing their green currencies.    The UnitedKingdom and Geimany would on the ether hand gain no improvement intheir support price levels.    This would make a revalaation of the greenpound still more difficult for the United Kingdom industry to accept.The Cabinet -Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIL SERVICEPUTEe viousereace:31) 12thnclusions,ute 44. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, althoughthe delays to revenue receipts, as a result of industrial action,would lead to some short-term increases in the monetary aggregates,they should not present any longer-term threat to economicmanagement.    Some staff in the Customs and Excise were refusingto carry out their normal duties and, under the standard procedures,they had been issued with oral warnings that they should resumework.    He recommended that where necessary these oral warningsshould now be followed by written instructions and, if those wereignored, by suspension from duty.    In the Inland Revenue thenumbers of staff refusing to carry out normal duties were increasingand he recommended that the staff concerned should be given oralwarnings followed, if necessary, by written instructions andsuspension.    Contrary to the instructions of their own unions,some staff were picketing at Inland Revenue offices other than, theirown place of work.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should takeaction forthwith to deal, on the lines he had prcposed, with thosestaff in the Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue who wererefusing to carry out their normal duties.    He should arrange forthe attention of the union leaders to be drawn to the fact that at someoffices picketing was being carried out by staff from elsewhere.The Cabinet took note that if strike action affecting Sheriffs&apos; Courtsin Scotland were to continue, emergency legislation might benecessary.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer -to take action forthwith, under the standardprocedures, to deal with those staff in Customsand Excise and the Inland Revenue who wererefusing to carry out their normal duties;to arrange for the attention of the union leadersto be drawn to any picketing which was contrary tothe unions&apos;  wn instructions and to the requirementsof the Employment Act, 1980.Cabinet Office26 March 1981CONFIDENTIAL
