CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House cf Commons during the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that, in spite of dropping threeprogramme Bills from the current Session and reducing the lengthof one other, the 1 gislative programme was under continuingpressure, and it might be necessary to consider at a later stagewhether it would still be possible for both Houses of Parliamentto rise for the Summer Recess on 28 July as originally intended.Two days had had to be set aside before the Whitsun Recess forthe annual debate on the defence estimates, which would in any casebe later than in previous years;  the Opposition had not been willingto agree to the debate being confined to a single day.    It would notnow be possible for the Commons stages of the Education (Scotland)and the Employment and Training Bills to be completed in time forthem to be sent to the House of Lords before the Whitsun Recess.Th;&lt;t in turn made it unlikely that the original timetable of achievingRoyal Assent, for both Bills by the Summer Recess could bemaintained.    He recognised the political difficulties which wouldarise from postponing Royal Assent on the two Bills in question,but there appeared to be no practicable alternative.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he hadagreed earlier in the year to two Scottish programme Bills beingpostponed to the next Session.    He had now taken powers by Orderunder existing legislation to introduce the assisted places schemein Scotland in advance of the passing of the Education (Scotland)Bill in time for the next school year.    Postponement of RoyalAssent to the Bill would, however, mean that it would be impossibleto introduce the new arrangements on parental choice in time for thenext school year,    This also was a Manifesto commitment, and thedelay would expose the Government to a good deal of adverse publicand political criticism.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the House ofLords would be heavily committed in the period up to the SummerRecess, in particular to the consideration of the British NationalityBill.    He could not promise to secure the passage of the Education(Scotland) Bill by the House of Lords before the Summer Recess, ifit were not received from the Commons until the end of the secondweek after the Whitsun Recess.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that considerable political and administrativedifficulties would be caused by the postponement of Royal Assentto the Education (Scotland) and Employment and Training Bills, butrecognised that this was likely to be inevitable in view of the needto find time for an early defence debate in the House of Commonsand of the general congestion of the legislative timetable.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1.       Took note.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that it was possible that a backbenchMember of Parliament would move for the issue of a writ for aby-election in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency in thenear future.    It was clearly preferable that the issue of a writshould be deferred until the Government were ready to bring forwardlegislative proposals on the candidature or the election of convictedprisoners.    If a motion were moved, it would in his view bepreferable, having regard to the present situation in NorthernIreland and the likely reaction in the House of Commons, to seekto postpone the discussion of the motion rather than to try to defeatit.    If a writ had not been issued by the beginning of the SummerRecess, the Speaker would be obliged to sign a warrant for a writif during the Recess any two members presented him with acertificate of Mr Sands&apos; death.THE HOME SECRETARY said that work was proceeding on thepreparation of a draft of a Bill to prevent persons serving prisonsentences from becoming Members of Parliament.    There wereconsiderable complications in framing a Bill which would disqualifyprisoners from nomination, and if a Bill was to be introduced andbecome law quickly it might have to be confined to restoring the lawas nearly as possible to the situation that had existed before thepassing of the Criminal Law Act 1967.    Even this would becontroversial.    It would mean that convicted prisoners would beallowed to stand for election, but not to take their seats if elected.He would bring proposals to the Cabinet as soon as he could.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the immediate issue of a writ   for theFermanagh and South Tyrone by-election should be prevented, andthat it would be preferable for the debate on any motion to beadjourned rather than for the Government to be seen to use theirmajority to defeat it.    They noted that the Home Secretary wouldbring proposals before them for early amendment of the law.The Cabinet -2.       Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, in consultation with the f ecretary of Statefor Northern Ireland and the Chief Whip, to take anynecessary steps to ensure that the debate on anymotion for the issue of a writ for a by-election inFermanagh and South Tyrone was adjourned.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALParliamentaryHowance sPreviousHeference:C(81) 18thonclusions,linute 6The Cabinet had, before them a letter from the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster to the prime Minister dated 12 May 1981about the 17th Report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB 17)dealing with the   salaries of Members of Parliament and Ministers,and allowances for Members and Feers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENFRAL said that the Cabinet had already decidedon the handling of the salary recommendations contained in TSRB 17.They now had to agree on the handling of the remaining recommenda-tions on allowances.    The TSRB had recommended that theSecretarial and research allowance for Members should beincreased by 7. 5 per cent from  8, 000 a year to  8, 600. Althoughthe TSRB had made no specific recommendation, it would also beappropriate to increase the supplement of  800 for pension purposesby the same percentage, to  860.    He proposed that thisrecommendation should be accepted, together with the TSRB&apos;sfurther proposal that there should be a supplementary provision forMembers who needed to secure temporary secretarial help duringthe paid absence of their normal Secretary lasting more than 4 weeks,and that Members should be allowed to claim for payments made totheir Secretaries during the dissolution of Parliament. TheReview Body had recommended an increase of 8. 5 per cent from 1, 175 to  1, 275 a year in the secretarial allowance for LordsMinisters, and had recommended that the maximum total expenseallowances payable to all Peers attending the House of Lordr! shouldbe increased by 11.4 per cent from  44 a day to  49 a day. Heproposed that the Government should accept all the TSRB 17 proposalson Parliamentary Allowances, and that the Prime Minister shouldinclude a reference to this decision in the Written Answer on theReview Body&apos;s Reports the following day.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Government had specificallyasked for the TSRB&apos;s advice on Parliamentary Allowances, and thatit would be presentationally difficult to appear to have rejected it outof hand.    It would, however, be difficult to justify increases ofbetween 7. 5 and 13. 6 per cent in Parliamentary Allowances at atime when the Civil Service pay offer was being held at 7 per centwithin a 6 per cent cash limit, and doctors, dentists and nurseswere to be offered only 6 per cent.    Although 6 or 7 per cent shouldnot be regarded as a pay norm, the absence of any cash limit onParliamentary votes did not justify increases in allowances whichwent beyond the going rate for public sector pay generally. Therewould be some opposition to any proposal to reduce the recommendedincrease in secretarial allowances, but this could be partly offset ifthe recommendations on substitution during sick leave and paymentsduring dissolutions of Parliament were implemented.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that on balance it would be preferable to limit theincrease in all the Parliamentary Allowances dealt with in TSRB 1to 6 per cent, subject to any necessary rounding.    The Cabinetagreed that the supplementary recommendations on the payment o:Members&apos; Secretaries should be accepted.    She would announcethe Government&apos;s decisions on TSRB 17 in a Written Answer thefollowing day.The Cabinet -3, Agreed that increases in ParliamentaryAllowances should be limited to 6 per cent, subjectto any rounding, and that the additional recommendationsof the Top Salaries Review Body on the pay of Members&apos;Secretaries should be accepted.4. Took note that the Prime Minister would announcethe Government&apos;s decisions on Parliamentary pay andallowances in her Written Answer on the Review Body&apos;sReports the following day.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALORTHERNELANDFFAIRSreviouseference:C(81) 18thonclusions,inute 42. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that, following the funeral of Robert Sands, nightly rioting hadcontinued in Northern Ireland.    The Security Forces had had tosustain not only attacks by rioters throwing petrol bombs and othermissiles but also casualties from increasing sniper fire byterrorists taking advantage of the riots;  but they were managing tokeep the situation under control.    By local standards the level ofviolence was not high, and no attempts had been made by eithercommunity to carry rioting into the other&apos;s areas.    A second hungerstriker, Francis Hughes, had died on 12 May.    His funeral on15 May, in the country near Londonderry, would be celebrated likethat of Robert Sands, but serious trouble was not anticipated. Thetwo other hunger strikers were likely, unless they desisted, to die inabout a week;  and they had now been joined by a fifth. TheProvisional Irish Republican Army (PLRA) clearly thought they hadfound a winning streak, and were exploiting the propagandapossibilities for all they were worth.    International media coverageremained intense.    Television reporters were more interested insens?tional news than good.    Although nothing could be proved,foreign television teams were undoubtedly paying children and othersto build barricades and start fires which could then be photographed;and it was regrettable that no British television channel had shownthe successful and peaceful procession on the occasion of the recentLord Mayor&apos;s Show in Belfast, which had been attended by theLord Mayor of Dublin among others.    Oa ths other liand Presscomment, in the United States as well as elsewhere had been morefairly balanced.    The Government were making every effort, bothdomestically and abroad, to explain their stance on the hungerstrikers&apos; demands;  and above all to make clear that these demands,which had been confirmed by Mr Sands just before his death and byMr Hughes&apos; brother recently on television, amounted to a demand forpolitical status and could not be met by minor gestures related eg toclothing.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that the IrishAmbassador and Mr John Hume MEP had separately called on thePrime Minister the previous evening.    Both urged concessionsmade on the prison rules about clothing and about association.There was no reason to suppose, however, that such concessions,even if they could be contemplated, would end the hunger strike;if they were granted, others would be sought.    The clothing rules inNorthern Irish prisons were already liberal by internationalstandards and very similar to those in force in Federal prisons inthe United States.    In Great Britain the rules were stricter and thePrison Officers&apos; Association would strongly oppose any relaxation.The circumstances of women prisoners, who wore their own clothingat all times, were manifestly different.    The attitude of the IrishCatholic Primate, Cardinal O&apos;Fiaich, had not been helpful, but hisfollowers&apos; attitude to terrorism might now be influenced by the recentattempt to assassinate the Pope.    Many Northern Irish Catholics hadin any case little sympathy for the hunger strikers.    From theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALProtestant Community Mr James Molyneaux MP would be calling onthe Prime Minister that evening, and Mr Paisley had also sought ameeting.    As regards international opinion, there had been noapproaches from foreign Governments, other than the Republic ofIreland;  foreign Press attitudes had in many cases been reasonableand moderate;  and an effective reply had just been sent by the PrimeMinister to a message from Senator Kennedy and his three fellowspokesmen for the Irish Catholic community in the United States.In terms of the propaganda battle, every emphasis should be placedon the crimes for which the hunger strikers were in prison, andperhaps also on the sufferings and anxieties of the families ofmembers of the Security Forces.The Cabinet -Took note.FOREIGN ANDCOMMUNITY1FFAIRSLebanonpreviousReference::C(81) 18thConclusions,Minute 23. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the situation in the Lebanon was potentially dangerous. Theprotagonists were not the Lebanese themselves but the Syrians andIsraelis.    The Israeli Prime Minister, ,Mr Begin, engaged in hiselection campaign, was seeking to divert public attention from a verydifficult economic situation by adopting a tough stance internationally.The Syrians were well placed to humiliate Israel by refusingto remove the SAM 6 missiles they had introduced into the Lebanon:if these were then destroyed by the Israelis, that action would rallysupport for Syria from the rest of the Arab world.    Even Egyptwould then have to take the Syrian side;  and there would be a realrisk of a new Arab-Israel confrontation, with the Soviet Unionstanding behind the Arabs and the United States behind the Israelis.Hence the importance of the mediation between Tel Aviv andDamascus currently being undertaken by Mr Philip Habib on behalfof the United States Government.franc*THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMonsieur Giscard d&apos;Estaing was likely to leave office on 27 Mayfollowing his defeat by Monsieur Francois Mitterrand in the FrenchPresidential Election.    The implications for French policy wereunlikely to become clear until after the Parliamentary Electionswhich would now take place.    Monsieur Mitterrand was almostcertain to need suppart outside his own Socialist Party. France&apos;spolicy on East-West relations was not expected to weaken and mighteven become more robust.    She would not abandon the NorthAtlantic Alliance, nor give up her own nuclear weapons.    She waslikely to adopt a more sympathetic stance towards the developingworld, particularly if Monsieur Claude Cheysson became ForeignCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMinister;  under Monsieur Mitterrand&apos;s Presidency she caiglU, lorinstance, not be prepared, as Monsieur Giscard&apos;s Administrationhad Deen, to join with the United States and Britain to veto a UnitedNations resolution on sanctions against South Africa.    In theMiddle East, Monsieur Mitterrand was likely to abandon th^ extremepro-Arab position of Monsieur Giscard;  but though sympathetic toIsrael he could hardly afford to alienate the Arabs too far, not leastbecause his reservations about nuclear energy would underlineFrench dependence on Middle East oil.    His less forward attitudeon arms sales in the Middle East might enhance British commercialprospects in that area.    In Europe Monsieur Giscard&apos;s defeat wasa serious blow for the Chancellor of the Federal Republic ofGermany, where the leftward drift of the Social democratic Partymight now increase and with it the shakiness of the governingcoalition,,    With French policy bo uncertain there would be littlehope of any early settlement of major outstanding issues in theEuropean Community, such as the Common Fisheries Policy andbudget restructuring.    This would increase the problems to befac^d during Britain&apos;s tenure of the Presidency of the Communityin the second half of 1981.    But France&apos;s position in the Communitymight prove less strong under Monsieur Mitterrand than underMonsieur Giscard and his Fifth Republic predecessors, by whomFrance&apos;s continental partners had tended to be somewhat overawed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the discussions with the FederalChancellor and his colleagues at Chequers on 11-12 May had beenaffected by events in France as well as by the outcome of theelections in Berlin and by the brutal murder of a senior member ofthe Free Democratic Party in Hesse.      The Chancellor had beensensitive to criticisms about the level of defence spending in theFederal Republic, which in his view  compared favourably with thatof most of the other allies, gloomy about the prospects of recoveryin the world economy, and disturbed about the continuing high levelcf interest rates in the United States.     On Community matters, theEuropean Council was due to meet immediately after the FrenchParliamentary elections.    Both she and the Federal Chancellorconcluded   that it might be better if the Commission&apos;s Report onbudget restructuring and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)did not come forward during that election campaign, since it wou&apos;dinevitably be attacked by Monsieur Chirac and options for the newFrench Government thus   closed off.    Some delay in thediscussions of budget restructuring was inevitable.    She and theFederal Chancellor had agreed on the need firmly to maintain the1 per cent Value Added Tax ceiling as the only way to force changesin the CAP, although this might not be the position of the new FrenchGovernment.7CONFIDENTIALAnglo-GermanConsultations; 11-12 May
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discus rion it was argued that the Federal Chancellor&apos;sclaims about the past level of the Germans&apos; defence effort werenot convincing.    Their defence bduget was now to be increased,but by less than their Defence Minister, Herr Apel, had wanted.The lack of robustness shown by Germany and other Europeancountries during recent discussions in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation was disturbing, as was the deterioration in UnitedStates/German relations on defence matters following an unsatis-factory meeting between the Federal Chancellor and the UnitedStates Secretary of Defense.    The current German attitudetowards the United States was ambivalent in a number of fields;eg the Middle East, where the hesitancy of German policy and theGermans&apos; sense of guilt vis-a-vis the Israelis had been accentuatedby the sharp public criticism to which Mr Begin had recentlysubjected them.THE MINISTER P&gt;F AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND F&lt;*OD,reporting on his talks with the Federal Minister of Agriculture,Herr Ertl, said that both Governments remained anxious for anearly settlement of the remaining issues on the Common FisheriesPolicy (CFP);  but in the French election campaign MonsieurMitterrand had criticised President Giscard for failing to defendFrench fishing interests, and he was bound to commit himself to ahard line in the forthcoming Parliamentary elections. Theresumption of negotiations would inevitably be delayed, and thedanger that the French Government might simply hold out until theend of the present access arrangements on 1 January 1983 wasincreased.    It also seemed likely that Monsieur Mitterrand wouldtake a strong line ir&gt; defence of the CAP, since a majority of Frenchfarmers appeared to have voted for him in the Presidentialelections.    During a recent meeting of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture), the French representative had taken a notablyintransigent line, denying commitments which had been enteredinto during the recent agricultural price settlement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the FederalMinister for Economics, Count Lambsdorff, regretted the Americanaction in agreeing restrictions on Japanese exports to the UnitedStates market but recognised the need for a Community response.At the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) on 18-19 May, the Commission would suggest that theCommunity should urge the Japanese Government to avoid thediversion of Japanese cars destined for the United States market toEurope and to limit supplies to the Community to no more than theprevious year.    It would not be possible for the Community to bemore precise in view of the different arrangements for controllingimports of Japanese cars in each member state.    The FederalChancellor also wished to urge the Japanese to open up their marketto imports of European manufacturers.8CONFIDENTIAL
In a brief discussion, it was noted that there were growingproblems 10** United Kingdom manufacturers of car components.The car manufacturing companies including British Leyland wereincreasingly turning to Japan for components in order to be ableto compete successfully.    This issue would arise in connectionwith the establishment of car production by Nissan in this country.They were seeking sufficient space to be able to manufacture theirown components, ard to carry out research, as well as tomanufacture cars.    The conditions for the Nissan deal were stillunder consideration, but in view of the contribution such foreigninvestment made to employment the Government could not take anegative attitude towards it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that, unless thenew French Administration made difficulties, it was likely thatthere would be voluntary agreement among steel producers to limitproduction which would cover some 9 5 per cent of the industry.Such an arrangement should help to stop the further slide in prices.The German Government now accepted that statutory quotas couldbe used in order to discipline the German company whichaccounted for the remaining 5 per cent and which was not willingto accept a voluntary arrangement.The Cabinet -Took note.CIVIL SERVICE       4. The Cabinet heard an oral report from the Lord PresidentPAY of the Council on the current situation in the Civil Service dispute.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and conclusions are recorded separately.PreviousReference:CC(81) 17thConclusions,^nute 49CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said thatdecisions trken at a meeting of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy the previous day (E(81) 16th Meeting, Minute 1)could give rise to problems in the coal industry which he mightwish to bring back to his colleagues for further consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, recalledthat the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy hadinvited the Secretary of State for Energy to bring the issues backto the Committee, if when he discussed the Committee&apos;s decisionswith the Chairman of the Board he encountered difficulties whichin his judgment made it advisable for him to do so.The Cabinet -Took note.10SECRETCOALINDUSTRY
CONFIDENTIALEGISLATP7E 6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the H^me SecretaryROGRAMME (C(&lt;31) 22 and 23) setting out the recommendations of The Queen&apos;sJ81-82 Speeches and Future Legislation Committee on the legislativeprogramme for 1981-82.THE HOME SECRETARY said that The Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL) had carefully considered all the 70 bidsput forward by Depattments for Bills in the legislative programmefor 1981-82.    Their recommendations, set out in the Annexes toC(81) 22, were for a main programme of 22 Bills, together with5 contingent Bills and 8 Bills suitable for the Second ReadingCommittee procedure in the House of Commons.    Four ScottishBills were firmly recommended for inclusion in the programme,with a fifth being held in reserve for introduction later in the Sessionif the Lord President could find time in the House of Lords.    QL hadstarted their discussion from the recognition that there had been atendency to overload the legislative timetable in both Houses ofParliament during the Government&apos;s first two Sessions. Thisplaced almost intolerable demands on backbenchers, including theGovernment&apos;s own supporters, and the resultant alterations in theprogramme did not redound to the Government&apos;s credit.     There hadbeen considerable difficulty in carrying the Government&apos;s programmein the 1979-80 Session in spite of a long spillover in the autumn of1980, and it was evident that there would have to be a further spill-over in the present Session, even though 4 Bills had been droppedfrom the programme originally agreed by the Cabinet.    Some of theBills listed in the Annexes to C(81) 22 were essential for financialor other reasons, while others had been the subject of earlier firmcommitments to legislation next Session.    QL had given some priorityto Bills whose preparation was already well advanced, on the basisthat it was highly unlikely that any major Bill which had not yetreceived policy clearance could be ready for introduction by thebeginning of the Session.    A particular problem in this respect wasthe generally over-optimistic assessments made by Departments ofthe time required in converting broad policy agreement into instruc-tions to Parliamentary Counsel and for the subsequent drafting oflegislation.    QL had sought to select a reasonable number of Billswhich were suitable for early introduction in the House of Lords.Subject to these constraints, the Committee&apos;s recommendations soughtto carry forward the Government&apos;s wider economic policies whilegiving some social policy content to the programme.    In addition tothose Bills which had been the subject of formal bids by Departments,some Ministers had indicated that they might be asking for time forother major Bills on competition policy, local government financeand trade union law on which policy was far from settled; andprevious experience suggested that other new unexpected Bills wouldhave to be added later in the Session.    The overall weight of theprogramme recommended by QL was about the maximum that could beaccommodated in a Session of normal length, and any substantialadditions would have to be at the expense of one or more of the main11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprogramme Bills already recommended.    It was essential for theproper management of the programme that Departments having Billsin the programme should adhere to the timings given in C(81) 23,and that the Chancellor ox the Duchy of Lancaster should be toldimmediately of any significant slippage, so that LegislationCommittee could, if necessary, consider whether the Bill concernedshould remain in the programme.    He invited the Cabinet to approvethe recommendations set out in C(81) 22, and to confirm the need forall Departments to observe their stated timetables for the preparation,drafting and introduction of Bills for which they were responsible.In discussion it was argued that the proposed programme should berevised in order more fully to serve the Government&apos;s mainstrategic objectives.    The Petroleum and Continental Shelf, Housing,Social Security and Shipbuilding Industry (Disposals) 3ills furtheredthese objectives, but more Bills for this purpose should be added tothe programme, including in particular measures to break upmonopoly powers and increase competition.    There -was a strongcase for including the Bills relating to the gas and electricityindustries listed in Annex E, and the proposals for the privatisationof Government functions contained in the Public Bodies (Management)Bill would also be in line with the main objectives of the Government,even if this meant dropping some of the more technical and lesscontroversial Bills which might more appropriately find a place inthe last full Session of the Parliament.    On the other hand, it wasargued that policy approval had yet to be obtained for many of theBills listed in Annex E and it was doubtful if they or other meaaureson which policy decisions had not yet been taken could be preparedin time for passage next Session, even if other proposed Bills weredropped from the programme.    It was essential to the orderlymanagement of the programme that major Bills were fully thoughtthrough and brought forward in time.In further discussion the following points were made:-a. The Department of Energy had three Bills in theproposed programme, two of which could be controversial.There was nevertheless a strong case for adding the Gas(Industrial and Commercial Supplies) Bill if the necessarypolicy clearances were obtained quickly.    The Bill wouldremove the statutory privileges at present enjoyed by theBritish Gas Corporation on gas purchase and supply andmake private sector participation a practical possibility.b. The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Billwas needed so that measures now included in local Actscould be replaced by a single public Bill rather than by aseries of private Bills.    It might be possible to add to theseprovisions measures on local government finance: forinstance, interim changes in the rating system.    Certain of12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe provisions alreadv suggested for a Public Bodies(Management) Bill could also be included in such a Bill.It was strongly argued on the other hand that a Bill of suchmagnitude could net in practice be got ready in time or besatisfactorily handled in Parliament.    The balance ofadvantage lay in keeping the Local Government (MiscellaneousProvisions) Bill as a separate measure.    If that were done,it might nevertheless be necessary to add to the programmea Bill concerned solely or primarily with rating.c. Most of the essential Bills raising borrowing limitswere short.    Experience suggested that attempts to combinethem would make their Parliamentary handling more difficult.d. It might be possible to omit the Co-operativeDevelopment Agency (Amendment) Bill from the list ofessential Bills.    The Secretary of State for Industry wouldshortly be making proposals about the future of the Agency.e. The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill would give adesirable social element to the programme and there wouldbe criticism if such legislation were further delayed.Nevertheless, the Bill might have to be deferred to makeroom for other measures more central to Governmentstrategy.f. The Duchy of Cornwall Bill, which would modernisethe arrangements fox the management of the Duchy estate,might be substituted for the Currency and Banking Bill,but did not appear to justify a high priority.g. Unless the Insolvency Bill were enacted the Departmentof Trade could not save 570 staff.h. The Equal Pay (Amendment) Bill could be omittedfrom the list of contingent Bills in Annex B.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet thought that the programme recommended by QL failed togive adequate expression to the Government&apos;s priorities.    Some of theBills proposed for the programme in Annex A to C(81) 22 should ifnecessary be deferred to make room for more important measures,provided that these could be got ready in time.    The Currency andBanking Bill could be deferred;  and the Ministers concerned hadagreed to look urgently at the possibility of deferring also theInternational Military Services, Teachers&apos; Remuneration and OtherConditions of Service, Territorial Sea and Wireless Telegraphy(Amendment) Bills.    Their conclusions should be reported to QL.The Cabinet supported the inclusion in the programme of the Gas(Industry and Commercial Supplies) Bill.    There was likely to be a13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALneed for some legislation next Session on rating, and QL shouldconsider whelher any odier provisions affecting local governmentcould be added to such a Bill.    The Cabinet were not ir. favour ofcombining it with the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill.    The Cabinet endorsed the proposals in Annexes C and D ofC(81) 22 for Bills suitable for Second Reading Committee and forScottish Bills, but QL should reconsider the proposals in that paperfor the main programme Bills for the 1981-82 Session in thelight ofthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion.The Cabinet -Invited The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future LegislationCommittee to re-examine their proposals for thelegislative programme for 1981-82 on the lines indicatedin the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office14 May 198114CONFIDENTIAL

The CCSU would consider on 26 May, in thelight of the resolutions passed at the conferences of the Civil Serviceunions, whether to call for an all-out strike for one week.    They wouldbe dubious about the extent of the response to such a call, and concernedover the effect of a large strike both on their own funds and also onpublic opinion;   but by then inaustrial action would have lasted for thi eemonths and it would be difficult for them to settle on the terms proposedby the Government.    In his judgment, some escalation of industrialaction was likely.    Contingency plans had been prepared for eachDepartment and he would circulate a memorandum, for discussion bythe Cabinet on 21 May, of the options for responding to any escalationand for bringing the dispute to an end.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that over 75 per cent oftax revenue was still being collected, but there was growing concernover the number of businesses affected by delays in the repayment ofValue Added Tax. The increase in the Central Government BorrowingRequirement resulting from the industrial action remained in the orderof  2-2^ billion and this would continue to distort the monthly monetaryfigures until the dispute was settled.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that industrialaction by 12 engineers had brought to a halt tne work of 4, 000 staff at theDriver and Vehicle Licensing Centre in Swansea.    Under present law andterms of service, the 4, 000 could be sent home but they could not besuspended without pay even though they might well be offering tacitsupport to the industrial action.    Senior management at the Centre had1SECRET
SECRETbeen vigorous and effective ii dealing with the action and as aresult, following consultations between the management and thelocal Chief Constable, the flow of mail was about to be resumedand supplies of nitrogen, which were necessary for the operationof the computers, were likely to be resumed shortly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that industrialaction by some air traffic controllero was continuing;   the travellingpublic were suffering some inconvenience, and the action wascausing significant financial loss to British Airways and BritishCaledonian Airwayw.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the dit,cussi-&gt;n, said that theCabinet would discuss, at their meeting on 21 May, on the basis of amemorandum by the Lord President of the Council, the options lorbringing industrial action to an end and discouraging any furtherescalation;  in the meantime a group of the Ministers most closelyconcerned would discuss the issues further.    There appeared stillto be some dispute about the validity of the fact sheet on the dispute,intended as a brief for Ministers, which had been circulated undercover of a letter of 8 May from the Private Secretary to the LordPresident of the Council to the Private Secretary to the HomeSecretary.    Until the difficulties which had arisen on this docun.enthad been satisfactorily resolved, it should not be used as a basisfor public statements.The Cabinet -1.
