THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHOFFICE (Mr. Hurd) said that the internal situation in Poland wasonce again very tense.    The current subject of strenuous argumentbetween the Government and the Solidarity movement was thedemand for a five-day week, which Solidarity had now reinforced byinstructing its members not to work on Saturdays.    Other difficultissues were likely to be raised and, if the Government continuedto give way on each issue which arose, its position would growprogressively weaker.    For the moment, however, there were nosigns of intensification of Soviet military preparations. Withinthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation there was now agreement ona list of possible counter-measures if the Soviet Union movedagainst Poland, althougl no decisions had been taken on which ofthese measures would in practice be adopted.jtiddle EastJreviousJLeference:}C(80) 44thJonclusions,iflinute 2THE MINISTER. OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHOFFICE said that the visit to Algiers by the United States Secretaryof State&apos;s deputy, Mr Christopher, resulted from new signs that theIranian authorities might now be willing to conclude a realistic dealover the American hostages.    It remained, in his view, unlikelythat such a deal could in fact be reached before the outgoing UnitedStates Administration left office on 20 January, and it was not clearwhat the incoming Administration&apos;s attitude would be.    The earlyrelease of three of the four British subjects imprisoned in Irancontinued to be forecast by the main Iranian contact of theArchbishop of Canterbury&apos;s recent emissary.    Meanwhile the warbetween Iran and Iraq was continuing, although at reduced level.Despite the Iranians&apos; claims, which were designed to strengthenthe position of President Bani-Sadr, their current counter-offensiveseemed unlikely to produce dramatic results.    The number ofserviceable Iranian aircraft was now lower than ever.    As a resulteither of air action or of sabotage, the Iraqis had now again had tostop exporting oil via their pipeline through Turkey.    This wouldparticularly exacerbate Turkey&apos;s existing difficulties over oil supply.,No other Iraqi oil was being exported and very little Iranian. Theattitude of the Rulers of the lesser Gulf States was therefore ofspecial importance.    He himself had just returned from a visit tothat area undertaken at the Prime Minister&apos;s request.    His mainpurpose had been to reinforce British Aerospace&apos;s efforts to securean order for Hawk aircraft from the United Arab Emirates;  he hadCONFIDENTIAL

Visits by other British Ministers wouldhave an important part to play in meeting that need.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatmembers of the Government would wish to bear in mind theimportance of Ministerial visits to the Gulf in present circumstancesif British interests were not to suffer;  to consider whether othertravel plans could be adapted to include such visits;   and to beready to respond sympathetically to suggestions which Foreign andCommonwealth Office Ministers might make in this context.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
COMMUNITYAFFAIRSommissionerportfoliosPreviousReference:|C(80) 37thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL3. THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COM?lONWE ALTHOFFICE (Mr. Hurd) said that after a long meeting on 7 January the newCommission had settled the distribution of Commissioner portfolios ina way that was reasonably satisfactory to the United Kingdom. Theneed to create a portfolio for the new Greek Commissioner, combinedwith the pressure from several existing Commissioners to retain orenlarge their present portfolios, had led tc an attempt to depriveM:  Tup,eudhat of the restructuring aspects of the Budget portfolio infavour ef Mr O&apos;Kennedy, the Irish Commissioner, who was to havebeen given special responsibility for the Budget restructuring mandateunder the general oversight of the Prepident of the Commission. Afterthe Prime Minister had intervened with Mr Thorn on Mr Tugendhat&apos;sbehalf, a new formula had been agreed which left Mr Tugendhat&apos;3responsibilities intact and gave an indeterminate co-ordinating role toMr O&apos;Kennedy under the President.    Mr Richard, the second BritishCommissioner, had been successful in gaining the Social Affairsportfolio, less vocational training.    Mr Kontogeorgis, the GreekCommissioner, appeared to have done better than expected in gettingboth Transport and Fisheries.In a brief discussion it was observed that, had the move to take awaya critically important aspect of Mr Tugendhat&apos;s Budget responsibilitiessucceeded, it could only have been regarded as a calculated insult bothto him as our senior Commissioner and to the United Kingdom as amember state with a major interest in the restructuring negotiations.At the same time there was some evidence that the negotiations had notbeen well handled in their early stages by Mr Tugendhat himself. Itwould be necessary to see the small print of the final agreement, whenavailable, to establish the precise balance of portfolios within the newCommission.980lupplementaryiudget and981 BudgetPreviousRefer .ace:bc(80) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the current disputeover the legality of the Community Budget arose from the failure of theDecember Budget Council to agree on the European Parliament&apos;samendments to the 1980 Supplementary Budget and the 1981 Budget.The United Kingdom, Italy and Ireland had been willing to accept theproposed increases, but Belgium, Denmark, Germany and France haddescribed them as illegal.    In the event the Council did not vote on theParliament&apos;s amendments, so that no qualified majority emerged tomodify them, and the amended Budget was subsequently adopted byMadame Veil on behalf of the Parliament.    Although France, Germanyand Belgium had limited their January contributions in respect of theSupplementary 1980 Budget to the amount originally accepted by theCouncil, the Commission were treating the adoption of both Budgets aslawful and were intending to implement them on this basis.    The UnitedKingdom had already received  97. 6 million on 31 December asadvances from the 1980 Budget under the supplementary measuresarrangements, and the Commission&apos;s stance should ensure that wewould receive the amount due to us under the Financial Mechanism inthe next few weeks.    There was thus no cause for action by the UnitedKingdom at this stage.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, it was noted that the line taken by the French on theBudget dispute formed one of a series of recent moves thatsuggested a general hardening of their attitude towards currentCommunity issues.    Apart from the Budget question, they hadblocked agreement on a revised Common Fisheries Policy at theDecember Fisheries Council, despite encouraging bilateral exchangesbeforehand, and the Foreign Ministei had shewn no sign of greaterflexibility in his subsequent talks with the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary;  they had announced massive and arguably illegal new aidsto French farmers, which could only add to the milk surplus and thusincrease the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy;  and they hadmade clear that they would press for substantial increases in commoiisupport prices in the 1981 price fixing negotiations.    Although theFrench were at one with the British Government in standing firm onthe maintenance of the 1 per cent VAT ceiling, there was a risk that,given the domestic requirements of President Giscard&apos;s electoralcampaign, their position on other issues would lead to a growingdivergence of views between the United Kingdom and France in themonths ahead.    It might be necessary to consider the implicationsof any emerging confrontation in more detail in the appropriateCabinet Committee.The Cabinet -Took note.FUTURE OF THEINNER LONDONEDUCATIONAUTHORITY4. Tie Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(81) 1), to which were attached minutes of 21 November 1980 and18 December 1980 from the Home Secretary to the Prime Ministerand a minute of 31 December 1980 from the Minister of State,Department of Education and Science, to the Frime Minister en thefuture of the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENTsaid that the prasent local government arrangements for educationin Inner London were less than satisfactory.    ILEA was constitutedby a complex and little-understood mixture of election and nomination.It spent and precepted without regard to the claims of other serviceson the available resources.     Its performance was patchy and by nomeans commensurate with its expenditure..  But there were strongarguments against breaking it up.    A single authority was neededfor higher, further and special education and the careers service.Some of the individual boroughs would be too small, especially at atime of falling school rolls, to provide adequate schooling. Therewould be difficult problems of financing a service provided by theboroughs.    Home and Social Affairs Committee (H) had thereforeconcluded, by a majority, that it would be necessary to retain asingle education authority.    The Leader of the Greater LondonCouncil (GLC) was also of this view.    H Committee had seenCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALconsiderable objection to the suggestions, including differentialprecepting, that had been made with the aim of improving financialcontrol.    They were also dubious about the balance of advantage ofthe changes they had considered in the way in which ILEA wasconstituted.    A majority of the Committee had therefore consideredit preferable t-  maintain the existing arrangements deopite theiradmitted shortcomings.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that on any comparison ILEA was very expensive.    It wassubject to little democratic or financial control.    He agreed,h wever, that it should not be broken up.    Since 1870 education inInner London had never been a borough responsibility and schoolcatchment areas did not coincide with borough boundaries. Nearlyhalf the cost of ILEA fell on the Cities of London and Westminster,though their areas accounted for less than one-tenth of ILEAexpenditure, and if their contribution did not continue the additionalburden would fall on other ratepayers or on the taxpayer. Thevariant of the proposal originally put forward by Lord Marshall formembers of ILEA to be nominated by the boroughs might offer someimprovement in financial and democratic accountability but would belikely to worsen the position of the minority party and was unlikelyto be welcomed by Government supporters.    Direct elections wouldimprove democratic accountability but would be likely to lead toeven greater financial irresponsibility by the authority.H Committee and the Ministerial Committee on the Future of theInner London Education Authority (IL) had resisted this proposal,the political consequences of which were unpredictable.    There mightbe a proliferation of candidates representing particular educationallobbies and pressure groups.    If ILEA were funded directly bycentral government, educational performance might well improve,but the Secretary of State of the day would be placed in a very difficultposition.    Since H Committee had considered the matter the Labourmajority group on ILEA had made proposals for further increases inexpenditure in 1981-82.    Expenditure might be some  100 millionabove the grant-related expenditure assumed for block grantpurposes, involving an increase of almost 50 per cent in the relevantprecept;  if so, the authority would receive little &amp;r no governmentgrant and the threat of loss of grant would not be available as adeterrent to even higher expenditure.    The Government needed tomake its position known well in advance of the GLC elections. Ifthe Cabinet decided that a single authority should be retained, itwould be possible to issue a Green Paper canvassing a number ofoptions for change in the constitution of that authority.    The alterna-tive would be a White Paper setting out firm conclusions on the issuesconsidered by H Committee and summarised in the note by theSecretary of the Cabinet.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion there was general agreement  *n the need forimprovement in the standard and quality of education in Inner London.The wish of the dominant opinion within the Labour Party in Londonto destroy church schools as well as grammar schools and toeliminate   streaming would further lower standards.    The immediateproblem was to find ways of controlling excess expenditure. Highrates bore particularly heavily on the Cities of London andWestminster and on non-domestic ratepayers.    Overspending byILEA was, however, only one example, if an extreme one, of thelack of control over those authorities in various parts of GreatBritain who were prepared to forfeit block grant and impose everhigher rates, in the belief that it would not be themselves but centralgovernment which would be held responsible by the electors. Thelack of adequate control over such authorities pointed to the need fora fundamental re-examination of the rating system and of methods ofcontrol over local authority expenditure.    Against that backgroundit was essential to examine again as a matter of urgency the wholerange of political and financial sanctions that might be introduced forILEA.    It was important that the Government should be seen to betaking action but also that they should not embark on changes whichwould not yield clear improvements.    Consideration would need tobe given to the implications of any changes for the MetropolitanPolice.In further discussion of the possibility of a directly elected authorityit was suggested that parental concern for educational standardsmight lead voters to reject the present policies of ILEA.    On theother hand, it might lead them to vote for increased expenditure oneducation.    The Boundary Commission did not have the capacity,at present, to prepare constituencies for a directly elected Authority.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatinformation now available about the likely increase in ILEA expendi-ture for 1981-82 gave fresh importance and urgency to the mattersconsidered by H Committee.    There was a clear need to improveILEA&apos;s performance as an education authority, and to improve thefinancial controls to which it was subject.    These matters wouldneed to be considered in the context of the control of local authorityexpenditure generally and of the possible weaknesses being revealedin the block grant system.    While the Cabinet were inclined at thisstage to favour the retention of a single authority they were not ableto rule out any possibility at this stage, including the reintroductionof excepted districts responsible for their own education services,the grouping of boroughs to provide a viable education service andthe possible right of individual boroughs to secede from ILEA.The Secretary of State for Education and Science, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for the Environment, should therefore re-examinethe issues as a matter of urgency, with particular reference to thesanctions that might be imposed on a single authority.    He would6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALneed to discuss these matters with tne Mirister of State, Departmentof Industry (Mr Baker), in view of the latter&apos;s close personalinterest in the subject, and it would also be desirable to consultthe Leader of the GLC.    The Secretary of State for Education andScience should bring the matter before the Cabinet again in twoweeks&apos; time, and should then suggest the matters that might becovered in any Green Paper, which would have to be issued wellbefore the GLC ele-.tions.    This work should proceed in parallelwith, and take account of, the consideration being given by theSecretary of State for the Environment and other Ministers to thegeneral problems of the control of local authority expenditure thathad been identified in the discussion.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Education andScience, in consultation with the Home Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor the Environment, to give urgent consideration toways in which controls on ILEA might be strengthenedand to other changes which might be made in the structureand financing of the education service in London, takingaccount of the points made in discussion, and to reportthe outcome to the Cabinet for further considei ation attheir meeting on 22 January.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL[EG OTIAT IONSN THE WATERNDUSTRY5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTsaid that he had explained to the National Water Council (NWC),who negotiated on behalf of the water authorities, the importanceof securing a pay settlement for the water manual workers whichdid not put at risk the success of local authority employers inpersuading the unions representing the local authority manualworkers to recommend their members to accept a settlement ofl\ per cent.    It was unhelpful that the NWC had made an openingoffer of 9.9 per cent on basic rates, which was equivalent to7.9 per cent on earnings.    At a meeting with union representativeson 6 January the NWC had, however, refused to improve theiroffer which the unions had rejected.    The unions were now consultingtheir membership - though not by ballot - and advising industrialaction in furtherance of their claim.    They would complete theseconsultations by 3 February.    The outcome would depend criticallyon whether the local authority manual workers accepted the offerof 7. 5 per cent by 27 January and on the outcome of the negotiationson the pay of the gas manual workers.    In the meantime the NWCwould continue to try to impress on the water workers that the offerwas fair and in line with that recommended for the local authoritymanual workers.    They would prefer Ministers to keep a low profileduring this period and he recommended the Cabinet to accept thisadvice.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, in the event of strike action, theattitude of the supervisors would be crucial.    If strike action werelimited, and if the supervisors were willing to co-operate, it shouldbe possible to maintain restricted services for some weeks. Ifthere were   general strike action, and the supervisors were unwillingto help, conditions could become intolerable almost at once.If, however, the supervisors were willing to co-operate in advisingthe Armed Forces the situation might be held for about six weeks.The problems of using the Armed Forces would be eased if thecurrent dispute over the pay of prison officers could be resolved,and his aim was to achieve this by the end of the following week. Itmight be necessary to declare a state of emergency to protect thewater authorities from charges that they were in breach of theirstatutory duty to supply.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatpublic opinion would be strongly against any industrial action by thewater workers, and the Cabinet agreed that the Government shouldstand firm against any pressure to endorse an increased pay offer.For the time being, however, Ministers should not commentpublicly on the negotiations and on the NWC&apos;s ongoing discussionswith the unions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office8 January 19818CONFIDENTIAL
