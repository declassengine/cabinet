CONFIDENTIALliamentary1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.viceputeviouseuence:[81) 8thelusions,ute 5THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had circulated tocolleagues the previous day the text of a draft statement on the currentCivil Service dispute which he thought it would be helpful for him tomake in the House of Lords that afternoon, and for the Minister ofState, Civil Service Department, to repeat in the House of Commons.It was important that the Government&apos;s views should be put clearly onthe record before the one-day strike planned for Monday 9 March, and,preferably, before the Press conference which the Civil Service unionswere due to hold on Friday 6 March.    The draft statement made it clearthat there could be no question of the Government improving on itsexisting offer of a pay increase of 7 per cent.    It explained why it hadbeen necessary to suspend the normal pay research arrangements, butsought to take account of the strength of feeling among civil servants onthis issue by drawing attention to the review being conducted by theGovernment with the object of establishing an ordered and agreed systemof pay determination for the Civil Service which would command thewidest possible acceptance.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that many civil servants were more concerned aboutfuture arrangements for determining pay than about the level of thepresent offer.     It was, however, important that their expectations andthose of their unions about a possible new system  should not beunjustifiably raised.    Civil servants had the benefit of job security andthe section of the draft statement dealing with the coverage of any reviewof future arrangements should emphasise the need for outsidecomparisons to cover all terms and conditions of employment, and notjust comparative wage rates.    Subject to appropriate amendments toreflect this point, the Cabinet agreed that it would be helpful for state-ments to be made in both Houses of Parliament that afternoon ca thalines proposed by the Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet -Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrangefor a statement on the current Civil Service dispute,revised as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup, to be made in both Houses of Parliament thatafternoon.1
CONFIDENTIALeignairsed Statesviouserence:81) 4thlusions,ite 22. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the United States Governmenthad gone to unusual lengths to give, and be seen to give, a very warmwelcome to her and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on theirvisit to Washington the previous week.    There was little sign of anyweakening in their support and admiration for the British Government&apos;spolicies, although they had some doubts about whether public expenditurecuts had been carried far enough at the beginning.    Their own economicpolicies had so far been the main focus of their attention. Theirproposed cuts, which it was a remarkable achievement to have laidbefore the Congress within 30 days of their taking office, would involvean actual fall in public expenditure in real terms.    General support forreductions on this scale appeared to be widespread, but it was not clearhow far the details of the programme would survive Congressionalexamination.    It might be that in the end only 50-60 per cent of theproposals would be approved.    But there was a new sense of purpose andconfidence in Washington which should make the tackling of economicproblems less difficult than in the past.     The underlying strength of theUnited States economy was also very great.    Its enviable featuresincluded good competition, active enterprise, the ready availability ofventure capital, excellent rapport between universities and industry, theabsence of nationalised industries, less unionism and stricter union lawseg in relation to the enforceability of contracts.    The economy had,however, been hampered by too many environmentalist regulations inrecent years;  these had in particular damaged the automotive industrywhich had simultaneously had to face extensive Japanese penetration andsuccessive world oil crises.    Foreign policy had so far received lessattention than economic policy from the new Administration.President Reagan himself clearly intended to delegate matters of detail,but he had strong views on individual issues, such as Southern Africa(which he saw as an aspect of East-West confrontation, with particularreference to the Cuban presence in Angola);  the Middle East (meaningthe Arab-Israel question more than the problems of the Gulf, with theseparateness of the two being perhaps exaggerated);  and above all theneed to resist Cuban encroachment in the Caribbean and CentralAmerica (which was the one area of foreign policy to have so far beengiven relatively full consideration).    Help would certainly be given tothe Government of El Salvador, even at the risk of international confron-tation and some domestic discord.    The new Government in Jamaicawould also be supported.    The United States Defense Secretary,Mr Weinberger, was well disposed to Britain and had recommended toCongress the purchase of important British defence equipment.    In thecivil nuclear field, the United States Government seemed seriouslyinterested in the possibility of Anglo-American collaboration on fastreactors.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIvious rence:11) 4thIclusions,lute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the recentCongress of the Soviet Communist Party had been markedly conservativein tone.    No new blood had been introduced into the top leadership,where the average age was now nearly 70.     President Brezhnev&apos;sspeech had been studiedly moderate on foreign policy issues andskilfully designed to put the new United States Administration on the spotand sow division between them and their European allies.    He had callednot only for a summit meeting with President Reagan but also for theearly resumption of negotiations on arms control measures includingstrategic arms limitation.    His main new proposal had been that thecoverage for certain confidence-building measures should extend to thewhole European territory of the Soviet Union, up to the Urals;  but thiswas subject to there being also some westward extension of the coverage,which might represent an attempt to bring in territory in North America.The American Government&apos;s reaction to the speech had been sensible andcautious.     They were clearly determined to consult carefully with theirallies;  and, provided that they agreed to resume arms controlnegotiations, as seemed probable, there was little danger of a splitactually developing between the United States and Europe.ize viouserence;81) 8th|clusions,ute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatnegotiations with the Guatemalan Government, at which the BelizeGovernment would be represented, were to be resumed that day, inLondon.     Prospects for an agreement were not particularly good. Somemovement might be forthcoming from the Guatemalan side, but theBelizeans were likely to prove more difficult.    The Guatemalans hadalso persuaded the United States Government that their approach wasreasonable.     Every effort would therefore have to be made to induce thePrime Minister of Belize, Mr Price, to contemplate the concessionsnecessary if agreement was to be reached.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUUNITY[fairs ^cultureicil3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODreported that, at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on23-24 February, it had been possible to reach agreement on a number ofoutstanding issues, notably imports of New Zealand butter and structuralaids for agriculture in Northern Ireland.leviousjference:[(81) 8thillusions,hute 4ievious(&apos;;rence:81) 8thelusions,ute 4THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said he hadrecently met the Commissioner responsible for Fisheries,Mr Kontogeorgis, who had indicated his intention to make furtherproposals on access which might have offered the prospect of agreementat the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on9-10 March.    It was now reported, however, that at the meeting of theCommission the previous day his proposals had been modified in wayswhich appeared to favour the French.    If these reports were confirmed,there was very little prospect of an overall fisheries settlement at theforthcoming Council meeting.    In these circumstances the UnitedKingdom would be pressed very hard by the Germans to allow thefisheries agreement with Canada to go ahead.    To agree to do so in thepresent state of the market would have serious consequences.    Or theother hand to refuse to do so would alienate the Germans.    He had there-fore agreed to explore with the Germans ways in which the marketingarrangements could be improved and quantities of fish equivalent toCanadian imports taken temporarily off the market.    In this way he hadmade a gesture towards the Germans, although it was doubtful whetherthe rest of the Community would be willing to agree to the marketingmeasures.    In any case, the indication of the latest Commissionposition had changed the atmosphere in which the fishing industry wouldview any such outcome.In a brief discussion it was noted that Chancellor Schmidt felt stronglyabout the Canadian agreement, and continued refusal to allow it to beconcluded might have wider implications for Anglo-German relations.The Canadian fishing grounds were the main fishing area for a largepart of the German fleet during March and April, and without an agree-ment they could be denied access.      It was unlikely that, even if theUnited Kingdom held out on the Canada agreement, the Germans would bewilling to press the French on the question of access.     On the otherhand, to agree to the Canadian agreement would be to forfeit thepossibility of leverage in securing German support for the Britishposition on access.    There would be a very strong reaction from theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfishing industry if the Government were to accept the Canadian agree-ment without being able to announce simultaneously measures to improvethe current depressed state of the United Kingdom market. Furtherfinancial support for the industry was also under consideration, butconclusions would not be reached before the forthcoming Council.Iviouserence:80) 37thIclusions,lute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY reported that the Councilof Ministers to discuss steel on 3 March had given the industry a furthershort period to work out voluntary arrangements to control production.The Council would meet again on 26 March.    If agreement could not bereached then, the German Government were threatening to take illegalaction against other Community countries which subsidised their steelindustry.    This was mainly aimed at Belgium.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, at the recentmeeting of ihe Council of Ministers (Energy), the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State, Department of Energy, had pressed the Commissionto investigate electricity and other pricing practices in certain memberstates.The Cabinet -Took note.1RIAGE|THEtfCE OFLES4. THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Cabinet to consider whether apublic holiday should be declared on Wednesday 29 July, on the occasionof the marriage of the Prince of Wales.    There was no precedent fordoing so.    There had not been a public holiday for the marriage ofPrincess Elizabeth, as The Queen then was, in 1947, and the onlysubsequent royal occasions on which there had been public holidays hadbeen The Queen&apos;s Coronation and Silver Jubilee.    If a royal weddingoccurred in term time schools would be granted a day&apos;s holiday, but theywould already be on holiday on 29 July.In discussion it was argued that the Government should not depart fromthe 1947 precedent, especially since a holiday in the middle of the weekwould be particularly unwelcome to employers.    Those who came towork, including, for example, workers required to keep continuousprocesses in operation, would have to be paid overtime.    Those whowere in any case on holiday in the last week of July would have to begranted an extra day&apos;s holiday in lieu.    The effect would be to impose anadditional financial burden on industry and commerce at a time ofCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALconsiderable economic difficulty.     The Government would be criticisedfor having done so.     On the other hand, it was argued that the engage-ment of the Prince of Wales had caught the public imagination; hiswedding would be a great and joyous national occasion.    There wasalready an expectation that there would be a public holiday, and manypeople would in any event take the day off.    The Government would becriticised as mean and parsimonious if they did not respond to thenational mood.    Despite the current economic problems, circumstanceswere not as difficult as they had been in 1947.    The Government shouldtake the initiative in declaring a holiday rather than appear to beresponding to pressure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the financial burden that an additional public holidaywould impose on industry, but were nevertheless agreed that on balanceit would be right for a public holiday to be declared on 29 July in celeb-ration of the wedding of the Prince of Wales.    She would consult thePalace before any announcement was made.The Cabinet -1. Agreed in principle that Wednesday 29 July shouldbe declared a public holiday.2. Took note that the Prime Minister would arrangefor an announcement of the decision after the Palacehad been consulted.Cabinet Office5 March 19816CONFIDENTIAL
