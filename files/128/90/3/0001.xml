nquiry

oJtttfj SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that Lord Justice

B/w^e^v-Sloss1 s report on the Cleveland child abuse inquiry was due to be

pttoli^lred on the following Wednesday.    The Minister of State, Department

of vrea}Oi and Social Security (Minister for Health) had circulated to

memb^^-e^v the Home Affairs Committee copies of a short version of the

reporcTy^nipJi had been prepared by Lord Justice Butler-Sloss, together

with a fyr^yl of an initial statement to be made in the House of Commons

at the tv^ne of publication.    He and the Secretary of State for Wales

intended Co publish on the same day a circular and guidance to Social

Services and Health Authorities on the handling of child abuse cases,

and he understood that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for

Education and S^ienae would be issuing guidance to the police and

teaching profes^2S)o -H:espectively.    The report was highly critical of

the poor co-ordination) between the various relevant agencies in

Cleveland and the^gH&gt;dV^ce which was being issued would recommend

changes designed to^irfxfv&amp;e communications and co-operation between

interested agencies. (&gt;^j#&amp;uld be publishing at the same time as the

Cleveland report a rep^f^bM^ the Social Services Inspectorate which

indicated that co-ordinati^S^hetween different agencies in other parts

of the country was genera^Vy aiod.    The Cleveland report criticised the

Social Services Department\ w^ting far too easily led by Dr Higgs and

Dr Wyatt, the two paediatric^khVvSjivolved, and senior police officers

came in for criticism for faiwwyio press with sufficient vigour the

senior police surgeon&apos;s grave reparations about the paediatricians&apos;

methods.   While the report did rfef^cAVj into question the

paediatricians&apos; motives, it made &lt; e/ac^ hat the reflex anal dilation

test on which their assessments wer ^5a^ad should not be relied on as

sufficient evidence of child sexual ^3rt$j^e.   That view was confirmed in a

report of a Sub-Committee of the Standg^g^Medical Advisory Committee

which would also be published on the f(Wdowing Wednesday.    It would

be for the Health Authority to consider Yn the light of the report the

reinstatement of the two paediatricians but he did not expect them to be

reinstated.    The report supported the proposals^for reforming child care

law in the White Paper on Child Care and FamiVV^SejVvices.    Although Lord

Justice Butler-Sloss did not specifically addrtA&amp;s^the question, he now

proposed to give parents and guardians an earlie//opVbrtunity to

challenge emergency protection orders than would\^ v^-heen possible

under the White Paper proposals. V/1

ryy\

In discussion, the following main points were made: &lt;^/\$y\

a.     There was a widespread feeling of outrage abou^ na^appalling

treatment of innocent families in Cleveland and the &amp;}&gt;g ^e^at

readiness to remove children from their parents on ina^fet&amp;a^e

evidence and to inflict on them physical examinations wt^jcij^e ould

have a profoundly adverse psychological impact.    It wouli^DV^yXtal

to reassure parents that all possible steps were being tak^Ji ,X\


^ to ensure that the mistakes which had been made in Cleveland would

not recur.    The public would not understand it if the two

//0\ paediatricians were reinstated.    While Mr Stuart Bell, the local

\Jjy^      Member of Parliament, had come in for some criticism in Lord

&apos;V-/V\    Justice Butler-Sloss1 s report, there would be great public support

\( vfor the robust way in which he had campaigned on behalf of his

M^y/^onstituents.

yy&gt;^\&gt;   Until fairly recently, the public perception was that the

^ w^evant agencies had been too lax in dealing with child abuse, but

vp^j ^ now felt that they were tending to go too far in the

opyosLt^ direction.    It was extremely difficult to steer an

ac  &gt;table line on these sensitive issues.

c.      The Lord Chancellor was preparing proposals for a Child

Protection Office, along the lines recommended in the Cleveland

report.    Tb^raain purpose of such an office would be to improve the

allocation/and) management of cases.    He was also considering

whether nev^a^ta^lgements might be established to bring together in

a single cour/t oa)re proceedings in Magistrates&apos; Court and wardship

proceedings r -  wHigh Court.

THE PRIME MINISTER,   sC^S^vk up the discussion,  said that there was an

acute sense of public outage about the way in which innocent parents

and their children had bgjHj/f^reated an&lt;^ tne Government&apos;s comments on the

report by Lord Justice Bu^er/^Bloss should reflect that concern in plain

language in a way which wosM/w. clearly understood.    It was essential

to reassure the public that VJ^f^Hiards against child abuse would be

provided without parents and xteQyren being subjected to such treatment.

The Secretary of State for Socia6^&gt;&amp;cvices should revise as necessary

the proposed Government statemerrt LepXake account of the points made in

discussion and should circulate iv^to/^11 members of the Cabinet before

the weekend.    The Cabinet noted tha^Xgiiidance would be issued to the

agencies involved and that the Secre^tw^of State for Social Services

and the Lord Chancellor were working ^/^/series of proposals to respond

to recommendations in the report and tM^ut into effect other

improvements which might be required. ^

The Cabinet - . ^

1.     Invited the Secretary of State for s^i)tt-&gt;Services

to circulate to them the proposed Governmen//re)aponse to

the report of the inquiry into child abuse vJJ^RV^Veland,

as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing ^Jp^^

Business

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the House oK^f&gt; dX were due

to debate on 12 July the Statement on the Defence Estimate OfcSa&gt;&amp; (Cmnd

344).    The debate would probably focus on the report by the^ef^nce

Select Committee, which had been published earlier that veekya^^e

size and role of the service fleet.   That report contained a n*iftfoey\ 


misleading assertions, which had been further distorted by sections of

,    the media, but there was not sufficient time before the proposed debate

^\ for the Government to respond formally.    There was likely to be a

)j two-day debate on defence in the House of Commons during the overspill,

sy^atod it would be welcome if the House of Lords debate could be deferred

&lt;^\^n^il that time.

jTRfe/P&lt;RIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion,  said that the

bVsijH^e of the House of Lords had been carefully arranged to enable

thejn tp-^eal with the final stages of a number of important Bills over

the &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ing month and, against that background, it would not be wise

for trr&amp;S&amp;cvarnment to reschedule the defence debate.    While not formally

anticip^vipg the Government&apos;s response to the Select Committee report

the Government spokesman could draw on the arguments which would be

advanced in it.    The Cabinet noted that the Education Reform Bill and

the Local Government Finance Bill, both of which had been handled with

great skill, rem^a-i-aed on course for Royal Assent before the Summer

Adjournment.     f( n

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STAmTMR^SOClAL SERVICES said that the Social

Services Select Committee wc^jfT^D^. publishing a report early the

following week which was 1 ike\y/^Wcal 1 on the Government to allocate

substantial additional resource^/p^^he National Health Service (NHS).

The report, which was not based wnanjk serious examination of the NHS or

its needs, had been timed to coincide ji/&gt;th the Labour Party&apos;s Health Day

at Alexandra Palace the following Sirof^y and the debate on the NHS in

Opposition time on the following TueW^^^

THE HOME SECRETARY said that a report by Her HMe^y&apos;s Chief Inspector

of Prisons on Risley Remand Centre would be pu\^s&gt;ed later that day.

He had commissioned the report following six recqytauicides at the

centre.    The report was highly critical of the stN^tg^ajf) the buildings

and of the regime but the most disturbing feature w^rvrjj^t it found that

his Department&apos;s guidance on reducing the risks of su^r^fe^s had not been

followed.    Since he had received the report,  the Govewre^M.d Deputy

Governor had been moved, the Fresh Start working arr angeme ^i\had been

introduced at the centre and a programme had been set in ^kmd)to

refurbish it. \T^^\

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the General

Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU),

Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had made a skilful and successful speech at the

(Special Party Conference of the CPSU which had opened in Moscow earlier

 ^Oiat week.    Mr Gorbachev had caused some surprise by his proposals for

^MJ-tical reform, especially the creation of a new Congress of People&apos;s

^ferouties.    This Congress would elect the President of the Supreme Soviet

wA/t&amp;Ahe expectation that this would normally be the General Secretary

CT-itk^oCPSU implying that Mr Gorbachev himself would occupy the post.

Tha^^rsrjjbsals had been put together in such a way as to command broad

cons^Jr ^ayl would have the effect of strengthening the personal position

of Mr^TS&amp;DOachev in what might by analogy be described as &quot;Gaullist&quot;

terms. v4^yer the les s,  there was no evidence of fundamental change to the

system. VThe KGB remained; and the Party leadership took care to

maintain firm support from the Soviet military.    Mr Gorbachev was

evidently attempting to shape the political structures of the Soviet

Union in such aj y as to enhance the chances of success for his

economic ref orrfi/prtoWamme.    At the end of his speech Mr Gorbachev had

said that this \^og-ramme was progressing too slowly; and,  in a striking

sentence, had conrc/lauied of what he called &quot;this ossified system of

government&quot; with hC&amp;^fhtralised systems of command and pressure. The

process of reform wwfW^-tte a very long haul, made more difficult by the

expectations aroused fo^H*\Gorbachev of improvements in standards of

living of Russian citi&apos;^e*^)^

Malta

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH^^^TARY said that the recent ships&apos; visit

to Malta led by HMS Ark Royal naM^ken place against a background of

domestic political strife therexwijASattempts by the Opposition of

Mr Dom Mintoff to embarrass the Ma^fTes^ Government.    The Royal Naval

ships had put into St Paul&apos;s Harboujr^gtjier than Valletta.   They had

received a warm welcome but the inc r^tf^had been potentially very

awkward.    The Maltese Parliament had ra4i^irmed a non-nuclear policy on

23 June.   The United Kingdom had thereMire sought assurances, to be made

public if necessary, that Malta recognised the British policy of neither

confirming nor denying whether Royal Naval ships carried nuclear

weapons.    These assurances had been obtained andthe visit had

proceeded.    But in the event the Maltese unilayeTVlly added a paragraph

to their letter referring to a basis of frienJlvx   d mutual trust that

the resolution of their Parliament was being obs/^vea.    The British High

Commissioner in Malta had therefore had to take ajs^C^rfSto establish that

there was no presumption one way or the other whethj^^amp lear weapons

were being carried.    It was disturbing that the Gove^ ^t&apos;s policy of

neither confirming nor denying should apparently be c^afsSag^under

increasing pressure from different quarters.    He would enww that Posts

in countries hosting visits by Royal Naval ships under nr^^oytback 88&quot;

deployment were thoroughly briefed.

In discussion, it was noted that even those Mintoff supporte^s^ariifb

demonstrated against nuclear weapons had expressed their posr f*^^&gt;

feelings toward the Royal Navy; the restricted shore leave in npXt&amp;yfpr


^     Naval personnel associated with this visit had passed off well.    It was

/p&gt;    nevertheless a pity that this problem should have cropped up,

yy\\ particularly since the Government had spent so much money in the recent

\)J .Rast in raising Second World War wrecks from Valletta Harbour.

T^E^f^IIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a further round of

tarksvh^ra taken place that week in Cairo between the United States,

CubayjpwgSSia and South Africa.    Although that process was continuing,

the armyfl&apos;r  ounters on 27 July between Cuban/Angolan forces and the

South A^w^cans had not been helpful.    South Africa was claiming 200

Cubans anX Angolans killed and admitted having lost 12 members of its

own defence forces.    The original clash had been between ground forces

close to the border between Angola and Namibia.    This had led to a Cuban

air strike on tW^Sputh African held Calueque Dam.    There was evidence

that the Cuban*Anaj) not have consulted the Angolan Government or even

informed them lwDsd^Jatoce about this air raid.    There was a risk of

further trouble aheady

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWE  $P^ CRETARY said that the visit  to Iran by a

delegation of British memv^rJtf Parliament had passed of uneventfully.

The visitors had not succeaWa/wi meeting anyone of great importance or

learning anything significarf^ vt&amp;f press conference they had given on

their return had been undramaE^6^/As for the Gulf War, Iraq had made

some headway with the recapture ^fee^&amp;revious week of the Majnoon

Islands, thus effectively ending^Ir^p^an occupation of Iraqi territory

in the southern sector.    Iraq wouVd        bend its efforts to repossessing

occupied areas in the north.    In Ir&lt;jr fcjr re were signs of internal

upheaval and discontent.    The SpeakeVsSy the Iranian Parliament, Mr Ali

Akbar Rafsanjani, had taken over as ac^^Jg Commander-in-Chief. There

was heightened speculation about the heVlth of the Iranian Leader,

Ayatollah Khomeini, who was certainly very frail.    But no fundamental

change in Iranian policy was foreseen.    British policy therefore

remained unchanged.    It was to press for implementation of United

Nations Security Council Resolution 598 and t(//suodort the efforts of

the United Nations&apos; Secretary-General, Mr Perex^de^TiHellar, even though

there was not yet enough solidarity among key memcers)of the Security

Council to make possible an arms embargo.    In theVmejmyime, the

Government had agreed a Memorandum of UnderstandingC&apos;w^to the Netherlands

and Belgium by which, with effect from 1 July, the mvrasw^eping forces

in the Persian Gulf of the three countries would be inregVr^&amp;ed under

British operational control.    The Foreign Affairs Commit^jK&amp;f the House

of Commons had published a report that day which had heljf&quot;rull)y endorsed

all aspects of the Government&apos;s policy in the region,  incrs*j^fa\that on

hostages. ^^&gt;//




THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY referred to the economic

effects of the current drought in the United States.    He had heard on

good authority that if there were no rain within the next few days the

^consequences would be that the price of grain on world markets would

,/^\ise above the intervention level.    He thought it desirable that some

be put in hand to analyse the economic  implications of all this.

4.      THE NjOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the conclusions

reached at the Hanover European Council on 27-28 June were in line with

United Kingdom objectives.    The Prime Minister&apos;s earlier contacts with

Chancellor KohL&apos;^an^k Pres ident Mitterrand and those with Presidency

officials in Bifm aiid with the Secretary General of the Commission had

been helpful in TiMrfewing this result.    The single market priorities

identified for thQ^&amp;ayxyce reflected our own major interests.    We had

headed off a renewecI^Pfcerxch bid, already successfully resisted in the

Council of Economic an-H/J^nance Ministers,  to secure a link between

harmonisation of taxes  (Osj?vings and the implementation of the capital

movements directive.    On Xw^l issues, we could expect increasing

pressure under the next  tfr eyPresidencies but any damaging conclusions

involving regulatory comm\Sm p^s. had been successfully avoided on this

occasion.    As regards monetar^&lt;Qyestions, Governors would lead in the

agreed study.    The Committeev&lt;ptt&gt;d^ be chaired by the President of the

Commission, with three additio&lt;Jax/mAmbers, plus one additional

Commissioner, It would report trn^pojSkthe Council of Economic and

Finance Ministers.    The mandate fajp^r^ study made no reference to a

European Central Bank.    Although thls-^Was not fully reflected in the

final conclusions, there had been a^rfSJul discussion of frontier

issues following a call by the Dutch INr^irepMinister for a study of the

problems of access to member states anty^rae social integration of

immigrants from third countries. Monsiet^ Delors had been reappointed as

President of the Commission for a two-year term.

In discussion, it was noted that at least two ajS3Nperhaps all three of

the additional members designated to serve infthe ynonetary study were

likely to have a helpful influence.    There was^K^ev^x no assurance that

the Committee&apos;s conclusions would be brought befrare^the Council of

Economic and Finance Ministers in adequate time rbr^i(6ra to have the

imput that would be desirable into the recommendatror/^&gt;pat went

forward.    It would be necessary to find ways to get V^mkf^this

difficulty.    On social questions, there would be continum &gt;pressure to

introduce additional regulations and standardised labou^J^gvslation.

The battle here was by no means over.    As regards frontie^_cWa xoIs, it

was essential that these should be maintained to deal effet^Cr^w with

entry of third country nationals and to combat terrorism, CR\m &gt;afld drug

traffic.    We wished to make it easier for Community nationals^e^tMvel

within the Community and the adoption of passports in common forffi^w uld,


together with computerisation, assist.    But the Community faced major

K   problems over immigrant control.    The problem was illustrated by the

y\(act that over the last four years,  there had been some 600,000 asylum

)applications to Western European countries.    Several European Community

I^Xtrtjhnber states faced difficulties in relation to specific nationals. The

&lt;V^d(Citional studies proposed by the Dutch Prime Minister and the

^ra^yagni t ion in the Council&apos;s discussion of the importance of frontier

vtvnfirf^ls represented a helpful background to the further practical

pbj&lt;(ny\k which Interior Ministers had in train.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that after it had been

thought agreement had been reached on green currency devaluations, the

Greeks had challenged the Commission&apos;s interpretation of the Council

texts.    We had ureed the Commission and other member states to stand

firm against anyyfTrrNthe r concession.    The Greeks had used the threat of

the Luxembourg $bmp$ imise to hold out for their own interpretation. In

discussion it was  dgg sted that it might be necessary to review United

Kingdom policy of of the invocation of the Luxembourg compromise

in all circumstances^/^m^the other hand, it was argued that given the

increased provision fokK^^^xiied majority voting, use of the compromise

might  in some si tuatioa^iyevfche only recourse remaining open to the

United Kingdom.    The soluti^^might not be to ban use of the compromise

but find ways of prevent inlgoriVbe ing devalued, perhaps on the lines of a

past precedent where the ab^ri  &apos;\pf agreement following a German

invocation had led to use of/Camn^sion management powers.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up &lt;^n^d^scussion, said that Cabinet

concluded that we should seek to(e*fsu)ne that the Greek interpretation of

the Council texts did not prevail wj *Te^not abandoning our view of the

Luxembourg compromise, and invited th^Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary and the Minister of Agricu^fi^y Fisheries and Food to proceed

accordingly.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said $a &gt;at the Industry

Council on 24 June the Commission had confirmeo(thit they were not

proposing any prolongation of steel quotas beyoffdvO^xXune.    The market

would now determine the levels of production in eUcJ)xTi/e*iber state. The

Commission had made clear that they would in addi tio^foash to monitor

very carefully any proposals for state aids for restndieTxJrang national

industries which might distort competition.    A major cfcfeem&gt; issue was

the extent of state aids which the Italian Government wisVjejjXto offer to

the Bagnoli plant at Naples.    German steel production in&lt;ttttKTTuhr was

also likely to come under pressure, with the possibility oX_piA&amp;ure of

some Krupp plants.    The Commission&apos;s approach was welcome sin^^X

potential buyers for the British Steel Corporation would feeiSmwr^S

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that at its meeting on

agreement on acid rain.    It had also reached agreement on the next stage

ISORDER IN

URAL AREAS

revi ous

eference:

C(88) 20.2

5.      TWe/Cy 4&gt;inet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary (C(88) 9)

on disorKfer in rural areas, prepared in response to the Cabinet&apos;s

invitatio^ at their meeting on 9 June.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that there had recently been a number of

we 11-publicised/JJ+^prders  in rural areas, but that these needed to be

seen against thfe ityt that the levels of recorded crime in the Shires

were about halz^ y &amp;S\pf metropolitan areas.    On the other hand, the

recorded crime  fvwjiryalor non-metropolitan areas were rising by about

3 per cent a year/~Vfp^Le those in metropolitan areas were on a slightly

downward trend.    Theri /^rk some feeling that the media were exaggerating

the problem of rural H^^rwr, and this would need to be watched. There

was,  in fact,  nothing new^a4 but disorders  in market towns, but it did

seem that there was curr^H^ yv\a growing problem of youths who had been

given no sense of social vXsjkJjaibi 1 ity by their parents; who spent

their substantial wages on attvrt&amp;ng in clubs and public houses that were

increasingly designed to attS^ci^as young age group; and who readily

turned to violence against eacaj/^njAr and against the police.    He had

therefore in the previous year  ^ma working group of officials and

the Association of Chief Pol ice uf&amp; eiyrs (ACPO) to examine the problem,

and this group had recommended theop ^tional improvements set out in

the annex to C(88) 9.    He proposed vs &lt;jSi^our age the chief police

officers to put these recommendat ionsyyxo^e f feet, and to commission

research that would provide the police^w^Th operationally useful

information about the kinds of people responsible for rural disorder and

the circumstances that precipitated it.    The police were, very

understandably, using rural disorder as an argument to support their

requests for more police manpower.    It would require extraordinary

increases in manpower to enable county and rural forces to tackle

outbreaks of disorder as effectively as could xfie^Gjiaer city forces but

he believed that some additional manpower, togetner}Jith operational

improvements of the kind recommended by the ACPO\ioja^pg party, could

make a helpful difference.    This was reflected in frtfexfrfoposals for

further increases in police manpower that he presentq^lCaX under

discussion with colleagues.    Adequate maximum sentences&gt;&apos; jpre already

available for all the most relevant offences, but the ett  \of a

successful prosecution was much diluted if it was delayetf/ro/) several

months after the event: he therefore proposed to discuss Vi*J*^Me

police,  the magistrates&apos; courts and the Crown Prosecution S^r^ra, the

possibilities for bringing on prosecutions for disorderly ofxferfafere at

the first possible moment.    Most importantly, alcohol was clearX^a&lt;\yery


major factor:    it featured in no less than 90 per cent of the incidents

of rural disorder in 1987 reported to the ACPO working party.    At a

meeting about football hooliganism under the Prime Minister&apos;s

\ chairmanship the previous day he had agreed to consider whether the

^magistrates&apos;  existing power to order the temporary closure of licenced

vADT^mises  in areas where riot or tumult was predicted might require some

&gt;Jp $ision.    He had also agreed to consider what might be done to enforce

^t/^w against under-age drinking.    More generally, he believed that

Xy^nping justices had become too lax and were not sufficiently using

the^raroXion of removing the licences of public houses where disorders

took^ip^ce. He proposed to issue firm guidance on this matter both to

1 icerps^^J^/just ices and to the police, since he had no doubt that the

removaL\of-^ licence from a disorderly public house had an immediate

and salu(Mry effect on all public houses in the area.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT reported that at the meeting

on the previous day about football hooliganism it had been agreed that

the football au^Jroyities should be urged to withdraw the England team

from friendly nmtchgs abroad for the next year, and from the Rous Cup

competition.    Irnf^aa~^jlso been agreed that the football authorities

should be request^d-^a/establish a full national membership scheme,

whereby only spectatw^with membership cards would be admitted to

football matches in EAJQ^rftd and Wales.    In the probable event that the

football authorities v^r^tyRable to deliver an acceptable scheme, the

legisation would be needejj/fcp.,impose it.    In addition to the licensing

matters already ment iones^JreyHome Secretary had also undertaken to

review the adequacy of exl^X-jjjj^ our t powers to keep convicted football

hooligans away from matchesS$&amp; %&gt;at home and abroad, by enforcing their

attendance at reporting centl^s^wjfen matches were on.

In discussion the following maii/^p&apos;oijjts were made -

a. An effective attack on alcjapal abuse required action in

various quarters.    The brewers^tioSyl do more to ensure that their

public houses were kept in an ord\ Typfashion, and it was

politically very desirable that trre^&apos;should be seen to take on this

responsiblity as the Licensing ActX^ame into force.    The police

should adopt a far more sustained and positive attitude in opposing

licenses for disorderly public houses.    The licensing justices

needed to be much more rigorous in perforsn^ffgX their duties. The

Lord President of the Council&apos;s Ministerial droup on Alcohol Misuse

had heard of a number of areas where good^py^t^ce and co-operation

had been established, but standards in thes&amp;\ny j ars varied greatly

around the country.    There would be advantage ijymaking

arrangements to share experience and good practi/  ^\

b. Members of local communities were not always trfe-Ojest people

to be entrusted with responsibilities for the regu] aj   fh\of trade,

and it was probable that licensing justices often f ew_^o!habi ted

from acting as firmly as the occasion warranted. There^w &gt;s\

therefore a case for using stipendiary magistrates to bAkV/^

licensing decisions, however much such an innovation mig^^re^

resented. Ljr&gt;\


c.      On the other hand, there were other respects in which local

decision-making was to be encouraged.    The Coventry City Council,

v\ for example, had put forward bye-laws  to prohibit the consumption

&apos;Jy\        f alcohol in public places and, while the Home Secretary had not

&gt;TO\     taken a final decision on this, he was minded to enable an

\~/*)   experiment to go ahead in Coventry despite the reservations of the

police.    The object would be to see if it was possible to use such

//}=k power to strike at objectionable, rowdy public drinking without

//precipitating uncontainable protest from respectable people who

^rp/^oyed a picnic.

^3^^\0ne possibility being canvassed in the fight against under-age

drifting was a scheme for making service at a public house

conditional on the production of an identity card displaying the

bearer&apos;s photograph and age.    The Home Secretary intended to pursue

this possibility, which was consistent with the much wider

accept ance^ofv identity documents of various kinds in modern

society. (( \)

e.      Publ ic Uioi^les were not necessarily the alcohol outlets that

caused the mVs-J/ii&apos;ouble.    Supermarkets and,  in particular,

off-licences wey^^obably more at fault in supplying drink to

drunken or undes^a^^ocustomers,  and in certain areas there were

severe problems witv3*&gt;scotheques and clubs of various kinds that

simultaneously decaf&amp;ej otheir clientele into the streets in the

small hours.    While&apos;QQtpugh approach to the conduct of such clubs

was well justified, Rtnjirv^^ restrictions on the number of clubs

that was allowed in anMar^a&gt;would not sit easily with the

Government&apos;s policies on^ejfopetition and deregulation.    It was also

often argued that the decyUffavQ. real levels of taxation on alcohol

had contributed to excessive j?p^jumption.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the&lt;# * K;sion, said that alcohol abuse

was very obviously an important comSb^ytactor between all the forms of

youthful public disorder that were curo^Jrtly in the public eye. This

was a major social concern on which tms\Government should take - and be

seen to take - decisive and energetic action.    It was clear that the

operation of the licensing system required a vigorous shake-up and that,

in particular, licensing justices were not prepa-red to contemplate the

withdrawal of licences as often as they shouyd\JThis was highly

regrettable, as the Cabinet shared the Home Sx^re^ry&apos;s view that the

withdrawal of a public house&apos;s licence was likely tw have a most

salutary effect on all the public houses in the Nt$ &gt;j!Hj^ourhood.    The Home

Secretary should therefore proceed urgently with v(&amp;A^ygh new guidance

to licensing justices and the police proposed in CC^j^K^v   While that

initiative should take full account of clubs, discotfreq^eM^ off-licences

and other alcohol outlets, it was also the case that the^K^wing

companies had a special responsibility for ensuring the^&amp;fadjly running

of their public houses and the Home Secretary should calv^wK^he

brewers&apos;  representatives to discuss this.    The Lord ChancefoTt^t^hould be

involved in the guidance to licensing justices, and he and \hJ^&gt;Lorae

Secretary should consider the possibility of giving licensing^fr/j^k^to


stipendiary magistrates.    The Cabinet welcomed the Home Secretary&apos;s

intention of urgently reviewing the enforcement of the law against

under-age drinking and in that connection the discussion had revealed

/y\ considerable support, which the Home Secretary would wish to bear in

^^ mind,  for encouraging some form of identity card scheme.    The Cabinet

 ^ owsj. corned the Home Secretary&apos;s intention of discussing the possibility of

quick prosecutions and court hearings with the responsible

Chippies, and they trusted that those responsible for the next

sQ^fnOiicant disorder that took place would be dealt with crisply and

expj^nrHously.    The Cabinet also approved the Home Secretary&apos;s remaining

propp^rlj&gt;in C(88) 9, namely the encouragement of chief police officers

to im^^jjforit the ACPO working party&apos;s recommendations annexed to C(88) 9

and the)ydp $H*issioning of research that would be operationally useful to

the poltfc^.    It would be helpful if the Home Secretary would make a

further rvport on the progress of these measures in September.

The Cabinet -

Took note\(wi wiapproval of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up o^fvTFte discussion and invited the

Home SecretatW_^j^i\the Lord Chancellor to proceed

accordingly.
