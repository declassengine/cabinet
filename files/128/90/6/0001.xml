2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the fire at the largest

of the oil wells at the Piper Alpha platform had now been extinguished

and efforts wep^rontinuing to put out the fires at the remaining four

wells.    A furti^er sjirvivor of the explosion had died, bringing the toll

of those dead amyHfis^aing to 167.    131 bodies had yet to be recovered

and it appeared txfajyjhgvt of them were contained in the accommodation

section, which restejj^bvarturned on the sea-bed.    Both the righting and

the lifting of that s &amp;p&amp;n would be difficult operations. Seven

survivors remained in &lt;$er^pv al and 55 had already been discharged.

Preliminary work on the rpx^ajtfies he had established was proceeding well

and there was good co-opejraCfc^yti between the Procurator Fiscal and his

inspectorate.   The materia^-tjp^fis. the technical inquiry would need to

examine was for the most par^-lS^ged within the frame of the platform

and it would not be possible^^cTjrj^cover it until the platform had been

made secure.   While that was h^mlrey^ng progress, he had been promised an

interim report within 6 weeks ai$^ffoj&gt;^d to have the final report within

a further month.    The preliminary&gt;ijlrarings of the public inquiry to be

chaired by Lord Cullen might take pLgpe in October.   On the previous

Tuesday he had met the trade unions^rr3&lt; ^d been astonished to find that

they had not realised that the Health\j*U^afety at Work Act had been

extended over ten years previously so aVxo apply to offshore

installations, such as the Piper Alpha r$g.    That totally undermined the

position which the unions had been taking which had been based on the

misconception that the Health and Safety at Work Act did not so apply.

The unions had pressed him very hard to make ai^ft^ble to them copies of

reports on safety issues, in particular his De\i(ar Sjbent&apos; s report on an

incident on the Piper Alpha platform in 1984.   li^Tayv explained to them

that all such reports would be made available to\t]lVA*blic inquiry,

which would release any material which Lord Cullen^^^/eyed that other

witnesses might require in order to present their cas/&lt;ra^\rhe prospect

of the trade unions taking industrial action has now^^ Q^d and he

believed that industrial relations should enter a calmerj^^iod. He

knew that the companies responsible for other oil platfdra^ftwire

redoubling their efforts to promote safety, and any lesso\reL^w j&lt;h

emerged from the inquiries would certainly be made known to&lt;/ reh\without


delay.    However, until progress had been made with establishing what had

happened on the Piper Alpha platform, it would be premature to offer

guidance or encourage speculation about the causes.

Tfllf^^RETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that

Mi^WicMMas Winterton MP and &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper were leading a

camp^^ft^for the Government to compensate the 11,000 or so mainly

retirV^Anvestors who had lost money as a result of the collapse of the

Bar low COy^es companies in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar.    Even if

the inquiry which he had established into his Department&apos;s handling of

Barlow Clowes disclosed shortcomings these could only relate to the

United Kingdom company and it was the Gibraltar company in which the

great bulk of the-^losses had occurred.    In any case, many other

organisations artdjunsti tut ions had been more directly involved than the

Government as v^e-rasdiaries or advisers.    It was for consideration

whether it might n/e j)n the interests of both the Government and

investors in BarDaSC^rawes for the Government to inspire guidance

designed to damp dovn^afl^ unrealistic expectations that the Government

should be looked to ajj/pfv \primary source of compensation.

In discussion, it was not^Xthat it could be highly damaging for the

Government to offer guidarfwfe \flhich was capable of being misinterpreted

as anticipating the outcomc^ ^^he inquiry.   More generally, the Barlow

Clowes affair raised the que^f^oivwhether some financial advisers might

be influenced more by the sia&amp;^wthe commissions available to them than

by their clients&apos; best interesV^^/^t would be important for the

future to ensure that the statuwfrVAAfluirements on the disclosure of

commissions and arrangements for ^jirv&apos;e&amp;tor s to have the protection of

insurance against such losses were ^jJfXiKad equate.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the disVj^^on, said that nothing should

be said in advance of the completion o^vhe inquiry into the Department

of Trade and Industry&apos;s handling of Barrow Clowes which was capable of

being misrepresented as anticipating its outcome.   When the report of

the inquiry had been received, consideration mi^bt need to be given to

the adequacy of existing legislative requiremarafsYteoverning the

disclosure to potential investors of the ccmimv^ip&amp;a. associated with

schemes recommended by their financial advisers anajMther measures to

increase the protection of investors. v^^O

The Cabinet -

summing up of the discussion and invited the SecreraxyYN

of State for Trade and Industry to be guided accordrn^Jx^X




THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, at its meeting earlier in

the day, the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy,

Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs, had considered his proposals for the

future of the fast reactor programme.    The Sub-Committee had agreed that

the programme should be scaled down substantially.    The Prototype Fast

Reactor at Dounreay would be closed down in 1993-94 and the reprocessing

&apos; olant there would be closed down three years later.    Work on the fast

^xkactor at other establishments of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy

vujNiority would be reduced from some  54 million per annum to

/Vtv .million per annum over the next eighteen months.    He would be

y^merfming these decisions to the House of Commons later that day.

In^fi&amp;^Jresion it was noted that the delay in closure of the Dounreay

plan&lt;P^w i M provide time for consideration to be given to alternative

employmewtAn the area, either in the nuclear field or in other

ac t iv i tSte^;

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

endorsed the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals and agreed that he should

report them to B^r4iament later that day.    This was an important

strategic decit/on)which would in time permit the release of significant

resources for scifttjEfrfic work of higher priority.

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWMW^ECRETARY said that Iraq had greeted

with understandable suspicion tho^mtfvpuncement by Iran on 17 July that

she accepted United Nations SecuVitv^Opunci 1 Resolution 598 and the call

for a ceasefire contained there in ^lp^q believed that Iran might merely

be playing for time and was therefo&lt; ^jwH*illing to relax military

pressure until Iranian intentions werfe^Zlear.    For that reason it was

important that the United Nations and vp^Secretary General,

Mr Perez de Cuellar, in particular shouW move rapidly to make the most

of this opportunity and to settle the technical arrangements for a

ceasefire.   With Security Council Resolution 598 now accepted by all

parties, the aim was the full and rapid implementation of all its

provisions,   The Iranian Airbus incident couldyaTaa be closed if Iran

were prepared to co-operate with the United St\q* s^j  enabling the

International Civil Aviation Organisation&apos;s invei/ig^tion to be

completed.   The acceptance by Iran of Resolution \12&amp;&amp;Ss certainly good

news as far as it went and the United Kingdom desewe^rfredit for the

prominent diplomatic role played from the outset in gVj e^ g the

Resolution passed and followed up.    One could not assw^e^tKat progress

would be straightforward from now on.    But a genuine peae^P^Jfrv the Gulf

would have major implications in relation to the oil market&apos;, )nhe


position of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and

trading prospects, as well as for relations with Iran more generally.

It would be worth considering these implications on a contingency basis.

^OsHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the agreement in

.^^rinciple which had been announced on 21 July between South Africa,

&lt;^kffi&gt;fA.a and Cuba promoted and assisted by the United States, was a

wj$c i\e and encouraging step.    It provided for the way forward toward

Nam^t&apos;&amp;n independence together with the withdrawal from the region of

all tweign troops, including the Cubans.    There had been parallel

con k t^n&amp;n New York between military delegations which offered some

groundyyto^hope that the military situation on the ground would remain

calm. there was a very long way to go before all the details were

worked ow^ to make the agreement firm.    There were grounds for caution

about whether the Cubans were really ready to leave Angola, but there

were some signs that the Soviet Union did want that.

The 70th birtrmay ^arlier that week of the imprisoned leader of the

African Nation^^jgjm&amp;ress, Mr Nelson Mandela, had passed without serious

disorder in Souta^Africa.    The Government would continue to urge the

South Africans toSf^^ase Mr Mandela.    There had been hints from the

South African MinisYa^f^r Information that Mr Mandela might indeed be

released at some stag^^oVt too much weight could not be put on these.

The South African Gove^nmVj*^ did not yet seem to realise that keeping

Mr Mandela in prison did^i^m^more harm than good.

Election with a well-balanced team of V ght wing and left wing support

respectively.    Not much could be inferrea from the party platform

adopted at the Convention about the future policies of a Dukakis

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a revised Trade

Bill was now being debated in Congress.    The President was very unlikely

to veto it.    In its revised form, the Bill still contained some

objectionable provisions.    But the alternative of a new Bill in 1989

might well be worse.    In the circumstances, he did not believe that we

,   or the Commission should lobby against the Bill.    We could continue to

/&apos;make known objections to individual elements in it.

TH^^JISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at its meeting

devaluation of the green drachma on which issue the Greeks had invoked

the Luxembourg Compromise.    Subsequently it had been thought that an

agreement had been reached on a solution to this issue.    However, the

Greeks had disputed the agreement reached and had sought to re-open it.

A number of merob^&gt;vcountries had appeared prepared to contemplate some

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that on 10 September

1987 the Cabinet, after very careful consideration of all the arguments,

had agreed tha^tWe Health and Medicines Bill should include provisions

to enable theUffipogition of charges for dental examinations under the

National Healtff-S^fv^ce (NHS) and to end the free NHS sight test for

those who could atf^pyKto pay.   On the previous Tuesday, during the

Bill&apos;s Committee SVggt/,sthe House of Lords had passed amendments to

remove both provisionr^Jr\&gt;m the Bill.    The yield from the new charges,

taken together, was e^yi^a^ed at  134 million a year, and the bulk of

that money was needed toye^set other improvements in primary health

care to which the GovernaJ^fvCAWas committed.   Those improvements and the

changes in charging arran^em n s were, therefore, a carefully considered

package, and he did not beL*6j&lt;e^t,hat the House of Lords&apos; rejection of

the charging provisions couia.Vp^kccepted.    A number of Government

supporters in the House of CoaJmiOTV^iad&gt; however, indicated their

approval of the action taken ir&gt;^ife\House of Lords, and many of those

who disagreed with the Government^n^&amp;he charging issue were not

susceptible to reasoned argument, sij^e-e they saw free medical

examination as a matter of inviolao^^arlnciple.    He would shortly

consider with the Business Managers iaybp*h Houses how best to proceed

in order to secure a favourable outcora^dur ing the overspill part of the

Session. ^

In discussion the following main points were made -

a.     The proposed charges would only be nfeqi^red from those who

could afford to pay them, as were other oe^ai^and optical charges

to which the public was well accustomed.    P^spAincreases in dental

charges had not deterred people generally frw^Saeking treatment,

and there was no reason to suppose that modesx  lk*pges for

examination would have that effect.    In the cas-^J^f^ptical charges

it was likely that if the NHS were to withdraw fromV^nancing eye

tests the opticians would provide that service fre^*p/0 rder to

attract custom.    The Government&apos;s proposals were am^nyfestly fair

and reasonable way of raising some of the money thacTpreOw)


b. Although the amendments in question were within the

constitutional competence of the House of Lords, it was

&gt; unreasonable for that Chamber to seek to undo such carefully

 v\ calculated public expenditure decisions.    The critics of the

yjy^       charges had no valid alternative proposals for providing a similar

vr\     amount of funds within the NHS.    On the other hand, much heavy

\Cv /\   legislation remained to be taken through the House of Lords in both

^V^^/^the present and future sessions, and it was not the right time to

/^/^^timulate a debate on the proper extent of the Lords&apos; powers. So

Syt^jC as immediate handling of the matter was concerned,  there was a

^crtjmrention in the House of Lords that the Government did not seek

^ ej3^e the Report stage of a Bill to reverse defeats in Committee.

AN^oujh this convention might not be binding,  it would be very

damaging if the Government sought to reverse the amendment and

surftred a further defeat.

c. While a bald statement that it was proposed to reverse the

defeats iiy^BSi House of Commons would not be the best way of

handling the fatter, the Government needed to give an immediate

indicatiorN3&gt;f&lt;*&amp;s views.    Unless that was done, the Government&apos;s

critics on tnisyj/ssue might seize the initiative and work up a

degree of punlrrJK^jeeling that severely restricted the Government&apos;s

room for manoeuvY^K^*

d. The Government&apos;v X&gt;itics believed, albeit misguidedly, that

free examinations sljoj&amp;ivcontinue to be provided because of their

importance in terms M^wliy^entive medicine.    The Government&apos;s

response should recogoi^e^fte strength of feeling on that issue and

should seek to defuse iS^fvA/way of doing that might be to offer

assurances on the way in^wtajiwwthis aspect would be monitored, or

to see if other ways could fi /fe\ind of making minor adjustments to

the proposals without damagYna^h^ir main substance.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the Cp^jfl^Bion, said that,  in order to

retain the initiative, the Governmenr^e&gt;^uld indicate that no new

arguments had been introduced in the Hs^e of Lords and that the

Government continued to believe, and wou^i argue vigorously, that the

linked proposals on primary health care improvements and on charges for

dental and optical tests were a balanced and justifiable package. The

Social Services Secretary should consider with &gt;*jQs.Lord President of the

Council, the Lord Privy Seal and other Ministers concerned what steps

might be taken to make the proposals more palai a1&gt;J^^to Parliament, and

thus improve the prospects of reversing the Housafof/iords amendments,

without jeopardising the substance of the proposars^xw

The Cabinet -

Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the discussion and invited the vC^vvv

Secretary of State for Social Services to proceed ^?^\\\

accordingly.
