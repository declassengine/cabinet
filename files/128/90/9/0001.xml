1.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the interim report of

the technical inquiry which he had established into the explosion on the

Piper Alpha platform would be published later that day.    Lord Cullen,

\the Chairman of the public inquiry into the explosion, would be

Mannouncing at the same time the date of the inquiry&apos;s preliminary

^karings and that the Department of Energy&apos;s report on the incident on

&quot;&quot;^H . Piper Alpha platform in 1984 was being made available to the public.

^Fm/Technical report had been difficult to compile because much of the

^py/^JtVal evidence remained on the sea bed.    However,  two possible

explanations had emerged and, while it would be for the public inquiry

to ve^^K&gt;its own conclusions, it appeared that the most likely cause of

the erap^sion was human error rather than a failure in the structure of

the rJg\V/The trades unions had been seeking to build up their position

in the tfarpn Sea,  as had the Opposition&apos;s energy spokesman in courting

the traded unions, and as a result there had been a good deal of

exaggerated and ill-informed criticism of safety arrangements.    This had

been heightened by the explosion on board the Ocean Odyssey platform the

previous week whp-ft-vthe radio operator had lost his life.    However, he

was clear from (/Cs^discussions with the workforce during a visit to the

Alwyn North oilx^e^ptxthe previous day that, while there was naturally a

good deal of anxiaty^Borth Sea oil operators and workers all attached

the highest prioriVy-^wsafety considerations.    The trades unions had

claimed that safety  ryrari^ements in the Norwegian sector were superior

to those in the Britisjj^s&apos;el^tor, but their contention that his Department

should no longer be reffpoafe^le both for safety and development was

undermined by the fact trw fc/j ^6Donsibi 1 ity for these two matters in the

Norwegian sector was likevfa^e/axercised by a single body.    The Burgoyne

Committee on Offshore Safety JJ^oexamined that issue and had concluded

that there would be no benef\fTvr&gt;cemoving responsibility for safety

from the Department of Energy^/^Le-Covernment should not be drawn into

commenting on the possible cause/^fcthe explosion on Piper Alpha, which

was a matter for the public inquVryv/^owever, without prejudice to

that, his Department had written tyrth^poil companies to urge them to

examine six issues relating to safelS^S^^

Prisons

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the prison officers at Holloway Prison had

ceased their industrial action on 22 Sept ember^^jE&amp;ter it had been made

plain to them that staff not obeying orders vomd       sent home. The

staff at a number of other prison establishment^/fKw^ever, were

continuing to refuse to accept new prisoners and f^hi^yhad led to a rise

in the number of prisoners held in police cells, whJ30&gt;A&gt;resently stood

at about 1700.    This situation, which was both expenayyj  and damaging to

the efficiency of the police, was totally unacceptabrev^kh^ he had

accordingly invited the national chairman of the Prison cAfJ^cers&apos;

Association (POA), Mr John Bartell, to meet him that aft^rapoh.    At that

meeting he would make it plain to the prison officers tha\\^)ja&apos;.

Government could not tolerate the present situation, which^payj&lt; \after a

long period of patient handling by prison management, and tn\a \ap/ys

continuation of the industrial action must lead to staff diso^e^mg^

orders being sent home under the Temporary Relief from Duty proaejfruifos,


and to suspension of check-off facilities for the payment of POA

subscriptions.    Although there were some risks in taking such a firm

^   line, the present state of affairs was manifestly intolerable and,

 \having discussed the matter with the police, he believed that the time

Jpad come to leave the prison officers in no doubt about the Government&apos;s

^^olution.

  lite Papers

THE&lt;Plmlfc MINISTER said that some six important White Papers would need

to be^jrifjjl-ished before the end of the year.    It was important that their

publi&lt;?a^Sn should be spaced out and in particular that two White Papers

should irtx/^rompete for attention in the same week.

2.      THE MINISTER OF^#jfE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE

(MRS CHALKER) said tha^ x k inquest in Gibraltar on the deaths of three

Irish Republican Army 8^?&amp;nyists on 6 March would probably conclude on

30 September or very earlv/^pk following week.    There were indications

of differing views within^HjevViry.    While there was still a significant

chance of a finding of jusBs^i^api  homicide,  the possibility that the

outcome would be an open verd-flesOyps thus greater than had earlier

seemed the case.    Draft statelwnT^j^for use in either eventuality had

been prepared by officials and vdWd^be submitted to the Ministers

primarily concerned.    Media cove^age^f the inquest had on the whole

been acceptable, with the major exo^Mm of the Thames Television

programme,  &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, which^OTlowing recent revelations

would be the subject of a major inteJ^rSl^yiquiry to be reported to the

Independent Broadcasting Authority in d^^j^urse.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH^JSSICE said that the

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would be merftingythe Iranian Foreign

Minister, Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, in New York oivSjCKSe^;ember. The

Government&apos;s objective remained to re-establish afferLalsh Embassy in /

Tehran.    It was hoped to use the 30 September meetiw^se finalise

agreement on this.    If the meeting was successful itry&lt;j&gt;rf&amp;. in theory be

possible to reopen the British Embassy within twenty-*J$rfr^Wours. Talks

between British and Iranian officials had begun in GenevaMMrt

27 September.    The Iranian side were making rather heavy^jkr^KWr of

these, arguing that they should be permitted to open a CofG^laye-General

in Manchester in exchange for allowing the British Embassy rrr^gvoen in

Tehran.    Should these talks fail due to Iranian obstinacy, tWf^oJpaign

and Commonwealth Secretary intended to put an ultimatum to Dr^^Wati


either to permit the United Kingdom to return its representation in

^Tehran to full Embassy status or to find a protecting power for the

&quot;Npresent Iranian mission in London.

Osft^ brief discussion, it was emphasised that the United Kingdom was not

&quot;\rj&gt;/jShe position of being a supplicant to Iran over normalisation of

&lt;^tpAj*Aatic relations and could not appear to be offering a quid pro quo

f^r/u&amp;yrelease of British hostages still held in Lebanon.    In view of

the^mbLc perception that Iran had some influence over the captors of

the homages, the current talks needed to be handled extremely

caref*&amp;^y

THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the

talks between Ir^S^nd Iraq were stalled although the ceasefire in the

Gulf was holding^    4&quot;other meeting between the parties would take place

in New York withrn^rraNfollowing few days.    Thereafter the talks would

probably be resume(c(yr/Geneva.    Iraq was still intransigent over freedom

of navigation in tn&amp;^g&amp;A and clearance of the Shatt-al-Arab. The

United Nations SecreraYp^SWieral, Mr Perez de Ceullar, was seeking a

compromise but this miVfrfT^eke some time to achieve.

THE MINISTER OF&apos;STATE,  FORE I G^TaV^COMMON WEALTH OFFICE said that there

was compelling circumstantial eo^dfemce, albeit not fully proven, that

Iraq had used chemical weapons aaafi^re&lt;t\ the Kurdish community there. It

appeared that such weapons had beenjrf^d, in a scattered manner and that

tear gas had also been employed toM!ndM e additional panic amongst the

victims.    The Government had request^&amp;^jHC^ndependent United Nations

investigation.    Iraq had refused this^&amp;y Turkey had also proved

reluctant.    There was nevertheless a nevp^o keep up the pressure of

condemnation in order to deter any futur\\use of chemical weapons.

Multilateral action was the most effective.    The United States Congress

was still considering sanctions against Iraq.    The United States

Administration would oppose this and employ a ve^^-^pver Congress if

necessary.    The sensitivity of the Iraqi Government}) to world opinion

suggested the condemnation had had its intendedN^e^^er&lt;^

THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE^*t$^that the

term of office of President Gemayel had ended on 23 Sep tejpfce^&apos;Wi thou t a

successor being appointed.    There were now in effect two Imuran)

governments,  that of the Christian Prime Minister, General^gJm^Nwho had

been appointed at the eleventh hour by Mr Gemayel, and that rfv&apos;Wv^

previous caretaker Muslim Prime Minister, Selim Hoss, backed l\V^JJj yia.

There was growing de facto partition in Lebanon.    The risk of Syf^ipV

proxy military pressure on Christian Beirut was high.&apos;   The Gover4 enO&apos;\


line was to maintain contacts with both the rival governments while

stressing that these contacts had no implications for their competing

&gt;   claims.    Other European Community countries endorsed this approach,

 \which had also been adopted by the United States.    The Americans

))remained in touch with the Syrians but the prospects of a compromise

^Wtween the Christians and the Muslims to elect a President looked

o^^jiMeasingly bleak.    These developments carried no direct implications

\&gt;ttjf/the British hostages.    The British Embassy were still in contact

w^pr^aaders in Beirut.    The situation, and its implications for British

d^Jlojira^ and their families, was being kept under close and continuous

^pan

THE MINIS^R OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the

condition of Emperor Hirohito of Japan was stable but critical. His

death might be imminent.    The Crown Prince had taken over the Emperor&apos;s

official respon/^STVities.    The funeral would take place 40 to 50 days

after the Empersjtis^d^ath.    Existing agreed contingency plans provided

for the United Kin|g/Iom)jto be represented at the funeral by a senior

member of the Roya^-Pa^iSy and by a Cabinet Minister.    The death of

Emperor Hirohito wou$ ^rj^ial the end of an era in Japan, but was

unlikely to have seriqu^J^jSfect on Japan&apos;s domestic and international

policies since the Empef^eTrV Ji^role was now purely symbolic.

In discussion,  it was poirm&amp;eyuit that British representation at the

funeral of the Emperor woul^-^Jj^d to be handled with great sensitivity

given not only the current imrfiai^pce of relations with Japan but also

the strong feelings on the pal^t j^Othose members of the British public

who had direct experience or metpozx^ of Japan&apos;s wartime role and her

treatment of prisoners.    It was j^por^Sant to find out quickly the

intentions of other friendly governaJ^ffM,^ as to representation at the

funeral, particularly the United StaLe^^ the old Dominions and key

European partners, especially those Sfrtti^Ebyal Heads of State such as

the Netherlands.    The United Kingdom nejeped^to be broadly in line with

major partners on this question. \&lt;T

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, reporting on  e annual meeting of the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Worldvffijrfjf^aid that the

general atmosphere had been calm, with the world ^\onopv in reasonable

shape and the US Presidential elections ahead.    HeS J  nad a bilateral

discussion with the United States Treasury Secretary^Mfa^ft. whom he

judged likely to retain his position if Mr Bush became^PJr^sNLdent.

Mr Brady had made clear that he would maintain the polrciVs^f his

predecessor, Mr Baker, in relation to international finaq $5  \

cooperation.   Mr Brady had also indicated that after the !( Es&lt;jiyentia 1

election he would wish to get to grips with the problems or^-^Se^Onited


r

States budget deficit, although he did not indicate what action he

proposed to take.    The Group of Seven meeting, preceded by an

unpublicised meeting of the Group of Five, had produced a satisfactory

communique.

&apos;ViContinuing, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, following the

^^scussion at the Toronto Summit, detailed arrangements for dealing with

?M;r&amp; problem of Sub-Saharan debtors had been worked out in the Paris

^he Germans had been holding up general agreement, but following

^pyj^s^re put on them during the present meeting, the agreement had now

bWn j^oncluded, with the Germans opting for the same technique of

red(jjc^ng\interest rates as we had chosen.   A difficult position had,

howev^^- risen in relation to the position of middle income debtors.

At a &lt;e^5^4ate stage in the Toronto Summit, the Japanese had produced

long an^^foroorate proposals in this area which there had not been time

to discu^fc.    On the eve of the present meeting, the Japanese had again

brought forward a complex scheme.    The United States Government were

suspicious of the proposals which in their view appeared to transfer

risk from the prpiate to the public sector.    The outcome was that the

Japanese propos/ lTy\which in the .absence of the Japanese Finance

Minister had be^ yp  sented by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, had

been reflected in/ks\\igle tentatively worded paragraph. Nevertheless

the problem had noCr^w^ away.    In particular there was the danger of a

Japanese alliance wic f^&gt;J)e French.    It was not unlikely that President

Mitterrand, on the oc(a^ X of his visit to the United Nations later in

the year, would produc^a^ jjnitiative on similar lines.    The Japanese

initiative might well re i j^\both their wish to cut a figure on the

international stage and CH^pnAssure on them from Japanese banks.

However,  there were a numbei^JE^alternat ive ideas available for market

based solutions, including ira5X a\ed use of the secondary market.

In a brief discussion it was notVp^hat there had been recent

indications that the French autrKrciM^a had been opening up their market

to Japanese companies for the firia e and substantial investments had

been negotiated.    While both the Un^^a^JCingdom and Germany had

attracted such inward investment in^MpTpast, we had not hitherto had to

face the problem of French based compe^o^on.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thaY in the course of the meeting,

the Chairman of the World Bank, Mr Conable, had announced the conclusion

of an agreement with Argentina.    Such an agreeme-ot would normally be

backed by an IMF programme and the proposals ttfatOrlso not yet been

approved by the Bank Board.    This had led to a^i^ute between

Monsieur Camdessus and Mr Conable and the matternwou)ud have to be

resolved in due course in the Bank/Fund Boards. VZ^^O

3.      THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that at

its meeting on 26 September the Foreign Affairs Council had not found it

possible to agree the draft mandate for the Lome negotiations.

Outstanding points would need to be resolved before the opening session

von 12-13 October.    The Council had approved a statement on the recent

^/United States Trade Act.    Despite the inclination of the French and

/^alians for a more confrontational approach, the agreed text had

&apos;pitched the United Kingdom wish for a firm but balanced

^^/-protectionist message.    The Foreign Secretary, in his meeting with

t^fK^Bvited States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz,  in New York

wcmld^tt^derline the importance in the context of the GATT Uruguay Round

of ^re-^onsible Administration approach.    The EC/Hungary trade and

econc3*fj&gt;^Cboperation agreement had been signed in the margins of the

CouncrTvyTh^ Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Marjai, had expressed his

gratituae/ or the role played by the United Kingdom in the negotiation

of an agreement and the interest taken by the Prime Minister in this

issue following Mr Grosz&apos;s visit to London last May.    The message which

the Prime Minister had sent to Mr Grosz earlier in the week had been

published in all/^ h^ Hungarian newspapers.

THE CHANCELLOR OF Trir^k&amp;EQUER, reporting on the informal meeting of

the Economic and Finarl^J^eaVtnci 1 on 16-18 September said that the

unhelpful press accounts &lt;yf/ he discussion of indirect tax

approximation had reflect^d^J^iefing by the Commission and in particular

Lord Cockfield.    However ra^suWstance the meeting had in fact gone well.

He had presented a very thoYorahvpaper outlining a market based approach

to the problem and reflectingv&lt;^we&gt;view that increased cross border

shopping would encourage appro*^mAt^)n of taxation without the necessity

for central harmonisation by the/cpmmission.    The subsequent discussion

had concentrated on this paper ana i^issues presented in it. The

meeting had only addressed Lord Cocxfj^&amp;d&apos;s paper, seeking answers to

detailed questions on the implementa^^esC^f the Commission&apos;s proposals,

in its concluding minutes.    Luxembourgvttad^een the only member state to

support the United Kingdom&apos;s approach nfo&amp;zhe other member states all

had difficulties with the Commission&apos;s proposals and Denmark had

described them as unacceptable.    The other nine member states had

regarded the United Kingdom&apos;s paper as a substantial and constructive

contribution.    While they had accepted the Commission approach in

principle it clearly caused them major difficun/tiejs&apos; for economic policy

and revenue reasons, and also in political term*X&lt;3fre Commission&apos;s

proposals on excise duties, where there were mucrUgj^eater national

variations than in respect to value added tax rates-jx aised particular

difficulties.    At the conclusion of the meeting, Iryy\

Monsieur Delors had accepted that the United Kingdom *^s/p^p&amp;r remained on

the table. The Commission had been asked to produce propCra^s amended in

the light of the views expressed during the meeting and &lt;j&amp;r  *0sf

bilateral exchanges to take place subsequently with membeixsjra^es  It

seemed inconceivable that while Lord Cockfield remained Comffi^s^noner any


satisfactory proposals would be brought forward: revised proposals were

likely to reflect only minor changes and so would be unacceptable. It

would be sensible for the United Kingdom to play this issue long in the

^   hope that a new Commissioner would approach it with a fresh mind..

THE M^^SJER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at its meeting

on 26%2^ eptember the Agriculture Council had had a first discussion of

the proVj af^&gt;resented by a judgment of the European Court of Justice

that farmers who had temporarily come out of milk production under a

1984 voluntary scheme should not have been denied any allocation of milk

quotas.    The decision presented some unwelcome issues, and the Council

would need to return to the problem on a future occasion.    There had

also been a dia^rfsaion of agriculture&apos;s place in the Uruguay Round. He

had had some prALimnflry exchanges on this issue with

Commissioner Andrferlfseyi and had underlined the need for a further

Community input iS^tJ^SATT discussions were to be successful.    He had

expected a difficult^dy^Ke on this issue in the Council.    In the event,

however, the French MilJ^ifVr of Agriculture, who had recently visited

the United States, hadC*lkd*Lup a much more open position than in the

past.    Only the German Mip^&amp;er had taken the view that the Community

should stand pat on the r^OTiM already agreed.    There was a clear wish

for further debate at a la^gjr^Jduncil in October or November.    Given the

nature of the debate on the rf&amp;eVwit occasion, this presented a less

unwelcome prospect than mighrwia^Je/ been expected.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FIS^lEluS^i AND FOOD said that the Council

had also considered a paper produ^ia m\ the Commission on the future of

the rural world which sought to take^toxk of the wider issues presented

by changes in agriculture.    Against ^fi^^&gt;ackground that agriculture

could not play an expanding role in wo^dj^production, it was clear that

there would need to be substantial adjustments.    We would need to be on

our guard against pressure for expenditure on other activities, both

within the agricultural budget and elsewhere.   There had finally been

discussion of the implications of prospective underspending of the

agriculture budget.    This had reflected not onyy-yhe impact on world

prices of the drought in the United States bui\ h4 -ef fects of the

reforms of the CAP already agreed and management/^avwngs in the dairy

sector.    Some member countries were looking for a^ j  a*at ion of the

pressure on expenditure.    It had been possible on ^Jpis/^pcas ion to fight

off such approaches.    In a brief discussion it was rim^KVith

satisfaction that recent changes in the dollar rate v&amp;tyyean that the

first activation of the monetary reserve would be in a narj&amp;rive

direction. y\
