1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

Terrorist

Incident at

Lisburn

\$dOPRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to record their

Mfaprjjfc at the killing of six soldiers in Lisburn, County Antrim, the

pfa^vitfve day in a car-bomb attack for which the Provisional Irish

ReHjJ&amp;H&amp;an Army had claimed responsibility.    The Secretary of State for

Nortb^rffjxeland would make a statement to the House of Commons on the

sub jeS^j^Ter that day.

The Housing

Bill

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that an arrrangement had been

made with the Orooaition through the usual channels for the remaining

stages of the nkusJjLc Bill in the House of Commons to be concluded on

the previous daypnf^rhat, in the event, the Opposition had not honoured

this agreement.    xhisVxSs only the second time in the present Parliament

that the Opposition^kyfailed to observe such an understanding reached

through the usual chaim Jw\ and it was far more serious than the earlier

occasion which had bee^J/T&amp;MFibutable to an oversight by the Opposition

Business Managers.    The D^jfow Leader of the Labour Party, Mr Roy

Hattersley, had alleged ro rfiW\ press that it had been implied that the

Government would not act c^-jpjj^sease the financial assistance to

Opposition Parties (Short morf ^J\ynless the Labour Party honoured its

undertaking on the Housing BJAr^jQWhile the Opposition had never been

left in doubt that an increasevfj^jSftpr t money would be unpopular with

Government supporters and that ty&gt;e^A\ympathy would not be increased by

what had happened on the Housing Bj^fM. Mr Hattersley1 s account was a

gross misrepresentation, which he courtly repudiated.    The behaviour of

the Opposition had, in fact, been lSjj23rtr due to groups of Members

representing mining interests, who weoe/c&gt;fJposed to the North

Killingholme Cargo Terminal Bill, whicV^fad been on the Order Paper as

Opposed Private Business on the previoua^day.   The incident was,

therefore, a further illustration of the inability of the Labour Party

leadership to control its members.    Despite these difficulties, it

remained highly desirable to maintain good woe#Jh$v relations with the

Opposition, since a high proportion of essential wsiness was taken, by

agreement, off the floor of the House.    If thoVeV^rr^angements broke

down, Government business on the floor of the )iad ^/vpuld be much

increased and frequent timetable motions would beSeSabssary to secure

it.    While there was no doubt about the Government^s/&gt;KM^ity to obtain

its business at the end of the day, Opposition back-^j fwwrs had now

sampled the disruption that they could cause and a diffix^ft. period

might lie ahead.    In these circumstances, he believed iv^p^Md be best

to allow a cooling-off period until 27 June before the HoiusVAonsidered

the timetable motion that would now be necessary for the HcSflTi^A Bill.

The North Killingholme Cargo Terminal Bill would again appewr/&apos;As^ppposed

Private Business in the following week, and the Business had &lt;b^dV^

arranged so that the time allotted to it would not be in jeopa^iy^^^


THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that the

Government would never use the level of financial assistance to

\ Opposition Parties as a bargaining counter in the way that had been

^suggested in the press.    A connection between the two subjects might

/&lt;f&gt;Aver the less be mischieviously inferred if they were considered by the

,  o se of Commons on the same day, and it might be better for the two

sVpy6h  8 of business to be separated.    The Lord President of the Council

arrotflxk consider, with this point in mind, whether the motion on

fin&gt;*f rv)al assistance to Opposition Parties should be taken early in the

foKo&gt;j i*g week.

^l^^a^inet -

l.^^Invited the Lord President of the Council to

proceed as the Prime Minister had indicated.

Value Added

Tax

THE CHANCELLOR 0 if       ./EXCHEQUER said that the European Court of Justice

were expected to sawwie their judgment early the following Tuesday on

a long-running Valuer Afid&amp;d Tax (VAT) zero-rate infraction case relating

to the construction N  (mv and a number of other matters. The

Advocate General&apos;s opnfiohy^jfhich had been made public in the previous

December, had accepted U^j^^\Kingdom zero-rating for domestic

construction but had heldy^gaXjbst the Government on non-domestic

construction and certain owMCr^matters.    The Government were legally

obliged to give effect to tM^VP^tt&apos;s judgment, although there would

clearly not be sufficient tim^^/introduce the necessary legislation in

the present Session.    The Court//^arcis ion was not yet know but, on past

experience, it was likely to foMoyOfeKe Advocate General&apos;s opinion and,

if so, he believed that, in orderv^o&gt;^move uncertainty, it would be

necessary for the Government to mak^^-Hrtatement in the House of Commons

on the following Tuesday announcing TT^irAt intended to take forward the

matters concerned.   The judgment was Ifoana to be controversial and would

require sensitive handling. &gt;X

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

figures for May would be published that day.    The seasonally adjusted

&gt; totals had fallen by 38,000 to 2.416 million.   This was the 22nd

/consecutive month in which unemployment had declined, which was the

vi\ngest continuous period of falling unemployment since the Second World

^ajk    The unadjusted total for May had fallen by 109,000 and

^jmrnployment had now fallen by a little over 500,000 since the General

Mmos, contrary to predictions which the Labour Party had made that

tfn&apos;emjp^yment would rise after the Election.   All regions had benefitted,

wiMi thj^ largest reductions occuring in the West Midlands, the North

West^fch^North and Wales.   A particularly encouraging feature was that

unemployment among school leavers had fallen by 53,000 since the

previoiwC^ey and now stood at the lowest level since May 1980. The

number ofXunfilled vacancies had risen slightly in May and it was

estimated that there were 700,000 vacancies in the economy as a whole.

Figures would also be published that day on the number of working days

lost to industri^rKdisputes in the 12 months up to April 1988.    It was

provisionally /((tinted that 2.3 million days had been lost during that

period compared^BitjC^.5 million in the previous 12 months and an

average of 11 milanoiyjover the previous 10 years.    The only unwelcome

development was tM^^re had been a further increase of V4 per cent

in average earningsy^^^/4 per cent.    This partly reflected higher

bonuses and, in the a&amp;g&amp;^aii the public sector, the generous pay awards

for nurses and for loc l^i pbhority manual workers.

Trade

Statistics

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQ0^^*2id that revised trade statistics for

the first quarter of 1988 woufny^^wblished that day.    The estimated

overall deficit for that period ^tfad^Iken revised from  2 billion to

 23/4 billion,  X/4 bill ion of wh cn J?&amp;s attributable to a higher

deficit on visible trade and the ro^^iag  $ billion to a lower than

projected surplus on invisible trade&lt;\J^nese estimates would be subject

to further revisions, but it was alredV^tear that the overall deficit

for that year would be higher than the\ orecast of  4 billion which he

had made at the time of the Budget.    Th&lt;r economy was moving ahead faster

than he had forecast at the time of the Budget, with a boom in

investment by business and industry and a confirming increase in

consumption.   Economic policy needed to be selVbyVteference to a broad

view of monetary and fiscal policy and movemevjcaJfo-^exchange rates, and

it would be wrong to react precipitately to tradje^rflaures as they became

available, especially since they were subject tovjMra^fyierable

adjustments.   Nevertheless, bearing in mind both t#e^/cAle of the

corrections that proved necessary and the size of tlre^^ancing item,

which reflected the discrepancy between estimated ind&amp;fi^ELows and

estimated capital flows, it was necessary to re-examine Jttt *&amp;ay in which

these and other economic statistics were collected.   A Myfew of this

matter was therefore already in hand.    The latest trade isfcgJjp^Xhad t0

be seen in the context of the cumulative current account stf piu&amp; of

 2l  billion which had been earned between 1980-87 when the^afc an&apos;s

currency reserves had been at record levels. ^/^^&lt;\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Community Charge

^    Registration Officer for Strathclyde had announced the previous day that

fnt of persons canvassed had submitted completed returns for the

charge register, out of 830,000 households, only 5,000 people

ed outright to provide the information requested and in due

ny of those would doubtless agree to co-operate. These

which were typical of experience elsewhere in Scotland, and

Id improve further before the end of the canvass period, were

y encouraging since the Labour Party had mounted a campaign

ting on Strathclyde promoting obstruction of the registration

-It could now be confidently predicted that the registration

proceS-eir^M Scotland would be completed satisfactorily.

Football

Hooliganism

THE PRIME MINISTEH^&amp;^dk that the involvement of British football

supporters in serioA^jy/Loting at the European Football Championships in

Germany earlier that A^^k\was merely the most recent episode to

demonstrate the growi^^v&amp;p^ial evil of football hooliganism. Further

action was undoubtedly ca&gt;j2d for on a number of fronts.    While British

club teams remained prorM&amp;j^eyl from participation in European events,

overseas matches between\ai^m&gt;al teams were becoming a battleground,

with widespread disturbancefr^fi^he streets.   Since it did not appear

practicable in the short ter .^?^&amp;8e the issue of passports to prevent

disorderly British football s&lt;prorc iprs from travelling abroad, it would

be necessary to consider whethe^^nS^nglish football team ought to

cease taking part in internationaJ^dmpetition for a period.   At home,

the preservation of order inside rop^all grounds had been much improved

since the Popplewell Reports in 198-^~Si fr 1986, though limiting entry to

registered club members, and the accommodation of all spectators in

numbered seats were matters that woula^oeed to be reconsidered. Alcohol

was very clearly a major factor in disturbances in the areas surrounding

football grounds, and it would be necessary to review the use that

magistrates had made of the powers they had been given to control the

sale of alcohol in these areas.   On the basis/tfi^previous experience,

the football authorities would only tackle tr/e^se (problems with energy if

strong pressure were applied to them.    The Gov^rfmette should therefore

draw up a clear plan of action and be prepared (hjAvite Parliament to

endorse it. **&gt;v/

In discussion the following main points were made

a.     The certainty of conviction and adequate punirj&amp;mjMTt must be

the greatest deterrent to hooliganism, but there we^VroMems in

securing evidence that was sufficient to justify conVt^Wwi for the

graver offences that were likely to be in question.   XAevo/34ice had

put much effort into undercover work aimed at conspirac^jjajfyca

organise disturbances, but the collapse of three recent


Metropolitan Police cases had been a setback in this.    The Home

\ Secretary proposed to take steps to improve police intelligence

Hv on this aspect.    Once a violent disturbance developed, it was

X/\ notoriously difficult for the police on the ground simultaneously

fji to maintain order and to equip themselves with evidence against

vr^^X     particular individuals.

\&gt;Syll b      Police forces in other countries faced the same difficulties

our own in securing evidence to support convictions for the

v^^crever public order offences.    Instead of being in real fear of

&lt;Xrartign courts imposing substantial prison terms, which might then

&lt;^^&amp;erved in British prisons, football holligans going to matches

mna did not, in practice, risk more than a night in the cells,

wh^fr^tney regarded as a battle honour.

c. ^*he intiative by Luton Football Club to restrict spectatorship

at their home matches to their own members had succeeded in

preserving order, so that these matches were enjoyed as family

occasions /vn^nhe neighbourhood.    Such a solution would, howver, be

vehementlyvojm fted by most other clubs.

d. The pero^raptfh by many Europeans of British visitors as

drunken and diq^a4^.y louts had too much substance for comfort,

and was a growing^iraVlem in our international relations.

e. Although attemp&gt;^?right be made to take the debate into

broader social issue^/iY\ was important to deal with the specific

problems of footballN^jgOTfler, since this was reasonably well

defined and had a par tiwm) importance of its own.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing upM^L^Ks cuss ion, said that the Cabinet

were agreed that the Government (pfioulH. take a further initiative against

football hooliganism in the light^crpcent disturbances in connection

with matches both home and abroad.  v*Jjr ters requiring further

consideration included the sale of a&lt;J?S^yl, the conditions for admission

to football grounds, and foreign traveXMJ^both teams and supporters.

The effectiveness of police intelligenc^arrangements against football

hooliganism also needed to be improved, vhe Cabinet had had a useful

discussion of these matters.    She would now proceed to consider them in

more detail with the Ministers most closely concerned, and would bear in

mind the points that Cabinet colleagues had mad ~\\

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it remained

necessary to counter suspicions,  fostered by the press, that the

^Government was seeking to negotiate with Iran a deal leading to release

))of hostages.    Negotiations on compensation for damage to diplomatic

/B^emises in Iran and London ended on 10 June with Iranian acceptance

&quot;^Jittt the Government&apos;s proposals offered a good basis for settlement. It

^w^Zd however be important to obtain adequate guarantees that the

Ty*r rxas would indeed use the money paid to them to rebuild their

Enrb^as^\at 16 Princes Gate, London.   There had been various signs

recwtLj^that Iran wished to improve the atmosphere bilaterally.   A visa

had bj gj&gt;&lt;ftsued to the brother of one British subject imprisoned in

Iran, ^^rasular access had been granted to another.   After the Iranian

attack wyy&amp;fi. Esso tanker &quot;Demetia&quot; the Iranian Charge d*Affaires, in

response&gt; o a strong British protest on 13 June, had not attempted to

deny Iranian responsibility but had said that the attack was

unauthorised and an inquiry was being undertaken.   These indications had

fuelled press sp^eulation about improvement in United Kingdom/Iranian

relations.    ButZ/fhenpress did probably now understand that the release

in May of an IrVgjair^errorist, Mr Nouripoor, from prison in this

country had been frfrejeoincidence, since the man had completed his

sentence with minimnf&amp;^^nission.

Lambeth Palace, in re^p *r*k to an approach from Iran, had persuaded four

Members of Parliament, &lt;Mr\C il Townsend, Mr Robert Hicks, Lord Tordoff

and Mr Tom Clarke, to go JrJx^Kan from 19 to 22 June to see the Speaker

of the Iranian Parliament f^frjAli Akbar Rafsanjani.    The Government had

delivered the strongest caot&amp;jH^p Lambeth Palace about the risks

involved in such a visit. It^aVwpt possible to prevent these Members

of Parliament going to Iran, vM^f-bey were aware that they would be

doing so without the Governmenc^// Vouragement or approval.

In discussion, it was noted that trJ&gt;eV j i t might well be misinterpreted

by the media as evidence that the Ui^^ejL-Kingdom was ready to negotiate

over hostages.   The Government&apos;s publ^M^ane should therefore bring out

clearly that it had warned against theg^j^ix which it regarded as most

unwise.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said tri^ L second round of

legislative elections in France on 12 June had p*&apos; Iuafed a hung

Parliament.   The Socialists were slightly ahead oJ -^4pe&apos;SRight Wing

parties.   The Communists had retained 27 seats and^H^/N tional Front

one.   Monsieur Michel Rocard was remaining as Prime Mup&lt;4Xer and his

strategy would be to look for additional support from^&amp;hA^wentre of the

political spectrum.   This would not make France easier tp^real with in

Counci 1

13 June

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there njid^fen a useful

meeting of the Economic and Finance Council.   The t^ x^b/ad been agreed

of the Inter-Institutional Agreement on budget disci r ($ \negotiated

between the Presidency, the Commission and the Europea^rN&amp;avliament. In

a number of areas this had been reinforced by unanimous &amp;Jj*J&gt;cil

statements confirming our interpretation of the European^eetanicjil

conclusions.    The Agreement was conditional on the Europe^g^%r,liament

accepting the Own Resources sub-ceilings and the text of th^w&lt;%et

discipline decision.    He said that the major achievement of^ch&amp;^j^eting

had been agreement on the directive on liberalisation of capiwfyV^

movements.   This required abolition of exchange controls throug^etu^ie


?    Community by 1990 subject to a derogation for Spain and Ireland

2  permitting implementation in 1992 and a similar provision for Greece and

/yPortugal delaying implementation if necessary until 1995.    The French

-^Vb^d been extremely difficult in the discussions, seeking to stipulate as

^-^jf^re-condition for exchange control abolition that there should be

N^rrarl&amp;onisation of taxation of savings.    They believed that in the absence

&lt;3&gt;fA6u h arrangements there would be a massive flight of capital and loss

of^ta^revenue to the French authorities.    He had resisted any such

pre^mivition.   But a face-saving agreement had been reached on studies

coveri^g^such matters as possible measures to reduce risks of tax

evasf^n*^?proposals would be put to the Council, but the Council was

only reouynpe^l to take a position on them and any action would require

unanimitr^^A particular cause for satisfaction in the agreement was

that the \972 directive, which in principle required the existence of

exchange control powers, and in which the United Kingdom had been in

breach, had been swept away.   Agreement on the directive would cement

progress to the/^Shzle market.    It underlined that European development

should take thef(for$ of liberalisation and deregulation rather than

harmonisation arrcF^eg^Klation.   The agreement might be expected to put
