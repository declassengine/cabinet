1.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, although the

^Employment Training programme was being established on the basis of a

,An\animous recommendation, which the Government had accepted in full, by

?&lt;$y^Training Commission, on which the Trades Union Congress (TUC) was

^re^^sented by 3 Commissioners, the TUC had the previous week voted to

&lt;K^Tifd&lt;paw support from Employment Training and to institute a policy of

ncn^rfo&amp;yeration.    The Training Commission were due to oversee Employment

Traii^fgv. but it would now clearly be intolerable for the TUC to be

represented on the body with responsibility for the programme.

Moreov^r^tjiere were 58 local area Manpower boards, with 5 trades unions

members \vC pc\\, of whom one third were Chairmen of the Boards. While

he had ncriowers to remove the TUC Commissioners in response to the

decision wfyich the TUC had taken the previous week, he was empowered to

take back functions of the Commission into his Department. Colleagues

most closely concerned had therefore agreed that the powers of the

Training Commissi^SaNshould be transferred to his Department and that a

new agency within        Department should be established to oversee

Employment TrainvHiAj^--^t seemed likely that,  if those steps were not

taken, the TUC wout^J^ave their Commissioners in place for the present

but would withdraw ttpM)Wt a time advantageous to them.   The steps he

proposed would enablejf&gt;&lt; ^overnment to concentrate its efforts on

better local training,vwfj^\was a development favoured both by the

Confederation of Britisn iwd^Jtry and by the Association of British

Chambers of Commerce.    Th^xWpvwere deeply divided over their attitude

to Employment Training:  thMWas a risk that some trade unions would

withdraw support from the prtrz^Prme, but he believed that a number of

unions would continue to co-ojrer tjKat national level and that more

would do so at local level.   He^CTyor^dingly proposed to announce later

that day that the functions of th/Z^jfining Commission, including

Employment Training, would be taken b^c^ within his Department and that

legislation would be introduced in Vue^Surse to abolish the Commission.

In announcing those steps, he would lC ^k-^ *rward to the proposals on

training which would be set out in th^w^re. Paper which he proposed to

publish later in the year and would askv^^the co-operation of

individual trades unions and trade unionists in making Employment

Training a success.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussiop^-&gt;said that the Cabinet

agreed that the functions of the Training CommijSiSiora should be exercised

by the Department of Employment, that an early v^JVsraXive opportunity

should be taken to abolish the Commission and that//xha^Secretary of

State for Employment should announce those measureNcdu^Y that day.

The Cabinet - ^^^^

1.     Agreed that the functions of the Training Commia^rvjaryshould be

exercised instead by the Department of Employment, wi*fr,/tna

Commission being abolished as soon as possible, and tirag^SraN.

Secretary of State for Employment should make an announoMMc^to

that effect later that day. v&gt;^//

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment figures

I for August would be published that day.   The seasonally adjusted total

^had fallen by 45,400 to 2.267 million.    This was the 25th consecutive

^monthly reduction, which was by far the longest continuous period of

Vf^Aling unemployment since records had been kept.   Unemployment had

^aikn by 655,000 since the General Election.   All areas had benefitted,

wfefrnwie largest reductions having occurred in the West Midlands, the

Nozi&amp;fyeat, Wales and the North.    The rate of unemployment had fallen to

8 per,^ent which was below the average for the European Community as a

whoM -arf3} in particular, below the rates in France, Belgium, the

NetheryMns^ Spain and the Republic of Ireland.   There were 240,000

unfille4^acancies at job centres and it was estimated that there were

about 70\^000 vacancies in the economy as a whole.   A cause of concern

was that average earnings had risen again and now stood at 9 per cent.

The increase partly reflected higher overtime payments and bonuses,

together with t&gt;j Nfull effect of the nurses&apos; settlement, but some of the

settlements wr/vch Wad been reached over the previous 12 months had

clearly been exc^s^xS^e.    Recent settlements of 5.6 per cent for local

authority manual[torUAts and 5.4 per cent for Health Service ancilliary

workers gave some^e SK^ for optimism about future settlements in other

parts of the publicVsye^^&amp;r.

The Economy

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHE?$J&amp;fc^aid that the economy was essentially

very strong with high rates vrf^rawth and of productivity and

with non-oil exports at recoro^ayels.    Business confidence was very

high, and this had helped to cr&amp;e^^A boom in investment. However,

there had been a massive increaseip^rmports and a slight but

significant acceleration in domes^rc assumption.    Interest rates had

accordingly been raised with the ai^J^^^-damping down domestic demand.

Interest rate adjustments, far from vsfoug the crude mechanism that some

critics have alleged, were in fact a pyra^rarly appropriate instrument

since the building and construction securer, which was the part of the

economy that was most severely overheatea, was highly responsive to

changes in interest rates and there were indeed already some signs that

demand in the housing market had been success fuLLydamped down. The

recent increases in interest rates could also e^e pected to have a

fairly rapid impact on savings, which had f alr^o. m&gt;ckedly in recent

months as a proportion of national income, and oa/cohAumer demand.

However, it was bound to take some time for inter^  &gt;^4 e adjustments to

make an impact on the balance of trade deficit and Qayya^ important to

avoid giving the impression that an early reduction rtr^mV. deficit could

be expected.   There was no difficulty about financing^tt^i^ade deficit

provided that the markets remained confident that the Gove^&amp;kent was

pursuing the correct policies.    The present situation, vnwjflyjas

characterised by a high level of confidence, both at home^od^ bsroad, in

the economy and by a low propensity to save, was quite unlikexwaj

during the periods of current account deficits in the 1960s a^dYi^frOs.

He had warned publicly the previous day that inflation was gra ddt)&amp;

edging up.    He expected that.it would fall again some time in  \\$S V\


following year.   The Retail Price Index (RPI) for August would greately

v\exaggerate the increase in the underlying rate of inflation as a result

y/of the inclusion in the RPIU of mortgage interest payments. The

/^ftOTtgage rate had risen by 1        percentage points in the previous month

^T^en^Kthat increase alone would raise the RPI by 0.7 per cent.    No other

H^J*Aop. country except Canada included mortgage interest payments in their

r/^wlN. price indices.    Pensioners were among those who would benefit

from/^h!^ recent increases in interest rates both because increases in

the^old^Sge pension were linked to increases in the RPI and because old

age p^CTi*jfi^ers had a high propensity to save than the population as a

whole ^~y/s\

In discu&amp;Aion, the following main points were made:

a. Although productivity was increasing strongly, unit labour

costs contip/ *d to rise, albeit slowly, whereas those in our major

competitor/s&apos;; including the United States, Japan and France, were in

some perio\igy  JtMn8 

b. The growOT^*Othe economy had greatly strengthened the

negotiating posvPryLbar^ of trades unions and some employers had been

willing to conce^f^raoessive wage increases rather than to risk the

disruption to pro fc^jm which would result from industrial action.

However, at a time ai^J*$&gt;ing costs and increased competition,

companies could not arvfooa to meet excessive wage demands and those

companies which follow^sIxpAdent policies would be best placed to

stand up to competition^&quot;&quot;^

c. The present high inteVe&apos;jpfe^ates were attracting substantial

investment from overseas.    fcomeANf our main competitors, notably

Japan, had banking mechanisms^mi^A assisted the Government to

control the total credit posityrfjp^njd there might be advantage in

seeking to introduce similar arCSSf^Sfients in this country. Against

that, the Japanese authorities operated in a totally different

culture in which they were able tovHTfluence by informal means the

activities of major financial institutions and it was clear that

such a system could not be made effective here.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,that the important

point to get across was that the Government woyttd Mike whatever steps

were necessary to ensure that the economy was kVpy^rjrvy balanced course.

As the Cabinet had agreed at their meeting on 14

(CC(88) 25.4), it would be vital to maintain a fira^^tjol of public

expenditure. C^Yv^

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the figures for notifiable

recorded by the police in England and Wales for the second qe&amp;rve^of

1988, published the previous day, underlined the trend that hety&amp;j/sy

reported to Cabinet in his memorandum on disorder in, rural areas/^&apos;&gt;\

(C(88) 9).:  The large fall in offences of burglary, and car&apos; theft^J^K!^


^.was most manifest in the cities with the highest number of these

-^y^ffences, had resulted in a reduction of the total number of recorded

_^^i*fences in the 12 months to June 1988 in comparison with the previous

^TO^onths.    That reduction in crimes against property, however, was

VdVpdftly offset by a continuing sharp increase in crimes of violence, to

WffjAyyhe press had predictably drawn particular attention.   Many of the

as^dlSsv that made up the bulk of violent crimes took place in the home

and^  ^we had indicated in his earlier report to the Cabinet, there was

a cleapyrink between violence and drunkenness.   An efficient and

adequa^jr^w^son system was one of the main components of the

GovernmenV^s^response to crime.    The prison population had increased so

as to taKe^up most of the space created by the increase in remission for

short sentence prisoners in July 1987, but the expanded prison building

programme remained on course.    The immediate preoccupation was with

industrial disputes in the prison service.    These reflected the

continuing abilit^^f the Prison Officers&apos; Association to frustrate, at

very little costf (to themselves, the long overdue efficiency savings and

management improv^Pb^lS^v that were embodied in the Fresh Start

arrangements.   He tos^/AAscussing the implications of this with his

colleagues most cloSTrt^^yoncerned.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that on the previous

^Monday the Post Office management had reached an agreement with the

ti unions for the postal workers to return to work on a basis that

have preserved management&apos;s position on all the main issues,

ling the question of regional payments.   About 100,000 out of the

staff of 140,000 had returned to work by the previous day, but a

\of main sorting offices including those in London, Liverpool,

ve^er and Glasgow, remained on strike.    The workers at 10 of the 14

soreing^ffices in London had concluded deals to return to work, but

were&lt;*p*jj3^ing to put them into effect until the remaining 4 London

officesy^Lsa fell into line.    Post Office management&apos;s tactics were to

concentVa^ron getting the London services back to normal, and to

isolate i&amp;e more militant trades unionists in Manchester, Liverpool and

Glasgow, where the unions were trying to extract a totally unacceptable

rate of overtime payment in return for their co-operation in clearing up

the back-log of&gt;h  strike.    He had previously decided that if an

agreement had datCyken reached early in the week he would have announced

an immediate srtq&amp;)*g&lt;m suspension of the Post Office monopoly for the

carriage of letterfiT J while that step would have been unlikely to lead

to the rapid emergks&amp;^bf any full alternative to the Post Office, the

public were now vel&amp;wprp of the inhibiting effect of the monopoly and

would not have under s  ^e X s continued application during the strike.

The Cabinet Ministers wrt^ Concerned, whom he had minuted on this

subject on 7 September, h&amp;fcyr^t dissented, and he proposed to act

quickly to introduce a sn wf-ft rm suspension of the letter monopoly if

events over the next few wRgjw^fjbould suggest that it would be

advantageous to do so.    He afl^wy^vited his colleagues to maintain the

contingency arrangements thau^u?^/ departments had made for their own

business until it was quite clvia/Ai^^at the postal services had returned

to normal. S\

Nurses&apos; Pay

Settlement

1

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said^fat the implementation of the

nurses&apos; pay settlement involved a massiv  and complex process of

regrading.   This process, which involved 190 district health authorities

and 14 regional health authorities in England, was still in train and he

was putting pressure on the authorities to iroj  5i&gt;t the anomalies that

had emerged between them, with the aim of get/(ng(phe new money into the

nurses&apos; pockets by Christmas.   A main obstacleNi^fcS^* timetable was the

attempt by the trades unions to renege on their ferigAnal agreement with

the settlement, and to revise it to their own advVirraatf.    In particular,

the unions were attempting to distort the creation VfiTSrJ&amp;ee new grades

of nursing sister, and were alleging that sisters wh   jc&gt;( aNiionally found

themselves in charge of wards were unfairly treated unaeVfl&gt;e

settlement.   These claims were totally false, and the G^^Jrowent should

not concede them.    If the payment of the new money to the^muwjjjes should

be delayed beyond the turn of the year, then the res pons ibSft^voshould

be firmly pinned on the unions&apos; attempt to rewrite the agreM^^tV* Above

all, the nurses&apos; pay settlement could not be costed until the^a^HLrading

exercise was completed, and allegations in the meantime that thV/^K

Government was not fully funding the settlement were factitiousV^^A

Iran/Iraq War

CC(88) 27.5

2\STWK PRIME MINISTER said that Iraq&apos;s attitude had created

diij^cuTties in securing a comprehensive peace settlement following the

cessa^rot^of hostilities between Iran and Iraq.   The Ira^&apos; Foreign

MinisCJ^^nr Tariq Aziz, was being particularly difficult on the

definitx/p^f national boundaries.    It was important that the United

Nations ^cretary General, Mr Perez de Cuellar, should continue to have

widespread support from the international community for his peace

efforts.    Intelligence reports strongly suggested that the Kurds had

been subjected by Iraq to attack by chemical weapons though it was not

yet possible to^wretotify these precisely.    This indicated the

ruthlessness oi\lrA&lt;L

Meanwhile the Uni^L^BJLagdom was cautiously rebuilding its relations

with Iran.    This ha3^ yh  done with great care and without prejudicing

the position over Bri/*Jtf &quot;hostages in Lebanon on whose behalf the

British Ambassador in^^r^ continued to work hard.    The United Kingdom

had throughout retained cjjjaj&amp;rcial relations with Iran and these were

now being given renewed C^ra-O^s with the despatch to Iran of a second

British official.    The agRAgjaeAt between the United Kingdom and Iran

covering the reciprocal renprtmroment of diplomatic premises at the

expense of the host country Nrasv}&gt;eNing implemented.

During her recent visit to the B&apos;rorfi&amp;n Gulf, she had seen the Armilla

Patrol at first hand and the remark^b&quot;^ performance of the young British

crew members there in the tanker escaping role.    The Royal Navy would

remain present in the Gulf until ovv^a-H^prospects were more certain,

together with the Belgian and NetheriMWSAontingents.    There was a

minesweeping role to be performed in ofa^forthern waters of the Gulf but

this would not extend for British minesweeping vessels to the

Shatt-al-Arab.

i Regional

Conflicts

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the situation with f spHt to Angola and

Namibia was very much better now that South Africstrr^^Aops had withdrawn

from Angola.   But large numbers of Cuban troops rem&gt;tile^there, and had

indeed increased, and a date had not yet been agreed jx$*^heir

departure.    It appeared that the Cuban President, Dr S&amp;ft^lM^astro, was

not particularly anxious to withdraw them since the paympjtt^fior their

services from Angolan oil revenue represented a valuable^eiunae of

income to Cuba.   The South Africans had so far behaved veiqcyj&amp;V

In Cyprus the overall situation was also somewhat better. jx^y

President, Mr George Vassiliou, had turned out to be easier td^aegri^with

than his predecessor.    He had already met the leadei* of the Turv**&amp;}\


Cypriot community, Mr Rauf Denktash, and it was clear that in personal

terms they got on well.    The United Nations Secretary General, Mr Perez

\de Ceullar, had so far handled matters very well.    Following the meeting

//between the representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot

/^namunities,  there was a basis to be^nj negotiations.

M^wKampuchea, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whom the Prime Minister had met

dvir rfg\her recent visit to the region, was having contacts with all

part^a^o the dispute.    The Russians had also been talking to the

Chiwese^^ A key factor was the need for Chinese firmness with the leader

of tH^3&amp;hjS&amp;r Rouge party, Pol Pot.    It was unthinkable that Pol Pot

shoulaxe4{ipo to Kampuchea after the genocide that he had perpetrated

there. yJ/^

THE PRIME MINIS/feR^Maid that the General Secretary of the Communist

Party of the SoN^t^finion, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had taken a very long

summer holiday andYit^appeared that during his absence there had been a

certain loss of coW3xfl %ver the reform movement, with hard-line

statements being macKpTw^wo Politburo members, Mr Ligachev and

Mr Chebrikov.    It was(jfyfg&amp;toTe good that he had now resumed full charge

in Moscow.    One area if &apos;n$ej^ms control field where Soviet behaviour

was still very unsatisfaci^r^yas that of chemical weapons.    The Soviet

Union was not being hones^&gt;rnd)\?as denying facts about its capability

that the United Kingdom knev^jxfte true.   Despite recent exchanges of

inspection teams between the^9wM Union and the United Kingdom, the

British inspectors had not bee^vi^eated with reciprocity and had been

kept out of certain buildings, VnM^^s the Soviet inspectors in the

United Kingdom had been permitteo^uL\\access.   This was a very

difficult subject, not least becau^^tn^ political atmosphere was

changing following the overt use of ^^mical weapons recently in the

Middle East. ^^^^&gt;

THE PRIME MINISTER said that whatever preferences there might be for one

or other of the candidates in the forthcoming W^rt^d States Presidential

Election, it was important that members of theUjovMrnment should keep

these to themselves and avoid public referencesi^^Cmk subject between

now and the Presidential Election.    The overridin\kjyg &gt;rity was that the

United Kingdom should continue to have a strong reT^HMship with the

United States thereafter. Jry \




THE PRIME MINISTER said that following her visit to Australia in August,

&gt; she was convinced that now was the time to step up British ties with

^Australia.    She had taken the line in her speeches there that Australia

} ad successfuly built its own nationhood; and that a new basis for

^ e\ations between the United Kingdom and Australia now existed which

v&lt;^wMjd extend into the next century and eclipse the old approach

\Jk^abrmined by the perception of Britain as the ex-Colonial power. The

Auae^a^ian Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, would be visiting the United

K&amp;fgdpm\n 1989 accompanied by other Australian Ministers.   The United

Kingla&amp;n^kould seek to sell more to Australia, especially defence

equipjj^jj^^

THE SECR&amp;W0W OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he too had

visited Australia, some three weeks after the Prime Minister, and could

vouch for tne great impact her visit had had on the Australian press as

well as the Federal and State Governments.    In trade the United Kingdom

had overtaken the^Eederal Republic of Germany to become Australia&apos;s

third largest si/wpTflar.    The United Kingdom had some $37 billion of

investment in Au^jal-ia, compared with some $40 billion of American

investment there, Mfdwas the largest foreign holder of equity in

Australia.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE^^KXqRTHERN IRELAND said that the numerous

personal ties and exchatfge^ l^tween young people in the United Kingdom

and Australia were also a viable asset on which the new relationship

should capitalise.

A member of the Vietnamese Embassy, w^Iwrad brandished a gun outside the

 7 million of emergency aid to Bangladesh followingM&amp;Zijusually severe

the Government had so far announced half a million pourw^OsQ^th of aid

but this would need to be looked at again in the light of Vpj^extent of

the damage which was now emerging. v^^lN

THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no end in sight to current

internal unrest in Burma.    It was a very interesting phenomenon that the

^Communist-inclined government had been unable to stand out against the

widespread public protest now manifesting itself there.

THE SECRETARY OF STM^PdkDE FENCE said that the recent removal of

at Molesworth in Cambr ragws)&amp;re was an important reminder of the

progress made in arms coQ4 r rt^and a vindication of the Government&apos;s

consistent policy.    This twre^ffypoint which could profitably be

underlined in Ministerial spejjcaes.    He had attended the previous

weekend a very succesful meevfrV^jjf the Independent European Programme

Group covering defence equipmeX^i&lt;)llaboration.    The fact that the

United Kingdom would be assuming/jH^xhairmanship of this Group for the

next two years would provide a uVefu^^pportunity to shape and guide its

efforts.    THE PRIME MINISTER said ^ffaj^he recent visit to the United

the President of the Commission, Monsieur Delors, to tKt&amp;faades Union

Congress on 8 September as outrageous.   As had happene^ls^vther

occasions, notably in his addresses to the European Parlia*0&lt;,

Monsieur Delors had reverted to demagogy.    The proposals^ra^fTaa put

forward included the creation of a statute for European ccSqg^p^ers with

provision for worker participation.    More generally we would^K&amp;a^


bearing in mind the significant number of socialist administrations now

in the Community, to guard against attempts to tie us up with increased

?^bureaucracy.    The present Commission approach was wholly inconsistent

&apos;SVith that of the founding father of the Community.
