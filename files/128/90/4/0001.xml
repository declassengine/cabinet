Local \

Government

Finance Bill

ytff SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a number of issues

y^ciJ^fie Local Government Finance Bill would need to be settled in the

^/tVSew days.    He had already proposed to his colleagues on the

MiH^cVrial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on

LocaJ^Sovernment Finance (E(LF)) that the Government should accept an

ameir^ntfwct^ which had been carried at Report Stage in the House of Lords

againsp/ofr^ advice, which sought to require student nurses, in common

with oe gT students, to pay only 20 per cent of the community charge,

and that\the Government should bring forward an amendment to exempt from

the community charge those in short-stay hostel accommodation.    On the

other hand, he was convinced that the Government could not accept

a further amend^e^t which sought, on top of an 80 per cent rebate to all

disabled peopM. tsd increase benefits by a sum equal to the average of

the remaining 2lFyMTVtent and to require local authorities to give a

further grant whixe^Afl. 20 per cent liability exceeded the average. The

Government spokesmaa^W the House of Lords had undertaken to consider

the suggestion, which^ftjajkyattracted very strong support at Report Stage,

that relief for charrta^^O^hould be increased from 50 per cent to 100

per cent, and he believea^Rat it might be possible to achieve a

compromise which the Houtsm^^\Lords could accept.

In discussion it was noted^EKa^wiere was widespread public concern

about the exploitation of tn^oWftent law by apparently bogus charities

which were nevertheless able 1^^i&gt;nni charitable status. Legislation

would be required in due course/ter whplement the proposals in the report

by Sir Philip Woodfield into the w^Kvof the Charity Commission, and

consideration could be given to whether that Bill should be expanded to

propose changes to the substantive t^C^^ charities.    It might be that a

more promising alternative would be tcyytigfoten the definition of

charities for taxation and local goveraMnt finance purposes but not for

more general purposes.    More immediately the outstanding issues on the

Local Government Finance Bill relating to the disabled and to charities

brought together the two most effective lobbies in the House of Lords

and it would be difficult if both were opposed/^2\the Government&apos;s

position. \( I)

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, smxl/j/hat the Secretary

of State for the Environment should circulate urgVn%LWto E(LF)

proposals for handling the issues outstanding from^Kp^/^ansideration  f

the Bill in the House of Lords, taking account of thV^m^s made in

discussion.

#^

The Cabinet - NW/,.

1.      Invited the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentAC^/s

proceed as the Prime Minister had indicated in the summr^mAof

the discussion. ^/^^^




THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he had the previous day

presided at a meeting of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic

Strategy, Sub-Committee on Local Authority Expenditure (E(LA)), which

\ had reached important conclusions on the future of the present Rate

?^Support Grant (RSG) machinery.    These conclusions needed to be announced

sAw^th the least possible delay.    The problem arose because the 1989-90

tJ&amp;f settlement would be the last in England and Wales before the

v^Wfe^hduction of the community charge.    There was a real risk that local

4^rrh^rdties would seek to exploit the opportunities for increasing

Ex^reqJJsr grant through creative accounting to the maximum possible

extarf^lri. the period up to the end of 1989-90.    Firms in the City were

alresO ^uvising local authorities how to set about this and many

hundrea/^Pmillions of pounds might be at risk.    To counter these

dangersC&lt;.the Secretary of State for the Environment had proposed to

E(LA) that the existing RSG system should be closed down early, so that

the grant paid to local authorities for 1989-90 would be directly fixed

by the RSG settlement assumptions, and would not vary with authorities&apos;

actual expendi^BrTM,   Grant for all previous years would also be fixed on

the basis of t\Ae_ ejtpenditure returns that authorities had already made,

and the scope to^/an\\ further creative accounting would thus be removed

after the announoWe^n^yof the Government&apos;s intentions.    E(LA) had agreed

to these proposals .^IWQ/sedown of the RSG system would mean that the

full amount of grantArj^vided in the settlement would be paid out to

local authorities, and^tsferO no grant would be forfeited to the Exchequer

as under the present arrafljg^ents.    With that in mind, E(LA) had agreed

that Aggregate Exchequen^gp^rMj for 1989-90 should be set at  13,575

million for England; this^wa^aia increase of  600 million over the

figure for 1988-89, and was/^Pc^above expected inflation.    E(LA) had

also agreed that provision ftfrVl^al authority current expenditure in

England should be set at  29, ion, which represented a call of

nearly  1.4 billion on the Rese^y^. V^That would allow non rate capped

authorities to increase spending j^dgVly in line with inflation. The

criteria that E(LA) had agreed for J^k^e capping in 1989-90 would lead to

the selection of seven general purpq^J^Wthorities and the Inner London

Education Authority.    A short Bill, wovcjK^ould be expected to be

certified by the Speaker as a Money Bi^&apos;Kwould be needed to close down

the RSG system in the way proposed, and\it was important that the

Government&apos;s intentions should be announced as soon as possible, since

local authorities would have every incentive to evade the closedown

proposals if they were to get wind of them.    H^-Tihcordingly sought the

Cabinet&apos;s endorsement of the conclusions reacngd vyE(LA) and their

agreement that the Secretary of State for the En^rTcmment should

announce them that afternoon.    A corresponding &amp;h&amp;4v&amp;&amp;t would be

required in respect of Wales, and a statement of t^xfcrovision and grant

figures for Scotland would also be needed in due covJx^^hough the

closedown proposals would not apply there. C^v\v

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that, \4*k pte&lt;r action

the Government took, some local authorities might try toN^es^aJ-n their

rates in 1989-90 and then increase the community charge the^^^Led, in

an attempt to embarrass the Government; but closing down thi^RS&amp;hsystem

offered the prospect of controlling the worst excesses of sxio^J/yy

behaviour.    The presentation of the level of Aggregate


Exchequer Grant would need to be kept in mind, in the light of the

Government&apos;s commitments, as the introduction of the community charge

drew nearer.    In addition to the closedown proposals, Aggregate

Exchequer Grant total, and rate capping criteria that the Secretary of

^NiState for Energy had reported, he proposed that his statement that

^aKfternoon should also encompass the publication of the Green Paper on

/ hre control of local authority capital expenditure which had now been

kj^e^A among the colleagues concerned.

I^nis^ussion the following main points were made -

he grant settlement approved by E(LA) was generous,

ally when the ending of forfeiture of grant to the

uer was taken into account.    It had been reached by

on the understanding that no more grant should be

conceded, whatever the backbench pressures when the Bill was

before Parliament, and that the legal machinery for blocking off

claims f/OTpfrVevious years should be absolutely watertight.

b. It wasf/possible that the Government might be vulnerable to

legal challe^jgB^fii it made a Rate Support Grant settlement for

1989-90 in the/raita^proposed before the authorising legislation

was on the statAiJ*^$W&gt;k.    The argument would be that

information abou^^c J. authorities&apos; expenditure that had

reached the Governmew^after the date of the announcement

could not reasonabry^bejYgnored by the Government so long

as the existing staru  i  Nframework for decision-making

continued to exist.    Ir^w^ther legal advice confirmed these

doubts and if it appear^d^Jhet local authorities were preparing

to challenge the GovernmenX^^sosition in this way, then it

would be necessary for thev^egXVlation closing down the RSG

system to be enacted before^xfe^winouncement of the RSG

settlement, which was cus tomajrt^Tymade in about December. If

that date were to be honoured,C^tf^legislation would need to be

passed in the overspill period o*M&lt;4$  present Session, or possibly

in the opening weeks of the next ^^ssion.

c. The Bill to close down the RSG system should not be

introduced until the responsible Ministers were absolutely

satisfied with it, since substantial GoA*^*Tratent amendment

to the measure during its passage wouldVkjye^an unfortunate

impression.    On the other hand, some price/woTriti have to be

paid for the addition of this measure to tKs-^gJgislative

programme, and it would be particularly diffvj^Mrt^^o secure

its passage during the present Session unless ft/^eVe

introduced and published before the Summer Rece^vV^it could

not be assumed that such a highly technical measure^ypuld be

perfected so quickly, although every effort wouldNM^maije.    It was

also essential that the Bill should be accepted as &gt;^Mp^#y Bill,

and the precedents suggested that it would be. &lt;c\vv

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the&lt;e|Vi-tpet had

endorsed E(LA)&apos;s conclusion that legislation should be introduce*!


close down the existing Rate Support Grant system and fix the grant that

would be paid to local authorities in 1989-90.    The Cabinet had also

.   agreed E(LA)&apos;s conclusions, reported by the Secretary of State for

J Energy, on Aggregate Exchequer Grant, provision for local authority

-y^urrent expenditure, and rate capping in 1989-90.    The Secretary of

\&gt;s ate for the Environment should make a statement on all these matters

&gt;/^y the House of Commons that afternoon.    His statement should also

 K ej pass the publication of the Green Paper on the control of local

Wtb^rVty capital expenditure.    The Minister of State, Welsh Office,

sft&amp;uld^hake a corresponding statement in respect of Wales that

aft^wrtWr^    The timing of the legislation to close down the Rate Support

GranV^y^tem would need to be carefully considered in the light of

furthevo^gal advice.

TheTabinet -

2. Invit^d^the Secretary of State for the Environment and the

Minister /or^iate, Welsh Office, to make statements in the

House of Vjeyroerve that afternoon on the lines indicated by the

Prime Minister j\i her summing up of the discussion.

3. Invited fctfre^J^pcretary of State for the Environment to

consult the Lor^-^ri&amp;i.dent of the Council, the Chief Secretary,

Treasury, and th^^tMrney General about the necessary

timing of legislatLa^Tfr close down the Rate Support Grant

Oil Platform

I Explosion

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR^ENEflGY said that there had been a very

serious explosion and fire the pij^/iojre evening on the Piper Alpha oil

platform operated by Occidental Pet^l^um which was situated about 120

miles north-east of Aberdeen in thed^^ri Sea.    The latest information

was that only 63 of the 227 people on/ip^ra the rig had been rescued and

the prospects of finding further survivors must be remote. The

explosion, whose main impact appeared tV have been felt in the crew&apos;s

living quarters, had virtually destroyed the platform.    Full emergency

procedures had been brought immediately into effect and a substantial

number of rescue vessels had been quickly mobjOT&amp;kd.    The survivors,

many of whom had been injured, had been takenAtoJ^Jtterdeen.    The flow of

oil at the Piper Alpha rig and at all other rigsyi&apos;nythe oilfield had

been closed down and a pollution control vesselVJvad^&gt;e en despatched to

deal with the oilslick which had developed around ^h^yfom aged platform.

The Minister of State, Department of Energy, had fld#j  fc the emergency

control room at Aberdeen and would visit the survivor^*&gt;Asvsoon as

possible.    It would be very difficult to establish the cau   of the

explosion.    There was no evidence that sabotage was to%i maj and there

was no reason to link it with recent incidents at, or to\s4^&gt; e\down,

other rigs.    He was considering the form of the inquiry whi^O^ would

be necessary to establish into the explosion, but was incllweq/jf^wards a


public inquiry rather than an internal one by his Department&apos;s safety

inspectorate, who had completed their routine annual inspection of the

rig as recently as 28 June.

n

^0\HE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to place on record

^J^Jjkir condolences for those bereaved and injured and their appreciation

&lt;/^r^ he efforts of the rescue and emergency services.    The Secretary of

 &gt;at \for Energy should make a statement in the House of Commons that

afJ^rttwqn and should consider urgently, in consultation with the Lord

Chanjz^lor and the Lord Advocate,  the form of the inquiry which would be

neea^mto the causes of the explosion, taking account of the paramount

need tV/r^fesure those who worked on rigs that all possible steps were

being token to ensure their safety.

The Cabinet -

1. Recoz^fir^v their condolences for those bereaved and injured in

the explo\/ioivon the Piper Alpha North Sea oil rig and their

gratitude TO^TYe work of the rescue and emergency services.

2. Invited TTlra^Ssecretary of State for Energy, in consultation

with the Lord Ct/jrfK^llor and the Lord Advocate, to consider the

THE PRIME MINISTER said that^J*^ml other colleagues had seen

representatives of the football/J tft\knrities the previous day to discuss

with them the need to take action^owirb football hooliganism.    She had

told the football authorites of tnV/^eps which the Government were

taking, about which the Home Secrec-M^^i^d the Secretary of State for

the Environment had informed the CabIV&amp;t&apos;/*  their previous meeting; and

in particular of their decision to inc^xfuce legislation, if necessary,

to establish a national membership scheme under which only spectators

with membership cards would be admitted to Football League matches in

England and Wales.

In discussion it was noted that the police adhftseq) to the Football

League had indicated at the meeting that the p^i^ ev ometimes admitted

into grounds groups of trouble-makers without twke^zivwhere this seemed

the best way of containing any potential violencer^^yy would be

important, in the interests of discouraging those oil^s^e the membership

scheme from travelling to matches, to ensure that tft^r| rakthout

membership cards were not admitted to Football League grcy*pds and to

encourage overseas police forces in countries where tha  jra&amp;ind team was

playing to take a similarly firm line.    The Home SecretaV _jiratald

announce later that day that he would be working with Coven^^^City

Council with a view to preparing a bye-law to ban the consuffipl&amp;piv of

 ^^&gt; THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE

(j^frsychalker) said that as a result of a tragic accident on 3 July, 298

Ix&amp;syz&amp;d been lost when an Iranian Airbus on a scheduled flight, from

Band^r^bbas to Dubai had been shot down by the USS Vincennes.    A full

UniDsj3^jTpates naval investigation was now under way as to how the

acc ideix/^aM occurred.    Meanwhile in public comment the United Kingdom,

while dfoffloring the tragedy, had stressed the right of self-defence for

United Spates naval forces in the Persian Gulf under Article 51 of the

United Nations Charter.    It was important to continue this public line

given the presence in the Gulf of the Royal Navy Armilla patrol.

Unfortunately/xft&amp;ev European countries who also had naval forces there,

such as Fr anck(^n8/_Italy, had been less forthright.    Iran had requested

a meeting of tH57^fTl\hed Nations Security Council and was canvassing a

draft resolution\X wrfrfrmning the United States and demanding withdrawal

of foreign f ovces^em t-he Persian Gulf.    Iran&apos;s initial response to the

accident therefore S ejire&lt;*vto be primarily political and rhetorical. But

there was clearly an tyt&amp;b&amp;sed threat of attack on United States

interests, as the designa &amp;n of 7 July as &quot;Death to the United States

Day&quot; in Iran showed.    Tft^^fflaitional risk to United Kingdom interests

was not assessed to be hi^hsAacept by association with the United

States.    In particular,  the/^Kx^et to the Armilla patrol had not

significantly increased beyoJvar^ftit associated with the general

consequences of heightened te^tfymyp   The Government had signed on 6 July

with Iran an agreement covering^6ii Wisation for damage to diplomatic

THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that

assessments of the recently concluded Special Party Conference in Moscow

had confirmed tirat it was a landmark in Soviet political life.    It had

introduced a nVw vitality into the debate there and represented a

victory for th\s 3^erj c^pt of glasnost which would set a precedent for the

conduct of dialogue Ihroughout Soviet political life that would be

difficult to eras*s^-^ Ue break with the Stalinist past had been

symbolised by the cwrovM^n to build a memorial in Moscow to the victims

of Stalinism.    But iv^ra^oalso clear that the majority of delegates at

the Special Conferencerod^een what might accurately be described as

diehards and reac t ionar i^sV^Many references during the Conference to

the excesses of glasnost^adjoeen applauded.    The powerful critique by

Politburo member Mr Yigor H^j^ae^yev directed against a fellow Politburo

member Mr Boris Yeltsin andv^Pt^^ ormer 1 s rejection of the attacks on

Party privilege had been welv^rtyeived.    There would be plenty of

opportunities for procrastinatiapOwer implementation of the reform

programme.    Nevertheless, the GVner^KSecretary of the Communist Party,

Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had emergec&amp;^roaC&apos;the Conference with his own

authority enhanced.    His assumptio^^f^he new executive Presidency

would if confirmed further increaseMV^Sy&apos;pQwer and his ability to bypass

the diehard elements of the Party strq fcjKe.    Equally the Conference had

brought out clearly the extent of the sjvposition to Mr Gorbachev&apos;s

proposed reforms and had confirmed Mr Ligachev as the leading

&quot;conservative&quot; in Soviet party terms.

THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH KfcFjKBft said that the

Leader of the Opposition, Mr Neil Kinnock, would b^K^e^ing off that day

for a ten day tour of Africa, visiting Zambia, Bots^aV^Nzimbabwe and

Mozambique.    A very large press contingent would be a^c^jnKanying him.

It was fair to assume that Mr Kinnock would be seeking w^S^spublicity

during these visits, for example by going to the sites j f/crass-border

raids.    He would no doubt also criticise the Government &apos;^^tfjefahy toward

South Africa.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had KrlXrvd

Mr Kinijock on Privy Counsellor terms.    It would be important^&lt;VKft any

rebuttal of public statements by the Leader of the OppositiorKMpeiJ&amp;d be

made by Ministers, and diplomatic posts in the area had been bY^ef^jk


accordingly.    The press party included some journalists who were very

well informed and who would be quick to criticise any naivities on the

part of Mr Kinnock.

4.    M^%/MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE

(Mrs CraJwr) said that in response to the suggestion of the Secretary

of Stat^Cfor Trade and Industry, arrangements were being made for

circulation of a short note on the current drought in the United States.

This would cover its possible implications for the United States

Presidential election,  the European Community (EC) budget and the

Uruquay Round/VTaN discussion it was noted that it was still too early

to reach a finxl Mr w on the effect of the drought: much would depend on

whether there wa^/raVVi over the coming fortnight.    The effects on United

States wheat proo^jeppCb should not be exaggerated since winter wheat

accounted for 75 pe^^fcs*  of the harvest and had not been affected. The

effects on soya bean^^H^maize could however be serious.    There had

also been secondary e^fKM. on livestock prices.    There was danger of

development of a belief iMAbecause of the drought it would no longer

be necessary to be conce^pe^)\bout surpluses.    Such an approach would be

misconceived.    There wourq^s^t^l be surpluses and the drought should not

affect long term agricultui;^V6jyrategy.    The impact of the drought on

world prices would lead to on the EC budget.    But we should also

Speech to

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY drew attention to press

reports of a speech by the President of the Commission, Monsieur Delors,

in which he had apparently expressed the view^h^t the existing system

of national parliaments would within seven y^kvs\Jnave to give way to the

embryo of a European government and that withrny^eTlywears 80 per cent of

economic legislation would be of European rathe\^ikajKnational origin.

In a brief discussion it was noted that subject to-^ nfj.rmation of the

accuracy of the press reports, opportunity might ne/i^A^e taken to

take the President of the Commission to task.    It wa^tfoW^ver not

unusual for him to express sentiments on these lines wh&amp;ar^ddressing the

European Parliament. ^V^/
