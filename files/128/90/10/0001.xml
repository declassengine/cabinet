THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the overall result

^^j/the leadership changes in the Soviet Union was less radical than

(/a^0^red at first.    There were now four reformers in the Politburo and

wfre^e^Bembers of the old guard.    The loyalties of the other five members

of^tne/^olitburo were uncertain but included elements who favoured

econ^Hf^&gt;--Kather than political reform.    It appeared that the position of

the frw^aent and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet

Union, w^Mikhail Gorbachev,  in carrying forward perestroika was

strengthened but he himself was showing signs of impatience with the

policy orglasnost as reflected in the criticisms he had faced in

Siberia and the attitude of the Soviet press.    The irony was that

Mr Gorbachev had aade these latest changes in a very undemocratic

fashion: membe so\B the Central Committee had been summoned peremptorily

to Moscow to rVjbjjar s^tamp decisions already taken. Centralised

political power Had Baen used in the name of trying to achieve greater

economic decentravi^^Dn.

United

General

Assembly

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWE&lt;A^pQ(kcRETARY said that during his recent visit

to New York for the Uniteav3fe ^ris General Assembly he had observed a

new atmosphere pervading Uni^eN^Vations work, reflecting the progress

which had occurred in findingSs^iiitions to the problems in Iran and

Iraq, Afghanistan, Cambodia airaVjPo^wiern Africa.    The new thinking in

Soviet foreign policy introducea^bv^nr Gorbachev was undoubtedly one

factor in this, challenging as itvdid/^11 the premises underlying Soviet

foreign policy hitherto and questiq$ i[iig~&apos;whether such policies had really

been in the Soviet interest.    Anoth important factor had been the

collective leadership demonstrated by^p* /west.    This rested on the

pattern of good relations and mutual consultation among the allies such

as had characterised the last Summit of The North Atlantic Treaty

Organisation.    The West had thus been able to respond constructively and

sensibly to the emergence of new thinking in the-^Soviet Union. The

speeches by the President of the United State^fMn Ronald Reagan, and by

the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard ShevaraJg^dS&amp;e^to the General

Assembly, had reflected much greater similarities^ oijposition than

previously.    The United Kingdom Permanent Represeifl^KiVe at the United

Nations had assumed the de facto role of co-ordina^i^ia^ the five

Permanent Members of the Security Council.    It was tyj^O^Lted Kingdom

which often took the initiative in calling the five fxJgi&amp;Nkr, as had

been done over United Nations Security Council ResolutiojK^8 on the

Iran/Iraq war.    There had been another meeting of the fim^Fjfcyreign

Ministers with the United Nations Secretary General, Mr Psx^z^e

Cuellar, on 28 September.    The willingness of all concerned^ff^X.

reorganise this meeting at short notice to accommodate the i&amp;vjtfi

Foreign Minister&apos;s sudden recall to Moscow for the Party Pleivuy^r&lt;Kbeen


remarkable.    There had been a very sensible discussion at the meeting

itself.    There was agreement to press on in implementing the ceasefire

\    resolution on the Iran/Iraq war.    The question had been raised as to

vC\ what common action might be possible to bring about a political solution

)) in Cambodia, picking up on the Prime Minister&apos;s own statement on this

~ ^X^Vbject.    There had been frank discussion of the situation in Angola and

\\\$lra&gt; possibility of diplomatic movement more generally in Southern

v^CByica.    Meanwhile Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan was continuing.

THE F^R^GJJ^AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there were encouraging

signs o^i^Jvement in several quarters as regards the overall situation

in SoutheSm Africa.    The Secretary General of the United Nations,

Mr Perez de Cuellar, had returned from the region with a sense that

changes were afoot over Angola and Namibia.    He himself had recently

returned from a/tj&gt;P to Africa.    The Prime Minister had also seen the

President of z/tfibabpe, Mr Robert Mugabe.    In South Africa the President,

Mr P W Botha, hB&amp;^^ENhimself into an illogical position internally. He

was frightened offbeiAg out-flanked to his political right by the

Conservative ?arty\~wfoie simultaneously trying to unscramble the Group

Areas Act.    Against Mfhrjfs^ackground he appeared to be trying to move

forward externally.    te ^*K\jsident of Mozambique, Mr Joaquim Chissano,

believed that South Africarvjks serious in its recommitment to the

Nkomati Agreement.    Most&lt;w r vinformed observers thought that South

Africa was prepared to pre^_^jAltowards independence for Namibia. The

two major remaining problems-^weV^. Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and

internal political reconcilia^iwn/there.    Progress was slow but the

chances of reaching agreement^ojj^fjhe^ timetable for Cuban troop

withdrawal looked somewhat betterc/ff^her major intiatives such as

Summit meetings in Southern Africa^^eXfced unlikely. Meanwhile

perceptions of the United Kingdom&apos;s na^ition on South Africa were

shifting in the Government&apos;s favour v fc^Jie time.    This was because

people recognised the strength of theapgujnents the Government had been

putting, for example in recent speechesvtjyHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to

South Africa, particuarly on the effect^hat punitive economic sanctions

would have.    The United Kingdom&apos;s positive aid to the Front Line States

was another important factor in mitigating criticism of British policy.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that h^e^^seen the Iranian

Foreign Minister, Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, during \i\s^i-kyC^Xo New York

the previous week.    The objectives had been to work ve^r^S^utiously

toward the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations yjrfhout a

precise commitment at this stage as to the time or scale&lt;^/Cnds. he

had naturally also pressed for better treatment for the twAjJxolish

citizens imprisoned in Iran and had raised again the questioiK^sftoBritish

hostages in Lebanon.    He had reached agreement in principle Vkttt/^

Dr Velayati on 30 September to resume full diplomatic re presenilation in

London and Tehran, subject to talks in Geneva between the two sirtfe-s ya


f

detailed implementation.    Iran was making unreasonable demands over the

wording of a joint communique^    It was therefore not inconceivable that

the whole agreement would have to be called off. Notwithstanding

&gt;      British commercial interests in Iran,  Iran needed resumption of

2*.   diplomatic relations more than the United Kingdom.    The British media

y\\ reaction so far had been broadly supportive of the Government&apos;s line.

Gibraltar

Inquest

Reference:

CC(88) 29.2

 BJ^toXeiGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that following the verdict

of svzsCyfiahle homicide returned by the jury in Gibraltar on 30

Septe^jjpej: on the deaths of three Irish Republican Army terrorists shot

by Br^jrfsfr security forces on 6 March, the reaction of the Irish

GovernmVf^^ad so far been restrained while they considered the report

of theirwfwn official observer at the inquest.    All those who had been

concernedvin the organisation and conduct of the Crown&apos;s case at the

inquest deserved congratulation.

In a short disc/ia^ton of the next steps with regard to the Thames

Television programme &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, it was noted that an

independent inqu^trv^WBte now under way, the result of which would be

reported to the In&amp;ejjajident Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and published

in due course.    This/^pl&apos;pc-ess might take some weeks.    Thereafter it was

for consideration whe/lJ^^Vny further statement should be made by the

Government both on the^i^g^amme itself and on the IBA&apos;s apparent

failure to exercise its su^^visory role.    The episode had completely

vindicated the arguments M p&lt;ftY|the danger of media coverage causing

contamination of the evide^&amp;e^t&gt;o which Mr Justice Salmon had drawn

attention after the Aberfan ^^^i^saster in 1968.

Chile

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONEALTH SECRETAR*/ aid that the Government of Chile

had conceded that the plebiscite helC^Tj^o October had gone against the

President, General Augusto Pinochet, btfAj/Jaargin of 53 to 44 per cent.

President Pinochet was likely however twremain in office until March

1990.    Congressional elections and a Presidential election were now due

in January 1990.    It was hoped that the plebiscite represented the first

step in a return to democratic government in Chile.    The problem was

that the opposition parties were very divided ^f6Tyt themselves and it

might take time for them to rally and for strcW^opposition candidates

to emerge.    Although reactions both from pro-PinaralieM forces and from

the opposition had so far been moderate, there reqia-ip^dj a danger that

the internal situation wou.ld deteriorate and would m/^o resemble the

Philippines after the fall of President Marcos but w^rooK the presence

of a strong democratic leader such as Mrs Corazan Aqurji^^vLf in such

circumstances the military were to move in and seize poweV^&gt;8hile&apos;s

predicament would have come full circle.

^f^&gt;   THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that an

\^agreement had been reached late on 4 October on New Zealand exports of

&lt;&amp;^A^X and sheepmeat to the Community.    Not all the details were yet

cfaarSand the agreement was subject to ratification by the New Zealand

Cabi^retyand, on the Community side, clearance by the full Commission and

the C^JrfciJ..    His understanding was that the proposed agreement would

cover^J^^tour year period 1989-92.    For butter there would be

a reducpvqj*^Xn New Zealand butter exports from the present 74,500 tonnes

to 64,500^tonnes in 1989 and progressively to 55,000 tonnes in 1992.

There wouu be a reduction in the butter levy from 25 to 15 per cent.

For sheepmeat the ceiling would be reduced from the present 245,500

tonnes to 205,000 tonnes, with the existing 10 per cent tariff reduced

to zero.    It reaf^iTv^d to be seen whether there would be any attempt in

the Council to WighVej up the detailed provisions of the agreement. His

expectation was t?Vaf&apos;~Yfer their part the New Zealand authorities would

accept it as the o^s^Available outcome.    For butter the effect of the

reduction of the lev^^/k^en with the reduced access would be actually to

increase New Zealand r/ef^rkturns in the first year.    He judged that an

outcome on the basis prj p^ d would be acceptable to the United Kingdom

dairy industry.
