2. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the

Europe^KCommission had on the previous morning agreed the terms on

whicrV-^fch*^^ would be prepared to approve the sale of the Government&apos;s

sharehoYd/fn^ in Rover Group to British Aerospace pic  (BAe), but at the

last mirnrp; BAe had asked for more time to consider the implications of

the condr^.ons attached to the Commission&apos;s decision.    In particular,

BAe had expressed concern that,  in the event of any significant

departure from the expenditure programme forecast in the Rover Group

corporate plan C&amp;S^ch BAe had already endorsed), the Commission would

have the legal f/igh^ to demand repayment of the entire sum which the

Government was pt&amp;rf3&gt;S^ng to inject into the Rover Group.    BAe directors

had said that they(wc&gt;nAd not be prepared to recommend to their

shareholders that cire^^ampany should carry that risk.    While the

Commission were unlrtfeQ^^o challenge any changes to the corporate plan

unless they amounted i^a^ignif icant departure and, in that event,

could be expected to reac^sjmpathetically if there were convincing

reasons, it was clear tha^^wNjher the Commission nor the Government

could possibly accept a s\S^ajelon under which BAe effectively had carte

blanche to depart from the cflrMwte plan.    It was not clear whether BAe

were simply being naive in pHXDWgv forward this proposal or whether they

were instead seeking a means o*^r*sLling from a deal which they no

longer regarded as advantageousshould have been aware of the

position from the outset and it waa^^raordinary that they should wait

until the very last moment beforeVais^Sg these doubts.    The United

Kingdom Permanent Representative to&lt; j ^J\iropean Community was having a

meeting with Commissioner Sutherland T^yfsJ^blish what assurances could

be given to the directors, and he himsB^^would be meeting BAe directors

later that day when it was likely to beaSme clear whether there remained

a prospect of reaching an agreement within the terms of the Commission&apos;s

decision.    If it became apparent that there was no prospect of reaching

a settlement, it would be important for the Government to make a

statement in Parliament as soon as possible in-order to seize the

initiative from BAe who would no doubt seek to\feiaflENthe Government for

any breakdown.    In the event of such a breakdown[fitjyouId be essential

to ensure that confidence in Rover was preserved,Vaajx^b seek to

discourage any unwelcome bids for the Rover Group fVo^^Jyal car-makers,

especially since August was the peak month for sales (p^ntn* cars. He

proposed accordingly that the Government should make cleaV^Jiat their

objective remained to return the Rover Group to the priv^vjSK^jector

within the lifetime of the present Parliament and that het^ou/yd be

exploring the options for securing this with the management ^r^che

Group. The performance of the Rover Group had recently muchM^^rrojed and

the Group was likely to remain attractive to prospective purc a flr/s.


In discussion, it was noted that it would be wrong to cut short any

negotiations which could preserve the sale to BAe simply in order to

v\ make a firm statement to Parliament.    If the directors required

V/assurances that the Commission would behave reasonably in monitoring the

^X^^ervance of the Corporate plan, such assurances could probably be

V^M^ained.    But if BAe were insisting that they should be free to depart

&lt;^rom-&gt;fundamental aspects of the Corporate plan or were seeking a pretext

rarre iling from an agreement which they no longer wanted to pursue, it

wou-liKkfe preferable to conclude discussions as soon as possible and

retai^j/tne initiative in presenting the Government&apos;s view.

THE PRmE\&gt;f&gt;NISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the further

negotiations which the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would

be holding with BAe should not be foreclosed while there remained any

realistic prospect of success, but if it became clear that there was no

prospect of reaching a settlement he should make a statement on the

matter in the RdjS&amp;of Lords at the earliest opportunity.    In the event

of a breakdownf^f 4*scussions with BAe,  it would be crucially important

to ensure that cSta^rdknce in the Rover Group was maintained. The

Cabinet agreed that^ra/that event the Government should make clear that

its objective xemaftpepfLa return the Rover Group to the private sector

within the lifetime otl^yfyts Parliament and that it would be discussing

with the Group the opt^&gt;rfs\for securing this.

P  ference:

(88) 24.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said\^ha*&gt; progress continued with

securing the remaining structure of tnfr^amaged Piper Alpha platform but

that the work had been hampered by bad weather.   At least three of the

six oil wells on the site were not under control, and the priority task

was to cut the flow of oil and gas from them.   Oil pollution was being

carefully monitored and was very slight.   A few&lt;U&gt;rther bodies had been

recovered during the previous week, but the bodlesrjof most of the

victims were probably trapped in the remains or^kKfc platform&apos; s living

accommodation which had sunk.    He had set up a pilt^Hx/inquiry into the

incident and, having consulted the Lord Advocate amjx&amp;ne Lord

Chancellor, had appointed Lord Cullen as its chairaanV^^bis

appointment, in which he had complete confidence, had-^ft^nXwell received

publicly.    In order to ensure that the application of tecTprfccal lessons

from the disaster did not have to wait until the public &lt;fcw*i^sy was

completed, he had also established an immediate technic a rwnwj/sX igation,

the results of which would be made available to the public^Jwufftry. He

presently estimated that the Piper Alpha disaster would re su^t vijKNa

production loss of about 4.2 million tonnes of oil in each or^w/y&gt;ears

1988 and 1989, together with an insignificant loss of gas produ^jpl^rft.

He also estimated that the adverse effect on the balance of paymen-fe^Jv


excluding insurance claims, would be of the order of  250 million in

1988 and  230 million in 1989, with the loss to the Exchequer being of

v   the order of  170 million in 1988-89 and  160 million in 1989-90. He

J would keep these estimates under review, and see that his colleagues

&apos;V^ere kept informed.    The trade unions were endeavouring to use the

*1\\rncident to establish a special position for themselves on safety issues

y^2*/North Sea oil production with the objective of promoting union

mtfj&amp;wship.    Although the Department of Energy acted as the Health and

safatj^Commission1s agent under the Health and Safety at Work Act, a

nuwnet/^f other Departments and organisations were also involved in the

safe^^aC*angements in the North Sea, and Mr Roger Lyons, the deputy

genef^awp&apos;ecretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, had

acted aAs^faly in blaming the Department for a helicopter accident that

was witn^n the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority.    Mr Lyons

was in a singularly poor position to offer any criticism since he had

been one of the members of the Burgoyne Committee on Offshore Safety who

had dissented ftortk that Committee&apos;s recommendations, which had been

implemented byntne)\&gt;resent Govermment.    Nor was the forthcoming visit by

Norwegian tradev3D4rj2&gt;ists likely to assist the trade unions&apos; attempts to

secure a greater nfoleJJin safety issues: the British public was sceptical

of such aspiration --  ycrade unions, and it was a fact that the worst

North Sea accident p-f^jMOto the Piper Alpha disaster had taken place in

the Norwegian sector.C^na^wmId continue to resist pressure from the

trade unions for publ n^Mam of his Department&apos;s reports on an incident

on the Piper Alpha platfgraK&gt;K 1984 and on the routine inspection of the

platform that had been co^luijbd just before the disaster, though these

reports would naturally be\ravwble to the public inquiry and in fact

the recommendation of the 19w\^TOuiry had been implemented.    It was

most important that the trade^Wzfoois&apos; attempts to make capital out of

the disaster, and to jeopardise JR/oyt&amp;. Sea oil production, should be

firmly opposed.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said \ at he would announce by way of

a Written Answer later that day that he and the Secretary of State for

the Environment were jointly establishing an inquiry by the Health and

Safety Executive and HM Inspectorate of Pollutipfr-Ninto the presence at

Drigg low level radioactive waste disposal sitfi[3Q)a canister apparently

containing plutonium. The canister, which shoabl/&lt;JS&gt;tainly never have

been at Drigg, had been discovered under several (feetfjof earth, and it

seemed likely that it had been there for up to 15^y-   iy.

Inemployment

ieference:

!C(88) 21.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemp^tfyn^^ figures

for June would be published that day.    The seasonally adjuVt^ovtetal had

fallen by 39,000 to 2.375 million.   This was the 23rd conse&lt;&amp;{t\&amp;p*)

monthly reduction, which was the longest continuous period of^f-^Ying

unemployment since the Second World War.   The overall total haa^xe^&amp;a

by 86,000 in the previous month and now stood at the lowest figuV^fp^


nearly seven years.    The rate of unemployment had fallen to 8.4 per

cent. Unemployment had fallen by 550,000 in the 12 months since the

^ General Election, with the largest reductions having occurred in the

A^West Midlands, the North West and the North. Unemployment among school

^O^cavers had fallen by 32 per cent over the previous 12 months and by

.^jxrte than 50 per cent over the previous five years. The position on

^/&lt;ifonE&gt;J.led vacancies continued to be very healthy:    there were 255,000

m fi lved vacancies at job centres and it was estimated that there were

ov&lt;rf/7v0,000 vacancies in the economy as a whole.

3.     THE FOREmN^AVD COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the terrorist

attack on the Grae^r-s&apos;ruise ship &quot;City of Poros&quot; on 11 July had resulted

in 47 injured anoAlJ/A^d according to latest casualty figures. There

were no reports orajjy^Jritish missing or injured.    Photographs had been

released of four ArabsMk&amp;ieved to have been involved in the attack but

the woman associated ^^C\fc em ^n press photographs had turned out to be

a French tourist.    It was/d&amp;o now less certain that the terrorists had

escaped from the cruise wj^p-^yw boat.    There was speculation that the

attack had been carried ooXjbV/fclie terrorist organisation Abu Nidhal,

but there was no evidence to/MOTort this.    The attack would help to

make the Greek Prime Ministei\ ^pO^ndreas Papandreou, realise how

seriously terrorism had to be ^a^ep/^and might in the longer run lead to

some improvement in Greek attiti/ft?s tNoward international co-operation.

United States investigation into the accidental shooting down of an

Iranian Airbus on 3 July were not yet complete.    Meanwhile, the United

States had agreed to pay compensation to the families of the victims. A

technical investigation was also to be undertalrjm^by the International

Civil Aviation Organisation.   Discussions to &amp;ad txtle Iran/Iraq war

now escorting some 80 ships in and out of the Gulf every month, whjtfm^


was more than all other Western Navies put together.    His interlocutors

in Kuwait were convinced that the shooting down of the Airbus had been

the consequence of an Iranian conspiracy.    They had pointed to the fact

!  that some of the bodies of the passengers had been recovered wearing

Xkife jackets, which argued against an attack which had taken the

\&gt;a&gt;ccraft entirely by surprise.    The Kuwaitis were also convinced that

 /^ere had been an Iranian military aircraft flying in the shadow of the

Lralcan Airbus.    The Kuwaitis perception was of increasing war weariness

rnl^ak.    Iranian prisoners of war seemed glad and relieved to be

ca&lt;prur^!S.    There were reports of Iranian women hiding their children to

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been no

the Nagorno-Ka/r^abaMh enclave.    There was no obvious way out of the

dilemma confroo^pifZJshe Soviet leadership in Moscow.    There was still no

PROSPECTS

AND rCf

EXPENDIT^J

4.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the

Exchequer (C(88) 10) on economic prospects and a memorandum by the Chief

Secretary, Treasury (C(88) 11) on the 1988 Public Expenditure Survey.

| THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his paper set out the

d^rospects for the economy.    In many ways performance and prospects were

Mkry good.    Output,  investment and employment were all growing rapidly.

^ C f idence in the economy was high, both in this country and abroad,

^flrewe was however some cause for concern over the prospects for

inflation and the balance of payments.    As to inflation, his current

forecast  (which would not be published)  for a year on year increase in

the Retail Price Index in the last quarter of the year of 5i per cent,

some l  per cent more than the forecast made in the Budget.    Of the

increase q^fcli per cent,  about half resulted from the expected increase

in mortgjK *j^terest rates,  and half from a rise in underlying inflation

caused ma^W|^^y the monetary relaxation which all countries had felt it

wise to mal^^fXgr the Stock Exchange crash.    The rate of inflation must

be brought dWJ^^^MLnterest rates had therefore already risen and if

necessary woul^^^^raised further.    As  to the balance of payments, he

was now forecasS \ current account deficit  in 1988 of  9 billion.

The size of the &quot;sBQlk. nee^ not cause alarm as  long as external

confidence was Ria&gt;vCw-    Government  finances were  in surplus. The

deficit reflected pMpt^sector demand and would reduce as growth in

the economy fell back i^^^sustainable level.    Nevertheless,  the deficit

had to be financed and^t was therefore essential to retain the

confidence of the markets.    This required the Government to continue to

follow prudent policies, and especially to maintain firm control of

public expenditure.    The recommendations in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper

were crucial in this respect.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY,  TREASURY s^ftjkit the Government had consistently

followed a policy of reducing the^Ep^b of public expenditure to Gross

Domestic Product  (GDP).  This polic^^^^Ld be continued.    He had

therefore proposed that the ob iec t iv^^olr^th i s year&apos;s Survey should be

that public expenditure should be helcBdf^.ose as possible to the

existing planning totals and that, after^^Auding privatisation

proceeds,  the ratio of total public expe^flB^ to GDP should continue

to decline steadily over the next  three Suk^y^ears.

Decisions had already been made which would ^lad to an unusually large

addition to public expenditure the following year, especially the

settlement on local authority expenditure and the nurses&apos; pay award.

Very substantial bids had been received in addition from Departments.

They were well beyond what could be afforded and difficult decisions

would need to be taken to ensure that the objective vAMMhieved. The

bids for Education, Transport and Home Office programn^(^jB:e for big

increases above the baseline and would need to be scale^HM^

considerably.    Most of the big Social Security bid ref lec^|^^timat ing

changes, but policy changes to offset it would have to be KnsB^red.

On Health, he would need to scrutinise in particular the bi^^d^W|igher

capital spending,  which would have revenue consequences  for ratj^^ears.

Difficult decisions would be needed also on the programmes for^R^^^ce,

Trade and Industry, and Agriculture,  and also on Employment wher^^^^k


account must be taken of the fall in unemployment.    Among other bids,

.   territorial expenditure would have to be scrutinised, especially in

Wareas where spending was at a higher rate than in England.    Finally, he

^^puld need to consider very carefully the bids for more spending on

l^^nstruet ion,  in view of the evidence of excessive pressure on the

k^o^t ruction industry.

Fids for increases in running costs were also very high.    They implied a

rise of 9 per cent in money terms and 5 per cent in real terms, and an

increase in Civil Service numbers back above 600,000 within two years.

He proposed repeating the previous year&apos;s objective of holding the share

of running^asts in planned expenditure roughly constant.    This would

mean a settlement well below the level of the bids,  and continuing

efforts tg^Agd^re efficiency through effective management plans. Some

of the plan^HkJ^uced by Departments were very good,  but others required

more work.   ^P3^P^L&gt; as to nationalised industries, he proposed that the

aim,  so long aKthM^remained within the public sector,  should be to

keep overall PT^^jd^^k to baseline or less.

In discussion the oEjd^^ing main points were made -

a. The GovernmeTitJ^Kuccess in managing the economy resulted from

its steady pursuif^cf prudent policies,  including effective control

of public expenditure.    Its reputation for sound management of the

economy was a major political asset.    It must continue to pursue

these policies.

b. The country&apos;s economi^VA:ess had also raised its standing

abroad.  It was  important t Vrinpw&gt; international confidence in the

British economy,  especially ^^^^W of the need to finance the

current account deficit. ^^^0^

c. The long-term consequences OT^jfl^ridi ture decisions had to be

borne in mind.  Expenditure once stW plcould be hard to stop, even

if economic conditions generally chafh^f^^ It would be unwise to

take action now which might have to b^^M^rsed towards the end of

the Parliament. ?

d. The current upturn in inflation was worrying.    It carried the

risk of a return of inflationary expectations.    The high level of

pay settlements was one of the most disturbing features of the

economy and had a direct influence on the size of bids.    It might

be however that  it was a result of the very high JL^^of company

profitability and that employers&apos; resistance to higher pay would

become stronger as profitability returned to more n^fl^^Llevels

with a decline  in the rate of growth. ^t^tf^.

e. The high rate of increase in earnings in the econoT^^Sd^

whole also produced problems for public sector managemenfl^^^Mie

groups in the public sector had fallen behind the private V^B^

and indeed more favoured public  sector groups,  in their pay^^\^k


k f.      The high rate of pay increases in the economy generally had

made the recruitment and retention of civil servants more

m difficult,  in some cases to the detriment of the efficient running

^K^L        f Departments.    There might  indeed be a choice to be made between

^^^^^    holding down running costs to the minimum and maintaining

departmental efficiency and services to the public at the level

^^^^which had come to be expected.

g. One way of containing running costs while also contributing to

a more even spread of economic activity throughout the country

would be further relocation of the Civil Service outside London and

the S^th-East.

h. ^^y^kions about expenditure on capital  investment should take

acc oun^Pfct^t t s effect on long-term economic growth,  and also of its

politic^^tfi^ractions.  Higher  inflation and the current account

deficit \Selhe result of conditions  in the private sector,  not of

exc es s ive ^ft^i^g in the public sector.

THE PRIME MINISTER^C^0Wg UP the discussion,  said that  the Cabinet were

agreed on the need l^^c^tatinued firm control of public spending. They

endorsed all the recOTimg^^tions by the Chief Secretary, Tresury. He

should now, as proposec^conduct bilateral discussions with spending

Ministers in the usual way against the objectives which had been agreed.

She hoped that Ministers would in these discussions bear in mind the

points made at this meeting, and that the bilaterals would result in

agreement.    If they did not,  she^jauld at the appropriate time establish

a small group under the chairmAftA of the Secretary of State for

Eenrgy, which would consider ou%gPsj0king issues and make recommendations

to the Cabinet.    Ministers who we&quot;^^%npible to reach agreement with the

Chief Secretary would not be able l^^^fcot on getting such good terms

as a result of discussion in this grmipjP

Meanwhile,   in reply to questions she wcwMJkxplain that the Cabinet had

held its usual July discussion of publ ic^^^^di ture,  that they had

agreed that public spending should be hela^^^^ose as possible to the

existing planning totals so that the share^f^^J^lic spending in

national  income  should continue to decline si^^arLy over the three

Survey years,  that with this objective the Chief Secretary would hold

bilateral discussions in the autumn and that in the light of these the

Government would take decisions on individual programmes and the

planning totals, which would be announced, as usual,  in the Autumn

Statement in November.    Other members of the Cabinet aW^L^ adhere to

this line in any outside contacts.    The bilateral dis^^ps^Wis should be

carried on in confidence and the press should be given^B^^^ound on

which to base speculative stories of Ministerial disagre^wrc^^

The Cabinet - ^^2^

1.      Took note, with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their discussion. ^^^^J^


I 2.      Approved the proposals in C(88) 11 and invited

the Chief Secretary, Treasury to proceed accordingly.

^  4^     3.      Noted that the Prime Minister would,  if necessary,

establish a small group under the chairmanship of the

^^kSecretary of State for Energy to consider outstanding issues
