of Commons in the following week.

^H^LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had every reason to

y&amp;fXpbe that the North Killingholme Cargo Terminal Bill and the

A^^cvjfcted British Ports (No 2) Bill would begin their Committee Stages

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was hoping to make a statement in the

following week on the publication of the White Paper on Official

Secrets.    There        a strong case for early publication in view of the

inaccurate spec/UTaMon in the press.    In discussion, it was noted that,

while the White\j aK&amp;t.was concerned with the criminal law rather than

the civil law, it/woulH be necessary to take account of the date on

which the House oS^k&lt;y&gt;ra would have finished hearing the arguments in

the Spycatcher case^y/^

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR $tAD^AND INDUSTRY said that an

announcement was being made that d^^treat Nestle1 had increased their bid

for Rowntree to  2.55 billion and the^firectors of Rowntree were

recommending acceptance.    That reprefgn &amp;A a huge increase on the

original offer. \/s^

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Seven Power

Economic

Summit

in Toronto

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th^^ft^a Seven Power

Economic Summit in Toronto from 19 to 21 June had bee/nr^^uccessful and

useful meeting.    All participants including Japan had ^N&amp;pirely

reaffirmed the correctness of the macro-economic policies^S^sued over

the last nine years and had set them on course for the f\r6 l Yyith

emphasis on the need to be watchful against a resurgence o^ -^Jpfriation.

Good language had been achieved in the communique on trade aiul\N^

agriculture about the need to achieve progress in the negotia\^Mf^under

the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to streri Ok jr&gt;the

GATT itself.    On agriculture there had been a firm commitment t^tfot) \


short and long term measures to reduce agricultural support.    There had

also been a good outcome on the problems of international debt. On

East-West relations, the communique represented a useful confirmation of

) a shared assessment of where matters now stood in the light of recent

fts.    There had been intensified co-operation against

nal drug trafficking including agreement to create a

network of bilateral agreements on the tracing, freezing and

on of assets associated with drug trafficking.    On terrorism

ft hijacking there had been no dramatic progress but the

endorsed current efforts undertaken within the International

tion Organisation (ICAO) at British initiative including

not to allow hijacked aircraft to take off from airports at

/alighted except where there might be a direct and immediate

threat foTlife.   There had also been agreement that pressure should be

maintained on countries which had not yet done so to subscribe to the

ICAO anti-hijacking conventions.

THE CHANCELL0R/W%1E EXCHEQUER said that the Toronto Summit had been a

reminder of thVkdeg-f^e to which sound economic policies combined with

closer internatidnaT)ao-operation had proved their value in the wake of

the Stock ExchangV^gws^Ls of October 1987, since the latter had had no

impact on the world&lt;^2pp my.   He also welcomed the growing emphasis at

such Summits on the iKp j ^or structural adjustments and supply side

policies.   Japan had l^rth^civkd an initiative at Toronto to deal with the

debt problem of middle iri^^. countries which had not been endorsed.

The initiative betrayed sZgfiaypt pressure from banks in the direction of

off-loading the risk on to^tMg&amp;yers of creditor nations.    The United

Kingdom, the United States rod^rtye Federal Republic of Germany had been

very wary of this, regarding\^t^ y a potential slippery slope.    In the

end Japan had withdrawn the ir(ry&amp;1pbre which would now be reconsidered.

By contrast, there had been a b^^kpnrough on the debt problem of the

poorest countries, following the gpdwck of support for the proposals

that he himself had launched in Wash^ere on in April 1987.    The President

of France, Monsieur Francois MitterajS^fiiad taken his own initiative

just before the Summit and the United/Sr^^es had also made its own

contribution.   The broad outlines of agreement had thus been established

to go ahead on a range of options providing for broad equivalence of

burden-sharing.   This had been a very satisfactory outcome.   A follow-up

meeting would take place within a few weeks in the Paris Club to fill in

precise details.

In discussion, it was noted that the position r~e^arn&quot;em at the Summit on

agriculture had been particularly encouraging grvVn^ip** very different

positions at the outset taken by the European Commujfi^ty^EC) and the

United States respectively.   The EC (with the except/ojrxNE the United

Kingdom) had initially wanted no further movement on ^ewjcjng

agricultural protection while paying lip service to the DOpciple:

whereas the United States had argued for an immediate co^m^fiwnt that

agricultural support levels should be reduced to zero by^be^#ar 2000,

threatening otherwise to increase her own levels of supportu^v^Fhj?

Canadian Finance Minister, Mr Michael Wilson, and the Europewi^O

Commissioner for External Trade, Mr Willy de Clerc, had playe^aV/X

constructive role in the ensuing compromise.    It was particularlyV\


encouraging that the communique had recognised the value of producer

subsidy equivalents.    This index showed that the level of agricultural

subsidy and protection had grown significantly during the years 1980 to

1986.   The percentage of farmers&apos;  incomes dependent on subsidy and

J protection was 75 per cent in Japan, 48 per cent in the EC, 45 per cent

Canada and 35 per cent in the United States.

)y$f&gt; PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that this Summit

^y/^raronto had been the best she had attended, having been very well

Wgaflrsed and well chaired by the Canadian Prime Minister,

Miv^ri^&gt; Mulroney.   The Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita,

had&lt;M^ -been very businesslike in his approach, but all would miss in

futufeXjrife-contributions of the President of the United States,

Mr Ron4^d/Reagan.

Bilateral

Relations

with Canada

THE PRIME MINLS^Elo\said that while she had been in Canada for the

Economic SummiH^sjw-shad signed a bilateral agreement with the Canadian

Government coverifngnaciprocal arrangements for the pursuit of funds and

the confiscation Nsfclb^slfets of those convicted of drug trafficking. She

had also taken the &lt;&gt;pRoj&lt; unity to explain the merits of the British

Trafalgar class nucl^jr/a^tack submarines and their suitability in

meeting the Canadian M^^nuaent.    The Canadians had told her that no

sooner had the President&gt;4$ ^ he United States, Mr Ronald Reagan, agreed

to authorise the transfetr^rjgechnology to Canada that a decision to buy

British submarines would ewt*&gt; \ than the Pentagon had begun to create

obstacles by insisting that^ra&amp;svcould cover only present and not future

technology.   The Canadian Government had told her that they were

currently engaged in an evaluarran^^f both British and French

submarines.   This seemed to be m mm than a delaying tactic.    She had

told the Canadian Government that^Tne^ritish Trafalgar class boat

provided manifestly better technolo^y^fcfvan operational and proven kind

than could be offered by the French^StfJjZrarines, which were known to be

very noisy.   After her speech to the &amp;ra2nan Parliament, a number of

Canadians had approached her to say th&amp;^they hoped the United Kingdom

would get the contract. ^

The Case of

Mr Ismail

Sowan

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaY^Ttelestinian,

Mr Ismail Sowan, had been sentenced on 16 June o^-4^*tears imprisonment

in connection with arms caches discovered by polic^4raMwis flat. There

were connections in this case with another Palestini^rj^wffo was wanted on

firearms and explosives charges connected with the mu^d^r^in London in

1987 of an Arab cartoonist, Mr Naji Salim Hussein.   The iz^exhad

revealed a mixed pattern of unacceptable activity by boW^naN

Palestinian organisation, Force 17, and Israel.   A Force xJ^9^Hcer i 

the London Office of the Palestinian Liberation Organisaticrfi^vPMO had

been requested to leave the United Kingdom and an Israeli dr^LpajaJc who

was an identified but undeclared member of the Israeli intellTgwJ^ft.


organisation, MOSSAD, had also been expelled.    The Israelis had been

reminded that British guidelines for intelligence co-operation precluded

\   undeclared MOSSAD operations in or based in the United Kingdom. The

j\ Israeli reaction had been muted;  indeed they had reportedly expected a

^Oupre severe penalty.    Nor had there been any undue excitement on the

/v^ rt of Arab Governments about the action against the PLO.    All Force 17

^.ajambers identified in Britain had now been excluded from this country.

^Tra^tovernment was pursuing with other European partners the question of

fcfrcxNl7&apos;s capability for terrorist action in Europe.

THE FORE^n&apos; AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the press continued to

seek grounds for criticising the Government&apos;s policy on Iran, either

ac*Via&gt;*Afcg&amp;&amp;3t&amp; %^^ either intimating that the

Government had changed it or that it should do so.    In fact there had

been no change/a^S^ll in the basic position or in the hard information

available abouXTv-Bolt^sh hostages.    It was possible that some

hostages were be]/ng&quot;~!raId in an area of southern Beirut controlled by the

organisation, Hiar^e-n^ft, but there were other reports of hostages being

held outside Beirut^^T}^ four British members of Parliament returned

from their visit to Jhrxfrfax 22 June.    The Archbishop of Canterbury,

Dr Robert Runcie, woutfK^e^irranging for the Foreign and Commonwealth

Office to be briefed abou* yhe visit.    Despite their reported

recommendation for the r^jronajtion of normal diplomatic relations with

Iran, there was no questi6^-&gt;f/kending British diplomats back to Tehran

in current circumstances.

Haiti

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 35.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRET^A-J^T^aid that Haiti was back under

military dictatorship following the ^5w  hrow of President Manigat by

General Henri Namphy.    United Kingdom/jmjfe^rests in Haiti were minimal.

There were 63 United Kingdom nationals driving there.   Arrangements were

in hand with Canada and the United Stated to cover their evacuation in

case of need.

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Agriculture

Council,

13-17 June

4.    THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said^j&amp;t the

Agriculture Council had met on 13-17 June to consider trc^^oB price

fixing.   His major objectives were, first, that the cost xfcf^&apos;MjA final

settlement should, in accordance with the European Council x^trctysions,

not exceed that of the Commission&apos;s initial proposals; and sA^jMjfD there

should be a green pound devaluation acceptable to United Kingtidy^i&amp;rmers

while remaining within the limits agreed with colleagues.    An ofareutk


settlement satisfactory in these terms had been reached, with 11 member

&gt;     countries voting in favour.    The Greeks, however, had at the last moment

insisted on a larger devaluation of the drachma and had invoked the

Sy\ Luxembourg compromise.    No settlement had therefore been possible. He

_^V^vad made it clear that ir. the United Kingdom&apos;s view this delay should

/O^J be allowed to lead to any breaking up of the agreed package with the

VwM^fker of its erosion.    This had been agreed.   As regards the Greek

&lt;  %k jjation, it was important that any increased offer should not itself

i^lSk a breach of the cost limit.    It should also only be modest since

other^tfrxe the tactics adopted by the Greeks in these circumstances would

set a^imgerous precedent.    The Commission had subsequently formulated a

furthej^rfoposal but this had also been rejected by the Greek

author 1^4*0  It was not yet clear whether a further meeting of the

Council ^ fuld be called at the weekend.    There was a possibility that

the mattelowould be raised at the Hanover European Council.

Foreign

Affairs

Council,

20 June

THE FOREIGN AND cfirfMO^yEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Affairs

Council had met irUjji*4^bourg on 20 June to finalise the legal texts

implementing the Brufl^fTs- European Council conclusions in the light of

the opinions from the M^^raeaxi Parliament.    The meeting was successful

and no changes of subsro ivse^rere made to the texts agreed by the Foreign

Affairs Council on 14 JuneJ/XIexts would now be adopted at the Industry

Council meeting that day would leave the way clear for the

Hanover European Council rcVf^u* on the single market as was now

proposed in a letter from Cha^^^pr Kohl to Heads of Governments.

Environment

Council,

16-17 June

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRpN^?NT said that Lord Caithness had

led the United Kingdom delegation at^&lt;5wcessful meeting of the

Environment Council on 16-17 June.    Agnaemejit had been reached on the

main elements in the large plant directV^T   In particular, targets had

been agreed for the reduction of eraissio^j of sulphur dioxide of 20, 40

and 60 per cent in 1993, 1998, and 2003 respectively.    These targets

would involve no more than the three additional retrofits that had been

authorised.   The agreement brought to an end a &gt;rf?ekracted and difficult

saga.    It would earn us credit in Europe and with Environmental

interests in the United Kingdom.   Agreement hadSa^^vxeen reached on

nitrogen oxide reduction targets.    Finally, agreeWejjjr/b^td been reached

on Community implementation of the Montreal protocol^&amp;M&quot; the protection

of the ozone layer.   Lord Caithness was to be congrari/jt^pad on these

achievements.

Internal

Market

Council,

22 June

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that &lt;K  eVhad been a

satisfactory meeting of the Internal Market Council on 22\&amp;p^v In

particular, this had reached agreement on the directive on mji^kS^

recognition of professional qualifications.    The United Kingi&amp;m^s^


position had been reserved on the issue of merger controls and much work

remained to be done in this area.    Over the period of their Presidency,

y     the Germans would have achieved agreement or positive positions on over

/\ 50 Single Market items.

Transport

Council,

20-21 June

^J^&amp;CRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that at its meeting on

2 f-2K&lt;June, the Transport Council had finally reached agreement on the

abw&apos;iti^h of quotas on road haulage throughout the Community from

1 Ja^J^J^rNl993.    This was a matter for considerable satisfaction.

HowevV*V chi Germans had launched a major attack on the United Kingdom&apos;s

derogat\ra* rn respect of heavy lorries in this country.    With the help

of the COTimission, this attack had been fended off but the problem would

not go away and further thought would have to be given to ways of

dealing with it.
