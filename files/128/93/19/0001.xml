2. IHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that a

meeting the previous day of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental

Conference had  completed  a  review of the working  of the

?y/*) Conference under Article 11 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Wide

X^/^^ponsultations had been undertaken during the review, although

(Jsjte   two  Unionist  parties  had  not  participated.      He had

&apos;ated separately to colleagues a copy of the Joint Report

e Review and of a British Government paper on developments

the signing of the Agreement which had been issued at the

Conference.   The Agreement had proved its worth. Co-

ion between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Garda

was\s cw better than ever and this was particularly important

given  the very  high  threat  of  terrorist  activity  in the

Province.   The recent local government elections in the Province

moderate politics in the



falls in the support for Sinn Fein, though not

which continued to be one of their strongholds.

Fein candidates in the election had signed a

Republican Sinn Fein candidates had

lereby disqualifying themselves.      If any

the declaration was subsequently found

The number of seats held by the

Party had conversely increased

these were hopeful signs.



THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUEFM^ia that interest rates had

been raised by 1 per cent the jfcpvious day. The rate had

previously been fixed at 13 per cent at the end of the previous

November, and this had been the longest period of interest rate

cted in

policy in order to reduce borrowing

Signs of the success of this policy were&apos;

slackening of the housing market and in

investment had continued to hold up well,

rise in the United States dollar, which few

advance, had put pressure on sterling. Initial

moved in line with other major currencies, but

came under particular attack.     Had decisive act

taken quickly to raise interest rates, the Gov

inflationary   strategy  would  have  been under

countries might well follow the United Kingdom lead

their interest rates.   The immediate effect of the in

rise had been to stabilise the sterling exchange rate,

financial markets were new awaiting the latest United  

monthly trade figures, which were about to be published. Th  e^&gt;

Exports had fallen and inports of investment goods had risen,

perhaps because seme importers were stocking up in anticipation

of a possible dock strike. Imports of consumer goods were down.

Although the current account figures were not good, they were

broadly in line with market expectations and he did not

therefore expect a marked reaction to them. The Building

Societies had indicated that they would not be raising their

interest rates: this was a sign of the damping down which had

already occurred in the housing market.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the House of Cannons

Services Committee would later that day be publishing an

report on the Government&apos;s proposed reforms of the

Health Service. The report, which the Committee had

apjj^voved by a majority of 7-2 on the previous day, would be

critical of the Government&apos;s proposals and would in particular

call for the Government to introduce pilot studies and

experimental schemes before the full implementation of its

proposals^?-^he report would not cause any surprise since the

CcmndtteeUtoAfa history of publishing reports which were

critical of^hsiGovernment. It seemed most unlikely that the

Committee&apos;s report would add anything of substance to



On the previous afternoon, he had for the

1y evidence to the Committee, and it was

very little time to reflect on what he

their report.   In calling for pilot

to want the Government to mount a

would thus lead to a completely

lementation of the Government&apos;s

ernment was already proposing,

The resolution by the

third time giv

clear that they

had said before

schemes the Commit

series of small

several years to

unacceptable delay in

proposals. In fact,

through its approach of

introduction of self-gb

practitioners (GPs&apos;) practi

in self-governing hospital

following month, and this

debate on the Government&apos;s pr

British Medical Association (B4A)

cooperate with the Government&apos;s proposed reforms did not appear

to be having any practical effect. There was seme opposition

among EMA members to the outcome of thev^Se&amp;otiaticns on a new

contract for GPs, but the EMA negotiators grerrained confident

that the forthcoming conference of their^BiflSeie would endorse

the proposed new contract.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that th

and General Workers Union (TGWU) had announced on

Friday that their members in the Dock Labour Scheme

voted by a 3-1 majority in favour of strike action.

General and Municipal Workers Union would be balloting

members in the docks later that week.   The High Court ]

the action challenging the legality of the TGWU ballot whi

had been brought by the three main port employers was expe

to be completed before the Whitsun Bank Holiday.   The two unio

had undertaken not to take strike action until after the hearing

had taken place but, depending on the outcome of the case, there

could well be industrial action, of either an official or

unofficial nature, during the following week.   Meanwhile, the

Dock Work Bill had the previous day oarpleted its passage

through the House of Commons and was now awaiting consideration

in the House of Lords.

distanct possibility that all the top leadership in China would

prove to be victims of the political crisis which the mass

student demonstrations in Peking had provoked.   Ihe Chinese

gratae.   This had been done initially wi&quot;

to provide an opportunity for the Soviet Union

rational way, however unlikely it had been that

so.   In practice there was no real possibility &lt;

matters frcm becoming public since three of those

Soviet journalists.   It had taken the Soviet Union t

hours to announce a mirror-image retaliation against

Kingdom involving the expulsion of eleven British ?

personnel (five frcm the defence side and six diplomats)

three British journalists.   Ihe Russians had also sought to

impose a ceiling on the numbers of British citizens residen

professionally in Moscow to match the ceiling of 205 that the

Government set for Soviet Embassy and other official Soviet



3

personnel in London.   But the Russians had tried to insist that

this figure in Moscow should also include Soviet citizens who

were locally employed by the British Embassy and other British

enterprises there.   This was not equating like with like, since

on that principle one would have to count in London 400 British

citizens who were locally employed by official Soviet bodies

here.   The Government had made clear to the Soviet authorities

that their response was unacceptable. There was seme evidence

that the Russians had not initially thought matters through

properly.   Nor was Britain alone in taking such action. Six

other Western countries maintained ceilings on official Soviet

_presentation in their capitals.   In the last five years seme

0 Soviet officials had been expelled from more than twelve

!tries for espionage, including a significant number in the

twelve months.   The Government&apos;s objective was to try to

the Soviet Union to change for the better its whole

to these matters both in style and substance. The

ans were aware of British concern at the highest level. It

was^just possible that after due reflection the Soviet

authorities would back away from their initial very hard-line

response, though a change of substance in the behaviour of the



[er diplomatic cover was uncertain.   The British

initial oscillation in their reactions to

The expulsion of Mr Ian Glover James of

In a brief discussion, it v^S?^rculated that the initial Soviet

the top.   The Soviet official

had seemed embarrassed in his

against the offending Soviet offic

THE FOREIGN AND OCMMDNWEAITH SECRETARY said that the debate

within the Alliance on short range nuclear forces (SNF) in

Europe would continue right up to the Summit of the North

Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on 29 and 30 May. The

Federal German Defence Minister, Dr Gerhard Stoltenberg, had

taken a new German position to Washington the previous week.

The Americans had presented an alternative which was strong on

most of the key points, but went further on conceding the

principle of negotiations and less feu: toward insisting on

modernisation of the relevant NATO forces than the United



_ lam would have wished.   Serious gaps remained in the German

ition including particularly their unwillingness to reject

icitly the possibility of the so-called third zero, whereby

the Warsaw Pact and NATO holdings of the relevant SNF would

letely abolished.   This remained very worrying given the

ing strategic principles at stake.   He himself had been

ch with the United States Secretary of State, Mr James

The latter had said that there was very little

flexibility in the American position.   He would be seeing the

Federal German Foreign Minister, Herr Hans Dietrich Genscher,

again lata^tfeat day following a reception in London to mark the

40th AnniTCrsaQL of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of

Germany.   He^roCMd repeat to him firmly the British position on

this questio!^^^^

4.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that&apos;

meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 May had

sensible and objective occasion.   The main area of dii

had been commercial relations with the United States. Pas1

tensions in this area seemed to have receded.   Italy and

were taking a less confrontational stance.   The present

indications were that the Community mic 1t well escape mention

developments provided a positive background to discussion of

Trade issues with President Bush in the coming week.   There had

also been a constructive discussion of the negotiations with

Poland for a trade and co-operation agreement.   The United

Kingdom had put forward specific ideas on an accelerated

timetable for liberalisation of quantative restrictions and

management training arrangements.

the background of the French Presidency in the second half of

the year and President Mitterrand&apos;s wish to make a historic

gesture.   While he had made clear that the United Kingdom was

unwilling to sign up to economic and monetary union, and was

also not willing to accept the stipulation in the Report that to

embark on the first stage was inseparable fran a decision to

embark upon the entire process, he saw some merit in

ventilation of the problems presented by the Report through

further discussion.   He had accordingly expressed readiness for

there to be discussion of the measures set out in Stage 1 of the

Report, which were concerned with improvement of the financial

rangements relating to completion of the single market. The

testion of membership of the exchange rate mechanism arose in

context of Stage 1 but without any timetable being set.

nish Presidency&apos;s summary of the discussion, put forward

own responsibility, had usefully detached consideration

r measures in Stage 1, which were to be given priority,

further consideration of Stages 2 and 3.   It had to be

_,nised, however, that the Economic and Finance Council was
