1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.



)LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at Committee Stage of the Football

jdments had been carried by a margin of three votes against the

&gt; f the Government which would oblige the Secretary of State to

the introduction of the national membership scheme for football

The proponents of the amendments had asserted repeatedly

ebate that the amendments would merely enable a proposal to

  the Secretary of State that the scheme should be phased in

. ^he question whether to accept any such recommendation would be

entirely at the Secretary of State&apos;s discretion.    Although the

Government&apos;s spokesman had made clear that the amendments would in fact

2.     THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that in April

1988 he and the Secretary of State for Health had set up a working party

,chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, Professor of Zoology at Oxford

Inivereity, to examine the implications of Bovine Spongiform



 ephalopathy (BSE) in relation to both animal health and any possible

\n health hazards, and to advise on any necessary measures. The



lg party had presented its report on 9 February and, in view of the

current public interest in food safety and the risk of the

&gt;arty&apos;s findings being leaked, it was necessary to publish the

*th as little delay as possible.    It would, however, raise a

lijfficult issues that required the most careful handling. BSE

neurological disorder of cattle.    It was one of a group of

diseases of the central nervous system, including scrapie

id the very rare Creutzfeldt Jakob disease in humans.    It had

been first identified by his Ministry&apos;s Central Veterinary Laboratory,

which had established that the most likely cause of the disease was the



feeding to calv

sheep affected

report stated that they considered that manufacturers of baby foods

should avoid the use of offal from ruminants.    Sir Richard Southwood had

told him that the likelihood of problems arising^4&lt;.om the use of

ruminant offal in baby food was very low indeee/an

party&apos;s suggestion represented counsel of extreiqg

Secretary of State for Health, he believed that he should

on baby food were the main problem.    In view of the extreme sensi

of this topic and of the tentative nature of the working party&apos;s

comments, he had considered that the best way forward might have been

for the Chief Medical Officer to be asked to consider the matter in

greater depth.    However,  the Chief Medical Officer had that morning told

that he did not think it would be right for him to do other than

ept the working party&apos;s finding.    That being so, the Government had



lternative but to accept the working party&apos;s conclusions on baby

^^nd to be seen to act on them.    He agreed that publication of the

&lt;0onPkshould not be long delayed.



In di^eussion, the following main points were made:



atA^e Southwood Report appeared to be less precise than might

ha p&gt;een expected of a report by eminent scientists on a matter of

sucn^moment, and its comments might well have an enormous impact on

the public and on industry.    Nevertheless, once such expert advice

was commissioned by the Government it was not feasible for

Ministersj^e^Jtopear to substitute their own judgement for it.

Unless th^CGo^xnment? s own professional advice pointed in another

direction, TVpfeVVas no option but to accept the report&apos;s findings

as the basisviMOv^licy.

d.     Even if the Government accepted the Southwood Re?

findings on baby food, there was a range of possible act

Prohibition of the manufacture of baby foods containing

offal would be the most extreme step, and this might neces

!confidential]



manufacturers themselves would almost certainly want to be seen to

cease the manufacture of such baby foods as a consequence of the

report&apos;s publication.    The position on imported baby foods would

need to be considered, as would the advice that should be offered

on the use of existing stocks of baby foods and on food for older

children.   There should be a clear line on all these points before

an announcement was made.



ME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Southwood

as likely to raise considerable alarm, and its recommendations

&quot;sa^festions were not based on precise and firm evidence.    There were

mani^^Siifficulties in handling that situation, but it had to be borne

in minJ&amp;vnat the disease&apos;s recent crossing of the species boundary from

sheep t&amp;^attle was a new phenomenon and it was not known whether a

further\kossing of the species boundary to humans was possible. In

these circumstances the guiding principle was that the Governmment

should be seen to act on properly qualified advice, and the Chief

Medical OfficeiyJjpwl a crucial role in this.    On that basis, the Minister

of Agriculturei/Fiikeries and Food and the Secretary of State for Health

should urgently&lt;IX5P?Xe a clear and accurate statement of the

Government&apos;s posif^oy/.n response to the Southwood Report, taking

of the European Community (EC) earlier in the week, Spain as the current

holder of the Presidency had been urged to seek international support

&gt;re widely for the stand taken by the EC.    In addition, the Government

taking action bilaterally in several capitals.   The Foreign and

unsuccessful policy of &quot;national reconci

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Anglo-German Summit on 20/21 February

had been held in Frankfurt at the request of the Federal German

Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, in order to give a higher public profile to

the Federal Republic&apos;s relations with the United Kingdom.    This had

attracted a considerable amount of public attention.    She had



countered little difficulty in discussions with Chancellor Kohl in

jeing on many of the major agenda items, for example the need to

protectionism and subsidies, to encourage free trade and to avoid

tMjp-e^dline of 1992 giving rise to a perception of &quot;Fortress Europe&quot;.

Cnan^t^or Kohl had also agreed with her that it was necessary for the

NorTnA^antic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to continue to have the

apprdepid^ mix of nuclear and conventional forces which should be kept

up-to-3ayiajp necessary.    But Chancellor Kohl had not been willing to

say wheprara successor system to the present Lance ground-to-ground

missile s^puld be deployed.    In their press conference they had

therefore reaffirmed in precise terms the language of the last NATO

summit, to the effect that the NATO strategy of deterrence was based

upon an appropri&lt; 3\mix of adequate and effective nuclear and

conventional fonces&lt;Aihich would continue to be kept up-to-date where

eement within the Alliance was thus

sufficiently robustly her assessment



was that the necessary decisi

Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER 8

Chancellor Kohl the question of lotj

In discussion, the following points were made:



a.     There was a different approach to pol

Federal Republic from that in the United  

as defence.    There the left wing was allowed

and the Government&apos;s public response was temp

ons on



b.     By contrast the position of the German Foreign Mini

Herr Genscher was much more ambivalent.    For example,

Chancellor, he had shown signs in discussion with the Foi

Commonwealth Secretary during the Summit of favouring furthei



!confidential!




!confidential)



I



gestures in the direction of restrictive measures against South

Africa.    He had however accepted that on chemical weapons

verification would be vital for a successful convention to ban such

weapons.   He had also accepted the need for the Alliance to present

a unanimous proposal promptly on 6 March when the new negotiations

opened on Conventional Forces in Europe, and to resolve quickly

remaining difficulties with the Turks.



It was important in assessing the tolerance of public debate

the Federal Republic to recognise that it would be very

erous for the Alliance if the current governing coalition were

replaced by a government including the German Social

s, whose policies were now considerably to the left of

ormerly favoured by Helmut Schmidt.    Moreover, the leader of

the^^ree Democratic Party, Graf Otto Lambsdorff, also seemed to

have changed his stance on the question of defence, on which he had

now become very unsound.
