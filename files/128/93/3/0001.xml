2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY sa

Japanese firm Toyota had been examining the possibili

car plant in Europe which would initially have the capaci

manufacture 200,000 cars per annum.    The United Kingdom wa

preferred location because the conditions for establishing

plant were better than in any other European country. They

seek any Government financial assistance, but merely general Go 

approval.    Toyota were collaborating with the French firm

Renault in a joint venture to manufacture engines and would also

considering whether the plant for this should be based in the United

Kingdom.    Toyota had no doubt been influenced by the Government&apos;s policy

of encouraging Japanese inward investment and of seeking to ensure that

the products could circulate freely within Europe.



iscussion, the point was made that until recently the Government had

primarily concerned to channel new industrial plants towards areas

h unemployment, but a major consideration now was the

ility of adequate land for housing.    The point was also made that

There would be a panel discussion between Lord

In discussion, the following points were made:



a.     Lord Windlesham&apos;s report was a disgraceful whitewash.    One of

the worst things about it was that even where an acknowledgement

that there had been something wrong with the television programme

was unavoidable the report had put an exculpatory gloss on matters,

describing such instances as no more than small lapses.



The bias of Lord Windlesham&apos;s report was hardly surprising

rven that Thames Television had appointed the Chairman of another

&apos;evision company to preside over the inquiry.    In that sense it

sSb media-based and not an independent inquiry. 



c\^   If the Government was to take detailed issue with the report

it would be important to concentrate on the errors of fact in

the programme rather than matters of opinion.    But it would be

THE PRIME MINISTER said that she was greatly concerned about the extent

of fraud in the Community revealed by investigations carried out by the

ourt of Auditors.    Its report had indicated, for example,  that no

fiance could be placed on the published figures for the quantities and

is of products held in intervention storage at the end of the

jial year nor on the related expenditure in the year.    There had

Iggestions that the sums involved in fraud could amount to as much

cent of the total European Community budget, or  6 billion.

uiich offered opportunities for malpractice.    It appeared that

cne ^om^ssion were powerless to carry out adequate follow up action.

If it were the case, as had been suggested,  that in Italy fraudulent

claims had been a source of finance for the mafia the issue was still

more serious. &gt;^JUjjere was little evidence that the Commission paid

REFORM

THE

HEALTH

SERVICE



5.   The Cabinet considered a draft White Paper on the reform of the

National Health Service (NHS), circulated under cover of a memorandum by

the Secretary of State for Health (E(A)(89) 2).



THE PRIME MINISTER said that the central theme of the White Paper was

he need to provide a better service for patients.    It emphasised the

ed to devolve as much responsibility as possible within the NHS down

ine to those who provided the service to the patient. Important

s which it proposed included the establishment of self-governing

Is within the NHS; budgets for some General Practitioner (GP)

for a defined range of services; tax relief for medical

a premiums for the elderly; removing the political element from



_..orities and making them more efficient and businesslike

and the creation of an extra 100 consultant posts and reform of

.?.^ of consultants&apos; contracts.    The package of reforms was

consistent with the Government&apos;s general philosophy while retaining an

NHS which was open to all, regardless of income, and financed mainly out

of general tajxpti^

Health Authorities, GPs and the^

would move away from direct proviVi

be responsible for buying services

hospitals, as they judged best to me

served.    A new and simpler method of

would be introduced, based on weighted



cent for the Thames Regions to recognise the special problems of the

capital.    Larger GP practices would be able if they wished to hold their

own budgets for a defined range of services,  y^uMing in particular

elective surgery.    All these changes would hei t&lt;vensure that in future

money went with patients to those parts of theNfo ??wet able to meet

their needs. \1/  



The composition of the Health Authorities would be cWanzpd^   They would

be smaller bodies, with a balance of executive and not^e^e^itive

members, and managerial in character with the removal of^H/P^political

element in their membership.    Family Practitioner Commit^^?*y|so would

be reformed to remove the domination of representatives o?

practitioners whose contracts they managed, and to give a gr,

weighting to consumer interests.    The White Paper also propo

important reforms to increase value for money.   There would be

of medical audit throughout the service to monitor and raise me

standards.   The Audit Commission would be given responsibility fo



confidentIaH




auditing the accounts of the NHS, and would undertake wide-ranging value

for money studies.    Separate chapters in the White Paper dealt with the

application of its principles to the separate systems in Scotland, Wales

and Northern Ireland.



^Rhese reforms would be controversial with many professionals, but should

,^fcpNwelcomed to the public generally.    The Government would be able to

?^^Aj&gt;{1strate that it was committed to maintaining and strengthening the

!nd in particular that the main objective of its reforms was to



the service for patients.    As to presentation and timetable, the

was to publish the White Paper, with an oral statement

^,int, on 31 January.   A major exercise was being mounted to

?it to NHS staff to help produce an immediately favourable



Following publication of the White Paper working papers would

be published inviting comments not on the principle of the reforms but

on how they could best be implemented in practice.    Major legislation

would be need^JP-iifcxt Session to provide for many of the changes, for

example the i^troej^ction of self-governing hospitals and the changes in

the compositiony f~ tealth Authorities.    The benefit of some of the



:ting patients, should be felt quickly, and by

including the first self-governing hospitals,



changes, direct

those who were likely to

participants in last year&apos;



lain points were made:



criticism of the proposals in the White

s in the NHS.    Some of those who

nt1s objectives might be reluctant to

orts should be made to encourage

P9*X the proposals - such as

rs - to speak out.



It was also important th^^J^ormation about the Government&apos;s

proposals should be available tc^/cjj^/public at large quickly and in

a readily comprehensible form,    ,mb Department of Health

were planning a shorter version of^the White Paper, which

was mainly for NHS staff but would also be helpful to the general

public; a shorter leaflet which would be generally available, for

example at Post Office counters; and a v/GTednf or NHS staff which

should also be made available for the pi

c. The proposal to increase the number  

would have a greater effect than that number

problems of waiting lists and the working hour

This was because the additional posts would be

in a few specialities, such as general surgery, ge

medicine and obstetrics, where these problems were
