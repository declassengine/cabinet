THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the four trades

representing manual workers in the electricity supply

try had balloted their members for industrial action if

s no satisfactory outcome to their pay negotiations with

loyers.   Three of the four unions had secured a majority

ivour of an all-out strike: in the fourth, there had been a

majority in favour of industrial action falling short of a

strike.   Negotiations were continuing and industrial action was

unlikely f^^pne two weeks.   He hoped that, in that time, ways

of achie\ unq 4f_satisfactory settlement would be found.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the British Medical

Association ( 2  ) would be holdi!?g a special conference in the

following week which, together with a poster campaign, would

mark a new phase of their opposition to the Government&apos;s

proposals for the reform of the National Health Service (NHS).

Ihe Association&apos;s aim was to persuade the Government to abandon

their proposed legislation and to negotiate new proposals with

e Association.   However, he was encouraged by two

elopments.   The first was the satisfactory settlement of the

tiations with the BMA on a new contract for general

itioners (GPs).   The settlement had been achieved without

concessions by the Government and should diminish the

ss of GPs to mobilise in support of the EMA&apos;s wider

ign against the NHS reforms.   Although seme local

ttees might reject the settlement, the EMA negotiators were

confident that the majority of their members would endorse their

recommendation that it be accepted.   They also knew that the



settlerneiv

100 hospitals and units had expressed interest

likely that there would be a much

proposals for self-governing status

isaged.   The Government would need to

statements on the issue.   It was

THE FRLM1-; MINISTER, summing up the^dfscussion, said that the new

contract for GPs would reward those^jjoctors who were most

efficient, who attracted and retained most patients and who

achieved performance targets.   The Cabinet would wish to

congratulate the Secretary of State for HarfHh on the successful

conclusion of the negotiations. })

on the



ropean Commission

roposals on

ehicle Emission

tandards



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the

European Commission had earlier that week tabled revised

proposals on exhaust emission standards for small cars. The

proposals involved a two-stage arrangement under which the

standards which the Environment Council had previously agreed




jUUNrlUfcMl   ] J



should come into force in 1993 should instead operate from

1991, and tighter controls, equivalent to those applying in the

United States and elsewhere, should cane into force in 1993.

!here appeared to be an emerging consensus among member states

in favour of the adoption of United States standards fran 1993.

Ihese standards could currently be met oily by fitting three-way

catalytic converters.   But it was hoped that in sane 4-5 years,

t might be possible to meet these standards by means of lean-

engines, which would be more fuel efficient.   He had

itly had discussions with representatives of Rover, which

;lanning to produce lean-burn engines and which was working

w car that was expected to cut fuel consumption by seme

yr cent.   He would later that day be seeing representatives

Ford, which had recently opened a plant which was expected

course to produce seme 250,000 lean-burn engines each

year.



In discus^en^ the following main points were made:



(a) Ihe



Governmen

connection

inevitably

for any



careful account

on prices, espec

was already too hi



environmental protection measures which the

idy agreed to undertake, in particular in

water and sewerage industries, would

igher prices.   In considering proposals

)!!mental protection measures, very



to be taken of the likely impact

a time when the rate of inflation



(b) Catalytic conve

more carbon dioxide

tend to worsen the gr

were expensive, had a

vulnerable to being stolen

remained a problem of hew

end of its useful life. Cata



more fuel and emitted

engines, and would thus

ffect.   Catalytic converters

e^ expectancy and wire

?ked cars; and there



of a converter at the

coiTvertors made use of



platinum, for which the Soviet&quot;,Qpion and South Africa were

the only sources, and the establishment of a Community

standard which effectively required the use of catalytic

converters could be expected to drive jdp^&amp;ie price of

platinum on the world market.   &apos;Ihe us4{of vconvertors would

only provide a temporary and unsatisfab b y~^t&gt;lution until

lean-burn engines were available.   AgainM^Jnla background,

there was a strong case for resisting the^jM^sgion&apos;s

proposals. 1



(c) On the other hard, France, which was the only?jg feer

member state which might oppose the proposals, a(

almost certain to accept them provided that it al^j

agreement to the introduction of speed limits thr

Community.   If, in the event, the United Kingdom

were to block the Commission&apos;s proposals, there wouldN

fragmentation of standards in the market in cars which&quot;

be most unwelcome to British manufacturers.   The United* &gt;

Kingdom should nevertheless strongly resist the introduction?^

of an intermediate standard in 1991. ^



_ 3



[confipentialI


!confidential}



(d) Cars sold in this country were grossly overpriced

compared with those sold in other Ccramjnity countries and

the United Kingdom should press for Ccttttunity initiatives to

tackle this.



(e) It was possible that, in the future, there would be a

growing demand at the lower end of the market for cars

fitted with fairly rudimentary diesel engines. British

manufacturers would need to be prepared for this.



?J^JRIME: MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was

&quot;oxical that the Commission should be pressing for tighter

emission standards which, &apos;under present technology,

be achieved only at the expense of a worsening of the

louse effect and when only an interim period needed to be

covered before lean bum technology was available on the mass

market.   The Cabinet agreed that the United Kingdom should

resist th^ea&amp;enission&apos;s intermediate stage proposals for 1991.

The Secrdmr^jif State for the Environment should take account

of the poih&amp;^fcile in discussion in negotiations on the

remainder o^vtJ^^pmmission&apos;s proposals.

repared to change their position on early negotiations. He

precedent of the international agreement on chlorofluorocarbons

(CFCs), where the Vienna Convention had been followed by the

Montreal Protocol.    Ihe next step was to promote these British
