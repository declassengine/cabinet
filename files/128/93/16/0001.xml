1.     TOE FOREIGN AND OCMNENWEALTO SECRETARY said that the day

marked the tenth anniversary of Her Majesty Ihe Queen&apos;s

invitation to the Prime Minister to form an administration,

following the 1979 General Election.   The completion of a

continuous decade in office was, in itself, an historic feat

that was unmatched by any Prime Minister in modern times, but

the achievement went far beyond mere statistics.   During that

period the authority of government had been restored, the

economy had been brought back to health and the United

//\^A Kingdom had been re-established in a position of influence

6^ y^nd respect abroad.   These very great achievements stemmed

the courage, leadership and clear vision of the Prime

.ster.   On behalf of all his Cabinet colleagues, he wished

&gt;ress their pride in serving in her administration.



The Cabinet -



endorsed the Foreign and Commonwealth

s remarks, and offered their

ations to the Prime Minister on the

versary of her taking office.

were inevitably difficult ones.   These issu

contracts of general practitioners in the Nat

Service; the legislation on the privatisation

and electricity supply industries; the legal prof

response to the Government&apos;s proposals for refomf

Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the

beer; and the abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme,

addition, there was the possibility of  industrial ac

during the summer, which the media might well present

exaggerated and sensational fashion.   It was most impor

that Ministers should keep a close eye both on individual

3.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that it was

now one month since the Government had announced that



islation would be introduced to abolish the Dock Labour

,erne.   Ihe Transport and General Workers Union had arranged

rk-place ballot from 10-17 May with a further short

iod for postal votes.   In an attempt to ensure that any

tant industrial action was regarded as a lawful trade

dispute, the union had made no reference to the Dock Labour

Scheme &gt;avthe ballot paper, which simply asked whether union



d be prepared to take part in strike action.

Ihe    ^ j^jij^Loyers, who had been acting very sensibly, would

It was clearly prudent that contingency

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that London

Underground was seeking an injunction in the High Court that

day against an indefinite strike by London Underground

workers which was due to begin on the following Monday, it

was likely that the case would be taken to appeal, and

tentative arrangements had been made for any such appeal to

be heard on the following day.   London Underground hoped that

industrial action could be averted, but as a contingency his

j^X&lt;\ Department were in touch with the police about the

yyf^ implications of a prolonged London Underground strike for

^\^3ther forms of transport in London.

4.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH S

Prime Minister had had talks the preceding

Dutch Prime Minister, Mr Lubbers, and the I

Minister, Signor de Mita, as well as with

the Federal Republic of Germany about how to

subject of short range nuclear forces (SNF) in

relation to the forthcoming North Atlantic Treaty

Organisation (NATO) Summit.   On modernisation of &apos;

there was seme prospect of progress with Chancellor

rest of the ad lies seemed likely to go along with this. But

on the question of whether the West should offer

negotiations on SNF, the support for the United Kingdom&apos;s

position was more limited.   Apart from the United States, the

main support came from the Netherlands.   Following the

resignation of the Dutch government, it would continue on a

caretaker basis pending new elections but would be unable to

take any initiatives, though it was to be hoped that its

support on the SNF issue would not weaken.   There was a risk

that the Americans might seek seme compromise solution in

y//^\ advance of the Summit.   The fact nevertheless remained that



yOro such negotiations could be initiated with the Soviet Union
