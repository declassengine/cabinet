1. !he Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Cannons in the following week.



    PRIME MINISTER said that, while the Heme Secretary&apos;s

statement earlier in the week on the disaster at the Sheffield

Wednesday Football dub Ground at Hillsborough had recognised

that it would be seemly to allow a short delay in proceedings on

the Football Spectators Bill, which currently awaited its Third

Reading in the House of lords, the Government was now caning

under pressure to drop the Bill or to postpone it to the

following session.   She had discussed this matter earlier that

with the Ministers most closely concerned.   There had

been four decades of crcwi trouble and, more recently,

liganism at football matches, which had led to nearly 300

if the Heysel Stadium disaster was taken into account,

nuntoers of police were now routinely diverted from other

to maintain order at major matches and arrests for



connected with football were new running at about

a year.   As for hooliganism, a national membership scheme,

had originally been recommended by Mr Justice Fopplewell&apos;s

Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports

Grounds, represented the only cenprehensive approach that had

in any way expected.   If the Gov!

controversial proposals such as those for all-seated



aaxmmodation.   The situation an crowd

In discussion the following main points were made -



a.    Lord Justice Taylor&apos;s present intention was to

an interim report on physical measures by June or July/

that it could be taken into account by clubs in planning^

their arrangements for the following season.   That interi



!confidential!




!confidential]



report might also include seme comments on administrative

arrangements, such as ticket allocation. While the Government

could clearly not dictate to Lortf Justice Taylor how he

should proceed, it would be perfectly proper to indicate to

him that if he had any recommendations to make about early

legislation, then they should be submitted in time to enable

the Government to act on them.



b.    The main reason for the current signs of faltering

support for the Football Spectators Bill among Government

backbenchers was that proceeding with it at a rapid pace

appeared to pre-enpt the findings of Lord Justice Taylor&apos;s

inquiry.   In fact, the disaster at Hillsborough appeared to

largely attributable to basic design characteristics of

stadium and the nature of the surrounding spaces,

igh these points might seem clear with hindsight, it had

recognised that Hillsborough had generally enjoyed a

1?ably good reputation hitherto.  The problem was a

vlex one that merited a full analysis, and the analysis

might make it difficult to justify a requirement for all-seat

grounds     the incident proved to have been caused by factors

ground in question.   In any event, those hostile

Spectators Bill would certainly give evidence

Taylor&apos;s inquiry and this would receive much

.ght be difficult to prevent the inquiry

of the Bill, and this could be very

if the Bill was simultaneously going

Commons.



outsi

to

to



publici

becoming a

add to the

all-seated

provisions. Progr

be made pending a sta

guidance to the local a!

progress could be made wi

.   Seme football clubs had

tfieia^tfttenticn of moving towards



likely that a good deal of

slaticn.



d.    On the other hand, all-sea^d arrangements, like a

membership scheme, would cost money that football clubs would

be very reluctant to provide.   On the whole, football clubs

were wedded to the idea of lew entrance^fefes and high

attendances and the football authorititevwe weak and

unreliable.   It was unlikely that delay^arKjNreveal any

consensus about measures to be taken and &amp;&gt;9 A|d be unsafe

to have confidence in the football industr^Kf^gpises or in

offers of support from the Opposition.



e.    The football culture had changed considerabl

last 20 years or so.   There was new a strong li

excessive drinking, and very often an atmosphere

violence at major matches.   No other sport required

supporters to be segregated as did football.   It was

in some quarters that neither a membership scheme nor

seated arrangements would make any difference to the  

If that were really true, football would forfeit any



the



!confidential!




!confidential}



and should be judged



entitlement to be regarded as a sport,

simply as a public order problem..



f.    In any event, it would be paradoxical if, in response to

a major disaster, the Government were to suspend action

designed to prevent further disasters.   One approach might be

to give more emphasis to the safety aspects of its proposals,

for example by re-titling the Football Membership Authority

as the Football Safety Authority.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

;potball Spectators Bill was based on the recommendations of the

Judge - Mr Justice Popplewell - who had considered the

lems associated with football.   There was a very strong

or making progress with it to provide the Government with

le for carrying any urgent recommendations that might now

by Lord Justice Taylor. Without such a vehicle, there

be no way of taking any legislative action on lord

Taylor&apos;s recommendations until at least next session.

Furthermore, delay in enacting the Bill would inevitably lead to

f the National Membership Scheme which had been

Mr Justice Popplewell as long ago as January

amounted to a most powerful case for

Football Spectators Bill this session.

Meanwhile, the ports had been working normally for the previous

ten days or so.   Port employers and port users held been using

the period since the announcement of the abolition of the Scheme

to make dispositions against possible industrial action, and

the stockpiling of itrports which was taking place would have a

short-term impact on the balance of payments figures.

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCTTAMy^Sd that the community

charge had now been in operation ij^ecotland for about three

weeks.   The implementation of the new arrangements was

proceeding smoothly, and the issue had almost completely

disappeared from the press.   It would not bepossible until the

summer to form a clear view of hew many pa pts\would refuse to

pay their camunity charge, but present smqs ^sere that the

numbers would be relatively small, though Qe^mtoht include

charge and virtually 2111 local authorities in Scot!

chosen to set the charge at the maximum rate.   As a

of those with second heroes were now paying a good deal

than they had previously paid under domestic rates. Thi

included many people of relatively modest means who cwned

small retirement hemes, or small flats or houses which they

was being criticised for having given local authorities

discretion on this matter, and simil u: criticisms would no doubt

be levelled against the Government when the oannunity charge

came into effect in England and Wales in the following year.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that London

underground drivers were staging an unofficial 24 hour strike

that day, following their earlier unofficial strike on 5 April,

unofficial action was in pursuit of a claim by drivers of

operated trains for an increase in pay, backdated to

1985, of an amount representing 50 per cent of guards&apos;

order to restore their pay differentials with drivers

operated trains.   Although the unions had urged

to work normally, only about 10 per cent of

were operating that day. This was partly the result of

dation of seme London underground employees.   There would

be further talks between management and the unions on 2 May



about a

manag!

from the

future, it

be taken on

at least until

the Administration were now beginning to engage in the search

for a way forward.   They did not support the idea of an early

international conference but they would try to build on the

proposals put forward by the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak

Shamir, for elections in the occupied territories. The

Government needed to continue to encourage the Americans to

remain positively engaged in this process.    As for the coming

Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation at the end of

May, the United Kingdom and the United States had cannon

objectives, which were to remain firm in avoiding any

commitment to arms control negotiations over short range nuclear

prces while securing forward movement on the need for

rnisaticn of such forces on the Western side. The

icans were however dismayed at the evidence of Chancellor

apparently dwindling resolution on key Alliance issues,

his recent reversal of an earlier decision to lengthen

?iod of compulsory military service in the Federal German

lie from 15 to 18 months.   The Administration were thus

on the need to avoid an arms control commitment than they

were at pushing forward on modernisation.   The United Kingdom

needed to mintain pressure on both the Americans and the

Germans on^fi \modernisation objective.

was keeping closely under review the&amp;position of the British

Embassy in Beirut and the safety of the few staff who remained

there.   The Embassy was seme 5 kilometres distance from the

place where the Spanish Ambassador had bea!^R\\led and so far no

Western Embassy had withdrawn from Beirut!

remained a valuable listening post, particuI56fTy^^gainst the

background of the United Kingdom&apos;s role as a\^e*j^jpnt Member of

the United Nations Security Council and of the,

detention in Lebanon of British hostages.



THE FRIME MINISTER said that withdrawal of the Brit

personnel might nevertheless become unavoidable if

conclusion was that the staff there were in great

real purpose and that further delay seemed likely to 1

IHE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEALIH SECRETARY said that there would be

a State Visit to the united Kingdom from 9 to 11 May ty the

Nigerian President, General Ibrahim Babangida.    The programme

provided for the customary series of banquets.    So far it

appeared that no Cabinet Minister had accepted an invitation to

attend the banquet at the Guildhall on 10 May and that the Prime

Minister and he were the only Cabinet Ministers to have accepted

the return banquet hosted by the Nigerians on 11 May.   He hoped

that colleagues who had received invitations would look again at

their diaries.



PRIME MINISTER said it was important for a proper level of

at such banquets to be achieved.

Delors Group    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the meet

Report on        Council had coincided with the publication of the

Economic and    Committee under the chairmanship of the President of

Monetary Union Commission,   Delors, on economic and monetary union in

European Community.   Ihis was essentially a political

not argued in terms of economic advantage although there

seme assertions of economic gain.   Ihe report explicitly

IconfidentIaJ




!confidential]



out a route to economic and monetary union, starting in July

1990 but with no defined timetable thereafter.   This would

involve ultimately a single currency, a European central bank,

a new central economic institution to control fiscal and funding

policies for the whole Community, and a further increase in

structural funds.   Ihe report acknowledged that this would

represent a &quot;quantum jurrp&quot;: it was more than this since it would

clearly lead towards a federal Europe requiring new Treaty

powers.  He hoped that colleagues would read the report, which

was very clearly set out, paying special attention to paragraph

39, which was particularly damaging.   This made two points:



that embarking on the first of the three stages set out

report represented a decision to embark on the entire



and second, that preparatory work on Treaty amendment

be put in hand immediately.   Nothing in the first stage

required new powers.



    CHANCELLOR OF IHE EXCHEQUER said that at the

he had made clear the United Kingdom&apos;s approach to the

report.   While we were fully in favour of close economic and

be made of the existing powers in the

this end.   Ihe only other Minister to

accepted that the essential issue was

In discussion there

a correct representation of

recognition that the issue woo]

United Kingdom Ministers to

was a need both to head off the



an inter-gwernraental conference 6&amp;aevise amendments to the

Treaty and to spell out the extent \a&gt; which the practical steps

that would be taken under stage 1 of the Delors proposals would

both be beneficial in themselves and possible within the



that the report raised issues

United Kingdom.   Ihe line taken

ir, both at the Economic and



press conference, has been

the approach in the report on the basis that inplementatvijp

unlikely that the people of Europe, as distinct from some

their governments, would be content with the secession of

structures for economic and monetary, union could well create

demands for extensions of democratic control and increases in

the powers of the European Parliament.



    SECRETARY OF STATE PCR TRACE AND INDUSTRY said that, though

the problems with France over the inport of Nissan cars

manufactured in the United Kingdom had new been resolved, on

following day it had become clear that Italy had devised

cles to put in the way of these vehicles.   This was a

exaitple of countries who were prepared to espouse the

of a federal Europe being ready to set aside the strict



of Cccitunity law when it suited them.   He had been

a^fa d by Commissioner Bangemann that the Occmission would take

action against Italy.
