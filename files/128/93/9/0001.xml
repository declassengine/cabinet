THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that a booklet

yled &quot;Progress on Cities&quot; had been published that morning to mark

fst anniversary of the Government&apos;s Action for Cities initiative,

to illustrate region by region the substantial progress which

made in the regeneration of inner cities.    At a press

conrv^fiCe. to launch the booklet, a number of colleagues had made

annoui^^fjj^nts about various inner city initiatives,  including an

announcement by the Secretary of State for Employment of four new

initiatives to encourage inner city residents to take part in Employment

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the Brit^if^^l

Association (BMA) was mounting a sustained and strident

was ostensibly directed against the White Paper on the

National Health Service but was in reality aimed more at

Government&apos;s proposals on the remuneration of General Prac

(GPs).    At present, salaries contained a large fixed elemen

independent of individual GPs&apos; productivity.    Under the Govef

proposals, GP &apos; remuneration would vary according to the numbe

patients which they attracted and their success in achieving targets for

new services, including health promotion sessions and minor surgery, and

preventive measures such as vaccinations and cervical cancer screening.

There would be no reduction in the total pay bill, but the Government&apos;s

3roposals would have the effect of increasing the pay of efficient and

;rgetic GPs at the expense of those who performed less well. These

^angements, which were consistent with those for determining the pay

fher professional groups, would encourage a better service to the

of General Practitioners in which he would once again explain

its of the proposed new arrangements.    However, the media were

ns by the BMA,  for example that as a result of the Government&apos;s

!/L^pu,     . AIDS patients might not receive proper medical care and

elderly patients might no longer be accepted by certain practices.

Negotiations with the BMA over the proposed remuneration package had

been in progra*^.for about a year, and he was clear that the matter

needed to beiietiled within the next three or four weeks so that it did

not become in&lt;3trti^ ed with the issues to be dealt with in the Health

Services Bill ifft])*? following session.    The BMA, which was representing

the interests of&lt;&amp;jiWeast efficient GPs, had sought to claim that the

White Paper had clrafl^^^he situation and that it was necessary to begin

the negotiations af\^Jrf vas it was beginning to realise, however, he was

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that as expected the

Iranians had formally broken off relations with the United Kingdom on

7 March.    There had been an ineffectual attempt by Iranian moderates te

stave off this break, with an allegation that the British Government had

proposed a meeting of British and Iranian officials in Geneva last week:

he Government had in fact rejected a proposal for such a meeting. He

informed the House of Commons on 8 March that in consequence of

Iranian action in breaking off relations the Government had decided

se the Iranian Consulate General in Hong Kong.    He had also been

announce,  following a meeting with other Ministers principally

that the Government intended to deport a number of locally

eng^gj^imembers of the former Iranian Embassy along with some other

knownX^^ists.    The details of these cases would be looked at

indiv1 cally by the Home Secretary.    This was a matter of security, not

retaliation.    He and other Ministers had considered possible additional

measures against Iran in the event of further Iranian inspired outrage.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had attended a

meeting in Vienna on 6 March of the 35 member states of the Conference

on Co-operation and Security in Europe to launch two sets of new

egotiations, on conventional forces in Europe and on further

fidence-building measures respectively.    The negotiations were

inning formally that day (9 March).    Agreement had been reached

the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on a Western

ting proposal on conventional forces in Europe after intense last

fforts to resolve remaining differences.    As the first Alliance

for  XXfsets of talks, which amounted to a crisp, clear and concise

herrings about the inclusion of naval forces and early negotiations on

foreigners were being excluded from Tibet.    There were two resident

British citizens.    Two British journalists who had visited Tibet as

tourists were also being required to leave a  e^*nvestigation by the

Chinese.    A correspondent of The Times was a(|0 Uill in Tibet: his



precise whereabouts were unknown but he was  

to be in any immediate danger.    He had raised

Foreign Minister when he had met him at the Jap

In a brief discussion,  it was noted that despite the fact that the Dalai

Lama acknowledged Chinese sovereignty and was concentrating on trying to

improve living conditions in Tibet, much of the protest on the part of

the Tibetan people seemed increasingly to be an expression of



tionalisra and of resentment of what they viewed as Chinese occupation.



IGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of South

i^lerk, as leader of the National Party, had taken over

increasingly reluctant to accept that President Botha should remain.

Ministers in charge of Bills to give their ?   tn ?   &apos; 



The planning of the programme would also de

selection of an adequate number of major Bif

Lords, and he asked colleagues to co-operate

In discussion the following main points were made



a.      The proposed programme would be exceptional!

both Houses since it contained a number of import;

there were strong opinions that were not entirely

lines.    The Broadcasting Bill, the Health Services Bi

Courts and Legal Services Bill were prime examples of

protection of the environment was now such a sensitive

its proposals were not especially controversial in themselves. The

successful presentation to the public of this difficult programme

would require a great sustained effort by the Government, and it

would be unrealistic to contemplate the addition of any further

controversial material.



The case for including the Town and Country Planning Bill was

vertheless a strong one.    The Government&apos;s proposals were known,

there was widespread expectation that they would be implemented

tly.    Any postponement would expose the Government to

ksed criticism in this area and, in any event, some of the

provisions were inappropriate for legislation in the fourth

...ion.    The proposed improvements in compensation arrangements

for compulsorily acquired property were, however, much needed

provisions that would be widely welcomed and would defuse much

opposition^-fco major developments.

that the nature of the

amendments on abortion  

Health was in discussion

which this might be handled



d.     The proposed Bill to ena^Cirt^ United Kingdom to join in

international arrangements for     ^  legal assistance was expected

to have a smooth Parliamentary p^Bage, though it was of

substantial length.    The remaining^components of the large Criminal

Justice Bill proposed by the Home Secretary were of a far more

controversial nature and for that reason QL had recommended that

action on them should be postponed to a ^etXt session.

situation on that topic might well develop  

The Conservative Manifesto at the last gener

to that end.    As a result, support was now being cd

the position on Sunday mornings was less clear.    An  

Motion would shortly be put down in the House of Common

support for a compromise policy of that nature in quarters

Government would not wish to appear to ignore.    Maintaining such an

unresolved situation might be somewhat uneasy, and the matter was

clearly unsuitable for legislation in the fourth session.

Furthermore,  the continued flouting of the present law was a matter

of concern to the Law Officers and it was always possible that

there would be a legal development in this field that precipitated

ka sudden crisis.



While a Bill on restrictive trade practices might not find a

!raent concern and it was important that .the Goverhment should

,amue to work up its proposals and announce them in good time,

hat legislation could be ready for introduction at the outset

he fourth session of the Parliament.

h.     The Pensions (Miscella^f^J^J&apos;rovisions) Bill was described ?

Annex A to C(89) 5 as having &gt;M^econdary purpose of scoring

pension increases against the^jS^IVnal funds that existed for

teachers and the National Healt^ p^ice.    Those provisions had not

been considered by the Ministerswpncerned, and their inclusion in

the Bill depended on policy approval being obtained in the normal

way.    The Bill&apos;s place in the programme was not dependent on this,

since it was necessary to implement certain European Community

requirements relating to widowers&apos; pens^*&quot;

should be the one to accommodate a good share of the more controversial

legislation remaining to be enacted in the present Parliament. Taken

together, these two pressure would impose a heavy burden on the whole

^legislative machinery.    The Cabinet agreed with the Lord President that

1e programme submitted by QL represented the limit of what could be



)aged, and endorsed his view that there should be no significant

ij:ions to the programme unless room could be found for them by

;ting reductions.    Since the Cabinet was unable to identify any

the programme which should be discarded, the programme set out
