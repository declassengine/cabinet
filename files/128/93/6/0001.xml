1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that on the following day The

Lancet would carry a Public Health Laboratory Service report on listeria

hich found listeria to be present in fairly large samples of various

stuffs available to the public.    Some indication of the contents of

report had become known the previous week, and that had led the

Medical Officer to issue guidance to the public on Friday 10

y.   That guidance had warned pregnant women and certain other

that were at high risk from listeriosis not to eat certain foods

oft cheese, and to take specified precautions on the

of other foodstuffs such as pre-cooked poultry and

chilled meals.    The Opposition had chosen food and water

. the subject for debate on the following Tuesday, but he

believed that the range of action being taken by the Government was

producing a more settled atmosphere and that the Opposition would

rightly be pevtfStved as irresponsibly trying to stir up public hysteria.

One point    /  (  he was acting was to stipulate the temperature at

which pre-cooVSJL^R^.led foods should be stored in all food businesses:

he had now rece((e^//j^e necessary advice from the experts that 5 C was



ture for this purpose and he had made it known

is under the Food Hygiene Regulations as soon

ik, the Opposition spokesman on health, had

entirely separate question of the

s used in the National Health Service. The

uidelines for this system, which had been

s the appropriate storage temperature

^is figure, rather than 5 C, was the

,re-cooked chilled foods under the Food

to deal with Mr Cook&apos;s confusion in

vnity to claim that he had put

&apos;jjjijjiic&apos;s interests at heart.



THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a      ^ cuss ion, said that action was

in hand on the specific food safety Vj&gt;4* 8 that had been identified in

recent weeks, but that public awareneA had been raised on matters of

food safety and of hygiene generally, and new areas of concern might

emerge with little notice.    One such public health matter that was

coming to attention was the increase in numbe^a&gt;of rats following two

mild winters in succession.    It was a mattew/ofnommon observation that

restaurants and other businesses were in th^Jgpbtl^of leaving

inadequately packaged perishable refuse on thef^avment.    This was

unacceptable, and the increase in rats made a &amp;u ^!34ybation worse. The

time might be coming when legislation would have v&lt;5^epintroduced to

place a duty on businesses to dispose of their refi^g^^iv^ proper

fashion.



The Cabinet -



Took note.



the appropriate

that he would pre:

as possible.    Mr Rol

confused this issue

and Mr Cook was suggesting^

one that should be specified

2.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

figures for January would be published that day.    The seasonally

adjusted total had fallen by 49,300 to 1.988 million.    The reduction in

unemployment below two million, for the first time for around eight

years, would be seen as a very important milestone.    This was the 30th

pnsecutive monthly reduction, and the rate of unemployment had fallen

per cent, which was below the European Community average and, in

icular, was below the rates in Italy, France, Belgium, the



lands, Spain and the Republic of Ireland as well as Canada. The

ion would seek to distract attention from these very welcome

ons in unemployment by contending that the figures had been



lly depressed by means of various changes in the definition of

t&apos;.    The Opposition were claiming that the real level of

nt stood at something over three million, but the forthcoming

rce Survey for 1988 was expected to confirm the trends shown by

the monthly unemployment statistics.    The Labour Party manifesto at the

previous General Election had claimed that a Labour Government would

reduce unemplyriie^Qt by 1 million within two years, but this now

contrasted uifayflglrably with the actual reduction of 966,000 which had

been achieved^ra^tlWk period since the General Election campaign. The

unadjusted totaU^f^Aieemployment had increased by 28,000 to 2.074

million in the p^5^^l/5^.nce December 1988.    This total invariably rose



tmae, and the increase on this occasion had

pared with previous years.    While it was true

tively mild winter, there had probably been

iou8 years among workers in the



rable weather conditions would have done

umber of redundancies which regularly

otably tourism, in the period



  especially encouraging feature was

less than five months since the



ritish



ferospace PLC



programme was launched, and the succes? of the programme demonstrated

that, even though the trend of unemployment had been very favourable in

recent months, the Government was far from coe!Aacent.    The number of

people in work had never been higher, even rftfcldding those in training.

unemployment and employment remained very enco!

and Plymouth, and this would create welcome employment opportunities m

reas where the rate of unemployment was higher than average.

3.     tfl&amp;iOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the reactioon from

AyatoliAh Khomeini of Iran to Mr Salman Rushdie&apos;s book &quot;The Satanic

Verses&quot; called to mind the fanaticism of other religions in the past,

including those within the Western tradition.   What made matters more

difficult to handle now was the propagation worldwide of local reactions

through the inm^ especially television, as well as the fact that there

were many re{F1qsje*j&amp; ives of such creeds as Islam spread widely through

the international cypmunity.    A further complication was the continued



Roger Cooper, and uncertainty over the recent

sentence had been passed on him.   It was

to make clear that the public threat

s unacceptable and that such behaviour by

maintenance of proper relations between

rnment should avoid complete rupture

&apos;Affaires had called on the Iranian

uire about the sentence on Mr Cooper,

they could to mitigate the effects oy^ttTeme reactions in Iran to

Mr Rushdie&apos;s book.   The Iranian ForeiwTMinister, Dr Ali Akbar Velayati,

whom he had seen the preceding week, hao also been trying in public

statements to put matters in a more balanced context.



The Iranian Foreign Ministry had said that

would be granted within the next two weeks

to vist him in Iran would also be made avail

realising that anything he said could affect

behaving with dignity and restraint.    The risk t

Mr Rushdie&apos;s book would be taken up by the Islamic

seemed to be containable.    It appeared for example

200 injured by the Pakistan security authorities in their

make it clear that there could be no further extension of the British

presence in Tehran nor increase in the Iranian presence in London in the

circumstances.    It was nevertheless important to try to maintain a

^thread of contact with the saner elements in the Iranian regime. The

press had shown a helpful awareness that the Government had a

balance to strike.



?ME SECRETARY said that incitement to murder was a serious offence,

^ice on their own responsibility had taken the sensible decision

le some protection for Mr Rushdie.    They were also investigating

alleged to have been made by the Bradford Muslim leader, Sayed



is, to see whether he had committed an offence. The

Lty of public disorder could not be excluded.   He was in touch

witn thV Chief Constables in the cities principally concerned as well as

with Conservative Members of Parliament with constituencies in such

areas.    He had also been over the ground with President Ershad of

Bangladesh w)vtpv t currently visiting the United Kingdom and who had

shown undersuQdMe of the Government&apos;s position.    It would be important

to measure worJJff/faY^fully in any public statements on the subject.



THE PRIME MINISTfKfAwing up a brief discussion,  said that the basic

point was that th,T^g^the United Kingdom had to be upheld.    It would

be necessary to loof$3&amp;e efally at the credentials of applicants

seeking to visit the Unfrj&amp;&gt;Kingdom from Iran, in the light of the

threat against Mr Rush&lt;Rj &amp;wfe.

co-operation.    There had been a helpful discussion on the

There was general agreement on the need for European influence on and

support for the key role of the United States in the Arab/Israel

dispute.    The Ministers had also welcomed and compared notes on the tour

of Europe by the new United States Secretary of State, Mr James Baker.

The expectation was that there would be a Summit in May of the Heads of

tate or Government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. There

been condemnation of the human rights situation in Romania. The

ve Ministers had released a statement on Afghanistan urging all

8 to try to establish a united and fully representative

lent.    Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops, it was

hy that Poland and Hungary had closed their Embassies in Kabul,

&apos;s a conspicuous expression of their lack of confidence in

&lt; lah&apos;s regime.    The Twelve Ministers had also issued a  

t welcoming the opening of round table talks in Poland involving

tatives of the Polish Government and the different political and

social forces in that country.   On South Africa there was further

recognition by other European Foreign Ministers that economic pressure

was not the b^St^way forward, particularly given the changes which had

come about irirevBtion to Namibia and Angola.   The Twelve had issued a

statement on nlyCMe of Conduct for Community companies with

subsidiaries iiWsraJAx Africa, noting the role that these companies

played in promotii^^biie interests of their black employees and in

encouraging busine%6e^* j\1n by black people.

specifically United Kingdom issues r



and also some hope that negotiations might be completed more

expeditiously than in the past.   If the Commission&apos;s proposals were

sustained the cost would be below the guidelxp^limit.   There was a

danger that a number of member countries miwnt lreek to use up the

existing margin.    His principal objective ifw3b 3tetailed negotiations

would be to seek to limit erosion of the Commi^si^^s proposals.

  CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there had been a meeting of

Economic and Finance Council on 13 February which had been attended

e Economic Secretary to the Treasury.   The main item was a

tation by Madame Scrivener of the Commission&apos;s proposals for a

ding tax on savings.    The tax proposed differed from the



rate arrangements in the United Kingdom.    There might indeed

^kwardness if revised proposals were to be modelled on the UK

t there appeared to be no likelihood of this.    Although the

5.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary

(C(89)4) about the recommendations of the Pay Revie



Cabinet



THE PRIME MINISTER said that the paper was the outcome ^j)}^ ^0^

among Ministers most directly concerned with the Rev1e?^^Port&quot;?

It proposed that the reports of the Review Bodies on e

on Professions Allied to Medicine, and on Nurses should be^gtfed  

full     The report of the Review Body on Doctors and Dentists^,



!confidential!




!confidential[



accepted except for the increases at the top of the consultants&apos; scale,

and in the size of their distinction awards.    These would have given big

increases in salary (up to 13 per cent) for consultants.   The Review

Body said it was proposing them to improve the long-term career

structure for hospital doctors.   That objective would be better achieved

the increase of 100 in consultants posts proposed by the White Paper,

orking for Patients&apos;, which had been announced after the Review



?s Report was completed.    Consultants would still get the 8 per cent

s the board increase recommended for all doctors and dentists. The

of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) should also be accepted,

: to a point on two star officers.    The Review Body had proposed

get a proper differential above one staff officers, their pay

linked to the first performance point for Grade 3 civil

Linking standard pay to a performance point in this way was

unacceptable.    Instead, it was proposed that the pay of two star

officers should be around 85 per cent of the normally attainable maximum

for Grade 2 civil servants.    This would give them the figure recommended



by the TSRB,



preserving the necessary link with the Civil Service.

that, of the  248 million excess cost, over  200 million would come

from the Reserve.



b.     Last year an argument for meeting the excess cost in full from

the Reserve was that the Health Authorities had already drawn up

budgets assuming that no excess cost would fall on them. This

argument no longer applied, since the Review Bodies&apos; timetable had

been brought forward so that decisions were made before the

uthorities had completed their budgets.    The draft Answer might be

which took account also of a reduction in superannuation

contributions, higher revenue, and cost improvements.    The Answer
