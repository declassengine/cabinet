2       THE HOME SECRETARY said that a Home Office statist!

would be published that day on notifiable offences record

police in England and Wales in 1988.    This would show that&apos;

fewer crimes had been recorded in 1988 than in 1987, which

lletin

the

cent


!confidential!



largest year-on-year decrease since the mid 19508.    The decrease had

been evident over most of the country, with particularly large falls in

a number of provincial cities.    The decrease was, however, concentrated

in property crime, and crimes of violence had continued to rise in 1988.

It had also to be acknowledged that all the figures of recorded crime

.were still far too high.    Nevertheless, even after making allowance for

V^/^the caution with which a single year&apos;s figures must be approached, the

^^fA588 figures were markedly better news on the crime front than the



/*^aJuitry had been used to hearing for some considerable time.    The Labour

and certain academics, would no doubt try to pick holes in the

!s.    In particular, they might argue that crime prevention schemes

Neighbourhood Watch, which had their main impact on property

^   \  had the effect of steering criminal activity elsewhere.

&quot;se were the very critics who had been accustomed to assert that

the G^ernment was responsible for the rise in crime through most of the

1980s, and they could not now have the argument both ways.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYME&gt;T*^id that the unemployment figures

for February would be published thatcday. The seasonally adjusted total

had fallen by 41,200 to 1.947 million^ The rate of unemployment had

fallen to 6.8 per cent, which was the first occasion since December 1980

that it had been below 7 per cent, and it was now falling faster than in

any other industralised country. The Labou/^a^ty manifesto at the

previous General Election had said that a

unemployment by one million within two years

the present Government unemployment had air

million in the period of well below two years s

campaign. The unadjusted total of unemployment h

2.018 million in the period since January. Unempl

all regions, with the largest reductions in the unempl

occurred in the West Midlands and Wales, followed by

Yorkshire, Humberside and the North West. The Labour

had been published earlier that week had confirmed the f

trends in the unemployment rate which had been derived fr

Labour Market Statistics: this rebutted the claims by the

that the reductions in unemployment had been largely a

statistical artefact.    The Labour Force Survey indicated that the number

of people in employment in the United Kingdom had risen by 735,000 to

26.4 million in the 12 months to September 1988.    This was around

1 million above the previous highest total in December 1979 and, even

excluding people in training programmes, was around i million above that

total.    86 per cent of the new jobs which had been created in the

2 months to oeptember 1988 were full-time jobs.    The rate of growth in

^?? ftoloyment over the previous two years had been higher than in any

xjel&amp;od since the second World War.    Vacancies, of which there were

^23 ^ 00 at job centres and an estimated 700,000 in the economy as a

wi&amp;43 pwere continuing to hold up well.    The only cause for concern was

tharvay^rage earnings had risen from 8 -V^ per cent to 9 per cent.

Ovei&amp;ii, the position remained very healthy; and he would circulate

brief^pg material to colleagues summarizing the main features.



In discussion, the following main points were made:

themselves a

of 1 million wit

ign had been a remarkable achievement.    It was

ssed the target which the Labour Party had set

c.     Although the latest increase of        per cent in the growth in

average earnings was not of itself a matter of great concern, the

rate of increase of average earnings

high: even before the current upsurge

of average earnings was consistently

labour costs had risen by around 4 per c

during the previous year compared with an

around 2 per cent in the rest of Europe,

to the reduction in unemployment was the success of the

Government&apos;s policies in reducing the size of the black Economy.



THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that it was a cause

for concern that the rate of growth of average earnings remained far too

high.    That aside,  the position on unemployment and employment remained

ncouraging, and it was important to ensure that the public appreciated

extent of the Government&apos;s achievements.    The main points to get

ss were that unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since

ih^ieneral Election, which was a concrete achievement which surpassed

&lt;f* ^ )rget in the Labour Party&apos;s manifesto, and that, while it was true

tfilh&amp;^nipmployment was approaching 1 million above the total which the

Gove^rtjrent had inherited when it had taken office in 1979, the number of

peopiA. in employment had risen by about 1 million in the period since

December 1979.

London giving them a week to leave; nine f 1^theV_deportations were in



hand.    The Iranian press was still calling

  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said he would be seeing relatives

^t^Kthe British hostages in Lebanon in the course of the day. The



s^^rity threat to Britons in Lebanon had been heightened by the Rushdie

v^ffi^r.    Consular advice to leave or stay away from Lebanon had been

hened, the staff of the British Embassy in Beirut had been



Jo an essential minimum and the office in West Beirut had been

lily closed.    The situation was under daily review, but it was

uesn^jjle to keep the Embassy open for as long as possible since it was

the United Kingdom&apos;s only remaining listening post in Lebanon through

which information about the hostages might be gleaned.

In a brief discussion, it was suggested that A^e 4Aet1t Botha&apos;s motives

for clinging on to office were likely to be persaratf/^ther than

political, and not entirely rational; he was bel 1aW|!dv o be bitter about

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he hi

returned from a visit to Washington and New York, which had lei

with two overriding impressions.    The first was how little of the new

Administration was yet in place; this was due in large measur^ to the

length of the investigations of appointees which were undertaken by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.    The second impression was of the

widespread concern among Americans about Japanese economic penetration

 vof their country.    The fact that the United Kingdom&apos;s share of total

&apos;ioward investment in the United States dwarfed the Japanese share passed

sjitally unnoticed.    These fears were being translated into

ilation;  for example, the Bryant Bill provided that overseas

lies investing in the United States should be subject to much more

reporting requirements than American companies.



In rf/b^ief discussion it was noted that the large and permanent balance

of paju ent surpluses of Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany were a

factor of increasing significance.    The possibility of effective action

by the EC to protect European trade interests against Japan was

frequently fwp^rated by the existence of bilateral agreements between

individual partners and Japan.

4.     THE MINISTER OF AG         , FISHERIES AND FOOD said that an

election commitment had b&amp;An^K*en to deal with the problem of

Spanish-owned fishing vesse^^LaJeang advantage of United Kingdom quota

rules to fish in British wate/ r^ tion had been taken through

regulations under the Merchant Sowing Act 1988 which obliged companies

owning British registered fishing^J^Ssels to be at least 75 per cent

owned by British nationals residetw&lt;SSpthe United Kingdom. Proceedings

had been brought by the Spanish ownVa^rt challenge those provisions.

The Divisional Court had granted an^iwierim injunction the effect of

which was to disapply the provisions       the Merchant Shipping Act. This

decision raised important constitutional issues.    An appeal had been

lodged with the Court of Appeal seeking the revocation of the interim

injunction.    If this failed the case could y^H^o to the House of

Lords.    It was likely that resolution of the(su46tantive issue would be

left to the European Court of Justice which nrwrijake 18 months or

more.    The problem had been exacerbated by the\fca11nj1j?*sion decision to

start infraction proceedings against the United jKwfeiapni action under the

Merchant Shipping Act, notwithstanding that the Un/*^^Kingdom

arrangements had been taken in support of agreemenC^nea^hed under the

common fisheries policy and the existence of comparabl^^^angements in

other member countries.



In discussion it was noted that some of the important co

issues involved had not hitherto been tested in the court

significant element in the present situation was the avai



ional

access to the courts in this country to seek an interim injunction

against the Crown,  in particular when the substantive issue of Community

law was in doubt.    It seemed improbable that comparable remedies would

readily be available in Spain or France.    Section 2 of the European

Communities Act 1972 provided for the supremacy of Community law, and

.section 2(4) provided for enactments, existing and future, to have

f. effect subject to this requirement.    However the extent to which a

f^Catute could in effect be rewritten by the courts so as to conform to



&gt;pe^unity law had never been clearly resolved.    With the passage of time

^ ju&lt;J^?ial attitudes changed, and it was perhaps unlikely that testing the

 8&gt;i* ^n the context of this case in the European Court ot Justice would

leay^o^ satisfactory result.    There had been cases where we had

recOB^sed the existence of a conflict between a domestic enactment and

Community law but had as a deliberate political decision allowed the

possible infraction to come before the European Court ot Justice in

order to buy time.    The Irish Republic had adopted this approach in

relation to &gt;tJi^wimposition of a 48 hour travel rule to discourage

purchases ac^lo^er VAT rates in Northern Ireland on which an action was

being take ? \  $55 ^ them in the European Court or Justice.

however not be legal ones but action at the political level to draw

attention to the manifest inequities of the present situation and its

inconsistency with the objectives of the cortfc!5\fisheries policy.



THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussiorr-^ttTYthat subject to the

outcome of the appeal lodged in the Court of Aape^^action would need to

be considered along the lines indicated in discp^Wn* including a

further approach to the Commission to find solut10Tr jrk the problem of

quota hopping by Spanish vessels.    The Foreign Sec^feArj^ should arrange

for an examination to be made of the. assurances given Jz&amp;the House of

Commons during the passage of the European ^ommuniti^^^&lt;in\1972 on the

supremacy of Community law, with particular reference 1&amp;- i \ible

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that at the meeting&apos;of the

Transport Council on 14 March it had been possible to avoid an early

decision on the United Kingdom derogation for two, three and four axle

vehicles.    A decision on this issue would however be necessary in June

when discussion was likely also to involve the existing derogation on

ve and six axle lorries.    Difficult negotiations were therefore in

^fespect.



THETfQKE SECRETARY said that the informal meeting of Interior Ministers

on lO^larch had been concerned with frontier issues.    The Spanish

Presidency had adopted the approach taken by Lord Cockfield that the

Single European Act provided for free movement of persons within the

Community ra^Sr^less of nationality and that the role of Interior

Ministers wfcfe tvjlevise compensatory measures to off set dangers from

terrorists anrfrVTl gal immigrants.    The ensuing discussion had reflected

a wide variatiutL^r/views amongst member states.    There might well also

be differences bi^ ri|4a Foreign and Interior Ministers about the issues

involved.    While tnCr^Vere these cross currents of opinion within the

Community the issue^wet^ likely to present difficulties for the United

Kingdom in coming mont^^^NThe subject would be pursued at a further

meeting of Interior M^^5rc^\s before the Madrid European Council.

checks in the United Kingdom, wh^e^iAternational and internal frontiers
