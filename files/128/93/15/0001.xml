1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Cannons in the following week.



    LORD PRIVY SEAL said that lord Nugent of Guildford had

tabled amendments for consideration at Committee Stage of the

ater Bill in the following week which sought to provide that,

 her than becoming public limited companies, the newly



tised water undertakings should be based on the existing

Lte statutory water catpany (SWC) model, with controls being

on dividend payments and assignment of funds to reserves



to prices.   Lord Nugent had tabled further

its, which would probably not be reached for a further

forft&amp;Lght, which sought to provide that the assets which the

water authorities had held when they had been transferred fran

local authority control in 1973 should be returned to them after

privatisation^ Ihe Government would be strongly resisting both

proposals 1(   



In a brief dMjgjBfeion, it was noted that many of the SWCs had

recently incrfe^^ytheir water charges by very large amounts.

The point was aiswKrade that it was questionable whether the

House of Lords     &lt;|^3 considering amendments to the Bill

which would, if carried^ involve substantial losses to the

Exchequer.

it&apos;s amendments should be firmly



THE PRIME MINISTER,

three weeks since the Government had

to secure this was under consideration in

the House of Commons; and no industrial

taking place.   There had been surprisingly f

since the Cabinet had discussed the matter at

meeting.   The Transport and General Workers Uniol

call a strike ballot, but the union had not yet d&lt;

precise form of the question on which their members

consulted and the ballot papers were not expected &apos;

the following week.   Mr Bill Morris, the union&apos;s de]

secretary, had written to all registered port emp

them individually to enter into national negotiations

sought replies by noon on 28 April,   !here would probably be

seme industrial action, but not in the immediate future: it was

now thought that 22 May was the earliest date on which

industrial action could begin.   Almost without exception, the

national and regional press had supported the Government&apos;s

decision to end the Dock labour Scheme.



 ^&gt;/*) THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important for the

&lt;^?//^ Government to keep the arguments for the Government&apos;s position

front of the public and to sustain the momentum of the Bill

&gt;^^ .that if any industrial action should take place it would have

as much progress as possible by that time.



Contamination

of Baby Food



THE HOME SECRETARY said that seventeen incidents had been

reported between 7 and 25 April of baby food having been

contamina

delibera

a further eleven incidents had been reported

The Cabinet -

1.    Took note



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEAKB^Sj&amp;d that the British Medical

Association (EMA) was that day nc&amp;a&amp;yKa conference of

delegates from its Local Medical eamlittees to consider the

Association&apos;s position in the lcngJ^anding negotiations on a

new contract for general practitioners (GPs).   He believed that

the EMA&apos;s negotiators wished to control the situation so that

they emerged from the conference with a mandSfce to continue



negotiating, and it was very much in the

that the contract should new be swiftly

disengage this question from the issues d

Paper on the reform of the National Health

would be implemented by the Health Services Bi

following session.   The EMA&apos;s leaders had,

stimulated an extraordinary degree of opposition

contract and they might find that the situation had

their control, arid that their members refused them

negotiating mandate.   It should become clear within

weeks whether the question of the contract could be

negotiated basis: if it could not be so settled, he woul



interest



order to

in the White

, which



e



!confidential]




!confidential!



to cane to Parliament with his own proposals.   Once the

question of the contract was settled, the Government would be

able to concentrate on the presentation of its proposals for

the reform of the NHS, where the essential point to stress would

again be the Government&apos;s prime concern with achieving the most

effective provision of patient care.   At present the EMA had

clouded the issues by an extensive publicity campaign which

^^Jn straddled the GP&apos;s contract and the NHS reform issues, and which

/^painted a picture of doctors concerned to protect patient care

//^Ggainst a Government that was motivated solely by cost-cutting.

^yrj^s travesty of the facts was being promoted by the EMA in a

v^\u&lt;&amp;7 extensive carrpaign which included leafleting in doctors&apos;

ies and a great deed, of national advertising, and this

ly made its impact in the media.   The Government had,

   , a very good story to tell, and he would continue to

ise as vigorously as possible that it was the

Government&apos;s proposals that represented true concern for the

care of patients.



In di



scus^^^^h



following main points were made.



a. ?Ihe

were the

be required

could otherwise

EMA&apos;s presentati

contract and the proposal that GPs should

te within a drugs budget.   The first of

pay to performance, while the second

overprescribing that wasted money that

elsewhere in the NHS.   Although the

proposals as an attack on the

vulnerable patients was wholly

ign was calculated to make a



vivid impact in the



b.     Since many sections&apos;

careful presentation of

than the



media found the Government&apos;s

argument less newsworthy

it was essential that the



Government should use every proper^



device to get its story across.viwwas not altogether clear

hew the conventions on paid Goverapent publicity applied, for

example, to advertisements carrying certain kinds of messages

from the Secretary of State for Health, and this question

should be urgently examined.



c.    Although many doctors saw the need&apos;

welcomed the Government&apos;s approach, it

courage for them to speak out, since the

was dominated by self-interested elements

change in their privileged position.   It woul

be important that as the preparation for the  

Bill proceeded, those doctors and NHS managers whqr^H^S^ to

co-operate with the Government&apos;s proposals on, for

self governing hospitals should be encouraged to exjJ

their support.   The position on that issue would be

clearer in June, by when hospitals should have respond

the general invitation to express their interest.

I



I



d.    There were a number of simple, easily grasped, figures

that made manifest the need for the changes in the management

of the NHS which the Government was proposing.   A good

example was the numbers of similar operations that were

performed by surgeons in different hospitals.   These figures

provided telling support for the Government&apos;s case, and more

public reference should be made to them, though it would not

be right to use them in a way that



would attract criticism as a personalised attack on doctors&apos;

clinical judgement.



S?i?&amp;     The medical profession had a long history of hysterical

&lt; ^3 position to proposals for change, but of quickly

^v^fc^mmodating itself to new realities in the event. The

^^ctors had, for example, vigorously opposed the introduction

the selected list of drugs, but they had accepted the

changes as soon as they were made and the savings had been

used for the benefit of the NHS.   It was very likely that the

GP&apos;s cartfS&amp;ct would similarly be accepted by the profession

as soowasilt began to take actual effect.

summing up of the discussion and invited the Secretary of

State for Health to proceed as the Prime Minister had

indicated.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the

Sea gas terminal had been closed down the previcxS^

following the discovery during a routine inspection &lt;5

in the machinery which appeared to pose a potential

safety.   The present signs were that it would be poss

repair the defect relatively quickly and that the plant:

resume production in two to three weeks.   St Fergus was

gathering complex for the northern North Sea basin and th&lt;

would be a considerable fall-off in production of gas there

while the plant was closed.   However, there was unlikely to be

any signf icant inpact on the balance of payments since British

Gas would be able to obtain the requisite supplies from other

fields.   The incident provided an example of the effective

working of the safety arrangements, since the defect had been

discovered during a routine inspection by the canpany and

neither the workers at the plant nor those living in the area

been endangered.

THE HUME MINISTER, sunning up a brief discussion, said that, if

it looked likely that industrial action would continue after the

talks on the following Tuesday, there was a^e&amp;png case for

either the Secretary of State for Transpor^orvjondon

3.V^HE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAUffl SECRETARY said that the

posr^jon which had emerged from recent discussions among the

coalition partners of the Federal German Government appeared to

cast doubt on the need for land based nuclear systems in Europe

and called &gt; SsNearly negotiations on short range nuclear

preceding evening.   The la

German position paper was a

Federal German Chancellor, Herr

Bundestag that morning.   It was



toughly about Soviet preponderance in such weapons systems and

their unwillingness to make reductions and had re-affirmed the

need for effective NATO defence together wi^i^v continued

willingness for dialogue with the East.   H4(ba&lt;valso made it

clear that the German position paper was far^liisaitesion with the

allies.   This might provide seme grounds for 4(?PQQRJ.se



In a brief discussion, it was noted that the Pri

would be seeing Herr Kohl on 30 April which would&apos;

valuable opportunity to try to steer Herr Kohl back&quot;

direction of what he had earlier described as his

convictions on the subject, which were more orthodox,

was possible that these had since been modified by the

deteriorating domestic political situation in Germany.

Kohl had spoken at the time of the European Council in Rhc



!confidential]


!confidential!



1988 of the need for a decision on SNF before the European

elections in 1989.   But he had also spoken at the same time

about his determination to extend the period of obligatory

military service from 15 to 18 months to help cope with

demographic pressures.   This decision also he had now reversed.

Herr Genscher&apos;s apparently unqualified belief on the change of

Soviet attitude under President Gorbachev had had an impact on

\&gt;^\ German public opinion.   If centre right convictions in Germany

^^(Y^^bout the need for sure defence collapsed in the face of

IJy&apos;y&apos;L Gorbachev, there was a danger that either the extreme left

v^alOthe extreme right would profit in electoral terms.

    FOREIGN AND caWONWEAETH SECRETARY said that Iran had

earlier that week announced the expulsion of 18 British

citizens.   This was evidently in response to the Government&apos;s

decision in March to expel from the United Kingdom 18 Iranians

who had been regarded as security risks in the context of the

threats to British life and property during the Rushdie affair.

In this latest move Iran appeared to have found it difficult to

identify sufficient British nationals to expel.   Eight of those

were already out of Iran when the announcement was made,

would only be 12 British subjects left in Iran including

er Cooper, together with seme 150 British wives of Iranian

bnals.   One of those on the latest Iranian list was a Mr

en, a frequent offender against Iranian law who was

y being held in prison on fraud charges. Ihe

t were nevertheless asking Sweden as the protector of

interests in Iran to make representations on his

More generally, the political tide in Iran was still

in a radical direction.   The Vice Minister of Foreign

jani, had been dismissed after allegations of

Iranian Permanent Representative at the United

led.   Both had since disappeared from

THE FOREIGN AND OCMMDNWEAUIH SECRETARY said that there had been

issues cons idered at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council

on 24 April had been the Uruguay Round and relations with

Eastern Europe.   On the first, there had been a general welcome

for the results achieved by the Trade Negotiations Committee. A

Portuguese bid, linked to the prospective liberalisation of

textiles, for a special restructuring programme for the

Portuguese industry, had been satisfactorily contained. On

land there had been general agreement that greater flexibility

ould be shown in the negotiations for a trade and co-operation

it.   Agreement had also been reached that negotiations on

agreement with Romania should be suspended and not

until Romania had improved its human rights record.

In a brief discussion it was noted that the agriculture&quot;

provision in the 1989 budget had been seme  1.2 billion

proposals for agricultural spending in 1990 in the 1990

Preliminary Draft Budget were for spending of seme  2.9 billion

below the agreed guideline.   These savings reflected to a

substantial extent the effective operation of the stabilisers

and the watertight conpartments imposed by the budget

discipline arrangements which prevented savings in one

commodity area being spent on other commodity regimes. Against

this background, the German authorities had increasingly been

having recourse to special set aside arrangements and VAT

 ??$^funds.
