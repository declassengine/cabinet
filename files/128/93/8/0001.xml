1       The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week and that,  subject to the progress of

business,  the House would rise for the Easter Adjournment on Thursday

23 March until Tuesday 4 April.



.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that Committee Stage in

use of Commons of the Water Bill was due to be completed on the

,ng Tuesday.    While this had gone very successfully, with no

s being carried against the Government, the public&apos;s attitude

he Bill had been coloured by a series of alarmist stories,

implications of privatisation.    In fact,  the Government had an

case to make and it would be very helpful if colleagues could

 opportunity in their speeches over the next few weeks to draw

attention to the benefits of water privatisation.    Among the main points

to make were that^ the Water Bill was the largest ever environmental

argument was fallaciou

industry was privatised,

of making water slightly cti

the case under existing arra



and that one of the main improvements which the Bill

uld be the separation of the roles of regulator and

orhhanies would be required to meet costs of around  3

he century as a result of various environmental

required under European Community law, and this

water charges.    The Opposition had been



of this by claiming that any increased water

fributable to privatisation.    This line of

er, since the costs of the environmental

be met regardless of whether the water

tisation would in fact have the effect

or the consumer than would have been



In discussion,  the following mail



its were made:



a.     While the Water Bill haiifeUM^handled very skilfully in

Parliament, the general public aanpAued to be sceptical about

water privatisation.    In descriofcwg the benefits which the Water

Bill would bring about, it would^ necessary also to make out the

case for privatisation itself.    Among the points to make in that

context were that private sector water companies would be much

better placed to obtain capital financey^S^i, while it was true

that such companies would be monopoly sLcplvfers within their own

areas, the need to compete for capital lh^tJe^iarket would provide

a powerful incentive towards achieving goai^mkaement; and that

allowing employees to hold shares in the

worked would improve their motivation.    It wou/jK

to remind the public that around 25 per cent ??^

already served by water companies which were in t

the privatisation of the public sector water util

did not raise any new issues of principle.    It was

in France, under a socialist government, water remain1

private control.

,er



!confidential!




1 confidential I



b. Opponents of the Water Bill had sought to argue that alleged

deficiencies in existing water and sewerage standards demonstrated

the risks of moving public sector water utilities into the private

sector.    This line of argument ought to be stood on its head,

however,  since any such deficiencies served to show that the

existing arrangements were not working properly and needed to be

improved.



c. The Secretary of State for the Environment had examined the

roposals by the private statutory water companies (SWCs) to



crease water charges by up to 30-70 per cent, and as a result the



ent indications were that a number of SWCs would significantly

-jrate t?heir proposed increases.    The SWCs had professed

^W^fje^lves to be appalled by the link which had been drawn in some

q&lt;^ters between their proposals for very high increases in charges

ancV the Government&apos;s plans to privatise the water industry, but the

fact remained that the SWCs&apos; behaviour had been most unhelpful.

Under the-L^w as it stood, SWCs were not allowed to build up

reserve^virr3i\this had led them to neglect essential maintenance

work.    TO&lt;i%Vpifcer Bill would introduce a far more appropriate

regulatory ffegfoe for these companies.

had been issue

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the European Commission

had put forward proposals to impose a time limit on the United Kingdom

and Republic of Ireland derogations from certain European Community (EC)

requirements on the allowable weights and dimensions of heavy lorries.

The United Kingdom position had consistently been that many of its

ridges were not strong enough to carry vehicles of the weight sought by

Commission.    The following Wednesday&apos;s debate in the House of

10ns was on a motion to take note of the relevant EC document and to

(rt the Government&apos;s intention to ensure that a premature end date

derogation was not imposed on the United Kingdom.    This was

to strengthen the Government&apos;s hand at the meeting of the EC

Council on 14 March, when the allowable weights on smaller

Id come under particular attention.   There were problems

&lt;)ited Kingdom&apos;s room for manoeuvre in the longer terms, and

!ent&apos;s position would come under greater pressure in the

,vduring the second half of the year.    The Government&apos;s

negotiating position was constrained by certain considerations of

Community law and he was in consultation with the Law Officers about

this.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the report on Gurkhas by

substance of the report was not far distant f|

thinking, the Select Committee also criticise

officials for not being more forthcoming in the

criticism was totally unjustified, since the inf

advice that officials had offered to Ministers,

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that Hammersmith

Council had the previous week asked him to indemnify

and officials against potential court action over various

ating to the Council&apos;s elaborate dealing on the money

This approach,  which had been stimulated by warnings of

possible illegality given to the Council by their auditors, was the

first that he had known of the matter, though it now appeared that the

auditors had fi^?s?fcvwarned the Council as long ago as the previous July.

The Council haflfa parent ly been indulging in speculation on the future



es and had already become too deeply involved for

they were first warned by the auditors. The

ative transactions, which went far beyond



een justified by reference to the structure of

plainly in question, and he had announced

,epared to indemnify councillors and



been requested.    Even if he had granted

ave legalised the actions of the Council

llegal; and he therefore could not have

ight be taken against the Council,

fficials would not only have been open

would have pre-empted by

of the Hammersmith and Fulham Council s&gt;



reckless as to constitute a scandal of monumental proportions, it was

most important that the Government should stand_back from the matter at

the present stage and allow it to be dealt wi

arrangements and legal processes,  and Minist(

in any public comment not to go beyond the terms

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that all the British

Embassy staff had left Tehran safely and the Iranian Charge d&apos;Affaires

here had returned to Tehran on 28 February.    Sweden would be the

protecting power in Tehran for British interests.   The Iranian

Parliament had voted on 28 February to break relations with the United

Kingdom the following week if the Government did not meet certain

Dnditions.    In practice this made no great difference to the de facto

jte of affairs since Britain&apos;s relationship with Iran was already

!ended.    The Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, had



1 visit to Iran:  it seemed on balance unlikely that Mr Shevardnadze

tased the Salman Rushdie affair with the Iranians in the terms that

had asked him to do.    Meanwhile efforts continued.to sustain

Western stance in the f.ace of Iranian threats. Although

&lt;V eKmany and the United States were being very supportive, this

aegre^p^^olidarity would not last indefinitely.    The Government were

also seeking support from Muslim leaders in other countires.    He himself

has spoken to the Indian and Pakistan Foreign Ministers recently who had

both responded sympathetically, no doubt partly with their own

respective dome^-Mx situations in mind.    Other Islamic countries were

also playing //sensible and restraining role even if it was too much to

hope for decla&lt;^LJ^ir6 of support for Britain&apos;s stance.    He was hopeful

that with appropriate! advance lobbying the meeting of the Organisation

of Islamic Confer^M^^on 13-14 March would strike a moderate note.



Continuing, THE FOR

had no alternative b

principle of free speec

others,  together with t

Secretary and the Secret^

recently made helpful stat

audiences.    As for the dire

diplomatic posts abroad had

authorities had been asked to

aviation around the world. The



COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said the Government

intain its present insistence on the

le reaffirming respect for the beliefs of

for normal relations with Iran.    The Home

tate for Education and Science had

along these lines to domestic

at to lives and property, British

on alert, and the responsible

rotection for British civil

aviation arouna me w11?.u.    1?c verfnb^Attack against the British Council

in Karachi on 26 February appeare&lt;^?&lt; j1ave been the work of the Iranian

Revolutionary Guards: reponsibilitf^&amp;^y other recent attacks was

unclear.    Mr Rushdie himself was con^^i^plg to receive a high degree of

protection.    There was also a threat  ^public buildings.   He had asked

officials to make an apprasial of whatMurther action might be necessary

if the crisis worsened and would circulate recommendations to colleagues

very soon.



THE HOME SECRETARY said that leaders of Musi

Kingdom, while continuing to contain their dem

law, felt frustrated by their lack of ability t&apos;

They were asking for a change in the law on blasp

extended to Islam.    In his view it would be a mist

to reopen this question.   There had been no Crown pn

law of blasphemy since 1922 and the last private prosec

1977.    The majority of the Law Commissioners had favoui

the offence.    There remained a possibility that someone

bring a private prosecution under the existing law arguin

provisions could be held already to appl&apos;y to Islam,  but he was advised

that any such action was likely to fail in the courts at an early stage.

There was little alternative but to listen patiently to explanations

from Muslim communities in Britain as to why they were so offended by Mr

Rushdie&apos;s book, while urging them to remain within the law.



a brief discussion it was pointed out that despite the widespread

usion that the Soviet Union under the leadership of President

,achev favoured freedom of expressin, the Russians had in fact

:d to align themselves publicly with the West in standing up for

nciple of free speech and opposing death threats, and had lost no

sending the Soviet Foreign Minister to Te.hran for talks with

Khomeini.    The debate about whether to change the law of

 ^ould no doubt continue.    But it was noteworthy that in the

?? recent film which many Christians had found offensive, the

?had not argued for prosecution under the law of blasphemy, but

had simply advised people not to go to see the film.    There was also a

danger,  if the public argument continued at the present pitch, of a

backlash from Mrtfeniist non-Muslim opinion in the United Kingdom. Those

who had been e/fffixiently attracted to come and live here by the degree

of freedom in^Jkj^^quntry had to accept the implications of freedom.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY id that the funeral of Emperor

occasion.    It was probably the largest turn-

the funeral of Queen Victoria. Considering

the issue in the United Kingdom, British hi

proved relatively uncontroversial.    This had

FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been a good

ere at the Anglo-French Summit on 27 February although little

ntive progress had been achieved.    France was reasonably close to

y^:ed Kingdom on the question of modernisation of short range

nuvfea^^forces but its position contained ambiguities and even

conu^^^^ions.



THE SE&amp;fe  RY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had since spent two days

with theoFrench Defence Minister, Monsieur Pierre Chev%neraent during

which the French side had been more forthcoming than in the past. The

French Government apparently still believed that they could offer an

air-to?surface s**nd-off missile as a replacement for Britain&apos;s free

fall nuclear h/^ETsArtiich would meet British specifications.    He had said

that he would \qs^r3 3Hw to consider the details of any such proposal but

he remained scept^ca^Jabout whether these would really measure up to

British needs.

guage.    It was important to

tion not least given its

^tfjfifanese investment in this

country.   The point had alreadyyhe^^made that the effect of the

French action could be to drive ^jroanese investment to Sweden since

local content of 60 per cent was sufficient to permit duty free

import into the Community of cars produced in European Free Trade

Association countries.    More generally it was noted that in recent

discussions in Tokyo it had become cleav^fciwt the Italian

authorities would raise less objection  ? NIWK exports if they were

given an assurance that more Japanese inv5V flJ3t)tf: would go to Italy.

The French authorities might have a simila\^ aM&gt;ulation in mind.

There was no doubt that Japan had a preferenc^ifybr investment in

the United Kingdom on language and other groun/e^^There was

increasing evidence of resentment in other mem

Community of this position and a readiness accord

isolate the United Kingdom.    It seemed unlikely t

Government would change their stance unless other

mobilised.   A reference to the European Court of Jus

be ruled out.

b.      There was a good deal of disquiet among French leaders about

whether it would prove possible for the Federal German Chancellor

to win his  1990 elections and stay in office against the background

of the results in recent elections in Berlin.    Chancellor Kohl&apos;s

own position on the issue of modernisation vacillated and currently

seemed to lean more in the direction of his Foreign Minister,

Herr Genscher.    There were signs too that the new United States

Administration did not wish to force the pace.    On the other hand,

i/i/   it was quite wrong to allow opposition parties such as the German

^^^^fiocial Democrats to set the agenda of the public debate. A failure

the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to take a timely decision

odernisation would be seen as a sign of weakness.



  ift^^MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the Secretary

of Sta^^fjar trade and Industry should pursue urgently with the European

Commiss\im and through the European Court,  if necessary,  the current

French arritude over the admission to France of Nissan cars built in

Britain.
