TARY    1      The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.



  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that on the evening of Sunday

anuary a British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 aircraft had crashed

Ml motorway near East Midlands Airport while on a scheduled

from London Heathrow to Belfast.    Forty four of the people on

Ld been killed.    The pilot of the aircraft had reported a fire in

engine about 15 minutes after take-off and the investigators

evidence consistent with that engine having been shut down in

evidence had yet been found, however, to indicate a

on in the right engine, while there were clear signs of a fire

 en place in the left engine.    As he had emphasised in his

statement in the House of Commons on 10 January, it was wrong to

speculate about JJ^e causes of the accident before the facts had been

established.    /(cEj^e present time there was no sound basis for reaching



^1 occurred, and it would be some days before a

ken.    Nevertheless, there had been much



and this had swung round from the theory that

!shut down the wrong engine to the proposition

was to blame.    Some sections of the media

ke stories out of the Government&apos;s refusal

explanation while the investigation was

ween wishing to avoid pre-judging the

kuthority had ordered all British

737-400 aircraft to carry out more

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRfii^AND said that it was welcome

that the press had avoided creating the impression that such flights to

Belfast on Sunday evenings carried a preponderant number of servicemen

returning from leave.    He understood that nothyi^had come to light that

pointed to the sabotage of the aircraft, and

take that line when he had been asked to comm

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said  that a team of Czech

officials was that day visiting the United Kingdom for talks on the

properties of the plastic explosive Semtex (which was manufactured

solely in Czechoslovakia), and to help with the forensic examination of

terial from the Lockerbie air crash.    On 10 January the Minister of

te, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, had spoken to the Czech Foreign

ister in Paris, where they were both attending the chemical weapons

ence, to urge upon him the desirability of marking Semtex with an

  enable its detection.    The United States Government was making

ajf&gt;representations to the Czech Government in Prague, and the



was encouraging its partners in the European Community to

l l action.    Experts on aviation from the seven summit



ere meeting in Paris on 19 and 20 January to discuss aviation

nd the Government was working,  together with the United States

Government,  for a special meeting of the International Civil Aviation

Organistaion Council in February at Ministerial level.



The Secretary of &amp;E3&amp;i ior Health said that the Chief Medical Officer

with other health afCd^pg^Xculture officials had given evidence to the

Select Committee on Afcj^^&amp;ture on the previous day.    Although some

sections of the press n?aa^ pjed to dramatise the use of the word

,epidemic1, which the Ch^*j3fedical Officer had made clear that he was

using in a technical sens^tji^session had passed off reasonably

satisfactorily.

morning referred to the Monopolies and Mergers

by GEC/Siemens for Plessey.    There were indicati

recently been speculation about a possible bid for

In discussion, the following main points were made.



said that, on the

ad earlier that

ion (MMC) the bid

a.t the European

here had



if such a

the usual



a.      In examining proposed takeovers, the MMC was requn

consider the likely effects on the relevant market which^

case of the defence electronics industry, they might well

was the United Kingdom, although they would doubtless be gul

!confidential!



this by the evidence which they would need to obtain from the

Ministry of Defence.    The European Commission, on the other hand,

would examine the likely effects on the European market.

GEC/Siemens would be likely to feel extremely aggrieved if the

European Commission were not to begin its enquiry until after the

MMC had completed its investigation.    While,  in view of the

possibility of conflicting determinations being reached, it might

be undesirable for the enquiries by the MMC and the European

pmmission to take place simultaneously, the European Commission

ht be asked to provide an informal view in parallel with the

&quot;s investigation,  in the same way that procedures had developed



United States anti-trust law for preliminary opinions to be

ej /before a merger went ahead.    It was important that the

etary of State for Trade and Industry should continue to keep

ose touch with Sir Leon Brittan,  the newly appointed European

Commissioner with responsibility for competition, over the European

Commission,j^handling of the bid.



b.    A prcHjJcieJi-i uropean Community regulation on merger control was

currently uno^Pwonsideration by the Sub-Committee on European

Questions on^hJa^Etefence and Oversea Policy Committee (OD(E)).

While the Unit^ji^j^gdom was opposed to the efforts by some of its

the difficulties occasione

and the Commission, it was  



France, to treat the proposed regulation

a European industrial policy,  there might

in a way which would provide for the

ation of the European Commission&apos;s role

discussions to that end might well be

of the proposed regulation would give

ive powers to investigate large



pment might clearly help to resolve

ccessive investigations by the MMC

r that it would be wise to give



exclusive powers in this area rf^^SlK Commission.    There was

increasing concern among BritisC^JWustry that British companies

were more open to hostile takeov^p^Mjrs than was the case in some

other European countries, and it &lt;ms essential that effective steps

should be taken to secure a more even playing field.    The West

German market was especially difficult to break into because many

of the leading companies were owned by banki and fewer were listed

on the stock exchange. u1\



c.    While the number of European companies ywicftjhad been bought by

British companies in recent years was greate^gMft the number of

British companies which had been bought by Eui^ffeajj^companies, many

of the British purchases had been of relatively^^^^undertakings.



THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that

would doubtless continue to face pressure to make known

speculation about a possible counter bid for GEC.    The li

should remain that, under the Fair Trading Act 1973, the

State for Trade and Industry was required to take into accou

advice of the Director General of Fair Trading in deciding wh

refer a merger proposal to the MMC and that it was then for the

al



reach a view on whether the bid was against the public interest; and

that it would be wrong for the Government to offer a view in advance of

the conclusion of those procedures.    There was clearly a tension between

the United Kingdom merger machinery and that of the European Community,

nd the Cabinet noted that the proposed European Community regulation on

,rger control was being examined in OD(E).    The possibility that an

uiry by the MMC into a proposed merger would be followed by an

ry by the European Commission was a cause for concern and the

ry of State for Trade and Industry should continue to keep in

cl^^^Ntouch with Sir Leon Brittan and explore the possibility of the

curop^im commission&apos;s providing at least a preliminary view on the bid

for Yt e5iey by GEC/Siemens while the MMC enquiry was under way.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that public reaction to the

level of attendance at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan remained

mixed.    There was widespread recognition that after forty years since

the Second World War and exchanges of visits between the Royal Families,

nd given the importance of the United Kingdom&apos;s relations with Japan,

was acceptable and right that the Royal Family should be represented

is Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh and the Government by the

United Kingdom had consistently voted against a European Community ban

on imports of hormone treated meat for which the Government saw no

justification on scientific grounds.    The United Kingdom had taken the

initial Council decision to the European Court of Justice but the United

om&apos;s views had only been upheld on a procedural point.    During the

yious autumn the United Kingdom had lobbied other member countries,

ding those, such as Denmark,  likely to be most affected by United

retaliatory action and had also had discussions with the United
