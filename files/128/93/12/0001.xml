1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.



The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

oyment (C(89) 7) about the Dock Labour Scheme.



RETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that with a number of

es directly concerned he had been considering the future of the

It enforced a statutory monopoly of dock work in the Scheme

t\/aA/h registered dock worker on work covered by the Scheme. It

meant thaA employers could not recruit workers or make them redundant

without the agreement of the unions.    It encouraged restrictive

practices and made the Scheme ports costly and uncompetitive.    Jobs had

therefore decli1} 3J^-n Scheme Ports, while non-Scheme ports had increased



arket and now accounted for nearly 30% of the United

ing oil.    The Scheme was no longer necessary to

pose,  the elimination of casual work in the

ck work had changed substantially since it was

be up to  35,000 in the first eighteen

eighteen months.    A White Paper, and a popular summary, had also been

prepared, and the draft White Paper was attached to C(89) 7.



Union seemed unlikely to put

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said th

of Cabinet to making a statement in Parliament

the Government&apos;s intentions, and to the publicat

and introduction of the Bill.



In discussion the following were the main points rai



a.     There was a very strong case for abolition of

most serious consequence was that it made the ports

uncompetitive, and this disadvantage would become inc



ought the agreement

ternoon announcing

the White Paper,



!confidential!




!confidential!



important as 1992 approached.    Recent events at Aberdeen and

Grimsby had drawn attention to it, and a statement now of the

intention to abolish the Scheme would be well timed.



b.     The Government must be prepared for a strike in the ports.

Jut this would have no effect on market confidence so long as the



}vernment maintained its resolve, as it must,  to carry through the

ajige.    The police might have a major task in dealing with any

^rbances, but preliminary contact with some senior officers had

ned that they would be able to cope.    Support from military

!1 in loading and unloading vessels, and driving heavy

&gt;icles, could be available if necessary after a short

jotice.    A strike could cause some difficulties in

Ireland,  since it was so dependent on supply by sea, but

^ports involved in trade with the province were not in the

and the difficulties should not be insuperable. Finally,

it would be important,  if a strike were to be handled successfully,

that the employee also should stand firm; but the improvement in

their financiA/L petition over the last few years made it more

likely that tn &amp;/4 3Hd do so.



compen

eme



c.     The proposa

after abolition of

would be much highe

redundancy and other

sympathy for striking

further concession coul

to win in subsequent nego

Government would be prepar

practice only to prolong the

further concessions.    It was

at the outset and then stick



sation for dockworkers made redundant

were important.    The compensation

standard statutory compensation for

were likely as a result to feel less

rs.    It might be argued that some

een held in reserve for the unions

s.    But any indication that the

ve on the issue was likely in

in the hope of extracting

m^jKB^ter to announce generous terms

t&lt; &quot;



d.      It was important for the Gove^jiagfib to make it clear that it

would proceed quickly with the legisMrt4pe.    It was therefore for

consideration whether in his statemeif^feKat afternoon the Secretary

of State for Employment could indicate^the timetable for Second

Reading.    It would however be a mistake to cut across the usual

procedures for settling and announcing the timetable for Bills. It

should be possible to find a form of words taJrfSfe. account of all

these requirements and the matter should be fertl^r discussed

between the Secretary of State for Employment^SH&lt;i??iwe Lord

President of the Council.



e.     At present the passage of the Bill was being ^V&amp;pa^d on the

assumption that it would go through its various stag^ T&lt;6^the

conventional timetable.    But its passage could be acceleja&amp;gd if

industrial developments showed that to be necessary.



THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Ca

the recommendations in C(89) 7.    They agreed that the Secretary

Employment should make a statement accordingly in Parliament tha

publish the White Paper attached to C(89) 7, and introduce the Bil

ad much influential support in doing so although the economy

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a maj

particular by the Front Line States and not by Permanent Memb rr

concerned to strengthen the authority and involvement of the UN and in this

7^X the Soviet Union was already playing a positive part.    The UN Secretary

(^VVCeneral, Mr Perez de Cuellar, was clear what needed to be done and very

^V^^ateful for the support of the United Kingdom.    Zambia too had now joined in

^x^rvesing SWAPO in the direction of a ceasefire and withdrawal of their forces

f the 16th parallel in Angola, after which the full authority of the

es on the spot needed to be firmly established.    The South African

Minister, Mr Pik Botha, had himself played an important restraining

ven some Africans at the UN had had to acknowledge.    The Prime

resence in Namibia when the SWAPO incursion had occurred had

critical in persuading Mr Pik Botha to adopt a responsible

e value of the United Kingdom&apos;s influence on South Africa was

even by those who had taken a different view on sanctions.



THE PRIME MlmeTER said that the South African Government by remaining firmly

within the te^jis of the peace agreement had not put a foot wrong so far, and

this would stand it in good stead.    South African troops had moved out of

their bases after the SWAPO incursion only with the explicit agreement of the

UN Special Representative,  the Administrator-General for Namibia, and General

Prem Chand.    The   /^r^ing need now was for all SWAPO forces to return north

of the 16th paralleN^rf^^or them to be monitored there by the Angolans, who

in turn would need tolte^^Apsely observed by UN monitors.    It could become

very dangerous if SWAPu?^ f&apos;/e^ in Namibia insisted on staying put.

THE PRIME MINISTER, comment   &amp; ^/ ^  recent visit to Morocco, said that King

Hassan was among the most intelttiOT^and perceptive of observers of the

Middle East situation.    He was be&amp;1m&gt;*fcg to feel it might be time to host a

further Arab Summit.    On the centr^^6^*j&gt;ute with Israel he recognised that

the real difficulty still remained w/^nSt Israel would accept negotiations

on the basis of land for peace as requj^e9?^by United Nations Security Council

Resolution 242, on which the Israeli Pryp^^inister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, was

likely to take a very hard line in WashrwrCS^   The Moroccans had made

enormous efforts for her visit, which haaVwn^perf ectly.



THE PRIME MINISTER said that during a brief^fop-over in Nigeria she had been

able to lunch with the President, General Ibrahim Babangida.    He was very

pleased with the United Kingdom&apos;s support to Nigeria over the stand-by

agreement concluded with the International Monetarv&lt;Rh d.    He was also

looking forward to his State Visit to the United KWngcvm.



In Zimbabwe the issue of sanctions against South ktrik&amp;Aka been almost

entirely ignored during discussions.    In the company otyaldPresident,

Mr Robert Mugabe, and the Mozambique President, Mr JoaquwJWji^ssano, she had

visited the training ground at Nyanga and had been very rm^d by the

British army&apos;s programme there to train both the Zimbabwe a

contingents from the Mozambique army.    It was clear that th

organisation RENAMO in Mozambique was very brutal, highly s

equipped and would be very hard to beat.    It seemed that for

President Chissano was still not ready for a solution on the

achieved in Angola.    Meanwhile refugees were leaving Mozambique

THE CHANCE^^P^OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the main item considered at the

recent meetw in Washington of the Group of Seven (G7) and the Interim

Committee of^he International Monetary Fund had been the new United States

proposals on Latin American debt.    These proposals differed in many ways from

those put forward ip-^he past and as originally presented caused concern in a

number of respects^y^&quot;l|V particular they would have raised the expectations of

Latin   American de^tcice-&apos;far beyond what could be satisfied; involved

governments and inteyjtfat).j&gt;nal institutions more heavily in the private sector

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the major themes in the.

VTO) and the Ministry of Defence&apos;s continuing drive for greater management

:iency and cost-effectiveness.    In the key first and second chapters the

Paper set NATO&apos;s defence policy in the context of the strategic

)ion and the signs of change in the East.    It welcomed what



It Gorbachev was doing, while stressing the need for continuing

k0n arms control the White Paper set out NATO&apos;s future priorities

jd a useful essay on the continuing value of nuclear deterrence,

chapters dealt on traditional lines with the activities of the



the equipment procurement programme,  the budget and measures to

improve m^J^j^jkent efficiency, and the East-West military balance. French

and German^^nguage versions of the White Paper would also be available,

together wifcfc larger numbers than last year of the popular version for free

distribution.    The draft reflected amendments agreed with the Treasury and

the Foreign and Commonwealth Office since earlier discussion in the Defence

and Oversea Policy^0^imittee.    It would be necessary to look again at the

passage about Prel^tdeM^Gorbachev&apos; s visit immediately after the visit was

over, and also at Ctyy^^sages on chemical weapons.
