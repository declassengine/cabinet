1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Commons in the following week.



THE IORD PRIVY SEAL said that amendments had been carried

against the advice of the Government at the Committee Stages of

both the Water Bill and the Electricity Bill in the House of

rds earlier that week.   The amendment to the Electricity Bill

.ght to require the Secretary of State to oblige each of the

a electricity suppliers to provide evidence that they had

the efficient use of electricity and empowered the



of State to refuse or to amend any application for

!creases or for major capital projects.   The first part



it did no more than replicate a provision in the

lie electricity supply licence, but the second part

would *%stray an essential principle of the Bill that the

Director General of Electricity Supply, rather than the

Secretary of State, would be responsible for approving increases



in electrici

amendments passed in the House of Lords.



The Cabinet -



1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the discussion and invited the Secretary of

//&gt;State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for

 ^jEnergy to proceed accordingly.



THE SECRETARY OF .STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that, following

consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, he proposed to make an

announcement in the following week that the Government would be

2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR

unemployment figures for April

There had been a further steep

the seasonally adjusted total



said that the

published that day.



unemployment, with

en by 60,000 to 1.856

fallen by 77,000 to



million and the unadjusted total havi

1.884 million.   The rate of unemployment had fallen to 6.5 per

cent, which was the lowest rate since November 1980.   It was of



debate on the

.t the rate of

e points

below

reece and



interest, especially in the context of the

Social Dimension of the Single European Mar

unemployment in the United Kingdom was 2.5

below the European Community average, and in

the rates in Spain, France, Italy, Belgium,

the Netherlands.   The number of people in work

highest ever level.   The unemployment rate had con

in all regions, with the largest reductions over

year having occurred in the West Midlands and Wales,

Yorkshire and Humberside, the North and North West,

unemployment was falling more quickly than unemployment

generally.   Vacancies, of which there were 220,000 at job

centres, were continuing to hold up well.   A cause for con&lt;

was that the increase in average earnings, which remained at

1/4 per cent, continued to be too high.   He would also be

publishing that day figures on working days lost as a result of



CONFIDENTIAL


confidential



industrial disputes which showed that the number of working days

lost in March was provisionally estimated at 73,000, which was

the lowest March figure since 1949 and which contrasted with an

average March figure over the previous 10 years of more than

900,000.   ?Ihe number of stoppages in 1988 was the lowest annual

total since 1935.



In discussion the point was made that the financial markets

ght interpret the continuing large reductions in unemployment

a sign that the economy was failing to slow dawn. This



two important factors, however: first, the labour market

lagged behind changes in the rest of the economy; and

the reduction in the seasonally adjusted total for April

ficially high because the season adjustment factor did

for the fact that, for the first time for more than a

e Easter holiday had fallen entirely in March.

In a brief discussion it was suggested that, especially if the

GMSC rejected the new GP contract, there would be much to be

said for an advertising campaign designed to set out for the

benefit of patients the consequences of the new contract for the

family doctor service.   However, it would be important to ensure

that any such campaign was within the Government&apos;s own rules on

advertising and did not have the effect of provoking the GPs

into greater opposition to the contract.



PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was

rtant that the Government should win the public argument.



it would need to be considered whether, in the light of

ernment&apos;s rules, this objective should be pursued through

arv^^sZe^rtising campaign or other forms of publicity.

Secretary^bf/tE \ Cabinet.

expected to be announced within the next two days.   A majority

in favour of industrial action seemed likely, although dockers

in a number of smaller ports were thought to have voted against

industrial action.   Another union with members in the docks, the

General and Municipal Workers Union, had not yet balloted. Ihe

High Court hearing of the action challenging the legality of the

TGWU ballot which had been brought by the three major port

employers was due to start that day and likely to take same 6 to

8 days to complete.   Strike action before the Whitsun Bank

liday was therefore unlikely.   Meanwhile the Dock Work Bill

ins would be completed that day and Report Stage would take

of the Bill, since its passage would provide the most

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that the Secretary

of State for Trade and Industry had made clear to the Brewers

Society at a meeting earlier that week that, while it would be

necessary to address the public interest issues which the

Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) Report on the Supply of

Beer had revealed, he was willing to consider alternative means

of tackling those matters.   The Brewers Society were expected to

bring forward proposals during the following week. Meanwhile,

consumer groups had recently began to mount a campaign in favour

of the MMC&apos;s recommendations and, overall, public comment on the

C&apos;s report was striking a better balance than had been the

a week or so earlier.

It was unlikely that Sino-Saviet rkl&amp;tion^ would return to the

cities major demonstrations were stillXbeing played out. There

had so far been no violent reaction by the Chinese authorities

but the possibility of deaths of hunger strikers could further

raise the tension.   The management of events^-such as it was,

seemed to be primarily in the hands of Zhao atiyetyq whose

conciliatory approach seemed sensible.   But ths/^ituation was

unpredictable.



THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it

years it had proved possible to replace one President b^

peacefully through the ballot box.   Nevertheless the Perof

victor in the recent elections, Mr Carlos Menem, represent

worrying prospect both for the future of Argentina and for

Falkland Islands.   Mr Menem was not due to take office until

December.   But he had earlier made belligerent statements about

the Falkland Islands, which had more recently been somewhat

toned down, as had his promises about economic policy. Ihe

United Kingdom commitment to the Falkland Islands should and

would remain firm, and so the  prospects for any further

normalisation in relations between the United Kingdom and

Argentina in the near term were poor.   Mr Menem had made pre-

election threats to expropriate British property in Argentina,

which included two banks and assets belonging to Imperial

Chemical Industries, quite apart from the question of



debt.    There had also been a menacing note in

references to the need for early completion of

tina&apos;s missile programme Condor.   Publicity of this kind,

ither inflammatory statements by Mr Menem, might actually

ful in the international community.   It might help sober

itions of the United States Administration about



this could assist the United Kingdom both in

American arms sales to Argentina and in resisting

to be more flexible over sovereignty of the Falkland

although it was disturbing that Argentina continued to

receive assistance from other countries in the development of

its weapons

directive on tobacco labelling.   He had voted against

detailed prescriptions for health warnings.   He had

draft directive on the maximum content of tar in cigarettes

on similar grounds but had not reached the

classic pattern was the establishment of an expert group which

in turn gave rise to a programme of work and eventually a

proposed directive.   The source of authority for such activities

was not infrequently Council declarations, including references

in the conclusions of the European Council, often of apparently

unexceptionable generality.   The cancer programme, begun under

the UK Presidency, was one example.   Another source was informal

Councils, where discussion could again open the way to

Commission proposals for a programme.   The matter was



licated by the likelihood that a programme of harmonisation



well be debated over a period of years, during which

ptical positions became steadily more entrenched. More

ly it had to be recognised that the judgements of the

Court of Justice were informed by its view of the

e realisation of the purposes of the Treaty. The



liament also favoured an extended Community role,

the institutional position was the Commission&apos;s

proposal which was associated with the difficulty of

ever definitively removing proposals from the Oommunity agenda.

In further discussion it was argued that the United Kingdom

should not overlook the benefits achieved byvCEe\ operation of

the Single European Act.   A major illustratl&lt;^of-ti1e

achievements possible through a positive appro^piTjVddressed to

the problem of the Commission&apos;s role, was the lKg^ &gt;Kingdam&apos;s

advocacy of a comprehensive single market program^c/^his had

dominated the Community agenda in a way analogous

statement of a legislative programme in The Queen &apos;s&lt;S &gt;^ei h. In

considering how best to deal with current proposals fojr

harmonisation it would be right to reassert the merit&apos;

voluntary arrangements.   In particular, the United KingcS

should take every opportunity to make clear the positive

objectives which lay behind the United Kingdom stance and \&amp;&amp;^r/

standards achieved in this country.   For example, the recortrlra/^

training and health and safety was second to none. The

proposals being brought forward by Socialist

members of the Commission under a succession of Socialist

Presidencies were not dissimilar to those brought forward and

rejected in the past.   When the full implications of over

regulation were brought out it had frequently been the

experience that member countries had drawn back from them. More

generally, however, it would be necessary to make every effort

to take effective legal and political countervailing action in

ich of the areas discussed.   It would be necessary to build

Liances with like-minded member countries which would vary

to different policy areas.   It was possible to make

:ive use of institutional arrangements such as informal

Lis, assuming they could not be curtailed, to put forward

of attraction to the United Kingdom, for example, to



aud.   On occasion the United Kingdom could also make

Ld other member countries, of the insertion of words in

:ions.   Consideration might need to be given to further

in these areas.   In suitable cases, such as the Social

Charter, it would be right to look for the active support of the

CBI and of institutions representing small businesses. In

particular s^tfuanions the United Kingdom could contemplate

recourse to t^J33j5px1bourg compromise.
