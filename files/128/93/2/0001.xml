of Commons in the following week.



HOME SECRETARY said that because the Opposition had withdrawn

 ration over the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions)

was necessary to introduce a timetable motion, which would be

&gt;on the following Monday.    The Opposition was reacting to the

t&apos;8 limited derogation under the European Convention on Human

a result pf.the judgment by the European Court of Human Rights

r^Jrof Brogan and others v.  the United Kingdom.    In his view the

(n had misread the situation and their reaction to the

uc1u6?!.i.in would not help them.    It was not proving at all easy to find

a practicable form of judicial oversight of the detention of terrorist

suspects in accoc4ance with the Court&apos;s judgment, that would meet the

Court&apos;s interp/eTfarVion of the Convention.    In the context of Northern

Ireland terror\s .2* wever, there was no doubt about the need to search

for a way of presfofviflg a power to detain suspects for up to seven

the deportation order to be implemented^ Early on the previous day,

therefore, Mr Mendis had been taken from^the Ascension Church and had

been placed in detention in Pentonville Prison to await removal



Criticism of the methods used to achieve Mr Men

hours of the morning was misconceived.    As he/via

of Commons on the previous day, the Ascension

of large gatherings of supporters of Mr Mendis,

Manchester Police had been anxious to proceed at

would have run the risk that his legal advisers mi

injunction from a judge at an emergency hearing at whic

were not represented, and he had therefore decided that

should be postponed for 48 hours.    He could be represent

about the prospects of success.    The Archbishop of Canterbur

fact, on 5 January the Bishop of Manchester had been told by the

\Minister of State, Home Office, that Mr Mendis&apos; deportation would be

stponed for a week to allow extra time in which to seek an alterntive

itination.    Two weeks had now elapsed.    He proposed to reply to the

^bishop of Canterbury later that morning, referring to the advice

,to the Bishop of Manchester and confirming that Mr Mendis would

be deported to Sri Lanka on the following day unless he could

va firm undertaking by another country that was willing to

  at once.    The Irish Republic would not, however, be an

actepvwvy,&apos;destination for Mr Mendis, in view of the common travel area

that exVtfte^ between it and the United Kingdom.



THE PRIMEvlINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion,  said that Mr Mendis1

continued defiance of the law was unacceptable and the operation to take

him into custody and deport him was entirely justified.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had been^impressed on a recent visit to

Italy by the degree of concern expresseavby the Italian authorities

about increased use of cocaine.    This had emerged very clearly from

discussions in Turin and with the Prefect of Milan.    His attention had

been drawn to a sharp increase in deaths from wfMoses.   The problem of

subversion of justice associated with the exteSaai^ _ raffic was also

said now to have assumed major proportions.    HeWwjT^heceived a similar

impression on an earlier visit to Spain where theyVayj^eyities had

expressed concern that Spain was becoming a highway^^dVJrug traffic

from Latin America to Europe.    In discussion referenO^^aXmade to the

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment figures

for December would be published that day.    There had been a sharp

reduction of 66,000 in the seasonally adjusted total to 2.039 million.

^This was the twenty-ninth consecutive monthly reduction, which was by

Ear the longest continuous period of falling unemployment since the

;ond World War.   The unadjusted total had fallen by 20,000 to 2.047

   .    The total was the lowest figure for nearly eight years and

ited reductions of 530,000 in the previous twelve months and

since the General Election.    The rate of unemployment had fallen

td^7J st&gt;eT cent, which was below the rates in many other countries

incwaii^ France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, the Republic

of Ir^^iNand Canada.    All regions had benefitted, with the largest

reducrhnra&apos;in the previous twelve months having occurred in the West

Midiandao? he North West and Wales.    The number of people in work had

never beew^higher, even excluding those on work-related Government

training programmes such as Employment Training and the Youth Training



of which there were estimated to be some 700,000 in

^le, were holding up well, although the number of

job centres had fallen by 6,000 to 238,000.

a. The Opposition w&amp;iSfeek to distract attention from the very

welcome reductions iiMineaployment by claiming that the figures had

been distorted by varibtt^&amp;wanges in the definition of

unemployment.   However, \&amp;&amp;yp13:iticisms carried very little

themselves that unemploymentr ir3kfalling throughout the country.

weather.    Such an increase in uneri

December 1988, which had been unusv ^



the seasonally adjusted total was therefore artificially high.

This would mean that the reduction in the seasonally adjusted total

for the current month was likely to be 10w^rr6.han would otherwise

c.     The reduction in the rate of increase i

represented in part the dropping out from th

of 1987.    There were some signs that earnings we

far below the levels which had been predicted in

the media.

other members of the European Community in securing more jobs.

However, the improvements in this area would be put in jeopardy if

the Community were to adopt the sort of proposals which were being

put forward by Monsieur Delors,  the President of the European

Commission.



The Government&apos;s critics were likely to argue that the figures

those in work failed to paint a true picture since a

nificant proportion of the total comprised part-time jobs. In

however, surveys had consistently shown that most part-time

wo^rs, who included many married women and retired people, would

&lt;x t^3 fteh to take on full-time jobs.



f. V/Cr the United Kingdom, around 60 per cent of. women worked

outs*nle the home and, on a standardised European basis,

unemployment among women was substantially below the European

average.    This demonstrated that the position on female employment

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had been in Vienna

earlier that week for the conclusion of the current session of the

Conference on Security had Co-operation in Europe.    The Ministerial

meeting had marked the end of the latest round of advances on human

ights and had laid the foundations for the conventional stability talks

ch would open in the first week of March.   The Conference had shown

it represented a process of continuing success, providing a series

pping stones into the future.    The prospects were better now than

geared likely some years ago and a series of further conferences

agreed.    there was pressure on Czechoslovakia and Romania to

line with the rest of the participating member states as

gress on human rights.    He had told the Soviet Foreign

j^Eduard Shevardnadze, that the Government&apos;s position on a

s conference in Moscow in 1991 had changed since their last

u????v0  this in New York in September 1988.    The United Kingdom

was now willing to contemplate this but on strict conditions, notably

that President Gorbachev&apos;s oral commitment to change Soviet law bearing

on certain humatKi^ghts provisions would be converted into practice.

Mr ShevardnadzeMna&lt;vsaid that he was glad to hear the new British

position on the   ^^ ^  conference and had given the impression that the

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said th3rtiftfh\draft Green Paper on the work and

organisation of the legal prdfceVk^ftn set out to examine from first

principles what would be requi^e^o^the profession in the future. It

set effective competition and th/*pja &gt; te nance of standards as the two

principal aims of policy.    He believ^Jvthat these aims were fully

compatible.    The draft Green Paper&apos;pufc^particular emphasis on new

arrangements for legal education anc&amp;wnS^Saintenance of professional

standards.    There would be a greatly swrtmg^hened Advisory Committee on

Legal Education and Conduct, with a majvirty of lay people, and

standards for competence and conduct woul^ be set in the light of their

advice.    Rights of audience would be given only to those who were

properly trained,  suitably experienced and subject to satisfactory codes

of conduct, and would no longer depend on membez^Shp of a particular

professional body.    The Green Paper also proposed tyiat

multi-disciplinary practices should be allowed

The draft Green Paper on conveyancing by authorised prac

issues of great importance to solicitors.    For many of t

provided more of their income than litigation.    It was th

essential that they should be able to compete on terms which

rs raised

,veyancing



confidential




!confidential!



whether conveyancing services could be provided by employees of lending

institutions.    It had been argued that this would lead to conflicts of

interest but he believed that this would happen only in very exceptional

cases.    The Green Paper therefore put forward the view that adequate

feguards could be devised which would allow solicitors and licensed

veyancers employed by lending institutions to undertake conveyancing

on behalf of their employer&apos;s clients.    It was most important

that the code of conduct should ensure that authorised

ioners did not offer their services below their true cost. This

ary to reassure solicitors that they would not be subject to

!petition from lending institutions offering conveyancing



The draf^ Green Paper on contingency fees suggested the possibility of
