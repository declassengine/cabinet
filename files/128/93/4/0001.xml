RY    1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.



.PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the

ry of State for Health on his extremely successful presentation

White Paper on the reform of the National Health Service.



Jabinet -



l^^x^armly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks.



THE LORD PRIVYUSEaO said that at Committee Stage of the Companies Bill

in the House of^3^?d?s\on the previous Monday, an amendment had been

carried against ibgAApice. of the Government which sought to provide

that companies woul^ifered to obtain the approval of their shareholders

at the annual generay $  fcing for any proposed donations for political

purposes.    He was dis^asi^qg the matter with the Secretary of State for

Trade and Industry and wra&amp;he Lord President of the Council, and he

hoped shortly to bring fv^^fyv proposals for remedying the matter.



THE PRIME MINISTER, summing

been pointed out in the deba

required to disclose in the di

political purposes that exceede

concerned about such donations we

annual general meeting and, if

dispose of their interest in the co



ief discussion, said that, as had

he amendment, companies were already

report any gifts of money for

shareholders who were

to raise the matter at the

sufficiently dissatisfied,

These safeguards were



and



in



entirely adequate, and the analogy whi^^^fe Opposition had sought to

draw between political donations by coniMnies and the trades unions&apos;

political levy was manifestly specious. vThe Lord Privy Seal should

bring forward proposals for reversing the effect of the amendment,

the way in which he had indicated.



The Cabinet -



2.       Took note with approval of the Prime

summing up of the discussion and invited the L

to be guided accordingly.

2.     THE HOME SECRETARY said that on the previous Monday most of the

uniformed prison officers at Wandsworth Prison had refused to implement

a new shift system that the Governor had introduced under the Fresh

Start scheme.    Consultations had been undertaken on the new system for

wo months, and it was entirely reasonable.    After the staff concerned

d been warned of the consequences of not accepting their duties, they

been suspended without pay.    Since then only a handful of uniformed

  officers had been working in the prison, which was being run by

r grades and police officers from the Metropolitan Police,

e Monday night there had been considerable tension in the

ut the police had worked hard to improve the situation and the

now calm.    Discussions with the Prison Officers&apos; Association



en place at the Home Office- in an attempt to resolve the

d they would continue that day.    The member of the POA

ecutive Committee who was handling the dispute was seeking to

reach a settlement, but might not carry his branch members with him.

Wandsworth was the most difficult of the London prisons which were, in

turn, the most ji^HJicult prisons in the country.   Despite substantial

increases in stuff.vwith the prospect of a further increase the

following month/^^ ~W|ndsworth staff had been the slowest in the

country to relinq!\\aJj//  trictive practices and to adapt to the improved

efficiency and managgMtftAthat was embodied in Fresh Start. The

imposition of the new/sjferN. system and the acceptance of prisoners at

Wandsworth up to the p^efir^ maximum operational capacity were key

points on which there cou^^^^.1 Nevertheless, there might



modation with the POA on the Wandsworth

g rather than substance, although

an of the POA, would undoubtedly

ibit prison officers from certain

and should be dampened down.

Mr John Bartell, the nationa]

seize on any opportunity to mi

legislation was in preparation

forms of industrial action was



discussion the following main poia^^jgre made:



a.       The POA had a notoriously b^^p^brd for seeking to preserve

restrictive practices and obstruct management reforms, and some

prison officers behaved reprehensibry in pursuit of those aims.

There was, for example, truth in the allegations that some

Wandsworth prison officers had incited the prisoners to misbehave

on the previous Monday in order to make thyi^^jc of the police more

difficult.



b.       The management reforms in the prison se&apos;

bearing fruit,  though the effects were still pa

prisons there had been noticeable improvements i

of management and the quality of life for the inma

the main barrier to progess, and that would remain th

some time to come.    Although new recruits to the pri

tended to be of good quality,  the traditional source b

from the armed forces had declined many years previously

interim there had been many years&apos; recruitment of staff w

standards and esprit de corps, and whose voice was prominerf

c.       Some prison officers who had been expelled from membership of

the National Executive of the POA were making moves towards the

foundation of a breakaway prison officers&apos; union, of an ostensibly

more moderate cast.    Given the origin of this movement, however, it

was unlikely that it would attract general support among prison

officers.



MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

f(iiiyv?J*pported the action that the Home Secretary was taking in

In discussion,  it was noted that some local authorities had in the past

boycotted Consolidated Gold Fields in their procurement arrangements

because of the company&apos;s links with South Africa^3Jvt that, under the

Local Government Act 1988, discrimination by lcwal ehthorities of this

kind was now illegal.



THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, sai

noted that Minorco was now free to pursue its takeov

Consolidated Gold Fields.

Commission who had indeed so far made no attempt to query them with the

difficulties on this front in relation to the passage of current United
