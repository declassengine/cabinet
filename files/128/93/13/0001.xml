LORD PRIVY SEAL said that,  although an amendment which had sought to

oduce a public interest defence into the Official Secrets Bill had

efeated at Committee Stage in the House of Lords, a further

nt which sought to introduce a more far-reaching version of that

had been tabled for consideration at Report Stage on the



Tuesday.    The Government was scrupulous in observing the

op^that an issue which had been settled at either Committee

eport Stage in the House of Lords should not be reopened at a

The Government&apos;s strict adherence to this convention put

it in a strong position in its negotiations with other parties on the

handling of business:  for example,  the Opposition had recently been

prevailed upoty^3fcv to take to a vote at Report Stage of the Football

Spectators Bill aityfendments on matters which had effectively been settled

at Committee S1&gt;a^i?-N\Jle was giving consideration to the best way of

handling the remeVj^iwg. debates on the Official Secrets Bill.    A number

of senior memberslpf^tjf\e House had provided influential support in the

earlier proceedings f&gt;vty1&amp;t&amp; Bill,  and he would be seeking to mobilize

their support for thex^m^ning stages.

ck Work Bill THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, as



agreed at their previous meeting, he had announced on t

evious Thursday that legislation would be introduced to abolis



ference: Scheme,  and the Bill to secure this had been published



(89) 12.2       day.    The announcement had been well received by the Gover

supporters.    Dockworkers had taken some limited industrial

following the announcement, but this had&apos;now come to an end

temporarily.    The Transport and General Workers Union docks co

which had met on the previous Tuesday, had favoured an immediate ballot

of its members on a national ports strike, but the union&apos;s General

Secretary, Mr Ron Todd, had taken the view that the union should first

seek negotiations with the port employers.    This was because Mr Todd was

concerned that any strike action against the abolition of the Scheme

:&gt;uld be deemed to be unlawful unless it had followed a breakdown in

negotiations with the employers.    The union&apos;s executive committee would

2$ weting on the following day, and the union would be convening a

vpyCS} delegate conference on the day after that.    It might well be that,

tvl)s ?ing those meetings,  the union would seek to enter into



ions with the port employers.    The employers would clearly not

 y&amp;a to accept a substitute scheme for the Dock Labour Schemej

.!ley were to refuse to negotiate, or negotiations were to break

aown,  c^en dockworkers could be expected to take industrial action. The

National Association of Port Employers, which had been handling the

situation with great skill, would later that day be providing a public

undertaking tijJCENthere would be no return to causual employment in their

docks following yne repeal of the Scheme.    This undertaking would cover

90 per cent   3 ?&gt;3  workers currently in the Scheme.    Since the Scheme

had been established .,to counter the abuses associated with causal

labour,  this guaV^^ae effectively removed its main rationale.    It was

indeed notable that/)Hv se who had opposed the Dock Work Bill had made

little or no attemprx^T^efend the Scheme on its merits.    It was

manifestly clear that cft/e^te was no longer a requirement for casual

dockworkers in modern ^kr^s^given the sophisticated nature of the

equipment which was no\A\jsi

Unemployment     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that



for March would be published that day.    The seasort

Previous had fallen by 30,600 to 1.918 million.    This was



Reference: consecutive monthly reduction, which was by far the 1



CC(89) 11.2       period of falling unemployment since the Second World



unemployment had fallen to 6.7 per cent, which was below

Community average.    Unemployment had fallen in all region1

largest reductions in the unemployment-rate having occurre

Midlands and Wales.    The unadjusted total was now below two

having fallen by 58,000 to 1.960 million.    The number of peopl

had never been higher, with an estimated increase of 169,000 in the

workforce in employment  in the fourth quarter of 1988.    He would also be

announcing later that day that the underlying increase in average

earnings in the year to February had been 9 V4 per cent, a rise of I/4

per cent on the year to January.



discussion,  the following main points were made:



General



Practitioners

Remunerat ion



The reduction in unemployment and the increase in the number

people in work over recent months were both extremely

ogj-isfactory.    However, the media would no doubt focus on the

i^tyther increase in the growth in average earnings, which they

claim was a sign that the economy was overheating,

ertheless, the increase in the growth in average earnings, while

cl^rly unwelcome, was not unexpected.



b.     Whileoroductivity growth in the manufacturing sector was very

good, oyygTale that sector it remained far too low.    This was partly

attribu&amp;Ahl&amp;-to the fact that changes in the labour market lagged

behind tho^exp\ the rest of the economy.



THE PRIME MINISTE

unemployment and e

further rise in the



ing up the discussion, said that the figures on

remained very encouraging.    However, the

of average earnings was a cause for concern.



The Cabinet -

Took note.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH^^^that the Government had made

clear in a Green Paper published 1tC^^0? and in a White Paper published

in the following year that it intend d?^ negotiate new contracts for

General Practitioners (GPs), and det^aed negotiations with GPs&apos;

representatives had been continuing fo  the previous 12 months. GPs1

representatives agreed that a new contract should be brought in from

April, but the two sides were in disagreement on virtually all the

details of the Government&apos;s proposals.    It w^~olear that the new

remuneration package needed to be settled qiiiclcry^so that GPs could make

the necessary preparations for any changes the//n&gt;TVht wish to introduce

to the way they ran their practices and so t ha 0^4 ^ ?^ s sue did not become

enmeshed with the issues to be covered in the He^MV^Sjrvices Bill

planned for the following Session.    Under the Gove/p^p^&apos; s proposals,

there would be no reduction in the overall pay bill^

benefit at the expense of those who performed less wer

suggested that this would encourage some GPs to take

patients, but it was quite clear that GPs who took on an

Government&apos;s proposals would encourage the provision of services such as

cervical cancer screening, vaccinations and minor surgery.



THE PRIME MINISTER,   summing up a short discussion,  said that it was

important that the new remuneration package should be settled in the

!ear future.    The Department of Health had produced an excellent set of

&gt;tters which were being sent to those who had commented on various

Z^ects of the White Paper on the reform of the National Health Service

ajm\ n the proposals on GPs1  remuneration.    As to the latter point, it

VouJt&lt;Pbe important to get across to the public that the Government&apos;s



Is were intended, not to reduce total remuneration but to achieve

fr^distribution of it for those who carried the heaviest workloads

ONWEALTH SECRETARY said that following urgent

kend&apos;s meeting of the joint commission of



plan, a framework had been agreed in the

tion for returning personnel of the South

tion (SWAPO) to north of the 16th parallel

United Nations (UN) forces.    This had

fforts from all parties including the

Zambia,  though not all the front line

i^rtTslementation of the measures in the

since there were not yet suf f icYeai^tfN forces present in Namibia,

although more would be arriving v&amp;wrii^the next few days.    In the

meantime a British contingent from\K6^Rj&gt;ya 1 Corps of Signals,

Australian forces and some others we?v ??aoing their best to hold the

position and to man the nine designat1^ checkpoints (two in Namibia and

seven on the Namibia/Angola border) through which it had been intended

that the SWAPO personnel should be disarmed and returned to Angola.

Further complications were the lack of clear^iSXtructions to SWAPO

personnel from their own leadership and the(nea^y-handed attitude of the

South African defence forces on the ground wivSy^mkined in the vicinity

of each checkpoint.    The recent South African WljjrfJ .that SWAPO personnel

were subject to &quot;interrogation&quot; before being retflmfl to Angola had been

especially unhelpful.    So far only four SWAPO pers/^ &lt; i\.had reported to

the checkpoints although 190 others were reported

Angola of their own accord.    A recent corrective stat

African Administrator-General for Namibia had placed

the position remained very volatile.    He himself would

The judgement of Colonel Donaldson, who commanded the British Signals

unit, was that the situation could probably be held until the arrival of

more UN troops.    The Government was meanwhile making available 0 

Landrovers and 12 four-wheel drive trucks to the UN forces in Namibia.

Basically the South African Government wanted the Namibia peace plan to

,work.   The question remained why the SWAPO leader, Mr Sam Nujoma, had

ade such a fundamental error of judgement in allowing SWAPO incursions



trary to the terras of the agreement.    The United Kingdom would

Drtcsinue to make every effort to help keep the peace plan intact while

lh&amp;ing people that, unlike the case of Zimbabwe, the real

Exsng^bility for making the plan work in Namibia rested with the UN.



THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said it was clear that the visit

of the President of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, to the

United Kingdafni&apos;^pm 6 to 8 April had been highly successful. President

Gorbachev&apos;s (ft^e^tives had been to seek support for his radical internal



reform program

and to present a ?

In a brief discussion,  it was noted tf^tt President Gorbachev&apos;s departure

from the United Kingdom had coincided with an incident in which East

German border guards had fired on fugitives it!Berlin, with violent

suppression of demonstrations in Tbilisi in/^6v\\pt Georgia and with a



defensive attitude over the sinking of a So

submarine north of Norway.    This had usefully

more traditional characteristics of the Soviet

surface.    At the same time there was a continuin

offensive, for example over the future of short r

Europe and the inclusion of naval forces in arms co 

The Soviet strategic aim remained to detach the United

Europe by means of the slogan of denuclearisation, as

President Gorbachev&apos;s crude threat that modernisation b

of short range nuclear forces would stop conventional for

in Vienna.    President Gorbachev,  in his programme of polit

was riding a tiger that might well outstrip his own expecta

therefore remain support for the internal Soviet reform programme

coupled with resolute determination to maintain Western defence.

Another vivid example of political advance was Poland, where the

remarkable decision to hold free elections in June would lead to the

transformation of the political climate; although neither the Communist

Party nor the trades union organisation,  Solidarity, had yet fuily

hought through the implications.    Meanwhile the Polish economy remained

a state of serious deterioration.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that a very recent and lengthy

judgement of the European Court of Justice, which had not yet been fully

analysed, appeared to indicate that national bans on cross-border

ticketing were illegal.    This would increase airline travellers&apos; ability

to shop around for cheaper fares and give the Commission additional

justification for pressing on to the next phase of air transport

iberalisation.    The judgement also appeared to involve the



ication of Community rules on competition not only to flights within

ommunity but also to routes between Community and non-Community

po^ts.    He would be discussing the issues raised by the case with

Sijp^eQfl Brittan in the near future.



THE SEC1&amp;ETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT drew attention to the vote by

the European Parliament on 12 April which endorsed higher emission

standards for small cars than those agreed by the Council in 1988. The

European Pary^rfmi^jit appeared to be supporting standards similar to those



e United States, which could only be met by the

on of three-way catalysts into small cars. This

e in itself and in fuel use and could perversely

by the European Parliament and that ^X^^KOmmission would need to

accept no linkage between the need for the French to come into line with

Community rules on Nissan cars of United Kingdom origin on the one hand,

and on the other hand, wider issues related to local content and

continued national controls on imports of vehicles from Japan.    This was

^itsu, into the United Kingdom, on which a note would be circulated to

;agues.

CHANCELLOR said that the judiciary&apos;s response to the Green



Paper on the work and organisation of  the legal profession was

developing in a way that was attracting a good deal of unfavourable

public coinmeyn^-P^pne reason for this was the assertion made by the Lord



House of Lords debate on the Green Paper on the

there had been no offer of consultation with the

Paper was being prepared, with the implication

tation period on the Green Paper was inadequate

Chief Justice to sugges

informal way,  so that w

invitations given for res

to give their views. The

invitation on the grounds

from the preparation of the d

decision that the judges had ha

Green Paper when it was publishe

importance of the matter, he had

attention to this correspondence dui^yng 

previous Friday,  and the Lord Chief



their views.    In fact, when the Green Paper

previous autumn he had written to the Lord

t it would be useful for the judges to be

otice of the Government&apos;s proposals,   in an

paper was issued to the public and

to it,  the judges might find it easier

ief Justice had declined that



judges should remain at arms&apos; length

and it was entirely owing to that

ior notice of the contents of the

&lt;rT2-5 January.    In view of the

-^giythe Lord Chief Justice&apos;s



he course of the debate on the

stice had authorised him to put



the facts of the correspondence on record during his winding-up speech,

and to state that the Lord Chief Justice withdrew his allegation that

the Government had behaved discourteously ove _J:he matter of

consultation.    This  incident had generally

displaying the judiciary in an unflattering

the media had since moved to the special meetT

High Court judges which was being convened for

when it was proposed that the relevant court sit

suspended.    This meeting, which the Lord Chief J

announced during the previous Friday&apos;s debate, had

because the senior judges had few routine opportuniti

discussion,  and some special arrangement was clearly

that had been allowed.    It was certainly very desirable

consultation period.    In the circumstances  it would be difficult to

argue that the consideration of  such a major matter of public policy as

the reform of the legal profession lay completely outside the judges&apos;

duty.    Indeed,  when he had learnt  from the Lord Chief Justice that this

meeting was being arranged he had indicated  that he would wish to &amp;ttend

it in his capacity as a judge.    In the event, however, he would be

^nable to attend the meeting since he had other commitments on 17 April

\d the Lord Chief Justice had now written to say that the date of the

i^te&amp;ting could not be changed, because of the problems in altering court

li^C^ngs at short notice.    He did not think that the Lord Chief Justice

Mr ji^ier judges were being intentionally provocative in organising a

m^ *jrS^in this way; he believed,   rather,   that they regarded  it as quite

reas^t(6bW to meet  in court hours in order to make a properly prepared

respop^e&apos;to the Government&apos;s proposals within the short time that was

being 11   owed.    A storm of protest at the use of court hours for this

purpose had now blown up in the media, however, and the judiciary were

no doubt greatly t3ken aback by this.



In discussi



following main points were made:



a. The

i11-advise

Their propo

the Green Pap

the worst tradi&apos;ti

criticism wouId

planned,  the Dock

Commons on the same



s response to the Green Paper had been very

rom their point of view, counter-productive.



court hours for preparing their response to

ed the criticism that they were behaving in

f irresponsible trade unionism and this

specially pointed if, as was currently

i^ll had its Second Reading in the House of

t the judges&apos;  meeting took place.



resented something far more serious

ting their judicial duty, or

Convening the proposed meeting in

lacing their own interests above

the old question of who should



b.    The judges&apos; behav

than a simple mistake in

i? sensitivity  to public op

court hours  showed the judge

the law, and posed  in an acu&apos;

guard the guardians.



c.    It was not feasible for the i^vernment to make a public

indication of its view of the judges&apos;  conduct, and an expression of

deep regret was probably as  far as the Government could go.

Nevertheless,   it was most undesirable tKji ?\the judiciary should

bring themselves into disrepute by concf^^ct: ?/g^ the meeting in the



be found to convey

Lord Chancellor

rrange for the

ncellor who were

e advantage of

not be

s of the

f this



way they proposed,  and some  informal wa

that message to them.    This might be done

himself.    Alternatively,  it might be possit)

advice to be conveyed by all the previous Lor

available:  proceeding in the latter way would

distancing the Government from the matter, but it

easy to arrange for the three available previous

office of Lord Chancellor to act in concert on a

k i nd.



THE PRIME MINISTER,   summing up the discussion, said that th

took the most serious view of the senior judiciary&apos;s intentio



confidential




CONFIDENTIAL]



holding a meeting during court hours on 17 April in order to formulate

their comments on the Government&apos;s proposals for reform of the legal

profession.    This action showed the judiciary behaving in the worst

traditions of irresponsible trade unionism, and it merited the

widespread criticism that it had attracted in the media.    It was no

exaggeration to say that the judges were,  in effect,  taking the law into

1^eir own hands, and their action merited condemnation in the strongest

*? most unqualified terms.    Whilst it would not be appropriate for the

^rnment  to go on public  record with any criticism of this sort, every

? should informally be made to persuade the judges to draw back

pinging themselves into disrepute in the way they proposed and, if

pO^siX/k,   to rearrange their consideration of the Green Paper  in a way

thav^rjS^ied any disruption of court sittings!    The Lord Chancellor

shoui9yyskA urgent steps to ensure that the judiciary were made aware of

the CavWt&apos;s views on this matter.
