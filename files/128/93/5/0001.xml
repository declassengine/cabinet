Department of Health and the British Egg Industry Council.    The working

group, which had first met in September 1988, had been given the remit

to review the scientific information on salmonella and eggs, and to

identify areas where further research was needed.    The existence of the

forking group was generally known and there was nothing in its report

*at conflicted with the line that had been taken by the Secretary of

; for Health and himself.    He had been concerned to handle it with

ipm openness, so as to afford no basis for accusations of a



,1p.    The report had therefore been placed in the library of the

Commons following a Parliamentary Question, and he had

its publication in his evidence to the Select Committee. Some

lad recognised that nothing was being held back, and had

to run a story on the matter, but other newspapers persisted

^ing to the report as a secret document, though all the facts

spoke against them.    His Ministry routinely took a great deal of action

on food safety matters, but there had been very little interest in this

field until tha^E&amp;cent explosion of media interest.    He believed that

the guiding p/inci(ple for the Government should be to keep the public

fully inf0rmeav2 ^i X results of scientific study, though media interest

was now so volatlie^that all announcements in this field would require



faction and handling.



the most careful



In discussion the fo



main points were made:



a.     Following sal

safety concern amon

infection, on which

shortly.    Listeria was

and pre-cooked poultry

pregnant women in particul

therefore preparing to issue

important aspect of food



b.     The control of temperature fc aaj&gt;



safety precautions at many pointsv^c the food chain,  including the

point of consumption.    It was now\jear that the proper use of

microwave ovens in the home and elsewhere was an important aspect

of the problem.    The controls applied to industry and the advice

given to the consumer should both deal fu^Jy^yfith the question of

temperature.



c.     Although the increase in food-borne di

related to the considerable changes in techni

the food chain, the renunciation of modern me

represent safety.    There was increasing reason

range eggs presented at Least as great a threat of

infection as did battery produced eggs: the opport

arisen to stress this point during the Select Commit

the previous day, and it was doubtful if the public ye

it.    Untreated milk was another example of so-called na

methods presenting a health risk: the Minister of Agricu

Fisheries and Food had announced on the previous Friday

embarking on the necessary statutory consultation with

d.      Irradiation was another field in which the natural food lobby

had been impeding progress in food safety.    This technique could be

helpful in food hygiene, and it had now been established that its

proper use did not present any human health hazard.



It would be announced that afternoon that, in accordance with

vice from the Food Advisory Committee, the Minister of



culture, Fisheries and Food was embarking on the necessary

Jjfcory consultation  with a view to ending the use of mineral

ocarbons in food production as soon as possible.



THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that public

awareness of food safety was now at a high level, and there were several

forthcoming i^a^ae^ which were potentially very sensitive.    It was

THE PRIME MINISTER said that members ofM;he Prison Officers&apos; Association

(POA) at Wandsworth Prison who had been taking industrial action in

protest against the new shift system which theJiovernment had introduced

under the Fresh Start working arrangements haii/vojipd on the previous

the new working arrangements, at the end of which

that those arrangements would be in place.    The pris

management had made no concessions either on the prin

levels and inmate numbers were not negotiable or on any^ei^

central issues, including an increase in the prison roll&lt;i*p

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the period for submitting

the previous day.   The outcome had been highly satisfactory with 125

applications having been received, the highest number since the seventh

TH^WHj&amp;TARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the private

statut^y^ater companies (SWCs) had announced on the previous Sunday

that ^JSS^c   tended to increase water charges by up to 30-50 per cent.

He was /a4Wjlg in the chairmen of companies which were planning

increasewof more than 10 per cent to make clear to them that there was

no justification for increases of the order which had been proposed.

The Opposition&apos;s allegation that such price increases were the

inevitable result of the Government&apos;s privatisation proposals was

without f oundaty ir^\The SWCs were claiming that the proposed increases

the more rigorous system of controls prwra^^d in the Bill.    In a

separate development there had been an uMelpful intervention by

Mr Ripa, the European Commissioner for the^Environment, who had claimed

that clause 19 of the Water Bill was inconsistent with the European

Community directive on water in that it permitted^jtijter companies to

phase in the improvements in water standards re

reasonable for the Government to take a limited de

directive in order to allow water companies to be

period of 2-3 years.

In discussion, the following main points were made:



a.     The existing system of controls on dividends was attractive to

SWCs because it facilitated the raising of long-term loans from

the banks.    The new controls on water charges proposed in the Bill

would oblige them to adjust their arrangements for raising

capital.



The Government had put in accountants about ten years

ously to investigate the case for proposed increases in water

s of some 20 per cent, which had been significantly reduced

ult.



THE PRlMK&gt;^iINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that price increases

in the oraer which had been announced by the SWCs would be totally

unwarranted.    Every effort should be made to ensure that the proposed

increases were m * rated and to reassure the public that there was

nothing in the OoveAiment&apos;s proposals to privatise the water industry

which would jusVfciy^Sftreases of the magnitude which had been proposed.

an understanding of the Government&apos;s policy.    This year the Gov

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had had a further

,meeting with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Fernandez Ordonez, on

February, as part of the so-called Brussels process, about Gibraltar

elated issues.    These talks had gone smoothly.    The Spanish side

aised sovereignty in a ritual fashion and he had made it clear

at sovereignty could not change against the wishes of the

rians.    The Spanish side had also pressed for movement on the

agreement and he had reiterated the British wish for progress on

in turn had pressed the Spanish side for improvements at the

ffonti^&amp;^J^ween Gibraltar and Spain including the withdrawal of the

ceremonrai guard and the reduction of delays.    The Spanish had floated

the remoV^l of the frontier fence which was already falling into

disrepair.    It was clear that the absence from the talks of the

Gibraltar Chief Minister, Mr Joseph Bossano, had been a negative factor

and he had senb^a^iessage urging Mr Bossano to attend the next round.

Apart from Gibfc41t8 _there were no other problems in Anglo-Spanish

relations.

and the Japanese Finance Minister Murayama, ha

Continuing, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the present

performance of the world economy was in general not unsatisfactory.

However there had been some resurgence of inflationary pressures for the

irst time during the 1980s.    The meeting had accepted that priority had

be given to arresting such pressures through tightening of monetary

cy and acceptance of higher interest rates.    The meeting had also

that trade imbalances in the United States, Germany and Japan

,take longer to correct than had earlier been envisaged. These

were thought to be manageable provided that the countries in

followed appropriate economic policies.    In the case of the

ates the problem of the budget deficit remained a major issue,

sh was attending a joint meeting of Congress that day at

 s required by the Gramm-Rudman legislation.    This figure

!;umpaicu w\^th a deficit of $160 billion in the present year. The

apparent extent of the proposed reduction was, however, to some extent

illusory.    Firstly a 10 per cent margin was permitted, which implied the
