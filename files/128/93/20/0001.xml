THE IORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there would be a debate

the following Monday on a motion to approve the Select Committee

&gt;rt on the televising of proceedings of the House of Cannons. Ihe

!e was not to consider the principle of televising the Cannons,

the House had already agreed that it should be televised cn an

ttal basis, but rather to consider the detailed arrangements

 J representatives of a wide spectrum of opinio! cn the

^ sing of the House of Commons, its report had been agreed with

only^one dissenter.   Sane sections of the media had misrepresented

the report&apos;s recommendations in order to suggest that they were not

the Select Committee towards a report which had received the almost

unanimous support of its members.   The report did not deal with the

principle of televising the House of Commons, but instead put

forward recommendations for giving effect to the House&apos;s earlier

decision that televising should be instituted on an experimental

basis: if the motion were defeated, the only effect would be that the

Select Committee would need to reconvene to draw up revised

tions for the conduct of the experiment.   It would

fore be right for Ministers to support the lord President of the

il&apos;s Motion, regardless of their views on the merits of the

pie of televising the Commons: there would be an opportunity at



of the experiment for the House to decide whether or not

sing should be permitted on a permanent basis.   It followed

f rdl^fchis that Ministers should not support any amendments which

would have the effect of undermining the Committee&apos;s recommendations.

Once the Speaker had selected the amendments for debate, the lord

President atf^Sbe Council should inform colleagues if there were any

amendment^g)jphich different considerations applied.

Scheme ports pending a full hearing of the action brought by the

enployers challenging the legality of the TGWU strike ballot. Ihe

Court&apos;s decision had turned not on the requirements of industrial

relations law but on the obligation placed on registered dock workers

by the 1967 Dock labour Scheme to make themselves available for work

on the Court&apos;s assessment of the balance of convenience between

employers and the union in deciding whether the injunction should

ted.   In assessing that balance, the Court had also had in

injury which a dock strike could cause to the public. Ihe

been given leave to appeal to the House of Lords: it was not

ear whether it would do so, but if it did it was possible that

of Lords might hear the appeal the following week. A

further complication was that the TGWU&apos;s authority for a strike under

the terms of the Employment Act 1980 would run out in the following

week, altharfjfbyit was unclear precisely when this would occur, and

the unicnrpu^i have to re-ballot if it wished to proceed. Official

action beraEfe^mfek end of June was therefore unlikely. Unofficial

THE HOME SECRETARY said that because of the rising n^jflj^^f Kurds

carrying Turkish passports seeking asylum in the UniteTKiftsJcm he

had previously agreed with the Foreign Secretary that

requirement should be imposed on Turkish citizens from

of the following year.   A large influx of Kurds, 1500 of

sought asylum in May, had however led him to bring forward

introduction of the requirement and, as required by a treaty

the two countries, me month&apos;s notice of the decision had been^fiyS

to the Turkish Government on 22 May.   Unfortunately the Turkish

Government had publicised the decision although they had been asked

not to do so, and had declined to agree to an acceleration of the

implementation date.   There was therefore a risk that a large number

of Kurds would seek entry to the United Kingdom before the visa

requirement came into effect on 23 June.   Each asylum case needed

careful examination, not least because of the possibility of judicial

lew.   The majority of asylum seekers seemed, however, to be



c rather than political refugees and thus outside the scope of

United Nations Convention on Refugees.   In view of the numbers

lved, it had been necessary to house some of the asylum seekers

service accommodation, and some 90 of them had already

oluntary repatriation.   The following two weeks could,

prove difficult if more Kurds sought refuge in the United

before the visa requirement came into effect.

IHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that he had announced the

previous day that 178 hospital units had expressed interest in opting

for self-governing status under the Government&apos;s National Health

Service (NHS) reform proposals.   The number which would eventually

exercise the option would inevitably be smaller but there was now a

good base on which to build.   There held been some criticism of the

location of  750,000 to a campaign to explain to staff in the 178

ts the implications of self-governing status.   Given the number of

f involved, and the size of the NHS as a whole, an information

ign of this sort was wholly defensible.  The successful

ishment of self-governing hospitals would be the most



argument possible for the soundness of the Government&apos;s

plans.
