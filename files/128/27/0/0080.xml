Parliament.Debate on the address.(previous reference:C.C.(54)79thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinefs discussion on 24th November it had occurred to him that it would be convenient if Ministers could have some private talks with leading members ofthe Opposition on defence policy before any general statement wasmade on this subject in Parliament. He had had an opportunityduring the week-end to mention this possibility informally to the leader of the Opposition, whose first reaction had not been unfavour-able. If, after consulting his colleagues, Mr. Attlee was able to fallin with this suggestion, it might perhaps be publicly stated in the debate on the Address that this course was to be followed.In discussion there was general agreement that opposition leaders should be given the opportunity of confidential discussions on defence problems, if they were willing to accept it.Later in the meeting the Cabinet were informed of the provisionalviews of the Opposition on the subjects to be raised in the courseof the Debate on the Address. These suggested that the opposition might not be anxious to force a general discussion on defence in thecourse of this Debate.British 2.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 27th August the somali land.     Cabinet had authorised him to seek a settlement with the Ethiopian(Previous        Government in respect of the Haud which, while recognisingReference:      Ethiopian sovereignty, would safeguard the rights of the SomaliC.C. (54) 57th   tribes to continue their long-standing use of this area for grazingConclusions,    during certain periods of the year.   Negotiations had now been minute 3.)       carried to a point at which he hoped it would be possible to sign anagreement later that day with the Ethiopian Foreign Minister.Because, through long usage the Somali tribes had come to regardtheir grazing areas in the Haud as part of their territory, it waspossible that our acceptance of Ethiopian sovereignty under theproposed agreement would lead to disturbances which would requirethe despatch of British troops to keep order.   But the risk that thiswould become necessary was much less than it would be if the presentopportunity were not taken to reach a settlement with Ethiopia whichwould include safeguards for the rights of the Somali tribes in theHaud.There was general support in the Cabinet for the views expressedby the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to complete the proposed agreement with the Ethiopian Government in respect ofthe Haud.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to concert measures, withthe Colonial Secretary and the Governor of Britishn\&amp;. Somaliland, for the prompt despatch of military reinforce-.: - ments should these be required to maintain order amongthe Somali tribes following the publication of thisagreement with Ethiopia.CivilInvestment.(previous reference:CC. (54) 55thConclusions,Minute 8.)3 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 344) recommending that means should be sought to restrict the growing scale of government expenditure on subsidised houses for the double purpose of reducingGovernment expenditure and of furthering other forms of capital investment They also had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (C. (54) 348) drawing attention to the need for thefurther development of hospital services.47188-4B 2
Housing. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the general economic position gave no cause for anxiety, there were some signsof a tendency towards inflation. This must be held in check. Oneof the measures which the Government could take to this end was so to adjust their policy as to avoid a situation in which the buildingindustry became overloaded with competing claims for capital investment. He was on this account anxious to reduce the amountof Government expenditure on housing.   There was every likelihood -fathat the momentum which had been given to house-building by private enterprise would be maintained in 1955 and 1956. The time had therefore come to restrict the number of subsidised houses which local authorities were authorised to build; and he hoped thatauthorisations in 1955 could be limited to about 140,000 as againstthe present level of 180,000. This would leave room for further expansion of industrial investment and for meeting some of the other claims to capital investment, e.g., in roads, schools and hospitals.The Minister of Housing said that he accepted the generalobjective proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and was willing to adopt a total of 140,000 authorisations in 1955 as a target for his own guidance in determining the allocations to be made tolocal authorities for subsidised house-building. No publicity should,however, be given to this figure; for any public announcement of solow a target would be regarded by local authorities as incompatible with the Governments intention to resume the campaign for slum clearance. Moreover, he would certainly have to make some concessions to meet representations from particular local authorities.Hospitals. The Prime Minister said that he was glad that the Minister ofHealth had drawn the Cabinefs attention, in C. (54) 348, to the needfor further capital expenditure on hospitals. He had been impressed by the extent to which this country was falling behind others in theprovision of up-to-date hospitals, and by the urgent need to improve the hospital services in London and elsewhere. He considered thata great campaign should be undertaken to improve this part of our .$social services as soon as the Governments programme for pensionswas completed.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals of the Chancellor of the exchequer in C. (54) 348 for reducing the scale of future government expenditure on housing.EducationPolicy.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 55thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on educationpolicy by the Minister of Education (C. (54) 343).The Minister of Education said that it had been the main concern of his predecessor to provide school-places for the growing number of school-children, which was rising from 5 millions in 1947 to 6fmillions in 1957. The time had now come to tackle the problemof overcrowding in schools and to make a start on the improvementof existing schools, especially in rural areas. The programmeoutlined in C. (54) 343 would involve capital expenditure of not morethan  5 millions in 1955, but it would secure a substantial reductionin the overcrowding at rural schools where both primary and secondary school-children had now to be taught together.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that government expenditure on education had risen since the war from  224 millions to  303 millions mainly in consequence of the larger number ofchildren of school age. He agreed that there was a strong case for proceeding with the improvements recommended by the Minister ofEducation in C. (54) 343, but he hoped that it would be possible to compensate&apos; for this by securing other savings in government expenditure on education.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) No substantial economies could be obtained by raising theage of school-entry or lowering the age of leaving school unless theGovernment were willing to face the problems involved in dispensingwith the services of a proportion of the existing teachers.(b) On economic grounds there was a case for altering thepresent arrangement whereby the Government met the full costincurred by local authorities in providing school meals. There were serious political objections to increasing the charges for school meals,but some savings might be secured by improving the administrative arrangements.(c) The programme outlined in C. (54) 343 would help tomaintain the supply of agricultural labour.(d) Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary extravagance inthe provision of play-grounds at schools in rural areas, where theseamenities were less necessary than in the towns.The Cabinet (1) Approved the programme outlined in C. (54) 343 for further capital investment on education.(2) Invited the Minister of Education and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to examine, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, possible means of securingeconomies in the administration of the school mealsservice and in other aspects of Government expenditureon education.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (54) 360) seeking the views of his colleagues on the expediency of applying economic sanctions against Spain in response to Spanish restrictions directed against Gibraltar.The Colonial Secretary said that the Spanish Government hadintroduced a series of restrictions on travel and trade between spain and Gibraltar with the evident intention of impairing the economy of the Colony. He had considered what means were open to us tobring pressure to bear on the Spanish Government. In trade relations we were not in a position to do Spain more harm than she could do to us; and on balance he thought it would be wiser to concentrateour efforts on building up the economic strength of Gibraltar inorder to reduce its present dependence on Spain. He hoped that itwould be possible to accelerate the construction of new barrackswhich were to be built by the Army, to encourage both naval and merchant vessels, British and foreign, to call at Gibraltar, and toassist the projects for constructing new harbour works and improvedbunkering facilities at Gibraltar. It was, however, for consideration whether it would also be expedient to reduce Spain&apos;s share of theBritish tourist trade by adjustment of the travel allowances.The Foreign Secretary said that in his view political issues shouldnot be introduced into the trade talks which were now opening in madrid. We should do nothing to discourage the flow of trade between the two countries, which now stood at a level of about 40 million a year. The best means of countering Spanish threats to gibraltar was to reduce Gibraltar&apos;s economic dependence on spain and at the same time to demonstrate our determination to retainBritish sovereignty over the Rock. Our policy should be to showourselves reasonable in our trade relations but firm in our supportof the Colony. This policy would involve some immediateexpenditure but would prove economical in the long run.
9^The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be undesirable to introduce political issues into the forthcoming discussions with the SpanishGovernment on trade and payments arrangements in1955.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers concerned, to consider what measures should be takento render the economy of Gibraltar less dependent onSpain.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the legal issues raised by the encroachment of the Spanish authorities inthe &quot; neutral &quot; zone surrounding Gibraltar.East/west trade.(previous reference:CC. (54) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (54) 357) on the situation arising from increasing Russian purchases of copper wire and cable.The Cabinet were reminded that, as part of a wider relaxation of strategic controls on trade with the Soviet bloc, the embargo had recently been lifted on exports of copper wire and cable, but not ofother forms of copper. Since then Russia and her satellites had placed, or were negotiating, such large orders for copper wire and cable, particularly of heavy calibre, as to suggest that they mightbe using this expensive method of building up a stockpile of copper.As a result, the United States Government and the Governments ofother countries represented on the Paris Consultative Group on security Controls were pressing for the restoration of the embargo on copper wire and cable. We were already involved in a disagree-ment with the United States Government about control over the delivery of ships to countries in the Soviet bloc. If, in thesecircumstances, a compromise were considered to be desirable, this might take the form of establishing a global quota for total exportsof copper wire and cable from the Paris Group countries to the soviet bloc; but it would then be necessary to ensure that Chile, which wasnot represented on the Paris Group, did not supply the copper wireand cable which would otherwise be supplied from Paris Groupcountries. A quota figure of 20,000 tons might be sought in thefirst instance, but it might be necessary to accept a lower figure inthe course of the discussions. The point was made, however, that,unless the quota were of the order of 20,000 tons, it was very unlikely that United Kingdom exporters would secure any appreciableproportion of the trade.On the other hand, the view was expressed that the reimpositionof control over exports of copper wire and cable to the Soviet blocwould be severely criticised in commercial circles in this country,and would by itself be difficult to justify. Thus, the recent lifting ofthe embargo on these commodities had formed part of a generalagreement under which exports of raw and semi-processed coppercontinued to be prohibited. The quantities of copper wire and cable which had so far been ordered by countries of the Soviet blocwere relatively insignificant when compared with, for example, total annual consumption of copper wire and cable in the United States oreven in this country. Moreover, far larger quantities of raw copperwere in practice being exported illicitly to Soviet bloc countries, andthe creation of a Soviet stock-pile of copper could be frustratedfar more effectively by the introduction of transaction controls thanby reimposing restrictions on the export of copper wire and cable.It was suggested that all outstanding matters in the field of strategic controls-including shipping and rolling mills as well as copper-should be considered together and made the subject of balancedproposals which should also include an offer to introduce transaction1r x
controls. Comprehensive proposals of this nature might well include,if necessary, an offer to impose a ceiling on exports of copper wireand cable to the Soviet bloc. The details of any such balancedproposals would need to be worked out in further discussion betweenthe Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet Agreed that detailed proposals covering copper wire and cable and other outstanding matters concerning strategic controls should be worked out by Ministers representingthe Treasury, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, Boardof Trade, Admiralty and Ministry of Supply, and submitted for the Cabinefs approval.Formosa.(previous reference:CC. (54) 79thConclusions.Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 367) setting out the arguments for and againstproceeding in present circumstances with the plan for raising theproblem of Quemoy in the Security Council.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentand the Chinese Nationalists were now ready to issue a joint statement about the conclusion of a mutual security treaty between them. Itwas, therefore, necessary for us to decide whether, when this state-ment had been made, we should be prepared to co-operate in theplan for raising the problem of the coastal islands in the security council. On the information at present available, he could not regard either the mutual security treaty or the exchange of lettersaccompanying it as entirely satisfactory from our point of view.To proceed with the Security Council plan in these circumstances might well involve us in public disagreement with the United StatesGovernment. The Foreign Secretary therefore recommended thathe should inform the United States Government that we could notat present agree to the proposed operation in the Security Council,but that we should be prepared to reconsider it when there had been time to assess the reaction in Peking to the conclusion of the mutualsecurity treaty. If his colleagues agreed to his communicating withthe United States Government on these lines, it would be necessaryfor the New Zealand Government to be informed of our views atthe same time.The Cabinet Took note of C. (54) 367 and of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement, and agreed that communications should now beaddressed to the United States and New zealand governments on the lines proposed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th November, 1954.
