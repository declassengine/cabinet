european defence.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 57thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign Secretary(C. (54) 280) covering draft telegrams of instruction to our representatives at Bonn, Washington and Paris on the situation arising from the rejection of the European Defence Community(E.D.C.) Treaty by the French Assembly.The Foreign Secretary said that action was required (i) to bringthe Bonn Conventions into force apart from the E.D.C. Treaty; and(ii) to devise an alternative means of obtaining an early Germandefence contribution within the framework of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).The decision of the French Assembly had had a stunning effect upon our partners in the Western Alliance and only M. Spaak had sofar communicated his views to us officially: these were generally in line with our own thinking, although we could not share his suggestionthat France should be given a further opportunity for consideringthe E.D.C. plan. It was, in his view, essential that we should actpromptly both to prevent a further deterioration of the position andto forestall proposals from other quarters which might not seem tous wise. He had therefore circulated the four draft telegramsannexed to C. (54) 280: these had since been amended in some respects, including, in particular, a redrafting of paragraph 5 of the longer draft telegram to the High Commissioner at Bonn. The first step was to seek the agreement of the United States Government toour approaching the Federal German Chancellor on the lines of thedraft telegrams to Bonn. He would add to the draft telegram to washington a paragraph emphasising the need for prompt action and asking for early American agreement to our taking the proposedinitiative. If this agreement were forthcoming, and if thereafterDr. Adenauer should prove receptive to our proposed approach tohim, it should be our aim to convene within, say, two weeks a meetingof the six E.D.C. Powers, together with the United Kingdom and theUnited States, if possible in London.The Cabinet should be under no illusions about the difficultieswhich would confront such a meeting. Thus, the GermanGovernment might well see little attraction in the Bonn Conventionsnow that they were not to be counter-balanced by the admission ofGermany to E.D.C. They might also be reluctant to enter into any form of agreement on a German defence contribution if this involvedGermany&apos;s acceptance of restrictions and obligations not sharedequally by her future partners. The French Government, on theother hand, might not feel able to bring the Bonn Conventions intoforce unless they continued to embody conditions which germany would not find acceptable in present circumstances. On the questionof Germany&apos;s defence contribution, it might be possible to devisemeans whereby the German Army would be restricted in practice to the twelve divisions for which the E.D.C. Treaty provided, butthere was likely to be difficulty over the questions of her Air Forceand her participation in atomic and thermo-nuclear preparations,from which she was to have been altogether debarred under thearrangements hitherto contemplated.If it should prove impossible to promote agreement between france and the remaining seven Powers, the choice would lie betweenproceeding without France or leaving Germany free to pursue anindependent policy, involving possibly some arrangement with SovietRussia. If the need arose to decide between these two alternatives,we should be bound, in his view, to choose the former.The Prime Minister said that the decision of the FrenchAssembly had put the German Government into a strong tacticalposition vis-a-vis Germany&apos;s Western Allies and had, in his view,presented them with a rare opportunity to restore Germany&apos;s moralstanding and expose the failure of France to rise to the needs of thehour. If Dr. Adenauer were to issue, promptly, spontaneously andwithout waiting for demands on Germany to be formulated, a generous public declaration to the effect that the GermanGovernment would not seek to derive advantage from thepredicament now facing her partners in the Western Alliance, and
A)South Africa.SimonstownNaval Base.(previous reference:CC. (54) 57thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Minister of Defence said that, at the request of the SouthAfrican Minister of Defence, he had arranged an informal meeting atwhich Mr. Erasmus had raised the question of the Simonstown naval base and made it clear that his main aim was that the base should now be handed over to the Union of South Africa. It had been pointed out to him that, in view of the strategic importance ofSimonstown to the whole Commonwealth, the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand would have to be consulted about anythat she continued to recognise that her contribution to western defence must remain subject to limits acceptable to her partners,this would be likely greatly to further her cause, besides reassuringher neighbours. He had it in mind to address a personal message to Dr. Adenauer immediately, urging him to consider making adeclaration on these lines.The Foreign Secretary said that he would welcome a messagein this sense from the Prime Minister to Dr. Adenauer but the suggested terms of such a public declaration should, in his view,be kept as general as possible.Support was expressed for this view on the ground that, byissuing a detailed declaration of Germany&apos;s intentions, Dr. Adenauermight prompt French comment to the effect that German declarationswere not enough and that her undertakings must be formallyembodied in any agreement which might be evolved.The following were the main points made in subsequentdiscussion:  (a) The draft telegram to H.M. Ambassador at Paris instructedhim to approach the French Government on the bringing into forceof the Bonn Conventions but to make no reference to the contemplated approach to Dr. Adenauer about alternative means ofobtaining a German defence contribution. Was it right that theFrench should be left without any indication of our intentions on this second point?The general view of the Cabinet was that, while it would be unwise to expose ourselves to the accusation of having misled theFrench Government in this matter, there would be some advantage in adopting a course which would make it clear to them that their conduct in regard to the E.D.C. Treaty had compelled us to enterinto discussions with the German Government in which we did notyet desire French participation. At this stage, therefore, we should inform the French Government, and likewise the other E.D.C.countries, but only in general terms, that, besides taking up thequestion of the bringing into force of the Bonn Conventions, we were taking steps to consult Dr. Adenauer about the possible alternatives to the E.D.C. as a means of obtaining a German defence contribution.(b) The point was made that the French Assembly&apos;s rejection ofthe E.D.C. Treaty had inflicted a grave wound on the concept of a european community which, although it might be staunched, wouldnot be likely to heal for a long time to come.(c) It was suggested that the French rejection of E.D.C. had been due more to reluctance to surrender national control of the french army than to opposition to German rearmament in principle. AGerman defence contribution which did not involve such a surrenderseemed likely, therefore, to prove more acceptable to French opinion,particularly if the alternative should prove to be the isolation ofFrance.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would address an urgentpersonal message to Dr. Adenauer on the general lines suggested by him in the discussion.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to issue instructions to our representatives at Bonn, Washington and Paris on thelines of the drafts attached to C. (54) 280, subject tonecessary drafting amendments and to the additionalmodifications suggested in discussion.
arrangements in regard to it. Mr. Erasmus had also been reminded that the negotiations in 1951 had broken down on the question ofavailability of the base, and that it was essential that it should be freely available to the Royal Navy in peace, and to the Royal navy and our Allies in war. Furthermore, the base must be efficientlyorganised and maintained. Mr. Erasmus had indicated that SouthAfrica would be prepared to meet these requirements, but it had been impressed upon him that any South African proposal about thefuture of the base would have to be referred to the Cabinet. TheMinister of Defence suggested that, at a further meeting which heand the Commonwealth Secretary expected to have withMr. Erasmus, they should, while avoiding any commitment, try toobtain a clear picture of what he had in mind about the future of the base; and he would then bring the matter again before the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that he was reluctant to contemplate any transaction which would be presented as yet another surrender of the rights and responsibilities of the United Kingdom. Thepolitical pressure engendered by the colour problem might lead SouthAfrica at some time to sever her ties with the United Kingdom andthe rest of the Commonwealth. Indeed, this consideration mightunderline the Union&apos;s desire to have the base handed over to her.The Commonwealth Secretary said that although, under theexisting agreement, the United Kingdom had a perpetual right to use the Simonstown naval base, the defences of the base were owned andmanned by the South African Government. The base was of little value without their full co-operation, and in any case the repairfacilities were very limited. In war we should always need in addition the facilities of Cape Town and Durban. An agreement with SouthAfrica which safeguarded our requirements at Simonstown would be preferable to having no agreement and being unable to useSimonstown in practice because of South African hostility.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Defence and the commonwealth secretary to ascertain what proposals Mr. Erasmus mighthave in mind for the future of the Simonstown naval base,on the understanding that no commitment would be incurred in regard to the future of the base without further reference to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.1st September, 1954.
