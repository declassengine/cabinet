Parliament.washington talks.Anglo-SovietMeeting.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 49thConclusions,Minute 1.)government organisation.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 22ndConclusions,Minute 6.)Ministry ofMaterials.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on the report of the Crichel Down Inquiry was totake place on 20th July. It was agreed that the debate should be heldon a motion for the adjournment of the House.2. The Cabinet continued their discussion of the possibility ofan Anglo-Soviet meeting.The Cabinefs discussion on this question is recorded separately.3. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that thefunctions of the Ministry of Materials had now been so far reducedthat they no longer warranted the continuance of the Ministry as aseparate Department, and the Ministers directly concerned had agreed that its remaining functions should be transferred to theBoard of Trade. They had recommended to the Prime Minister thatan order should be made under the Ministers of the Crown (Transferof Functions) Act, 1946, dissolving the Ministry and transferring its functions to the Board of Trade. This order would need to be approved by an affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament;and, if these resolutions could be passed before the summer recess,the transfer could take effect by the middle of August.The Prime Minister said that he approved this recommendation and would like to announce the decision during the following week.He hoped that the necessary Parliamentary proceedings could becompleted before the summer recess. The Government would gaincredit from the abolition of this Ministry; and it would be unfortunate if, for lack of Parliamentary time, action had to be deferred until theautumn.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the functions of the Ministry of materials should be transferred to the Board of Trade.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider whether the necessaryParliamentary proceedings could be so arranged that thetransfer of these functions could be carried out in August.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 48thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 230) covering a draft of a supplementary Estimate to meet the cost of providing a sessionalallowance for Members of Parliament.In discussion of this draft the following points were raised:  (a) The Cabinet Were informed that there was strong feeling among Opposition Members that the new allowance should be payable from 24th May, when the House of Commons had declaredthemselves in favour of an improvement in the remuneration ofMembers. The Cabinet agreed that the allowance should be madepayable from that date.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with theintroduction of this new system of allowances, it would be necessaryfor the Treasury to withdraw their existing instruction to the InlandRevenue to allow without question any claim for income tax reliefby a Member in respect of expenses up to  100 a year.(c) It was thought possible that, despite earlier assurances thata free vote would be allowed in all the Parliamentary proceedings onthis matter, Government supporters would now be willing that this
Supplementary Estimate should be taken along with others under theguillotine procedure. It was agreed that the Lord Privy Seal shouldhave discretion to handle the Parliamentary proceedings on theEstimate in the normal way unless a strong feeling should be voicedby Government supporters that it should be made the subject of aseparate vote. In that event the position should be further considered by the Cabinet.(d) Some minor drafting amendments to the supplementary estimate were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points raised in discussion, the supplementary Estimate annexed to C. (54) 230 to meetthe cost of sessional allowances for Members ofParliament; and authorised the Financial Secretary,Treasury, to present it to Parliament.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider whether the House ofCommons should be invited to pass this supplementary estimate, together v/ith others, under the guillotineprocedure.Crichel Down 5.

It could not be abolished without legislation amendingCommission. the Agriculture Act, 1947; and he had himself been satisfied that ithad a useful function to perform, both in the management of State-owned agricultural land and in its advisory capacity. He had,however, taken steps to strengthen its membership and he was now making arrangements to pursue a more active policy of disposing ofState-owned land where this was practicable.The Home Secretary said that the Commission^ WelshSub-Commission was at present carrying out the survey of a large area in mid-Wales. This project had been announced in the white paper on Rural Wales (Cmd. 9014) and would, he hoped, yieldvaluable results.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was by no meansconvinced that the Commission ought to be retained permanentlyand he hoped that the Minister would indicate in the forthcoming debate that the Government had the question of its future under active consideration.In discussion there was support for this view. It was also suggested that the Ministers memorandum conveyed the impression that the Government were inclined to retain agricultural land in public ownership and to spend public money in improving it, Shouldnot the State be more ready to dispose of land in poor condition and get the best price it could for it?The Minister of Agriculture expressed his readiness to reconsider the relevant passages in his speech in the light of the views expressedin the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (54) 221.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to settle, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the terms of thosepassages of his speech which concerned the future of theAgricultural Land Commission.

Malenkov.    The President had said that this project would not create any difference between the Governments of the United States,and the United Kingdom or alter his confidence in the PrimeMinister !s dedication to the principles which had united the twocountries in time of peril and now constituted the best guarantee of world peace.    Though he feared the effect on public opinion in 1the United States, he would do his best to mitigate any immediateunfavourable reaction.    On more specific points, the President had welcomed the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that he would not be willing to meet M. Malenkov except on a basis of full equality.He had also been reassured by the Prime Minister&apos;s insistence thatthe Soviet Government should give proof of their sincerity by deedsas well as words; and he had agreed that it would help to re-establish, public confidence if the Russians would undertake to ratify the Austrian Treaty and to co-operate in the Atomic BankPlan.The Prime Minister said that he was gratified by theterms and the tone of the Presidenfs message.The Cabinet wore also informed of a conversation whichthe Foreign Secretary had held with M. Molotov in Geneva, inpursuance of the Cabinet:1 a discussion on 10th July.     This was reported in Geneva telegram No. 898. - M. Molotov had recognised, that this project of a bilateral meeting could not proceed furtheruntil the outcome of the Geneva Conference was known.    Asregards the choice of meeting-place, the Foreign Secretaryrejected a tentative suggestion by M. Molotov that the meeting might take place within the Soviet Union, and had suggested london or, as an alternative, Berne.    M. Molotov had then said that hisGovernment had not yet considered questions of time and place,but he Would noW communicate with them on this and would let the Foreign Secretary have their views in due course.The Foreign Secretary had deduced from this interview that, if itwere finally decided to pursue this project, we need not exclude thepossibility of persuading the Russians to accept London, or alternatively Berne, as the place for a meeting. -THE. PRIME MINISTER said that he would not ask theCabinet to reach decisions on this matter until after the foreign secretary had returned from the Geneva Conference,Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th July, 1954.
Disposal The Home Secretary recalled that on 2nd June the Cabinet had of land approved in principle an announcement of future policy on thecompulsorily disposal of land compulsorily acquired but no longer needed forbought for public purposes. Thereafter, the Ministers concerned had agreedpublic on the terms of the draft statement reproduced in Annex I to hispurposes. memorandum (C. (54) 222). Later, at the request of the Committeeof Ministers which was considering the arrangements for theforthcoming debate, he had arranged for the Land TransactionsCommittee to consider whether this draft went far enough in thedirection of ensuring, wherever possible, the disposal of land whichhad been acquired by the use, or threatened use, of compulsory powers. The Land Transactions Committee had now recommendedthat, before a Department transferred agricultural land acquiredunder compulsory powers to another Department for a purpose forwhich there was no power of compulsory acquisition, the land shouldbe offered for sale to the former owner. If the Cabinet accepted thisrecommendation, he suggested that the closing words of the openingparagraph of the draft statement in Annex I to his memorandum should be amended to read as follows:  &quot; . . . . and is no longer required by the original acquiringDepartment, or immediately by any other GovernmentDepartment possessing compulsory purchase powers, for a purpose for which the use of such powers would be justified.&quot;The Land Transactions Committee considered, however, that if a department wished to transfer land compulsorily acquired to another department for a purpose for which powers of compulsory acquisi-tion existed, it should be free to do so without holding a furtherpublic enquiry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the LandTransactions Committee&apos;s recommendations went as far as seemedto him possible towards preventing unjustified transfers ofcompulsorily acquired land from one Government Department toanother.The following further points were made in discussion:  (a) The Prime Minister said that if, as he understood, theadoption of the policy now proposed would prevent a recurrence ofwhat had happened over Crichel Down, it was important that this fact should be brought out clearly in the debate.(b) The Lord Chancellor said that he felt bound to reiterate hisobjection to giving former owners a pre-emptive opportunity to recover their land, alike on grounds of principle and because of thepractical difficulties to which such a policy would give rise.(c) Some doubt was expressed about the justification for theLand Transactions Committee&apos;s conclusion that it was impracticable to devise a special procedure to be followed in cases where it was proposed that land compulsorily acquired should be transferred fromone Department to another, to take the place of the statutoryprocedure which the second Department would have to follow if itwere proceeding de novo to acquire the land compulsorily. In thisconnection, exception was taken to the statement in paragraph 5 (b)of the Land Transactions Committee&apos;s report that &quot; it can fairly beassumed that, when compulsory powers have once been properlyused to acquire any particular piece of land, its use for any other purpose for which compulsory powers exist would be authorised if those powers were used.&quot; Ought not provision to be made for the hearing of objections to the proposed new use of land which it was proposed to transfer?The Home Secretary said that the amendment to the draft statement of policy which he had suggested would not exclude furtherconsideration of some special procedure to govern transfers of suchland from one use to another, if there should be strong pressure forthis.   It could also be explained in the debate, without disclosing the
Governments legislative intentions, that it remained their policy to dispense with emergency powers so far as possible and thatrevocation of the Defence Regulations governing land acquisitionwould greatly reduce the scope for the overriding of private interestsin land.(d) It was agreed that in line 24 of Annex I to C. (54) 222&quot; personal &quot; should be inserted between &quot; special &quot; and &quot; claim &quot; andthat in line 27 &quot; his &quot; should be substituted for &quot; a special.&quot;The Cabinet- (3) Agreed in principle that the draft statement in Annex I toC. (54) 222 should be amended to conform with therecommendations in the report of the Land TransactionsCommittee annexed to that memorandum.(4) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to settle the final draftof the proposed statement of policy in consultation withthe Lord President, the Home Secretary, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Attorney-General.Disposal of The Minister of Agriculture recalled that in the House ofCrichel Down. Commons on 15th June he had announced that, unless the existingtenancy agreement of Crichel Down was surrendered, it would be impracticable to sell the land back to the successors of the threeformer owners. He was now inclined to think that an offer could bemade in the debate to sell the land, subject to the existing tenancyagreement, to any one of the three former owners. The Ministerread to the Cabinet the draft of the passage on this subject which hewould include in his speech if the Cabinet should favour anarrangement on these lines.In discussion there was support for the Minister of Agriculture^proposal, which would have the advantage of giving CommanderMarten an opportunity to recover his land and might prove attractive to him in spite of the obligation which he would thereby incur to equip the land at a cost of about  35,000.The Cabinet (5) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to offer to sell theCrichel Down land, subject to the existing tenancyagreement, to any of the three former owners.Employment The Minister of Agriculture said that he had sought independent of Messrs. expert advice on the question whether Mr. H. A. R. Thompson, ofSanctuary and Messrs. Sanctuary and Son, had acted properly in pressing a claim forSon as Crown dilapidations on behalf of Mr. Tozer. He had now been advised thatReceivers.      in this matter Mr. Thompson had been guilty of no impropriety but had made two errors of judgment and in another respect had shownhimself incompetent.The Home Secretary said that the Minister of Agriculture had consulted him informally on this matter, and he had formed thepreliminary view that the circumstances would justify terminating theemployment of Messrs. Sanctuary and Son as Crown Receivers.The Cabinet (6) Took note that the Minister of Agriculture would agree withthe Home Secretary what action should be taken in regardto the continued employment of Messrs. Sanctuary andSon as Crown Receivers.High 6.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the CommonwealthCommission Secretary (C. (54) 223) covering a revised version of a communicationTerritories. which he proposed to send to the South African Government(Previous regarding the transfer of the High Commission Territories to the reference: Union.C.C. (54) 46th In discussion it was suggested that the second and thirdConclusions, sentences of paragraph 13 of the draft should be amended to read:  Minute 1.) &quot; whatever view may be taken on the current native policy of theUnion Government and the United Kingdom Government do not

In thesecircumstances the United Kingdom Parliament would not be preparedto assent to transfer were it proposed at the present time.&quot;The Cabinet-Approved the revised draft annexed to C.

The Minister of Labour said that seven or eight thousandworkers at the new steel plant at Margam might find themselves outof work by the end of the week unless means could be found of settling an unofficial strike of coke-oven workers at the plant. Everyeffort was being made to persuade the coke-oven workers to resumefull work.Newspaper Trouble had again risen in the printing works responsible for industry. printing the Daily Sketch, and it was possible that, this might affectthe printing of other newspapers. If the dispute should spread,publication of all national newspapers might be stopped during thefollowing week.The Cabinet-  ..Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.13th July, 1954.
