washington talks.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)Anglo-AmericanDeclaration.464411. The Cabinet had before them two messages from the PrimeMinister (Washington telegrams Nos. 1306 and 1307) regarding ajoint declaration which he and President Eisenhower proposed to publish at the end of their current discussions in Washington. Inthe first of these messages it was explained that the President had suggested that, in lieu of a communique, there should be published a joint declaration on the lines of the Atlantic Charter, setting outthe common aims which the two Governments were pursuing in world affairs. The second message contained the text of the pro-posed declaration, which was to be published later that day. ThePrime Minister sought the Cabinefs approval of this text.Discussion turned mainly on the third paragraph of the proposed declaration, which bound the two Governments to foster by everypeaceful means the attainment of independence by all peoples capableof sustaining it. It was pointed out that this paragraph, thoughdesigned to refer mainly to the satellites of the Soviet Union, wouldbe applicable to Colonial peoples and might therefore be a source of embarrassment to us in our Colonial administration. particular difficulty was felt about the promise to uphold &quot; the right of self-determination.&quot; The doctrine of self-determination, as enunciatedby President Wilson at the end of the First World War, had given rise to countless difficulties between the wars, and it would be unfortunate if these were now revived. Both the Atlantic charter and the Charter of the United Nations were more cautious in theirreferences to self-government. A declaration in the terms now pro-posed might well be held to apply to any separatist movementanywhere in the world: it was likely to cause us embarrassment in cyprus: it might well increase the current difficulties of the FrenchGovernment in North Africa: and it seemed bound to encouragethose elements in the United Nations which were critical of our colonial administration. It was recalled that similar difficulties had arisen over the much more guarded language of the Atlantic Charter,and that the Prime Minister had found it necessary to explain, in a speech in the House of Commons on 9th September, 1941, that those provisions of the Charter had no application to British colonial possessions.The Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable that the proposed declaration should not include the statement that the two Govern-ments were determined to &quot; uphold the right of self-determination.&quot;It was subsequently suggested that, if it were found difficult to persuade President Eisenhower to omit this particular phrase, the cabinet&apos;s views would be met if the first sentence of the third para-graph were amended to read: &quot; We uphold the principles of self-government and will earnestly strive by every peaceful means tosecure the independence of all countries whose peoples desire andare capable of sustaining an independent existence.&quot;In further discussion reference was made to the following points of drafting:  (a) It was suggested that the force of the first paragraph of theproposed declaration, reaffirming the principles of the atlantic charter, was diminished by the qualifying words &quot; in so far as theyare still applicable.&quot; It seemed doubtful whether this qualificationwas strictly necessary.(b) The fourth paragraph, which referred to the reduction ofarmaments of all classes and kinds, omitted reference to the possi-bility of an ultimate prohibition of atomic weapons. This omissionmight be exploited in Communist and neutralist propaganda.(c) In the last sentence of the fifth paragraph the word&quot; citizens &quot; seemed unnecessarily precise. It might be preferable to substitute &quot; Governments &quot; or &quot; peoples.&quot;The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the points raised in discussion, theterms of the declaration which President Eisenhower andthe Prime Minister were proposing to issue at the end oftheir talks in Washington.b 2
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to convey to thePrime Minister the Cabinefs views on the third para-graph of the draft declaration and to suggest that means should be found of avoiding the assertion of an absolute&quot; right of self-determination.&quot;(3) Took note that the Minister of State would convey to theForeign Secretary the drafting suggestions noted in para-graphs (a) to (c) above.2. In the statement on Members&apos; expenses which he had madein the House of Commons on 24th June, the Prime Minister had saidthat, while the Government would not feel justified in present circum-stances in taking steps to increase Members&apos; salaries, they would beprepared forthwith to discuss with the leaders of the opposition parties an alternative method of dealing with this problem. labour members had then indicated that, as a majority of the House had on24th May voted in favour of increasing Members&apos; salaries, they wouldbe unwilling to enter into discussion of alternative means of dealingwith the situation. The Leader of the Opposition had, however, sent a letter to the Prime Minister stating that he would be prepared toenter into a discussion &quot; on the basis of considering how the resolu-tion passed by the House of Commons could best be implemented.&quot;The Cabinet considered what reply should be returned to this letter. They agreed that, in view of its terms, the reply must reaffirmthe Prime Ministers statement of 24th June and, in particular, his reference to the resolution passed by the House on 24th May. Itshould also repeat the Governmenfs readiness to consider alterna-tive means of relieving the serious financial difficulties which some members were experiencing. Subject to these two points, however,the reply should keep the way open for discussions between theParties. It was possible that the Leader of the Opposition might subsequently obtain more discretion to discuss alternative proposalsthan he appeared to have at present. The reply might therefore endby expressing the hope that a meeting might be arranged at whichhe could &quot; explain the full significance &quot; of his letter.The Cabinet Took note that, in the Prime Ministers absence, theChancellor of the Exchequer would reply to this letter fromthe Leader of the Opposition on the lines agreed in the cabinet&apos;s discussion.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation (C. (54) 213)setting out the circumstances in which, by a recent Order in Council,aircraft manufacturers were given the same protection against legal action on account of noise and disturbance caused by aircraft undertest at their airfields as was already available to aircraft operatorsat Government and licensed airfields; and informing the Cabinet thata Prayer for the annulment of the Order had been tabled by theOpposition.The Minister of Supply said that aircraft operators at Govern-ment and licensed civil airfields had been protected by Orders and regulations under the Civil Aviation Act, 1949, against legal actionarising from noise and vibration, provided they complied with certain conditions. The same immunity had not, however, been given to manufacturers&apos; airfields. Recently the owner of a nearby farm had sought damages and an injunction against noise and disturbancecaused by the engines of Hunter jet fighters which were assembled
and tested by the Hawker Aircraft Company at Dunsfold airfieldnear Guildford. If this action had been successful, the productionof jet aircraft would have ceased at Dunsfold and might have been stopped elsewhere as the result of similar actions. In these circum-stances the Home Affairs Committee had agreed that manufacturers&apos;airfields should be put on the same footing in this respect as Govern-ment and licensed civil airfields, but that the Order in Council to effect this should be deferred until the civil action in respect of theDunsfold airfield had been settled. The Attorney-General had advised that the action was likely to succeed and he had thereforeencouraged the manufacturers to come to a settlement with thelitigant. They had been able to do so, and the Minister of CivilAviation had thereupon made an Order in Council under the CivilAviation Act, 1949, which would preclude further actions of thiskind.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that in replying to the Oppo-sition&apos;s Prayer for annulment of the Order he would stress the factthat it did not give manufacturers freedom to make as much noiseas they wished at their airfields. They would be subject to restric-tions imposed by regulations which he could vary from time to timeto take account of progress in devising means to muffle the noise of aircraft.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While the noise caused by aircraft engines at airfieldsundoubtedly caused real disturbance to people living in the neigh-bourhood, the national interest required that no undue handicapsshould be imposed on the development of the aircraft industry.(b) Criticism might well be directed, in the debate, against the drastic provisions of sections 40 and 41 of the Civil Aviation Act,1949. These sections had abolished the right to bring an action fornuisance in any case which was covered by an Order in Council madeunder the Act, and had also provided that no compensation shouldbe payable in this connection.(c) It would be undesirable to reopen the way to any form ofcompensation in cases of this kind, since this would expose theGovernment to numerous claims in respect of R.A.F. airfields andpossibly airfields in use by the United States Forces.. (d) Notwithstanding the powers available to the government under the Civil Aviation Act of 1949, the making of the Order inCouncil had been deferred until a settlement had been reached inthe Dunsfold case.The Cabinet Endorsed the action taken by the Minister of Civil Aviationunder the Civil Aviation Act, 1949, to extend to the airfieldsof aircraft manufacturers the same protection against legal action arising from noise and vibration as already existed for Government and licensed airfields.Reorganisation 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theof the Minister of Transport (C. (54) 211) submitting for their approval aRailways.        draft White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Railways.The Minister of Transport said that, in pursuance of Section 17 (1)of the Transport Act, 1953, he had consulted various interests on thescheme submitted to him by the British Transport Commission andhad found that it commanded general support save for the TradesUnion Congress and the Scottish Trades Union Congress, whose objec-tions to it were based on political considerations. The Home AffairsCommittee had approved the draft White Paper subject to certain points which were covered in his memorandum, but he had felt itnecessary to bring the matter before the Cabinet because of the
nationalised industries.(previous reference:C:C. (54) 3rdConclusions,Minute 6.)Appointmentof SelectCommittee.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (54) 210) seeking authority to announce the Govern-ment&apos;s intention to proceed with the appointment of a SelectCommittee on the nationalised industries.The Lord. Privy Seal recalled that, with the Cabinefs authority, hehad announced in debate in the House of Commons on 8th Februarythat the Government favoured in principle the appointment of a standing Select Committee, subject to consideration of any views which might be expressed from either side of the House. Oppositionto the appointment of such a Committee had been expressed by someLabour Members, of whom Mr. Herbert Morrison had said that hewas speaking for the National Executive Committee of the LabourParty and the Trades Union Congress. The anxieties of the latterbody might be largely met if it were made clear, as was done in thedraft note annexed to C. (54) 210, that the proposed Committeewould not investigate &quot; matters (including wages questions) whichwere normally decided by collective bargaining arrangements.&quot; Hehad expressly kept open the possibility that the proposed committee might be a Joint Select Committee of the two Houses, but he had since been informed that the leaders of the three Parties in the Houseof Lords had agreed not to ask for a Joint Committee for thispurpose. He recommended that the proposed Committee should not now be set up until the next session and that at the outset it shouldbe established under an ad hoc motion rather than a standing order.He would, however, be glad to have authority to take a convenient opportunity of announcing the Governments intentions.The Lord President confirmed that the House of Lords did not wish to press for a Standing Joint Committee. It would, of course,be open to them to appoint an ad hoc Committee of their own toconsider the affairs of one or more of the nationalised industries, if at any time this should appear to them to be; desirable.The Minister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation expressed their support for the Lord Privy SeaFsproposals.It was suggested that, in the note annexed to C. (54) 210 on theproposed terms of reference, the phrase &quot; or matters (including wagesquestions) which are normally decided by collective bargainingimportance which he attached to bringing the scheme before Parlia-ment before the summer recess. It was now generally known thathe had completed his consultations, and he would be expected to publish the White Paper without delay. But, if the scheme was published now but not debated in Parliament until after the summer recess, he feared that the general support for it which now existedwould be dissipated.The Lord Privy Seal said that he recognised the political impor-tance of proceeding with this scheme as quickly as possible. ButGovernment business was now so congested that it was doubtfulwhether time could be found to debate this before the recess withoutasking the House to sit into August or deferring some government bill.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the draft White Paper annexed toC. (54) 211 on the Reorganisation of the Railways.(2) Agreed to resume at their next meeting their discussion ofthe timing of the presentation of this White Paper.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to circulate amemorandum describing the organisation and functionsof the Council which it was proposed to set up toco-ordinate publicly-owned transport in Scotland.
Broadcasting. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord the Fortnight Privy Seal (C. (54) 209) about the rule whereby the British Broad-Rule- casting Corporation (B.B.C.) were precluded from broadcastingdiscussions or ex parte statements on any issue during a period of a fortnight before it was debated in either House of Parliament. this rule also prevented the B.B.C. from inviting any Member of Parlia-ment to take part in any broadcast discussion on a matter which wasthe subject of current legislation.The Lord Privy Seal said that the B.B.C. had indicated that theywould be unable to continue to observe this rule except on the basisof a formal notice requiring them to do so, issued by the PostmasterGeneral under Clause 15 (4) of their licence. The Home AffairsCommittee had agreed that it was important to maintain the rule and had asked the Postmaster General to try to persuade theCorporation to accept in place of a formal notice a parliamentary statement about the rule, to be made by agreement with the LabourParty. The Postmaster General had accordingly discussed the matter with the Chairman of the Board of Governors and the Director-General of the B.B.C. but they had adhered to the view that a formalnotice must be issued to them if the rule was to continue. This wasnot in fact the kind of matter intended to be covered by Clause 15 (4)of the licence, but there seemed to be no alternative but to issue sucha notice if, as was to be expected, the Labour Opposition still con-sidered that the rule should be maintained and were prepared tosupport the issue of such a notice. A similar notice would doubtlesshave to be issued to the Television Authority in due course under clause 7 (2) of the Television Bill.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to ascertain whether theOpposition leaders would support the issue to the british broadcasting Corporation, under Clause 15 (4) of theirlicence, of a formal notice requiring them to continue to observe &quot; the fortnight rule &quot;; and authorised him, if that support was forthcoming, to arrange for the PostmasterGeneral to issue the proposed notice to the CorporationCabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th June, 1954.arrangements&quot; was not entirely appropriate. The Minister ofLabour was invited to recommend how this passage should bere-worded.The Cabinet Subject to any necessary re-wording of the comment on theterms of reference of the proposed Select Committee,approved the draft answer and note annexed to C. (54) 210and authorised the Lord Privy Seal to give the answer andpublish the note in the House of Commons at the earliestconvenient opportunity.
