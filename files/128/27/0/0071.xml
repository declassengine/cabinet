The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the powers of economic control conferred by defence Regulation 55 and associated Regulations shouldbe narrowed, not by legislation, but by an Order inCouncil on the lines proposed in C. (54) 311.(2) Invited the Ministerial Committee on Emergency legislation to consider in detail the terms of the proposed Order inCouncil.(3) Authorised the Home Secretary to include a reference to theproposed Order in the forthcoming White Paper onContinuance of Emergency Legislation and, subject to conclusion (2) above, to arrange for the Order to be made and presented to Parliament with a view to its cominginto operation on 1st January, 1955.East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C.(54)47thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by (i) thePresident of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of the Admiralty(C. (54) 324) and (ii) the Minister of Transport (C. (54) 325) on proposals put forward by the Consultative Group in Paris for changes in the present system of control over the delivery of ships to countries in the Soviet bloc.The President of the Board of Trade said that the existing system of control prohibited the sale of certain types of ships to countries in the Soviet bloc and required, for certain other types,prior consultation with the other members of the control system.The new proposals contemplated that supply of ships with a speedover 15^ knots would be banned for all member countries exceptDenmark, who would be granted a special exemption enabling her toLegislative 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordProgramme: Privy Seal (C. (54) 326) submitting a preliminary report by the1954-55 Committee which they had appointed on 20th October to examineSession. the proposals for legislation in the forthcoming session of Parliament.(Previous This report was concerned with the narrowing of the powers ofReference: economic control under Defence Regulation 55 and associatedC.C. (54) 68th Regulations, and recommended that this should be done, not by conclusions, legislation, but by an Order in Council designed to come intoMinute 5.)       operation on 1st January, 1955.Economic The Lord Privy Seal said that his Committee endorsed the viewControls. expressed by the former Home Secretary in C. (54) 311 that no attempt should be made to pass legislation for this purpose in theforthcoming session of Parliament. They recognised, however, thatGovernment supporters would be dissatisfied if no action were takento narrow the existing powers of economic control under the defence regulations and they therefore supported the recommendation thatthis should be done by Order in Council as proposed in C. (54) 311.The Cabinet were informed that the present Home Secretaryagreed with this recommendation.In discussion it was pointed out that by taking this course theGovernment would not escape political controversy. The making ofthe Order would focus attention on the uses currently made of these powers and would provide an opportunity for debating these inParliament. As against this it was argued that, as compared with legislation, action by Order would have the advantages that parliamentary discussion would be limited to a single day&apos;s debate and that the Order would not be open to amendment.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the balance ofadvantage lay in favour of the course proposed in C. (54) 311 and 326.
o ^scottish affairs.Report of theRoyalCommission.(previous reference:CC. (52) 64thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (54) 322) seeking approval for a Parliamentary statement of the government&apos;s decisions on the recommendations in the Report of theRoyal Commission on Scottish Affairs (Cmd. 9219).The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Governmentwould be well advised to announce at an early date their acceptanceof the Royal Commission^ Report and, in particular, of the irrecommendation that the Secretary of State for Scotland should nowassume:  (i) the responsibilities of the Minister of Transport for roads,piers and ferries in Scotland;(ii) the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor for the appointmentof Scottish Justices of the Peace; andsell about two such ships a year; and that for ships with a speed of under 15 knots there would be a global quota of 600,000 tons over three years and a national quota of 105,000 tons for each member country. It would be very difficult to justify this scheme toshipbuilding and shipping interests in the United Kingdom. he proposed that we should inform the United States Government thatwe were not prepared to accept a new agreement on these lines. TheCabinet might prefer that we should seek the support of the americans for an alternative scheme which would prohibit the saleof fast vessels, subject to the special exemption in favour of Denmark,but would allow other countries to compete freely for the delivery ofslow ships. The exemption in favour of Denmark would be open to objection by British shipbuilders, but in view of the undertakings which the Americans had already given to the Danes there seemed tobe no practical prospect of eliminating this feature from any futureagreement.The Minister of Defence supported the proposal outlined by thePresident of the Board of Trade. On strategic grounds the Chiefs ofStaff attached greater importance to the ban on the supply of fastships to the Soviet bloc than to any limitation of the number of slowships which might be supplied.The Foreign Secretary said that the Government were faced witha disagreeable choice. If the new scheme were accepted it would meet with widespread criticism from British shipbuilding and shippinginterests and would doubtless cause us to lose shipping orders fromRussia which we should otherwise have gained. On the other hand,rejection of the new scheme was likely to lead to differences of view with the United States Government and other members of the paris group. He agreed that we should try to persuade the United StatesGovernment to modify their present attitude. But we might be forced to consider the alternative course of accepting a new agreement on the lines which they proposed on an interim basis subject to review in a year&apos;s time.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a determined effort should be made to persuade the United States Government to accept alternative proposals for control over the supply of ships to countriesin the Soviet bloc on the lines proposed in paragraph 15of C. (54) 324.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of theAdmiralty to settle the terms of the representations to bemade for this purpose to the United States Government.
industrial disputes.Docks.(previous reference:C.C.(54)70thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Minister of Labour said that, in response to his request,representatives of the Stevedores Union and of the London port employers had met in his Department that day to discuss the interimreport of the Court of Enquiry. These discussions had resulted in a provisional agreement that the strikers would return to work on thefollowing Monday without reimposing their earlier ban on overtimework; that negotiations would at once be opened between employersand workers for revision of the overtime arrangements; and that,while these negotiations were proceeding, the employers would refrain from taking any disciplinary action under the Dock Labour Schemefor failure to work overtime. If the representatives of the StevedoresUnion persuaded their Executive Committee to accept this agreement,the strike would be at an end. If they declined to accept it, theemployers would presumably make known the terms of the offer which the Union had rejected, and would thereby weaken the men&apos;resolution to continue the strike. There was, therefore, a reasonable prospect that the strike would be brought to an end by the beginningof the following week.The Cabinet were informed that, even if the strike continued,there would be no need to use military labour in the docks for thepurpose of maintaining essential supplies before the middle of thefollowing week. In these circumstances they agreed that no steps should be taken to move troops for this purpose before the week-end.In discussion it was suggested that further publicity should begiven to the long-term consequences which the strike would have,both on food supplies and on industrial production and exports.Information on this should be given to the Press before the week-end;and a full statement might also be made in reply to a parliamentary question in the House of Commons on 1st November.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour, and agreed that no decision need yet be taken to use military labour in the docks for the maintenance of essential supplies.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for furtherpublicity to be given to the long-term economic consequences of the strike (i) in the Press and (ii) inParliament.(iii) the responsibilities of the Minister of Agriculture for animal health in Scotland, subject to the proviso that the minister would remain responsible for the control of epidemic diseases amonganimals throughout Great Britain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposals of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and The Minister ofTransport, The Lord Chancellor and The Minister of Agricultureexpressed their concurrence in the changes proposed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that effect should be given to the recommendations in the Report of the Royal Commission on Scottish affairs as summarised in paragraphs (i)-(iii) above.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would make an early statement on this subject in Parliament on the lines of thedraft annexed to C. (54) 322.
British Guiana.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Colonial Secretary said that he had received, and wouldpublish on 2nd November, the Report of the Commission of enquiry which had visited British Guiana after the suspension of theconstitution in December 1953. The Report, which was unanimous,fully endorsed the action taken in British Guiana by the UnitedKingdom Government and advised that the present interimconstitution should be maintained. He sought authority to announceforthwith the Governmenfs acceptance of the Commission^ Report.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce the government&apos;s acceptance of the Report of the Commissionof Enquiry.Canada.Hurricane inOntario.(previous reference:CC. (54) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that the cabinets decision not to offer assistance towards the relief of those who had suffered from the recent hurricane in Ontario had been taken in the belief that the Dutch Government were not proposing to offer such assistance. The Dutch Government had now announced that theyhad offered a sum of $50,000 for relief purposes, and the cabinet might therefore wish to reconsider their earlier decision. The damage caused by the hurricane had been localised and relatively small, andon financial grounds there was little reason for us to offer assistance.We should also be careful to avoid involving ourselves in anydisagreement between the Provincial and Federal Governments onthe question of responsibility for compensation and repair. In all thecircumstances he suggested that he should be authorised to discussthe matter with the Canadian High Commissioner in London and tooffer a sum of, say,  20,000 if he were satisfied that such an offer would be welcomed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that of late years therehad been an increasing tendency for the United Kingdom Governmentto offer assistance towards the relief of suffering from natural disastersin other countries, and he thought the time had come to check this tendency.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that the canadian government had contributed generously towards the relief of distressfrom the floods in this country and in Holland and Belgium in 1953,and the fact that the Dutch Government had already offeredassistance should make it possible to distinguish this case from others.It was also suggested that, if any offer of assistance were to be made,the sum should be substantially larger than that offered by theDutch: from this point of view  25,000 would be preferable to 20,000.The Cabinet-Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to discuss thismatter with the Canadian High Commissioner in Londonand to make an offer of  25,000 on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government if he were satisfied that such an offer would be welcomed.Persia.(previous reference:CC. (54) 56thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that the Persian Senate hadratified, by a substantial majority, the agreement for the settlementof the Persian oil dispute. It was expected that the Shah would sign the agreement on the following day.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
