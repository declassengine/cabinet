5? S-Industrial 1.   The Minister of Transport said that, when he received the disputes. representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) laterRailways. in the dav, his primary object would be to persuade them to resume(Previous the wage negotiations with the British Transport Commission which reference: they had broken off. He had therefore had a confidential talk with c.C. (54) 84th the Chairman of the Commission with a view to ascertaining whether,Conclusions, if the negotiations were resumed, he would feel able to improve on minute 7.) the offers so far made to the men. He had ascertained that theChairman would not in fact feel able to do more than offer a fewsmall adjustments, which would not suffice to satisfy the men&apos;demands. The Chairman had given five reasons against making anysubstantial concession first, the financial position of the railways;secondly, the repercussions of such a concession on the other activitiesof the Transport Commission; thirdly, the likely repercussions inother industries; fourthly, his conviction, based on experience sincethe last award, that such a concession would not secure any respitefrom further claims; and fifthly, his belief that the N.U.R. wouldnot accept a settlement on any other basis than their original claim for a 15 per cent, increase in wages. In reply to a question by theMinister the Chairman had indicated that, although the otherarguments weighed heavily with him, he would have been prepared,if the railways had not already been operating at a loss, to make an offer which, though short of the full 15 per cent., would be a substan-tial compromise. The Minister had then asked him whether he wouldbe ready to make such an offer if the Government assured him thatthe Commission need not be unduly concerned about the size of the deficit on their current operations in view of the long-term prospectsto which they could look forward when their plans for modernisingthe railways came into effect. The Chairman had said that, if theGovernment were ready to make a public statement to that effect,he would be disposed to accept a larger deficit on current operations.Such a statement would mean that the Government shared with him the responsibility for the settlement reached on the wages claim. Ifsuch a statement were publicly made, he would not think it necessaryto ask that the Minister should give him a formal direction underthe Transport Act, 1947, relieving him of his statutory obligationto ensure that the railways paid their way &quot; taking one year with another.&quot;The Minister of Labour said that there had been two significantchanges in the situation since the Cabinet last discussed it on 8th December. First, it was now known that the Chairman of theTransport Commission would not feel justified in offering anysubstantial increase in wages; and the arguments which he had advanced in support of this attitude were strong. Special weight should be given to his judgment of the effect of such a concession on wage claims in other industries, and to his belief that a concession would not secure a respite from further claims by the railwaymen.Secondly, it now seemed unlikely that the N.U.R. would resort to strike action before Christmas. In these circumstances the minister suggested that, when the Minister of Transport received the repre-sentatives of the N.U.R. later in the day, he should urge them to resume their negotiations with the Transport Commission, making itclear that they had not yet exhausted the possibilities of improving their wages by negotiation or arbitration; that he should promise toconsider carefully their claim that the Transport Commission shouldbe put in a financial position in which it could pay better wages;but that he should make it plain that there could be no question ofa Government subsidy to the railways.In discussion there was general agreement that in his interview with representatives of the N.U.R. the Minister of Transport should follow the line suggested by the Minister of Labour.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider what policy they should follow if the negotiations were not resumed or if they failed to resultin any settlement.
The view was expressed that the Transport Commission wouldbe justified in accepting for a time a larger deficit on their currentoperations, if they were satisfied that an increase in the general levelof railway wages would promote a better spirit and greater efficiency in their labour force. It was at least doubtful whether, in law, theGovernment would be justified in giving the Commission a formaldirection designed to relieve them of their statutory obligation tomake the railways pay &quot; taking one year with another.&quot; It was now known, however, that the Chairman would not ask for such a formaldirection if the Government made it plain, in a public statement,that they considered the Commission to be justified in increasing the deficit on their current operations. The form of that statement would need careful thought. It must not create the impression that a concession on wages was being made solely to avert a strike. Normust it be such as to encourage the workers in other nationalised industries and services to suppose that claims for increased wagescould be met by Government subsidy, in one form or another. Itmust make a convincing case for according special treatment to therailways. The argument that the Transport Commission would bejustified in taking a long-term view of their statutory obligation tomake the railways pay might perhaps be supported by reference to three considerations first, that their new charges scheme would shortly come into operation; secondly, that the Government wereprepared to give favourable consideration to their comprehensive plan for modernising the railways; and thirdly, that the railwaymenhad given assurances that they would co-operate more effectively in securing the efficient deployment of the labour force. The last point was of special importance. The Commission^ efforts toimprove the efficiency of the railways were greatly handicapped bythe men&apos;s unwillingness to accept measures designed to reduceredundancy and restrictive practices. A satisfactory agreement onthis point would be an essential element in a comprehensive settlement.Attention was drawn to the grave political and economic consequences of a railway strike. Even a strike of short durationwould cost the country more than would be involved in meetingthe current wages claim. Though the N.U.R. itself might be reluctant-tant to call a nation-wide strike, it might well yield to pressure from some of its local branches which were more inclined to extrememeasures. Indeed, some of these branches might even favour strike action before Christmas.On the other hand, the Governmenfs political credit wouldcertainly be damaged if they appeared to be encouraging theTransport Commission to make a concession to the railwaymen inorder to avert a strike. Some Government supporters would regard this as a sign of weakness. They would recall that the Governmenthad intervened in similar circumstances a year before, in order to avert a railway strike at Christmas-time; and they would ask what had come of the promises then given by the men to co-operate in measures for increasing labour efficiency on the railways. On this the record was not reassuring. There seemed no doubt that, sooner or later, the Government would have to withstand the pressure towhich they were subjected for wage increases in nationalised industries and services.As against this, it was argued that the Government should choosetheir own time for making such a stand. If a railway strike was inevitable, it would be easier to deal with it in the summer than inthe winter. And it would be better to choose an occasion on whichthe issue would be clear to public opinion. At the moment there wasa general impression that the wages of railwaymen in the lowergrades compared unfavourably with the current level of wagesgenerally. It might also be easier to present the case for treatingthe railways exceptionally when the plans for modernisation hadbeen put forward. Those plans might perhaps justify a decision to write off, or to fund, the accumulated deficit, so that the railways
Housing Policy.       2.   The Minister of Housing recalled that, at the Cabinefs(Previous       meeting on 29th November, he had agreed to adopt, as a target for reference:      his own guidance in determining the allocations to be made to localGC (54) 80th   authorities for subsidised house  building,  a total  of  140,000Conclusions,    authorisations in 1955 as against the present level of about 180,000.Minute 3.)       He was now confronted with a number of Parliamentary questions on this subject and with newspaper criticism of an alleged Govern-ment intention to reduce the volume of house-building by localauthorities. The Minister handed round the draft of the reply whichhe proposed to give to Questions to be addressed to him on thefollowing day, and explained that the figures which it containedwould be adjusted to cover the position in Scotland as well as inEngland and Wales. The Minister said that he was not seeking to be released from his previous undertaking in this matter, but the cabinet must realise the difficult position in which he would find himself ifhe were asked directly in Parliament whether it was the Government&apos;intention to reduce the amount of house-building by local authorities.As such a question could not be answered clearly in the negative,the Government might thereafter find themselves embarrassed intheir handling of housing policy.The Economic Secretary to the Treasury said that, on thestrength of the Minister^ undertaking to reduce the number ofauthorisations for the building of subsidised houses, the Chancellorof the Exchequer had agreed to the announcement of plans for additional expenditure on other forms of civil investment. TheChancellor would, therefore, find it extremely difficult to contemplate any modification of the figure for authorisations which the cabinet had approved as the target for 1955.In discussion it was suggested that the Government should beable to avoid indicating for some time yet the number of subsidisedhouses which, according to present plans, would be likely to becompleted in 1956. It could be emphasised that the issue of authorisation-tions was a continuing process and that it was not customary to publish allocations or forecasts of completions in respect of future years. At the same time it could be said that it was the Government&apos;intention to enable roughly as many houses to let to be completed in 1955 as were expected to be completed during the present yearand that, whatever the number completed in 1956 might eventuallyprove to be, it would be likely to compare favourably with themaximum number of such houses completed in any one year whilethe Labour Government were in office. The figure for completions in respect of the last year of the Labour Government might with advantage be quoted for purposes of comparison.could make a fresh start. They might also justify a firm demand forthe men&apos;s co-operation in a more efficient redeployment of thelabour force.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport, in his forthcoming inter-view with representatives of the National Union of railwaymen, to follow the line which had been suggestedby the Minister of Labour at the outset of the cabinets discussion.(2) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of theline to be taken by the Government if the National Unionof Railwaymen declined either to resume negotiationsor to go to arbitration on their wages claim.
The Cabinet Approved the terms of the answer which the Minister of housing proposed to give to Parliamentary Questions onthis subject on the following day, and invited him to dealwith supplementary Questions on the general lines suggestedin the discussion.Cabient Office, S.W.1,13th December, 1954.
