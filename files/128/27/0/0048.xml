3 CC. 48(S4i. 1, The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (54) 224) and the Minister of State (C. (54) 219) aboutthe threat to the security of the Aden Protectorate from raiders fromadjoining Yemeni territory;The Colonial Secretary, said that; despite the specious terms ofthe communication from the Government of the Yemen, set out inthe annex to his memorandum, and the unlikelihood that furtherexchanges would yield any positive result, the note which was in course of being despatched to the Yemeni Minister in London would accept the suggestion that the frontier authorities on both sides should at once consult together. He wished, however, to have the Cabinefsauthority to instruct the Governor of Aden that if raids shouldcontinue after the proposed protest had been made and the talks between the frontier authorities, had been initiated, and if he was satisfied that further talks would be ineffective in stopping them, he might seek authority for air action against military targets to be specified by- him at the- time. Such action would take the form, ofprecision attack with rockets against specified targets, after warninggiven to the inhabitants twenty-four hours, and again two hours, inadvance. Before empowering the Governor to authorise such action,he would obtain the Foreign Secretary^ agreement to this course.He also proposed to take steps to strengthen the Aden Protectoratelevies, although this could have no effect on the immediate situation.The Minister of Defence said that he had carefully consideredthe Prime Ministers suggestion that order should be restored byground troops rather than air forces. The move of the necessaryground force from the Canal Zone would be an expensive and lengthybusiness, whereas air action from Aden could be arranged at short notice, concentrated without difficulty at the point where trouble had arisen, and repeated as often as might be necessary.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff supported the view that air action would be more effective and more economical.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like rather more timein which to weigh the international complications which were likelyto arise if air action were taken against targets in Yemeni territory.. There could be no certainty that such action would be supported bya majority of Member States in the United Nations, and the despatchof a United Nations Commission of Enquiry to the frontier of the aden Protectorate might cause us much embarrassment.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the position, and theaction which we proposed to take to meet it, ought to be carefullyexplained to other Commonwealth Governments. The attitude of the asian Dominions would almost certainly be hostile, and even theNew Zealand Government might feel compelled to abstain in any vote on this issue at the United Nations.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would give furtherconsideration to the possible international repercussions of air action from Aden against targets in Yemeniterritory.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, authorised the colonial secretary, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, to;.; t. send instructions to the Governor of Aden on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 224.&apos;j 1 7.&apos;.. .,        (3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider how other commonwealth   Governments   could  best   be   kept informed of developments in this matter.Visa:ot;^iajor The Colonial Secretary said that Major Salah Salem, the;sasah sajem. Egyptian Minister of National Guidance;, was due to arrive in the&apos;rj/;;v;.fi&apos; ..;.,ri .., capital of the Yemen oh 10th July and had expressed a desire to traveli&amp;&apos;-r*7(rfi nv&apos;;&apos;; through the Aden Protectorate on his return journey to Egypt.

Atomic Energy.WeaponsProgramme.(previous reference:C.C.(54)47thConclusions.Minute 5.)was most undesirable that he should visit the Protectorate at this time, arid the Governor of Aden had sought authority to excludehim from it. If such action were considered to be too provocative,arrangements might be made for Major Salah Salem to-be met at thefrontier and escorted frorri there to Aden either by aircraft or bymotor transport.      :The Cabinet agreed that steps should be taken to exclude MajorSalah Salem from the Aden Protectorate, but that arrangements should also be made to escort him from the frontier to Aden in theevent of his attempting to enter the Protectorate.The Cabinet (4) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to take the necessary steps to ensure that Major Salah Salem was not at liberty to travel unescorted through the Aden Protectorate&apos; on his return journey from the Yemen to Egypt.2. The Cabinet resumed their&apos; discussion of the. questionwhether our atomic weapons programme should be so adjusted as toallow for the production of thermo-nuclear bombs in this country.The following were the main points raised in the discussion:  (a) What additional financial commitment would be involved?The Cabinet were informed that the net additional cost of adjusting the programme so as to allow for the production ofthermo-nuclear bombs would not be very substantial. The capital cost should not exceed  10 millions, and the thermo-nuclear bombswould be made in lieu of atomic bombs at a relatively smalladditional production cost. Much of the material needed for theproduction of the new type of bomb would have been required forthe production of atomic bombs, and there would be a substantialdegree of flexibility in the programme, since atomic bombs could be converted into thermo-nuclear bombs. In terms of explosive power the thermo-nuclear bomb would be more economical than the atomic bomb.(b) Might we not wish to prevent the manufacture of thermo-nuclear bombs in Western Europe, particularly in Germany?Would it be easier for us to prevent this if we ourselves refrained fromproducing these weapons? Some of our other defence preparations were already based on the assumption that we should not engage in major war except as an ally of the United States: could we not continue to rely on the United States to match Russia in thermo-nuclear weapons?In reply it was pointed out that the strength of these argumentswas weakened by the fact that we had already embarked on theproduction of atomic weapons. There was no sharp distinction in kind between atomic and thermo-nuclear weapons; and, as we were already engaged in the manufacture of this kind of weapon, it was unreasonable that we should deny ourselves the advantage ofpossessing the most up-to-date types. The Foreign Secretary saidthat our power to control the production of thermo-nuclear weapons in Western Europe would not in his view be weakened by the factthat we ourselves were making these weapons.(c) Was it morally right that we should manufacture weaponswith this vast destructive power? There was no doubt that a decisionto make hydrogen bombs would offend the conscience of substantial numbers of people in this country. Evidence of this was to be foundin the resolutions: recently passed by the Methodist Conference inLondon.In reply the point was again made that there was no difference in kind between atomic and thermo-nuclear weapons; and that, in sofar as any moral principle was involved, it had already been breachedby the decision of the Labour Government to make the atomic bomb.It was also argued that the moral issue would arise, not so much on

Molotov the personal and private message embodied in Foreign Office telegram.to Moscow No. 873.    It had been hispractice as Prime Minister, both during the war and since thepresent Government took office, to exchange personal messageswith Heads of Governments and more particularly with thePresident of the United States. &apos;   Most of these messages had been seen before despatch by the Foreign Secretary, who could alwayssuggest that reference should be made to the Cabinet if he thought this necessary.    The Prime Minister hoped that he would continueto onjoy tha confidence) of hln colloeigufts in continuing u nvaalsiaawhich,, in his opinion, had proved beneficial in the conduct ofpublic affairs.1
THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he was glad that this opportunity had been given to discuss the constitutional aspe cts&apos;of this matter.    He did not contest the right of a Prime Ministerto determine policy.    But, if a Prime Minister took a&apos; decision ofpolicy which involved the collective responsibility of the wholeGovernment without prior consultation With his Cabinet colleagues,any.of his colleagues who dissented from the decision mightthereby be forced to the remedy of resignation.    The message which the Prime Minister had sentto M, Molotov, though framed as a personal enquiry, was in his opinion an important act offoreign policy;  and it would have been preferable that the cabinet should have been given an opportunity to express their views on it before it was sent.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he also regarded this as an important act of policy, on which the Cabinet should have vbeen consulted.     For, although it was presented as a personalenquiry, it was bound to commit the Government to some extentto the view that this was an opportune moment for a meeting ofthe kind suggested&apos;.     For his part, if his view had been sought,he would have been inclined to advise against making such an approach at the present time.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that a distinction couldbe drawn between an informal enquiry and a formal proposal fora meeting.    The latter could clearly not have been made&apos;withoutthe approval of the Cabinet,    But he had not thought that theCabinet would be in any way committed by a personal and preliminary enquiry; and he had understood that the foreign secretary, whom he had consulted, was of the same opinion.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY recalled that a draft of the message had been sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, andit had been in his mind at the time that the ChanceLLor would bring it to the notice of his Cabinet colleagues.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thedraft had reached him during the afternoon of  Saturday, 3rd July,when he was in Norfolk.   &apos; The telegram embodying i-t had bewnaddressed to him personally, and copies had at that stage b^en sheonly to senior officials in the Foreign Office and to the PrimeMinister&apos;s Private Secretaries at 10 Downing Street.    Therewas nothing in the telegram to suggest that the views of theCabinet were being invited.    Indeed, before he had been able to despatch his own comments, which he had formulated after discussion with senior Foreign Office officials, a further telegram had been received from the Prime Minister enquiringwhether the message had been transmitted to Moscow.    This had confirmed his view that he had not been expected to invite theviews of other Cabinet colleagues - and it would in any eventhave been very difficult for him to do so when Ministers were dispersed at.the week-end.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the message had been dispatched to Moscow on 4th July.    The Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary had arrived in London on 6th July and could then have held full consultation with their Cabinet colleagues.Was the message so urgent that its despatch could not havebeen delayed for three days?
THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in his anxiety to loseno opportunity of furthering the cause of world peace, he mighthave taken an exaggerated view of the urgency of the matter.There had seemed no reason to delay what he regarded as a personal and informal enquiry which could not commit hiscolleagues.THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in his view the constitutional position was clea(r.    A Prime minister was certainly free to conduct unofficial personal correspondence with Heads of other Governments,    But, equally, in suchcorrespondence a Prime Minister would take care to avoid committing the Cabinet to any act of policy without their prior approval,     The practical question was whether any particularmessage; sent in the course of such personal correspondence,had the effect of committing the Cabinet.    Though it was clearthat this had not been intended on the present occasioii, had itproduced this effect?THE LORD PRESIDENT said that in his opinion the&apos;Cabinefs freedom of action had to some extent been limited bythe message which the Prime Minister had sent.    When theCabinet came to take a decision on the substance of the issue,they might wish to decide that it would be preferable not to go forward with this project for a meeting with M. Malenkov.     But,if they so decided, and if the Russians then chose to givepublicity to the messages exchanged between the Prime Ministerand M, Molotovj the public would be left with the impression thatthe Prime Minister had wished to arrange such a meeting but.had been deterred from doing so by his Cabinet colleagues.That consideration might now influence the Cabinefs eventualdecision. &apos;   .     &apos;THE COLONIAL SECRETARY said that the constitutional position was as stated by the Commonwealth Secretary,    Thepractical question was whether the collective responsibility of theCabinet had in any way been involved by the informal approach which the Prime Minister had made to M, Molotov;     For himselfhe did not think it could be denied that it was now more difficult for the Cabinet to decide that this was not an appropriate moment for a bilateral meeting of the kind suggested in that message.Nevertheless, he thought it was still open to the Cabinet todecide not to proceed further with this project.. ..THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with this view.    Itmight well be that, when President Eisenhower had replied tohis further message, he would be convinced that it would be preferable not to proceed further with this project.    In that event he would not feel obliged to give M. Molotov any detailed .reasons for his decision.    It would suffice to thank him again for his cordial message and to say that we did not think it
practicable to proceed further with this project at the presenttime.     This, however, must be left for consideration in thelight of a further expression of the Presidents views.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of thisquestion when President Eisenhower had replied to the further message which thePrime Minister now proposed to send him.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.10th July, 1954.
washington talks.Anglo-SovietMeeting.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 47thConclusions,Minute 4.)Parliament.3. The Cabinet continued their discussion of the possibility ofan Anglo-Soviet Meeting.The Cabinefs discussion on this question is recorded separately.4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Opposition had expressed the wish that foreign affairs shouldbe debated, in Committee of Supply, on 14th July. It was now clear,however, that the Foreign Secretary would be obliged to return before then to the Geneva Conference. When they knew this the opposition might suggest another subject for debate on that day. If, however,they still wished to hold a Foreign Affairs debate related mainly tothe recent meeting in Washington, it might be convenient that thePrime Ministers statement on the Washington talks should be madethe production of these weapons, but on the decision to use them;and that the resolution of the Methodist Conference was directedmainly against the use of atomic weapons. The further point wasmade that, if we were ready to accept the protection offered by united States use of thermo-nuclear weapons, no greater moralwrong was involved in making them ourselves.(d) No country could claim to be a leading military Power unless it possessed the most up-to-date weapons; and the fact must be faced that, unless we possessed thermo-nuclear weapons, we should lose our influence and standing in world affairs. Strength in thermo-nuclear weapons would henceforward provide the most powerfuldeterrent to a potential aggressor; and it was our duty to make our contribution towards the building up of this deterrent influence.It was at least possible that the development of the hydrogen bombwould have the effect of reducing the risk of major war. At presentsome people thought that the greatest risk was that the United states might plunge the world into war, either through a misjudgedintervention in Asia or in order to forestall an attack by Russia.Our best chance of preventing this was to maintain our influence withthe United States Government; and they would certainly feel morerespect for our views if we continued to play an effective part in building up the strength necessary to deter aggression than if we leftit entirely to them to match and counter Russia&apos;s strength in thermo-nuclear weapons.(e) Doubt was expressed about the feasibility of keeping secret,for any length of time, a decision to manufacture thermo-nuclear weapons in this country. It was therefore suggested that thought should be given to the question how a decision to manufacture these weapons could best be justified to public opinion in this country andabroad.It emerged from the discussion that there was general support in the Cabinet for the proposal that thermo-nuclear bombs should be manufactured in this country. Some Ministers asked, however, thatthere should be a further opportunity for reflection before a finaldecision was taken. Meanwhile, it was agreed that there should beno interruption of the preliminary planning which had already beenput in hand.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at afurther meeting before the end of July.
reorganisation of theRailways.(previous reference:CC. (54) 45thConclusions,Minute 4.)Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:CC. (54) 47thConclusions,Minute 1.)Coal Imports.(previous reference:CC (53) 63rdConclusions,Minute 7.)in a speech opening that debate instead of after Questions on12th July.The Cabinet agreed that the proposed debate on the report ofthe Crichel Down Inquiry should be held in the week beginning19th July.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in his statement on business that day, he would say that the Government hoped to obtain the SecondReading of the Food and Drugs Bill before the House rose for the summer recess.5. The Lord Privy Seal said that it was now quite clear thatno Government time could be made available before the summer recess for Parliamentary proceedings on the Governmenfs proposalsfor the reorganisation of the railways. It did not follow, however,that publication of the proposed White Paper on this subject need be deferred on this account. If, after the White Paper had been published, the Labour Opposition should wish to have it discussedbefore the recess, it could be indicated to them that the only meansof arranging this would be by their making available one of theirremaining Supply Days for this purpose.The Minister of Transport said that the Railways ReorganisationScheme represented an important result of the Transport Act of 1953and he would deplore further delay in its publication, even though some time might elapse before the necessary steps could be taken tosecure its approval by Parliament.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport to publish withoutfurther delay the draft White Paper on the &quot; RailwaysReorganisation Scheme &quot; annexed to C. (54) 211.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the opposition had now indicated that they would accept, with great disappointment,the Governmenfs modified scheme of subsistence allowances for members of the House of Commons. It was desirable that an early announcement should be made, and this might be on the lines of thedraft statement which he had put before the Cabinet at their last meeting. One or two minor amendments would be incorporated inthis; but the only point of substance for consideration was whether,as the Opposition desired, entitlement to the proposed new allowance should be made retrospective to 24th May, when the House ofCommons had voted in favour of an improvement in Members&apos;emoluments. No further resolution of the House would be required,but a Supplementary Estimate would be necessary in due course.The Chief Whip said that Government supporters would notwelcome the suggestion that the new allowances should haveretrospective effect. It was also suggested that it would be inappropriate to authorise payment of the allowances from the date when the House had recorded a view on the matter which theGovernment had decided to disregard. It would be preferable that payment of the new allowances should take effect from a date notearlier than the end of the Whitsun recess.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would announce in theHouse of Commons that afternoon particulars of the modified scheme of subsistence allowances for Members onwhich agreement had now been reached with the Opposition.. 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (C. (54) 218) on the need for additionalcoal imports.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that there were grounds for serious concern oVer the adequacy of coal supplies for the coming winter.   By arrangement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer he
had already authorised the National Coal Board to contract for theimport of half a million tons of coal, but a great deal more was required. He therefore proposed that the Board should now be instructed to raise the rate of imports to the maximum possible,namely, a quarter of a million tons a month, and that the situation should be reviewed when the Board had concluded contracts for, say,another one million tons, which would involve a total import of1J million tons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that in the presentsituation further imports of coal were unavoidable, but he wished to record his view that this situation was profoundly unsatisfactory.He hoped that the imports would include United States coal boughtfor sterling from continental countries.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange for additional coal imports on the basis proposed in paragraph of C. (54)218. &apos;     &quot;Cabinet Office, S.W. 18th July, 1954.
