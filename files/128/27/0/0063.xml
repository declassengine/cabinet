(54) 28thConclusions,Minute 7.)Egypf.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 55thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to record their satisfaction that the Nine-Power Conference had reached sosuccessful a conclusion and to convey to the Foreign Secretary their appreciation on the distinguished part which he had played in bringing this about. The influence of the United Kingdom in inter-national affairs had been greatly strengthened by the settlement whichhad been reached, and would be still further enhanced by theagreement on Trieste which was due to be signed in london that day.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that, during his recent visits to countries in the middle and Far East, he had been impressed by the widespread evidence ofthe prestige enjoyed by the United Kingdom. The criticism of theWest which was voiced in Eastern countries was more often directed at the United States than at this country.In discussion it was suggested that the British press were notshowing enough recognition of the success with which the UnitedKingdom Government had assumed the lead in international affairs.The recent visit of leading members of the Opposition to Russia andthe Far East had been reported with more attention than the solidprogress of the Government in resolving intractable internationalproblems. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in theabsence of the Commonwealth Secretary, he had it in mind to discuss with some of his colleagues what measures could be taken to further the presentation of the Governments achievements. A meeting between Ministers and the Lobby Correspondents might be arranged for this purpose.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that substantial progress had been made in thenegotiations which Mr. Nutting was conducting with the egyptian government in Cairo. The Egyptians were, however, still reluctant to accept the inclusion in the Agreement of a clause prescribing thatthe Agreement, after it was signed, would be subject to ratification by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. They were concerned lest a provision to this effect would result in delaying final confirmation of theAgreement and so afford an opportunity for discontented elements in Egypt to undermine the position of the Egyptian Government byprovoking incidents, which in turn might induce the United kingdom parliament to oppose ratification. Mr. Nutting had accordinglysought authority to give the Egyptian Government an assurance thatarrangements would be made to afford Parliament an opportunityof debating the new Agreement before the end of October. TheCabinet would recall that Lord Reading had given an undertaking in the House of Lords on 15th December, 1953, that provision wouldbe made in the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement for its ratification andthat, before ratification took place, full opportunity would be affordedfor debate in Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the Governments obligationto provide facilities for a debate might be held to have been honouredalready by the debate which had taken place on the Heads ofAgreement. He doubted whether the Government need take theinitiative in arranging a further debate in Parliament beforeratification, though a debate would have to be arranged if there were a demand for it in Parliament.The Prime Minister said that it was important that the new treaty with Egypt should, in accordance with normal custom, include a ratification clause. If a debate should prove to be necessary andhe expected that it would be arrangements could no doubt be made without undue difficulty. If necessary, an indication could be givento the Egyptian Government that Her Majesty&apos;s Government47022-2 B 2
expected that ratification would have been effected by the end ofNovember and possibly by the end of October.The Cabinet Invited the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to arrange for guidance to be sent toMr. Nutting in Cairo accordingly.Economic 2.   The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to joinPolicy. with him in welcoming the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his visit of the return from the United States, where his discussions had been veryChancellor of   beneficial to our interests.*^X(?hequer The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the convertibility ofto Washington, sterling  would  undoubtedly  continue  to be  the  major  issue(Previous        of economic policy.   First reactions among the Finance MinistersReference:      assembled in Washington to our evident unwillingness to make anyCC. (54) 59th   early move towards convertibility had been unfavourable, especiallyConclusions,    in the case of hard currency countries, and the effect on sterling had minute 10.)      been depressing.   Sterling had now, however, fully recovered andthere was general recognition, except perhaps on the part of theCanadian Government, whose motives were not unmixed, that our attitude could be justified on sound economic grounds and couldnot fairly  be  attributed  to  domestic  political  considerations.Although we were bound to be subjected in future to renewedpressure to make sterling convertible, there seemed to be a fairprospect that we should be able to hold the position at least for afurther period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his discussions with united States representatives had revealed an unresolved difference of view within the United States Administration between those whobelieved in protection and those who favoured more liberal tradepolicies. There seemed to be some prospect of further limited moveson the part of the United States Government towards the freeing oftrade, but these might well fail to materialise if, as seemed possible,small pockets of unemployment should develop in the United Stateseconomy. The Republican Administration considered, not withoutjustification, that their policies had so far sheltered this country fromany untoward effects of a decline in business activity in the UnitedStates, and it behoved us to accord some public recognition ofthis fact.The Chancellor said that it was clear from his discussions in washington with other Commonwealth Finance Ministers that theforthcoming negotiations about a review of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) would raise issues of great complexityand delicacy. Among other Commonwealth countries generallythere was little disposition to challenge the principle at presentembodied in the G.A.T.T. that there should be no increase in tradepreferences. There was at the same time a general acceptance of theneed for maintaining a system of trade rules without which therewas likely to be widespread reversion to restrictionist policies which,on balance, would not work to our advantage. On the other hand,a number of Government supporters were undoubtedly sincere intheir belief that the present provisions of the G.A.T.T. and itsrestraints upon Imperial Preference operated to our disadvantage.He had discussed the matter fully with the President of the Board ofTrade and they had agreed that it should be the Governmenfs aim,so far as possible, to steer a middle course. In principle, a system oftrade rules must clearly be preserved, but means should be soughtof adjusting these rules to meet our special needs in particular cases.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been deeplyimpressed by the evidence which had come to his notice during thecourse of his visit to North America of the magnitude and pace of

This fortified his confidence in the longer-term prospects of sterling.The Cabinet Took note with approval of these statements by theChancellor of the Exchequer.European Coal 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theand steel Minister of Supply (C. (54) 305) reporting the outcome of his informalCommunity. discussions with M. Monnet, the President of the High Authority(Previous of the European Coal and Steel Community, about the united reference:      Kingdom&apos;s association with the Community.CC. (54) 39th The Minister of Supply said that M. Monnet had agreed conclusions, that their discussions should proceed without committing eitherMinute 7.) Government in the formal negotiations which would take place ata later stage. Not without difficulty he had been able to persuadeM. Monnet that the Council of Association, which was to be set upjointly by the United Kingdom and the Community, should have no executive functions or supranational characteristics but should besolely consultative. He had also persuaded M. Monnet to abandonhis insistence on a reduction of the present British steel tariff as a pre- -requisite of any closer United Kingdom association with theCommunity. The terms of the draft Agreement which had emerged from these preliminary negotiations were set out in the right-handcolumn in Annex B to C. (54) 305. Subject to certain points of detail, they had been approved by the Committee of Ministers underthe chairmanship of the Commonwealth Secretary, and he nowsought the authority of the Cabinet to inform M. Monnet that theywere acceptable to Her Majesty&apos;s Government as a basis for theestablishment of the proposed closer association. He also sought theapproval of the Cabinet to the eventual issue of a joint communiqueon the lines proposed in Annex A to C. (54) 305.There was general support in the Cabinet for the view that thedraft documents to which the Minister of Supply had obtainedM. monnet  agreement represented as satisfactory an outcome tohis discussions as could have been hoped for.The Cabinet (1) Subject to any further detailed amendments which might be approved by the Ministerial Committee, approved thedraft communique and the draft Agreement contained in annexes A and B of C. (54) 305.(2) Authorised the Minister of Supply to make arrangementsfor a formal meeting in London with representatives ofthe High Authority of the European Coal and steel community to complete arrangements for closer association of the United Kingdom with the community on the lines proposed.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Supply, to inform other commonwealth governments of the progress of the negotiations.ParliamentDates ofProrogationand Opening(previous reference:CC. (54) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that Parliament would reassembleon 19th October, and it was proposed that it should be proroguedon 26th November. He recognised that the volume of legislativebusiness in the House of Lords would be considerable, but this stateof affairs would be not unusual and he was reasonably confident thatthe date he had suggested for prorogation could be adhered to. no announcement need yet be made, however, of the dates on whichthe present Session would be prorogued and the new Session opened,but it would be opportune to seek The Queen&apos;s pleasure on theproposal that the new Session should be opened on 30th November.
The Lord President said that he hoped it would be found possibleto arrange for some Government amendments to legislation due tobe considered during the remainder of the Session to be introduced in the House of Lords. Although more Parliamentary time might then be required for discussion of such amendments in the Houseof Commons, this risk ought, in his view, to be accepted, for thereasons which he had set out in C. (54) 204.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would seek The Queen&apos;pleasure on the proposal that the new Session of parliament should be opened on 30th November, 1954.industrial disputes.Docks.(previous reference:CC. (54) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Minister of Labour said that the factors underlying thestrike action which had been taken in certain docks were complex,and the elements responsible for the unrest among dockers wereseizing every opportunity to spread the strikes and confuse the issues.The dispute affecting ship-repairing workers had originated inthe decision of the Electrical Trades Union to strike on the groundthat five of their members had been discharged as redundant in a manner which contravened the principle &quot; last in, first out,&quot; whichthe Union supported. The employers were willing to discussredundancy with the appropriate Union before dismissing men, butclaimed the ultimate right to determine which men to retain ordischarge. In consequence of the strike by members of the electrical trades Union, members of other Unions employed on certain ships were unable to work. Some members of yet other Unions, notably the Amalgamated Engineering Union, had struck in sympathy. Thedispute would be considered by the Federation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions at a meeting in York on 7th October. Theattitude which the Federation would adopt could not be foreseen,and until it was known he was satisfied that it would not be appropriate for him to intervene.The strike by the Stevedores Union in the London docksconcerned the additional remuneration to be paid to their membersnow that the sorting of meat had had to be reintroduced followingde-control. The Transport and General Workers Union hadnegotiated an agreement on this matter with the port employers,and the additional sum so agreed was being paid to their members and also to the members of the Stevedores Union concerned. Butthe Stevedores Union had resorted to strike action because theemployers had not negotiated with them on the matter. Anotherfactor in the dispute was the ban which the Stevedores Union hadimposed since January on overtime working at the London docks onthe ground that overtime should be acknowledged to be voluntary.There had been no practical difficulty in arranging overtime and neither the employers nor the Transport and General Workers Unionagreed with the views of the Stevedores Union on this point. Theemployers declined to negotiate with the Stevedores Union while theban on overtime remained in force; on the other hand, the transport and General Workers Union would not sit with the Stevedores union on the negotiating body. The employers had, nevertheless, offered to discuss payment for meat sorting with the Stevedores Union if their men returned to work. The Union for their part had refusedunless the employers would discuss with them all outstanding issues. This was not acceptable to the employers or to the transport and General Workers Union, both of whom considered that theyshould stand firm and that any intervention by the Ministry ofLabour would serve only to prolong their differences with theStevedores Union.   The membership of the Stevedores Union was
about 7,000 dockers, mostly in London, whereas the Transport andGeneral Workers Union had about 70,000 docker members spreadover all the docks. There was little doubt that some members ofthe larger Union were dissatisfied with their Union representationand considerable numbers were going over to the Stevedores Union.The Trades Union Congress were seeking to resolve the consequentdispute between the two Unions. Before a settlement was reached,strike action might well spread further in the London Docks and extend to other docks. At a later stage it might become appropriate to set up a Court of Enquiry with wide terms of reference to examinethe working of the dock labour scheme; but in present conditionshe was convinced that it would be premature to take any initiative.The Minister of Food said that incoming cargoes of meat andother food which could not be unloaded on account of the strikewere being stored satisfactorily aboard ship; and the absence of these supplies from the home market would have no serious effect for sometime.The Home Secretary said that he had satisfied himself that therewas no immediate need to use military labour, but the position wouldbe kept under review.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.MilitaryAirfields.Scampton.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 61stConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 303) reporting that in his opinion, and in that of theMinister of Labour and the President of the Board of Trade, the AirMinistry estimate that development of Hemswell as a Class I airfieldwould cost  1-63 millions more than corresponding development atScampton was soundly based.The Lord Privy Seal said that he still saw the gravest objectionsto the development of Scampton. The fact that the local authority concerned had been incorrectly informed of the extent of the &quot; fillingin &quot; which would be required at Hemswell, and had still not beeninformed of the true position in this respect, did not inspire confidence in the Air Ministry&apos;s handling of this matter as a whole.It would also be interesting to know at what date the development ofSturgate as an American long-range fighter base, which was now given as an additional reason for not developing Hemswell as a class I airfield, had been decided upon.The Cabinet were informed that action was now in train toinform the local authority of the true facts concerning Hemswell, andthat the development of Sturgate had been started in 1951 before any objections had been raised to the development of Scampton.The Prime Minister said that the only course open to theCabinet, on the basis of the facts before them, appeared to be to approve the development of Scampton in spite of their naturalreluctance to seem to disregard the objections felt by the Lord privy seal.The Lord Privy Seal said that he wished his continuing dissent inprinciple from any decision to develop Scampton to be placed on record.The Cabinet-Agreed that Scampton should be developed as a Class IAirfield.
Civil Aviation.Developmentof gatwick airport.(previous reference:CC. (54) 59thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (54) 304).The Minister of Transport recalled that the Cabinet had already agreed in principle that the Government should announce their intention of proceeding with the development of Gatwick airport asthe main alternative civil airport to London Airport. Decisions bythe Cabinet were now required on three subsidiary matters: (i) the diversion of the London-Brighton road; (ii) compensation for owners of adjoining property; and (iii) the timing of the announcement ofthe Governmenfs decisions.On the question of road-diversion, The Minister of Transportsaid that the effective choice lay between a short diversion, costing 369,000, and the construction of a section of the proposed Brightonradial road at a cost of  1,820,000. He had not felt justified himself in pressing for more than the minimum diversion, but some membersof the Home Affairs Committee had taken the view that theGovernment would be well advised to meet local opinion at least onthis aspect of Gatwick&apos;s development.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, urged the Cabinet to approveonly the short diversion on the ground that construction of a part ofthe Brighton radial road at the present time would stimulate claims on behalf of other major road projects which enjoyed a higher priority but for which funds could not be made available.The Minister of Housing said that he would not press for themore costly diversion in spite of its obvious advantages for bothGatwick and Crawley New Town.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should proceed on thebasis of a short diversion of the London-Brighton roadat a cost of  369,000.On the question of compensation The Minister of Transportsaid that he was not pressing for even a limited scheme of compensa-tion although some members of the Home Affairs Committee hadbeen inclined to favour such an arrangement. He would, however,be glad to have authority to alleviate hardship so far as possiblethrough the purchase of properties adjoining the airfield for useeither by his Department or by the airlines, and he would like toinclude in his announcement a guarded statement of his intentions in this respect.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that he had no doubtthat the Minister of Transport and he would be able to reach agreement on the terms of a statement to this effect which wouldnot give rise to serious repercussions or serve as a precedent.The Minister of Housing said that he agreed that the Govern-ment would be wiser to proceed empirically in this matter than to formulate a scheme of compensation expressly designed to alleviatehardship caused by the Governmenfs change of plans.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Minister of Transport and the Financial Secretary,Treasury to agree upon the terms of a statement on thelines suggested in discussion, for inclusion in the proposed announcement.As regards the announcement of the Governmenfs decisionsThe Minister of Transport said that, if he was to meet the strong representations which had been made to him in favour of anannouncement during the Parliamentary recess, the announcementmust be made before the end of the present week.
The Minister of Housing said that he would welcome anopportunity to consider further how best to handle the full report onweather conditions at Gatwick which had been submitted by theDirector of the Meteorological Office. In any event it might nowbe wiser to await the reassembly of Parliament before announcing the Governments decisions.The Prime Minister said that the exact form and the timing ofan announcement should be further considered by a smaller bodyof the Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the form and timing of an announcement of theGovernments decision to develop Gatwick airport shouldbe considered by a Committee composed as follows:  Chancellor of the Exchequer.Minister of Housing and Local Government.Secretary of State for Air.Minister of Transport.Cabinet Office, S.W.15th  October, 1954.
