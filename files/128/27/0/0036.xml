CC. 36 (54)Kenya.(previous reference:CC. (54) 2.1stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (54) 172) recommending a relaxation of the restrictionsat present imposed on the use of bombing from the air as a methodof dealing with Mau Mau terrorists in Kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that bombing had hitherto been confined to the prohibited areas, which could not be entered withouta permit. It was now proposed that authority should be given forbombing by aircraft operating in close support of ground forcesoutside the prohibited areas. There were occasions on which thiswould be the most effective and economical means of dispersingterrorist gangs which had taken cover in wooded country. aircraft would not, however, be used for this purpose except on request bythe commander of ground troops in close contact with terrorist gangsand in circumstances involving no foreseeable risk of injury to third parties.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had looked very closelyat this proposal, in the light of earlier experience of bombing oftribesmen by aircraft. He was satisfied, however, that in presentconditions in Kenya there were special circumstances which justifiedthis limited relaxation of the existing restrictions. The air weaponwas to be used only when the ground troops were in close contact with a terrorist gang large enough to offer a reasonable target forair attack. Reliable pilots would be specially chosen for this duty.On the conditions laid down the risk of injury to third parties was so small that it could, in his view, be accepted.The Prime Minister said that he hoped it would not be necessaryto make any public announcement of this relaxation of the existing restrictions on air operations against Mau Mau terrorists.The Cabinet Agreed that air operations might be undertaken againstMau Mau terrorists in Kenya on the conditions specified inparagraphs 6-7 of C. (54) 172, and authorised the colonial secretary to send instructions accordingly to the ActingGovernor of Kenya.Togoland. 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (54) 169) on the future of British Togoland.The Colonial Secretary said that British Togoland was a trust territory for which the United Kingdom Government wereaccountable to the United Nations. The interests of its inhabitantswould, however, be best served if it continued to be administered asan integral part of the Gold Coast. When the Gold Coast attainedself-government, the United Kingdom should no longer remainaccountable for it to the United Nations and the terms of the Trustee-ship Agreement would need to be altered. It was therefore proposedthat we should inform the United Nations that in our view theinterests of the inhabitants of British Togoland would be best served by integration with the Gold Coast, when it attained self-government,and invite them to ascertain the wishes of the local population,whether by plebiscite or otherwise. Before this approach was madeto the United Nations, consultations should be held with the FrenchGovernment, because of the growing demand for unification of theEwe tribes, living partly in British and French Togolands and partly in the Gold Coast. Certain other Governments should also beinformed before our proposals were laid before the United Nations.
Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Whitsun Recess from4th to 15th June.Parliament. 4.   jhe Cabinet reviewed the position resulting from the debateExpenses of in the House of Commons on 24th May when the motion proposingMembers. an increase in Members&apos; salaries had been carried by a majority(Previous of 1.14. It was reported that there was a strong feeling amongReference: Government supporters, in Parliament and in the country, that theC.C. (54) 35th Government should defer improving the remuneration of MembersConclusions, until they had dealt with other deserving claims, in particular thoseMinute 3.) of old-age pensioners. The Cabinet agreed that, having invited theHouse of Commons to express their view on this question by a free vote, the Government must be guided by the view expressed andthat, as the motion had been carried by so large a majority, theyhad no alternative but to proceed without undue delay to take effective steps to improve the remuneration of Members. Differingopinions were, however, expressed on the question whether theGovernment need necessarily adopt the method of a direct increasein salary. Some Ministers felt that the Government could not nowdecline to adopt the method favoured in the motion which had beencarried by so large a majority. Indeed, it was thought doubtfulwhether proposals for improving the financial position of Membersby the alternative method of reimbursing expenses could be carried in the House of Commons even with the support of the GovernmentWhip. Other Ministers suggested that the Government were entitledto treat this vote by the House of Commons as no more than adeclaration of principle that an immediate improvement should bemade in the remuneration of Members, and that it would be open tothem to bring forward proposals for reimbursement of expenseswhich would afford for most Members financial relief roughlyequivalent to a salary increase of  500. In support of this view itwas argued that, despite the vote in the House of Commons, theGovernment were entitled to take account of public opinion in thecountry. It was also pointed out that, if the system of reimbursement of expenses were adopted, it could at the appropriate stage be appliedto Peers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that two other questions would need consideration. First, the trustees of the Members&apos; fund should be asked for their views on the question whether an exchequer contribution to the Fund was needed. Secondly, theCabinet should decide what adjustments should be made inMinister^ salaries and whether the legislation needed for that purpose the Minister of State supported the proposals put forward bythe Colonial Secretary.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals on the future of British Togolandoutlined in C. (54) 169; and authorised the Colonial Secre-tary, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, to arrangefor those proposals to be put before the United Nationsafter consulting the French Government and informing theother Governments concerned.
Pensions for old-Age and war Disability.(previous reference:CC. (54) 28thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions (C. (54) 162) submitting, in accordance with the Cabinefsconclusion of 13th April, an outline of an interim scheme for improving the rates of old-age and disability pensions before thereceipt of the Report of the Phillips Committee.The Minister of Pensions said that, although he had submittedthis outline of an interim scheme in accordance with the Cabinefsrequest, he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were now agreedthat it would be preferable to introduce at a later stage a singlescheme incorporating any acceptable recommendations made by thePhillips Committee. There was now good reason to hope that thePhillips Committee would be able to submit at least an interimReport in the late autumn, and the Government Actuary&apos;s report onhis first quinquennial review of the working of the national insurance scheme would also be available before the end of the year.The Government should therefore be in a position to formulate theirpolicy and to announce their plans before Christmas; and, if legisla-tion were introduced very early in the New Year, the new rates ofpension could be in operation by the summer of 1955.In discussion there was general agreement that in thesecircumstances it would be preferable to defer legislation on old-age and disability pensions until the 1954-55 Session. This would thenbe the main item of social legislation in the legislative programme for that Session.The Minister of Pensions recalled that on 3rd March theCabinet had approved an increase of 10s. a week in the rate of&quot; unemployability supplement&quot; payable to war pensioners and to persons suffering from industrial injuries which rendered thempermanently incapable of work. He sought the views of the Cabineton the question whether this improvement should now be deferred for incorporation in the main legislation on old-age and disability pensions.In discussion it was argued that, if this improvement were brought forward in isolation, it might provoke pressure for improve-ment in pension rates generally. This might, however, be avoidedif it were deferred until after the Government had been able to makeplain their intention to deal generally with pensions in the next session of Parliament. The Cabinet agreed that it might be left tothe discretion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofPensions to decide whether this improvement should be introduced during the autumn or whether it should be left over for incorporation in the main legislation in the following Session.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that legislation improving the rates of old-age anddisability pensions should be introduced early in the NewYear so that the new rates might be in full operation inthe summer of 1955.should be introduced before the summer recess or deferred until theautumn. He proposed to consider all these matters, in the light ofthe preliminary views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion, andwould submit a memorandum which could serve as a basis forfurther Cabinet discussion in the following week.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of these questions at their meeting in the following week, on the basis of a memo-randum to be circulated by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
Sugar Trade. 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Food (C. (54) 167) outlining the arrangements which he proposedto make to end direct State trading in sugar.The Minister of Food said that he had been authorised by theEconomic Policy Committee to discuss further with the various interests concerned plans for ending direct State trading in sugarwhich would, he hoped, prove acceptable in principle to Common-wealth sugar producers and to refiners and other members of the sugar trades in this country. He had thought it right to bring these plans to the attention of the Cabinet at this stage because of the likelihood that some Government supporters in Parliament might be critical of the proposals to establish a Sugar Board of Governmentnominees and to convert the British Sugar Corporation into a statu-tory company with a Board of Directors nominated by the Govern-ment. But the only practicable alternative would be the nationalisation of the sugar industry. And this, apart from other objections, would prevent the re-establishment of the London sugarmarket. The adoption of his proposals would assist in the processof winding up the Ministry of Food.The Cabinet Approved in principle the plans for future regulation of the sugar trade outlined in C. (54) 167.7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Common-wealth Secretary (C. (54) 173) and the President of the Board ofTrade (C. (54) 174) on the form of the United Kingdom&apos;s association with the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that on 7th April theCabinet had appointed a Committee of Ministers under his chairman-ship to formulate instructions for the United Kingdom delegation which would negotiate on this matter with the President of the high authority, M. Monnet. This Committee had agreed that we couldnot undertake to enter a common market with the Community for either coal or steel, which was opposed alike by the National coal board, the Iron and Steel Board and the engineering industry. Theindustries concerned, if they were free to decide their attitude in thelight only of their own commercial interests, would not be in favourof any form of association with the Community, but they recognisedthat there were political considerations which might warrant closerEuropean coal and steel community.(previous reference:CC. (54) 27thConclusions,Minute 3.)(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to do his utmost toensure that a report was received from the PhillipsCommittee in time to enable the Government to formulate their plans and introduce the necessary legisla-tion early in 1955.(3) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Pensions to decide in their discretionwhether the approved increase in the unemployabilitysupplement payable to war pensioners and to persons suffering from industrial injuries which rendered thempermanently incapable of work should be introduced inadvance of the general legislation on old-age anddisability pensions.
Civil Defence.(previous reference:C.C.(54)29thConclusions,Minute 3.)co-operation than would be justified on commercial grounds alone.The majority of the Committee had taken the view that the UnitedKingdom industries concerned should be brought into direct contact with the corresponding industries in the countries of the Communitythrough the early establishment of a Council of Association on thelines proposed in Annex 1 to C. (54) 173, and that negotiations for areduction of our present high protective tariff on steel might thereby be facilitated.The Minister of Supply confirmed that the Iron and Steel Board,in particular, were taking the view described by the commonwealth secretary and emphasised the importance of retaining their confi-dence. There seemed to be a definite prospect that, by a gradualprocess of contact and discussion, the British steel industry could bebrought to co-operate in practice with the Community andM. Monnet was probably enough of a realist to see the wisdom ofan empirical approach on these lines.The President of the Board of Trade said that the only point onwhich he had differed from his colleagues on the Committee hadbeen on the timing of the establishment of the proposed Council of association in relation to the negotiation of a reduction in oursteel tariff. Our strongest bargaining counter was M. Monnefsdesire to secure some formal association of the United kingdom with the Community and this would be thrown away if we were tojoin a Council of Association before securing agreement on the tariffquestion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, from the record of a recent conversation between M. Monnet and Sir Cecil Weir, it seemed clear that the former took the view that fundamental questions suchas the steel tariff should be resolved before a Council of association was established. It would, he thought, be wise to tell M. Monnetthat final conclusions might not be reached during his visit to London,but that we should be willing to arrange for negotiations on the steeltariff to be put in hand. On the question of timing, therefore, he supported the view expressed by the President of the Board of Trade.The general view of the Cabinet was in favour of the course recommended by the majority on the Committee of Ministers. TheCabinet also agreed that the negotiations with M. Monnet should be conducted by the Minister of Supply and that the Committee ofMinisters should remain in being so as to be available to consider any issues of policy which might arise during the course of thenegotiations.The Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the recommendations in C. (54) 173 and invited the Minister of Supply to undertake negotiationswith M. Monnet upon the basis of those recom-mendations.(2) Agreed that the Committee of Ministers should continue in being during the course of these negotiations.8. The Cabinet considered a note by the Home Secretary(C. (54) 176) covering the draft of a public statement on civil defence plans.The Home Secretary said that he was satisfied that he shouldmake a further public statement about the Government^ civil defence plans at an early date. The draft statement annexed to his note,which he proposed to make in the House of Commons on 28th May,had been prepared in consultation with his colleagues on the ministerial Committee on Civil Defence.
The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The Prime Minister suggested the substitution of &quot; callous &quot;or &quot; neglectful &quot; for &quot; defeatist &quot; in line 9 of paragraph 3 of the draft statement.(b) The Minister of Defence said that he favoured some drafting amendments to the proposed statement, designed to give it a rather more robust tone, and would discuss these with the Home Secretary.(c) There was support for the view that the draft statement was too long to be made orally in the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the points recorded in paragraphs (a) and (b)above, approved the draft statement attached toC. (54) 176.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultation withthe Lord Privy Seal and the Commonwealth Secretary,how the statement might best be made before the endof the present week so as to meet the convenience ofParliament and to secure the widest publicity in thecountry.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (C. (54) 175) about the appointment of a new Apostolic Delegatein the United Kingdom.The Minister of State said that Her Majesty&apos;s Minister to the HolySee had been informed that the Pope intended to offer the vacantpost of Apostolic Delegate in the United Kingdom to Archbishop0&apos;Hara, the present Nuncio in Dublin, who was a&apos;United Statescitizen of Irish origin. Mgr. 0&apos;Hara was known to be a man of out-standing qualities, who had demonstrated during his period of office in Dublin his sympathy with the outlook of the Commonwealth. Inthe circumstances the Foreign Secretary did not consider that weshould be justified in objecting to the appointment of a Delegatewho was not a British subject.There was general support in the Cabinet for this view.The Cabinet Agreed that no objection need be raised to the proposed appointment of Archbishop 0&apos;Hara as Apostolic Delegatein the United Kingdom.10. The Cabinet had before them memoranda on fuel policy by the Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (54) 163) and the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 170) and a memorandum by the agriculture ministers (C. (54) 171) on opencast working.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while full discussionof these important papers must be deferred, he would welcomeauthority to investigate further in the meanwhile, in consultation withthe Minister of Fuel and Power, the proposal to convert Mafchwobdpower station to oil-firing and possible alternative methods of con-converting small coal into briquettes.The Minister of Fuel and Power confirmed that he would welcome further investigation of these questions.
