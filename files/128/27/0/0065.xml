Industrial 1.   The Minister of Labour said that the dislocation of LondonDisputes. omnibus services was causing great inconvenience to the public, but(Previous the situation did not yet give cause for serious anxiety.   the reference: Transport and General Workers Union (T.G.W.U.) were about toC.C. (54) 64th publish a statement explaining to the public the issues which underlayConclusions, the strike.   There was no disagreement between the LondonMinute 2.) Transport Executive and the Union, who were ready to begindiscussions on all outstanding issues as soon as work was resumed.London There was no occasion for him to intervene in this dispute at theTransport. present time.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Docks. The Minister of Labour said that Mr. Deakin, the Secretary ofthe Transport and General Workers Union, had not in the eventaddressed the mass meeting of strikers held on the previous eveningin the Albert Hall. This meeting had brought about no improvementin the situation, which was now very grave. Mr. Deakin consideredthat if military labour were used to maintain essential services thestrike might spread, for example to power-station operativesbelonging to the Electrical Trade Union, and he would prefer thatthe Government should hold their hand at least until the beginningof the following week. The port employers were also opposed to early intervention by the Government, lest it should encourage the expectation of concessions to the strikers: they hoped that the strike would collapse within a week or so. The Ministers own view was,however, that the Government would be seriously criticised if theyrefrained any longer from taking action. He therefore proposedto invite the representatives of the three parties to the dispute the port employers, the T.G.W.U. and the Stevedores&apos; Union tohave separate discussions with him on the following day, in orderthat he might be accurately informed about the present position inthe dispute. In these discussions he would make it clear to the strikers&apos; representatives that, immediately work was resumed, theemployers would be ready to discuss all outstanding issues, includingovertime arrangements. The fact that he was holding these discussions might possibly influence the attitude of the lightermen,who had now decided in favour of striking in sympathy.The Minister asked for the Cabinefs authority to make it known,either during his talks on the following day or at an early stagethereafter, that he. intended to appoint a Court of Enquiry to investigate the dispute. He thought it necessary that the Governmentshould take this step in order to demonstrate that they were notindifferent to the serious consequences of the present standstill inthe docks. He believed that both the employers and the unions concerned would be ready to give evidence in such an enquiry, eventhough they would not welcome its appointment.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that steps to appoint a Court of Enquiry should not be deferred beyond the end of thepresent week.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) While there was no cause for immediate anxiety aboutsupplies of essential foods, there were consignments of bacon in the docks which would have to be removed not later than 21st October.(b) Exports to the value of  20 millions were now awaitingshipment, and the total was rising by about  3 millions a day. ships were being diverted from United Kingdom to continental ports and,if the strike were prolonged, foreign buyers would begin to diverttheir orders elsewhere.(c) Departments would complete by the following day their estimates of prospective needs for military labour for themaintenance of essential services;  and this would enable the
Ministerial Committee on Emergencies to approve plans for theemployment of military labour which could be put into operation as soon as they became necessary.The Cabinet were informed that the Army could provide about ten thousand troops without serious difficulty,, and that the three services between them could make available a further fifty thousand,if necessary. The Service Departments would be glad to have three days&apos; notice of the need for troops, but some could be made available at shorter notice if this should prove necessary.(d) There was general agreement that action ought to be takento bring home to the public at the appropriate time the lossesincurred and threatened by continuance of the strike and the actionwhich the Government might be compelled to take to maintain essential services.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Labour to invite representativesof the three parties to the dispute affecting work in theLondon docks to visit him for discussions, and to proceedwith the appointment of a Court of Enquiry into thedispute as soon as he considered that such action wouldbe opportune.(2) Took note that the necessary preparatory measures were inhand to introduce military labour into the docks as soonas the situation justified this step.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation as necessary with the Home Secretary and other Ministers concerned,to issue suitable guidance to the Press about the damageresulting from the strike and about the action which theGovernment considered necessary to meet the situation as it developed.ColouredWorkers.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 17thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. Reference was made to the Cabinefs earlier discussions on the possibility of limiting the immigration of coloured personsinto the United Kingdom.The Home Secretary said that, since the Cabinefs last discussion,this matter had been the subject of further study by a committee of officials whose findings were about to be considered by the ministers concerned.The Cabinet-Agreed that the problems arising from the immigration of coloured people into the United Kingdom required urgent and serious consideration, and invited the Home Secretaryto bring the matter before them as soon as possible.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th October, 1954.
