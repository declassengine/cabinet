3CC. 57 (54)european defence community.(previous reference:CC. (54) 54thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 276) about the course to be adopted if the european defence Community (E.D.C.) Treaty should be rejected by the FrenchAssembly after their forthcoming debate.The Foreign Secretary said that there was every likelihood thatthe Treaty would be rejected by the French Assembly within the nextfew days. It was vital that, until the critical vote had taken place,no encouragement should be given publicly to the idea of any alternative to the Treaty. He could, however, envisage no betteralternative than to bring Germany into the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.), in agreement with France and the UnitedStates and subject to the safeguards set out in the annex to C. (54) 276.The difficulties in the way of this alternative were undoubtedlyformidable. Not only had the attitude adopted by M. Mendes-france at and since the recent Brussels Conference seriously antagonised theother signatories of the E.D.C. Treaty, but the Labour Party in thiscountry were not committed to supporting any plan involvingGerman rearmament other than E.D.C. and might well takeadvantage of the opportunity of restoring Party unity on this issue byopposing the admission of Germany into N.A.T.O. If the cabinet agreed with his view about the course which should be taken in theevent of French rejection of the Treaty, he would at once inform theUnited States Government confidentially of what we had in mind:he expected them to agree to our taking the initiative. The first step would be to seek the views of Dr. Adenauer, and this he would propose to do in the first instance through our High Commissioner inBonn. It seemed unlikely that the German Federal Governmentwould feel able to accept all the limitations outlined in the annex tohis paper, but as many as possible of these must be secured. It was doubtful whether a majority would be obtainable in the presentFrench Assembly for any proposals involving German rearmament,but M. Mendes-France had expressed the view that on a secondoccasion the Assembly would find it harder to take an entirelynegative decision.The Prime Minister said that it had not been difficult to convince the United States Government that their plan for a postponement ofthe French Assembly debate and for the immediate summoning of an eight-Power conference was unsound (Foreign Office telegramNo. 4293 to Washington). The words which, in agreement with theForeign Secretary, he had used in his speech to the Conservative party conference at Margate in October, 1953, remained as true to-day aswhen he had spoken them:  &quot; I am sure that the decisions taken by the SocialistGovernment, which were supported by us at the time and are nowbeing carried forward steadfastly and soberly by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, constitute the best chance and&quot; indeed, I think it agood chance of getting through this awful period of anxietywithout a world catastrophe.&quot; We, at any rate, are going to adhere faithfully to them and do our utmost to promote the formation of the European Armywith a strong contingent of Germans in it. We, like the americans, shall maintain our forces in Europe, thus restoring the French balance of equality with our German associate.&quot;If E.D.C. should not be adopted by the French, we shallhave no choice in prudence but to fall in with some new arrangement which will join the strength of Germany to theWestern allies through some rearrangement of the forces ofN.A.T.O.&quot;French fears of German predominance in the comparativelyrestricted E.D.C. might not have the same force in respect of the wider community of N.A.T.O., including, as it did, the United Statesand United Kingdom.   The isolation in which France would find

herself if she rejected E.D.C. would, moreover, be likely to induceher to co-operate in seeking an alternative to it.The Minister of Housing suggested that a N.A.T.O. solution might be made more palatable both to French opinion and&apos; to the-Labour Party in this country if, for this purpose, N.A.T.O. could bemade at least to appear to have been modified in the direction of theEuropean idea. Was it possible, for example, for Germany formally to adhere to the Brussels Treaty which continued to subsist within theNorth Atlantic Treaty? He would send some suggestions on theselines to the Foreign Secretary.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he would be opposed toany association of the United Kingdom with continental countriescloser than that envisaged in connection with the E.D.C., as it seemed likely that this would encourage tendencies in certain commonwealth countries to turn towards the United States.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that, in the event of rejection of theE.D.C. Treaty by the French Assembly, it would benecessary to work to bring Germany into N.A.T.O&apos;.,subject to as many as possible of the safeguards set outin the annex to C. (54) 276.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed on the general lines suggested in C. (54) 276 and in the course ofdiscussion.
british somali land.Grazing rights in Ethiopia.(previous reference:C.C.(53)81st, Conclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 278) covering a despatch to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Addis Ababa regarding a conversation which he had recently had with the Ethiopian Ambassador in London about thenegotiations on the Ilaud grazing grounds.The Foreign Secretary said that a settlement of this long-standingproblem could no longer be deferred and must be sought on thebasis of acceptance of Ethiopian sovereignty over the Haud, whichhad been recognised as long ago as 1897 by the Anglo-EthiopianTreaty of that year, provided that we were assured of our requirements as regards the grazing rights and protection of theSomali tribes during those periods of the year which they wouldspend in Ethiopian territory.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs agreed with this viewbut emphasised that the arrangements to be made with the ethiopian government must provide for protection of the tribes andmaintenance of law and order amongst them throughout the year,as there were now no limits to the length of time which they would wish and be able to spend on the grazing grounds across the frontier.The Minister of Defence said that there was a risk that, if thearrangements made in regard to the tribes should prove to be inadequate, trouble might ensue necessitating the use of Britishtroops.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to effect a settlement withthe Ethiopian Government in respect of the Haud grazinggrounds on the basis outlined in discussion.South Africa. 4.   The Prime Minister said that he understood that the SouthSimonstown African Minister of Defence, during his forthcoming visit to thisNaval Base. country, was likely to try to re-open discussion on the transfer ofthe Simonstown base to the South African Navy. This base had always been of first-rate strategic importance, but its value appearedto be even greater now in the light of the reduced importance of the suez Canal and the greater uncertainty about the degree ofco-operation in defence matters which was to be expected of theSouth African Government in the future. He had asked the Ministerof Defence to report on the suitability of Durban as an alternativebase to Simonstown, but it was not clear that Durban could be relied upon in all circumstances. He therefore felt doubtful whether in any circumstances we ought to consider abandoning our presentlegal right to perpetual use of the Simonstown base.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the object of theforthcoming discussions with the South African Minister of Defence,Mr. Erasmus, was to encourage the South African Government totake a broader view of their responsibilities in Commonwealthdefence. There were grounds for believing that Mr. Erasmus might prove to be reasonably forthcoming. In any event there was not atpresent any intention to modify the conditions for transfer of the simonstown base which had been agreed upon in 1951.The Minister of Defence said that, even from the point of viewof our use of the Simonstown base, it was important to ensure the... . fullest possible co-operation of the South African Government inorder to safeguard, the continued supply of labour, water and electric power to the base.The Prime Minister said that there was certainly no objectionto seeing what, if anything, Mr. Erasmus had to say on the subjectof the Simonstown naval base. But, before any encouragement was
Supply of 5.   The Prime Minister said that it had been brought to hisHelicopters to notice that the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture had approachedArgentina. the Bristol Aeroplane Company about buying Sycamore helicopters(Previous for crop-spraying. They wished to buy 5 now, and might order upReference: to 50 later. At the end of 1953 the Argentine Navy had wanted to buyC.C. (54) 1st helicopters from us, but we had been unwilling to agree, since theyConclusions, might have been used against us in the Antarctic.   He did notMinute 4.) himself feel sure that the helicopters the Argentines now wantedwould not in fact be used to our detriment.The Foreign Secretary said that, although there was no certainguarantee that the Argentines would not use these helicopters against us, they had already bought for their Navy American helicopterswhich were larger and more suitable for use in the Antarctic. on balance, he recommended allowing the sale of not more than 10Sycamore or similar helicopters to Argentina, and that the matter should be re-examined if the Argentines wished to place a largerorder.The Secretary of State for Air said that orders for thesehelicopters would represent a valuable export, since they cost 40,000 each. He had no objection to the sale, provided the argentines did not pre-empt helicopters needed by the Services.The Cabinet Agreed that not more than 10 Sycamore or similarhelicopters should be sold to the Argentine Ministry ofAgriculture; and that, if the Argentines later wished to place a larger order, the matter should be considered again by theCabinet.Cyprus. 6.   The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that the(Previous        announcement of the policy approved by the Cabinet on 26th July had reference:      provoked a violent reaction in Greece, but there had been only minorC.C. (54) 53rd   and isolated incidents in Cyprus. Indeed, except for the extremeConclusions,    nationalists and the Communists, there was considerable apathyMinute 5.)      among the people of Cyprus.  Archbishop Makarios had preachedthree sermons of a political nature, but not in such terms as wouldwarrant a prosecution for sedition. As regards the enforcement of the laws against sedition, it had been the intention that the governor should issue a warning that the law would be enforced, but that thiswould be in general terms, whereas the publication of detailedprohibitions, some of which might not be applicable in presentcircumstances, had understandably aroused widespread criticism.The Colonial Secretary had since expressed the view to the.Governorthat seditious behaviour which did not lead to violence mightconveniently be overlooked. The Colonial Office were taking active measures to explain publicly the case for the Governments policy in cyprus.given to him to think that the United Kingdom Government mightbe ready to re-open the question of transfer, the matter must bebrought again before the Cabinet. World conditions hadsubstantially changed even since 1951, and it was by no means certain that conditions for transfer of the base which had beenconsidered sufficient at that time would prove on examination tomeet adequately the conditions of to-day.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
Cost of Living. 7. jhe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Prime(Previous Minister (C. (54) 272) covering a report by the Ministry of LabourReference: about the rise of 3 points in.the Retail Prices Index figure publishedCC. (52)70th for July; a note (C. (54) 277) containing statistics of the consumptionConclusions, of food and expenditure on tobacco, beer, wines and spirits providedMinute9.)       by the Ministry of Food at the Prime Minister^ request; and amemorandum by the Minister of Food (C. (54) 274) about the levelof meat prices since decontrol.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that, asthe Index figure was calculated from the actual prices which people were prepared to pay on a particular day, it was not possible to makeaccurate forecasts of future changes in the Index figure. In so far as any estimates could be made, the Index figure for August might showa fall of 1 point; but a rising trend must be expected for the rest ofthe year, as there would be increases in rents and fares as well as inthe cost of some foods and other items.j The Prime Minister said that the publication of repressive lawsagainst sedition had been unwise and had led to unnecessary trouble.It would do no harm to allow demonstrations in Cyprus, provided they did not lead to violence, which did not appear likely.The Foreign Secretary said that it was necessary to explain our policy, and the reasons for it, in as convincing a way as possible before the matter came up for discussion in the United Nations inSeptember. The claim to Cyprus, which Greece was pressing, wasa fabricated one and we should be ready to expose this. ManyGreeks, particularly those with a liberal outlook, were not in sympathy with present Greek policy, but could not say so because there was no freedom of expression in Greece. We could point outthat the Greek record of administration in the Dodecanese, since ithad been restored to them, was deplorable compared with our ownin Cyprus. We had a good case and it might be helpful if a small committee of Ministers were set up to supervise its presentation.In discussion the following further points were made:  (a) Pakistan had now indicated that she fully supported theUnited Kingdom on this issue. There had been criticism from theNew Zealand Minister for External Affairs, but this might not reflect the general state of public opinion in New Zealand, and showed theneed for a proper explanation of our policy.(b) It was sitggested that an examination should be made of the laws against sedition in Cyprus, with the object of putting into reservesuch of them as need not be used unless a state of emergency weredeclared. It was pointed out that in Cyprus, as in other colonial territories, seditious intent included the intention to change the sovereignty of the Colony, regardless of whether there was anyincitement to violence.(c) The Foreign Secretary expressed the view that, since itshould be our aim to show that conditions were not abnormal in cyprus, it would be unwise for the Colonial Secretary to visit the island at the present time, and that the Cabinet should be consulted before any decision was taken to pay such a visit.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of State for colonial Affairs.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a small Committeeof Ministers to be set up to consider the presentation ofthe Governmenfs policy towards Cyprus.
industrial 8.   The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thatDisputes. there was no truth in the report that the Chairman of the british railways. Transport Commission had put forward proposals which might(Previous provide a solution to the dispute about railwaymen&apos;s wages. In fact,Reference: the National Union of Railwaymen would decide on 31st AugustC.C. (54) 50th what course they would follow.   They might decide to approachConclusions, the Minister of Labour or they might take other action.  AthoughMinute 7.) the railwaymen did not really want to strike, this possibility couldnot be ruled out.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour.Agricultural 9.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLand Minister of Agriculture (C. (54) 273) about the effect of a recentTribunals.       High Court ruling on the constitution and decisions of agricultural land Tribunals.The Minister of Agriculture said that an Agricultural LandTribunal consisted of a legally qualified chairman, appointed by theLord Chancellor, and two lay members, appointed by the Ministerof Agriculture. In practice, the latter two members were selectedon each occasion by an official of the Ministry of Agriculture (usuallythe official who acted as secretary to the Tribunal) from a panel ofpersons nominated for the purpose by farmers and land owners.In the case in which a Mrs. Woollett had successfully appealed to theHigh Court against the compulsory acquisition of 3 acres of land of which she was the owner, the Judge had held that the Tribunalhad not been properly constituted, on the ground that the two laymembers had not been appointed &quot; by or on behalf of the Minister,&quot;but by the official in his capacity as secretary.  This decision threwThe following points were made in discussion:  (a) The increasing difficulty of making reliable forecasts wasa result of freeing the economy and removing price controls.(b) The increase in retail meat prices was due in part to the factthat consumers were prepared to pay a price which allowed butchersto take a somewhat higher rate of profit than they had been allowedwhile meat was controlled. In fact, the public were willingly paying for the better cuts of meat.(c) When prices were controlled, it was the controlled price which was taken for the purpose of calculating the Index figure,although in some cases, for example meat, consumers might well,on occasion, have paid more than the controlled price.(d) It was agreed that there was no general discontent about thecost of living, but it was pointed out that a rise of 3 points in theIndex figure nevertheless provided a basis for claims for increased wages, and in some cases wages increased automatically with a risein the Index.The Prime Minister said that it was clear from the statistics offood consumption that the level of prices did not deter consumers,and the statistics of expenditure on tobacco, beer, wines and spiritsshowed that the people generally were prosperous. It should notbe difficult to find arguments to meet Opposition propaganda basedon the rise in the Retail Prices Index figure for July.The Cabinet Took note of C. (54) 272, C. (54) 277 and C. (54) 274.
doubt on the constitution and decisions of all Tribunals which hadsat since 1947. To remove these doubts, it would be necessary foran appeal to be successful on all the points on which the High Courtdecision had been given. An alternative course would be to proceed at once with a validating Bill. Despite the risk that it might notbe successful on all points, in which event a validating Bill wouldbe necessary, he recommended that an appeal should be made. Inorder to avoid hardships to Mrs. Woollett, it would be desirable tooffer to pay her reasonable costs, whatever the result of the appeal.The Attorney-General said that he agreed that the best course was to appeal, although it was doubtful whether an appeal would succeed except on the narrow ground that Mrs. Woollett&apos;s applicationto the High Court was outside the period of limitation provided under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946.Even if the appeal were successful, there might in any case be apublic demand that Mrs. Woollett should be allowed to recover herland though this point need not be decided until it arose.The Lord Chancellor said that, if validating legislation should prove to be necessary, it ought to be generally recognised to bejustified, in view of the fact that the appeal to the High Court hadbeen allowed on technical grounds. An appeal was in any casenecessary in order, if possible, to establish the fact that the certificategiven by the Minister was valid, notwithstanding doubts about theconstitution of the Agricultural Land Tribunal.The Cabinet-Approved the course proposed in C. (54) 273.Soviet Union. 10.   The Foreign Secretary said that two subordinate employeesCharges against in the British Embassy in Moscow had, when intoxicated,-assaultedBritish Russians, including a Russian policeman.   One was employed asemployees. a wireless operator, but not in such a position that his predicamentgave rise to anxiety on security grounds. The Ambassador wanted to send the employees concerned back to the United Kingdom, butthe Russians were insisting on bringing them to trial for hooliganism.A trial could be avoided if they were given refuge in the Embassypremises, but there were difficulties about such a course since the employees concerned had families, and in any case there was nodoubt that they had committed an offence. We could, therefore,either stand on their claim to diplomatic immunity but without takingmeasures to prevent their arrest, or we could waive any claim todiplomatic immunity for them. If they were tried, they might wellreceive severe sentences.He had asked the Soviet Ambassador to transmit a personal message to the Soviet Foreign Minister expressing the hope that theRussians would not insist on bringing these men to trial since thatwould lead to unnecessary friction. Subject to this, he had cometo the view that we should waive diplomatic immunity in this case.The Prime Minister said that he agreed with the course proposedby the Foreign Secretary. If the Russians inflicted vindictivesentences it would then be proper to take whatever measures were open to us; but this was not a case in which diplomatic immunityshould be claimed.The Cabinet Agreed that diplomatic immunity should be waived inthis case.
