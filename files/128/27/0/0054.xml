If he could secureConclusions,    their agreement to these, he would invite the French Parliament to minute 4.)       ratify the Treaty as it stood on the understanding that the agreedamendments would be incorporated thereafter.   On that basis theTreaty might be ratified by France before the end of August.  If,on the other hand, the other Treaty Powers were unwilling to assent to this plan, the French Government would be ready to discuss with us during August methods of controlling German rearmament other-wise than through a European Defence Community.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Egypt 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary of State for defence War had now put to the Egyptians the revised proposals approved by negotiations.    the Cabinet at their meeting on the previous day.   The result was(Previous        reported in Cairo telegram No. 870.  It seemed likely that the reference:      Egyptians would agree that a period of 20 months should beC.C.

He hoped to be in a positionto make a statement in the House of Commons on 29th July. this could then be debated later that evening or, preferably, before the debate on the Adjournment on 30th July.The Cabinet Agreed that, if the current defence negotiations in Cairowere concluded during the next 24 hours, the heads of theagreement should be announced and debated in the Houseof Commons before the summer recess; and invited theLord Privy Seal to discuss with Opposition leaders in due course what arrangements could best be made for holdingsuch a debate on 29th or 30th July.housing subsidies.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 46thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal and the Minister of Housing (C. (54) 242) submitting a report on housing subsidies by the Cabinet Committee on Local GovernmentReform.The Minister of Housing said that in England and Wales duringthe last 18 months there had been a large and gratifying increase in private house building, and it was estimated that in 1955 the numberof houses built by private enterprise might rise to 130,000. It was his object to encourage this, so long as the number of houses built by local authorities did not fall below the total built during the lastyear of office of the Labour Government. Therefore, as the resourcesof the building industry were limited, the housing programmes oflocal authorities must be contracted. This could be done in either of two ways. The first was the administrative method of approvingless than the full programmes  submitted by individual local
authorities. The second was the financial method of differential ratesof subsidy described in C. (54) 242. The plan there proposed wasthat local authority houses built to meet general needs should attracta lower rate of subsidy than houses built by local authorities in replacement of slums or houses built in new towns or other areasproviding for people from over-crowded towns. He had no doubtthat in the long run the second was the better method. On the otherhand, it was the more conspicuous and the more likely to provokepolitical controversy. Timing was therefore of some political importance, and he sought the views of his colleagues on the expediency of making an early announcement that the government intended to introduce &quot;this differential rate of subsidy.In discussion there was general support for the view that a differential rate of subsidy on the lines proposed in C. (54) 242 offered the best long-term prospect of controlling the number of houses built by local authorities to meet general needs. Several Ministerssuggested however, that the time was not yet ripe for the introductionof this financial method of control. Though the number of houses for letting had been substantially increased, the public demand for houses had not yet been fully satisfied. In the public mind thehousing situation was measured by the number of deservingapplicants whom the local authorities could not satisfy, and thenumber of these hard cases had not yet reached such small pro-portions as to dispel the public impression that there was still aserious shortage of houses. Moreover, the situation was not uniformthroughout the country: there were still some areas, notably in theMidlands, where a large outstanding demand for houses remainedunsatisfied. The Cabinet were also informed that Conservativeorganisations throughout the country, which were still grapplingwith the task of removing misconceptions about the Housing repairs and Rents Bill, would prefer to postpone for a time the further dutyof defending a lower rate of subsidy for local authority houses built to meet general needs. The Secretary of State for Scotland addedthat delay in introducing this differential system in England andWales would be convenient to him, since it could not be applied inScotland for some time to come.The Cabinet (1) Approved the policy of encouraging the expansion of private house-building and, to offset this, contracting the localauthority programmes for the construction of subsidisedhouses to meet general needs.(2) Agreed in principle that at the appropriate time the Govern-ment should introduce a system of differential housing subsidies, on the lines indicated in C. (54) 242, for thepurpose of reducing the number of subsidised houses tobe built by local authorities to meet general needs.(3) Agreed to consider again in the autumn what would be theappropriate moment for. introducing such a system ofdifferential housing subsidies.Defence 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord.Policy. President (C. (54) 250) submitting the report of the Defence Policy(Previous Committee on the changes to be made in defence programmes in the reference: light of the new strategic appreciation by the Chiefs of StaffCC. (54) 24th (C. (54) 249) and the need to secure the utmost economy in defenceConclusions, expenditure.   They, also had before them a memorandum by the minute 5.) Minister of Supply (C. (54) 257) commenting on certain points arisingfrom the recommendations of the Defence Policy Committee.The Lord President said that the Defence Policy Committee hadreviewed existing defence programmes on the basis of a new strategicappreciation by the Chiefs of Staff taking account of recent develop-ments in the evolution of thermo-nuclear weapons.   The Service
5CC. 54 (54)Departments had revised their programmes in the light of this new-strategic concept, and the changes which it was now proposed tomake in them were summarised in paragraphs 4-9 of C. (54) 250.Some of these changes would arouse public interest and controversy,e.g., the proposal that Anti-Aircraft Command should be largelydisbanded and that expenditure on Civil Defence should be substantially reduced. Throughout their work the Committee hadkept in mind the statement made by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his Budget speech that means must be found of relieving theburden of defence expenditure on the national economy. great efforts had been made by the Service Departments to reduce their expenditure in the coming year but, even allowing for all the changesnow recommended by the Committee, their total requirements in1955 would amount to  1,630 millions, which was  130 millions abovethe target of  1,500 millions which had been set by the Chancellorof the Exchequer. It seemed unlikely that the gap would in fact beso large, since the figure of  1,630 millions included a provision of 80 millions against the possibility that, as a result of the establish-ment of the European Defence Community, the full costs of british forces in Germany during 1955 would have to be met from theExchequer. If it were accepted that these costs should be left to bemet, if they arose, by a Supplementary Estimate, the gap would bereduced to  50 millions. As was indicated in paragraph 17 ofC. (54) 250, the Minister of Defence was satisfied that further savings in expenditure by the Service Departments could only be achieved at the cost of further abandonment of existing military commitments.In these circumstances the Committee had not themselves felt ableto recommend further curtailments in Service programmes sufficientto produce an additional saving of  50 millions.The Minister of Supply suggested that further study was needed to ensure that the proposed reduction in defence expenditure wascorrectly apportioned between the various elements in our defence programmes. The changes recommended by the Committee were based on proposals made by each Department separately in thelight of the new strategic appreciation. If our defence effort wereviewed as a whole, it might be found desirable to make someadjustments in the proposals of individual Departments and it might also prove possible to secure some further economies.The Secretary of State for Air supported this suggestion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped the cabinet would feel able to accept the Committee&apos;s report as a basis for thepreparation of Departmental Estimates and programmes for 1955.It would still be possible to make further adjustments later in the year before the Estimates were finally settled. But, unless decisions were taken now on the main changes to be made, much of the saving whichcould otherwise be secured next year would be lost through delays inmodifying production programmes. He appreciated the great efforts made by the Service Departments to reduce the level of defence expenditure in 1955. Nevertheless, if even  30 or  40 millions hadto be found to meet the cost of British forces in Germany during 1955,defence expenditure next year would still be  80 or  90 millions inexcess of the  1,500 millions which he had set as the target. Thiswould have a substantial effect on the nature of his Budget for 1955.He therefore hoped that it would be possible, by further detailed study of defence programmes, to find means of securing some further savings in addition to those which would result from accepting theCommittee&apos;s recommendations.The Foreign Secretary said that the changes recommended bythe Committee would give rise to some public anxiety and he agreed with the emphasis which Was laid, in paragraphs 18 and 19 of C. (54)250, on the need for the most careful presentation of the newdirection in our defence preparations. He himself would feel some doubts about a policy of expanding Bomber Command at the expense
of Fighter Command. He recognised that we must develop a medium Bomber Force, but he was not convinced that its ultimatesize need be so large as that now envisaged. He thought we mightwell consult with the United States Government on the extent towhich we should supplement the large resources of their strategicbombing force. It could not be assumed that the risk of war couldbe disregarded during the next few years, and he was not sure thatit was wise to run the risk of diminishing the effectiveness of our fighter Force during those years by postponing the replacement ofobsolescent types of aircraft.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the new strategicconcept and the revision of our defence policy on the lines recommended in C. (54) 250 would be of close concern to other commonwealth countries. If we proceeded on the assumption thatthe United Kingdom could not be a main support area for allied action in a future war, other Commonwealth countries could not beexpected to rely on us for important elements in their defence supplyprogrammes and would tend to turn to United States types of equipment. For political as well as strategic reasons the changes nowproposed in our defence policy would need careful explanation to members of the Commonwealth.The Home Secretary said that important changes in civil defence preparations were recommended in paragraphs 12 and 13 ofC. (54) 250, but these were dependent for their success on themaintenance of public confidence as was pointed out in paragraphs 18and 19 of the Committee&apos;s report. A Government statement of great weight and authority would be needed if public support were to beenlisted for a policy of building up our deterrent strength at theexpense of measures of a defensive character.The Prime Minister said that this review of defence policy hadbeen largely influenced by the need to assist the Chancellor of theExchequer in overcoming the budgetary difficulties with which hewould be faced in the coming year. The radical changes nowproposed should be examined in greater detail before final decisions were taken by the Cabinet. This must, however, be done without prejudicing the economies which would flow from the adoption of therecommendations made by the Committee on Defence Policy. Hewas willing that the proposals in C. (54) 250 should be accepted asa basis for the revision of existing programmes and the preparationof Departmental Estimates. But after more detailed study some adjustment of the particular changes now envisaged might be found desirable, particularly when the new programmes were viewed in theirrelation one to another. This further scrutiny might be entrusted to a small group of Ministers who would call on such technical assistance as they might require and would report their conclusions to the Cabinet by the middle of September. The Cabinet would also need to consider very carefully the presentation of a new defence policy to the public. A draft of a possible White Paper should besubmitted for the Cabinefs consideration during the summer recess.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the new strategic appreciation by the Chiefs ofStaff contained in C. (54) 249.(2) Agreed that (without provision for Exchequer expenditureon British forces in Germany) the upper limit for expenditure on the Armed Forces in 1955 should be 1,550 millions.(3) Agreed that the proposals made in the report of the defence policy Committee (C. (54) 250) should be, taken as a basis for the revision of the defence programmes, of Service and civil Departments and the preparation of; DepartmentalEstimates, on the understanding that Departments should

(54) 250.
