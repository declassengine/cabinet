The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 184) setting out a number of points whichwould need to be settled if the Government should decide to giveeffect to the all-Party motion in favour of an increase in Members&apos;salaries which had been carried by a majority in a free vote in theHouse of Commons on 24th May.The Cabinet were informed that opinion among government supporters both in the House of Commons and in the country was runnin strongly against the proposal for an increase in Members&apos;salaries and that there was every likelihood of a serious split in theParty if the Government were now to proceed with the presentation of a Supplementary Estimate for the payment of such an increase,which was likely to be approved by the votes of Opposition members and of the small group of Government supporters who had voted in favour of the motion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government nowfound themselves in an exceedingly difficult position. It was undoubtedly true that opinion among Government supporters againsta direct increase in Members&apos; salary was much stronger than could have been judged from the views expressed in the earlier debate inthe House of Commons. When speaking on behalf of the Govern-ment in the debate on 24th May he had tried to reflect the general sense of the Cabinefs discussion on the morning of that day, andit was true that he had specifically reserved the right of the Govern-ment to consider the decision of the House. On the other hand, hehad said that the Government regarded this as a House of Commonsmatter and, therefore, one for the collective wisdom of the House,and he would find great difficulty in accepting the view that theGovernment, if they were now to reject a proposal which had beencarried by a majority of 114, would not lay themselves open to the accusation of having broken faith &quot;with the House. The damage which would be inflicted on the Party by putting a direct salaryincrease into effect would no doubt be serious, but the consequences of appearing to have betrayed a decision of the House would, in his view, be far graver. If it should prove possible, even at this latestage, to work out some alternative to a direct salary increase whichwould be broadly acceptable and not expose the Government to thecharge of having broken faith, he would not rule out a departure from the particular course recommended in the motion carried on24th May. His colleagues ought not, however, to be under anyillusion that such an alternative could be devised easily. Opinionamongst Opposition Members had been consistently and strongly against any method of improving Members&apos; remuneration other thana direct salary increase, and this view was shared by the Govern-ment supporters who had supported the all-Party motion.In discussion there was general support for the view that theGovernment were not under any obligation of honour, by reasonof the vote recorded by the House of Commons on 24th May, toimprove the financial position of Members by a direct increase of salary. It was true that the Government had said that this was a house of Commons matter and had invited a free expression ofMembers&apos; views. They had said that they would wish to take theview of the House, and they had allowed that view to be recorded in a free vote. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said nothing in his speech which implied that the Government would be committed to give effect to the view expressed in the division. Indeed, in hisconcluding remarks, he had made it clear that the Government would wish to review the position in the light of the debate. Even theOpposition were not taking it for granted that the Government would now proceed to propose that Members&apos; salaries should be increasedby  500 a year. There was general agreement in the Cabinet thatthe Government were not committed by this vote to adopting theparticular method of improving the financial position of Membersby a direct increase of salary.
In further discussion it was argued that there were in fact strong reasons why the Government should not proceed in this particularway. Five-sixths of their supporters in the House of Commons hadvoted against this proposal, and a large proportion would continueto oppose any increase in Members&apos; salaries. The Governmentcould not hope to have their continued support on other matters ifthey disregarded their views on this question. In the country feeling in the Conservative Party was, if anything, even stronger. There wasno doubt that the mass of the Conservative Party was deeply shockedby the proposal that Members of Parliament should give themselves a 50 per cent, increase of salary at the present time; and there was a real risk that many people now active in the Conservative cause would withdraw their support if the Government went forward with thisproposal. Some Ministers felt that in these circumstances theGovernment should not be guided solely by a majority decision ofthe House of Commons as a whole. They should have regard to the strong views held by a large majority of the Conservative members in the House and to the general state of feeling in the country, Thiswas not a House of Commons matter in any sense which obliged theGovernment to give effect to a majority vote of the House if it rancounter to their own view of what was right and to the general stateof public opinion as reflected in the Press and in the constituencies.It was recalled that in the statement which he had made on14th April on the Report of the Select Committee the Prime minister had said that this was a House of Commons matter on which a wide measure of agreement between the Parties was desirable. It could hardly be said that there was a wide measure of agreement in theHouse on a proposal which had been opposed by five-sixths of theConservative Members. On the other hand, it was recognised thatthe Government could not afford to take no further action in thematter. The proper interpretation of the Commons&apos; vote was, it wassuggested, that something should be done to improve the financialposition of Members but that the improvement need not necessarily take the form of a direct increase in salary. The Government should seek some middle course which would command the widest measureof support from Members of all Parties in the House. In thesecircumstances it was suggested that the Government might now takethe line that they took note of the view recorded by a majority of theHouse as a whole that it was desirable that there should be asubstantial increase in the salaries of Members, that they did notthink that this was an opportune moment at which to bring thisparticular change into effect, but that in the meanwhile they recog-nised the need to relieve some Members who were suffering specialfinancial hardship and they therefore proposed as a temporary measure means of helping Members to meet some of their exceptionalexpenses. In this way the Government might justify the preference,which they had consistently shown throughout the discussions on thissubject, for allowances designed to meet some part of the expensesnecessarily incurred by Members in the performance of their parliamentary duties rather than a direct increase in Parliamentarysalaries. It was pointed out in this connection that amongConservatives in the country there would be more support for asystem of subsistence allowances than for a system of reimburs-ing expenses of all kinds up to a stated limit. It was suggested that,in the interval before Parliament re-assembled after the whitsun recess, every effort should be directed towards finding some means,other than a direct increase of salary, of relieving the special financialhardship which some Members were suffering.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all the schemes of allowances which had so far been canvassed had been found to beopen to objection of some kind, and he feared that no such scheme could be devised which would be generally acceptable to Members.He doubted whether, in particular, the Labour Opposition would support any scheme of this kind. As against this it was pointed out
that in all the discussions which had been held hitherto the opposition had been expressing their preference for a direct increase of salaries.It need not be assumed that they would necessarily reject a schemeof allowances if it was made clear that this was the only offer whichthe Government were prepared to make. If a satisfactory scheme of allowances could be devised, it would be expedient that this shouldbe made the subject of consultations with the Opposition Leadersbefore any public announcement was made. No such consultations should, however, be held until the Cabinet had had an opportunity of considering the scheme and deciding whether it was one which theycould support.In the light of their discussion the Cabinet reviewed again theearlier suggestion that a free vote should be allowed on all the subsequent Parliamentary proceedings on this matter. They agreedthat, at the next stage in these proceedings, the Government must assume responsibility for executive action. It followed that, whenthe Cabinet had decided what course they should pursue, they mustpresent a united front to Parliament. On a matter involving theexecutive responsibility of the Government, members of the Govern-ment could not properly vote in different lobbies. Indeed, if theGovernment could reach agreement on a method of improving thefinancial position of Members otherwise than by a direct increase in salary, it was desirable that they should carry their proposal with thesupport of the Government Whips. It might, however, be difficult toput the Whips on unless a solution could be found which commandedwidespread support among Conservative Members in the House.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;?discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would doubtless explore the possibility of finding some means of improving the financialposition of Members which, while giving effect to the spirit of the vote recorded by the House of Commons on 24th May, would be acceptable to his colleagues in the Cabinet and to the mass of conservative Members in the House. If no such means could befound, the Cabinet would have to look again at the possibility, and probable consequences, of proposing a direct increase in Members&apos;salaries.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd June, 1954.
