1. The Prime Minister said that he was concerned lest furtherAnglo-American misunderstanding should arise from our unwilling-ness to agree that United States naval vessels should be authorisedto stop and search British merchant ships suspected of carrying arms from Communist countries to Guatemala. While he agreed thatBritish ships should not be subjected to search on the high seas by united States warships, he was anxious that we should not appearto be lending support to the Communist cause in Guatemala.The Minister of State said that the United States Governmenthad already been assured of our readiness to give any other help wecould with a view to preventing British subjects or British ships fromassisting in the supply of arms to Guatemala.The Prime Minister said that he would prefer that some publicaction should be taken to check British participation in this traffic.Would it not be possible to arrange for British warships to patrolthese waters with authority to search any British ship suspected ofcarrying arms to Guatemala?The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to consult with the Admiralty,and report to the Prime Minister, whether arrangements could be made for British warships to intercept and searchany British merchant vessel suspected of carrying arms toGuatemala.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 201) covering drafts of a parliamentary statement on a scheme of subsistence allowances for members and of a White Paper setting out the details of the scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchquer said that, while he had preparedthese drafts on the lines desired by the Cabinet, he still preferred his original scheme whereby Members would be enabled to draw fromthe Fees Office, on a monthly or weekly basis, cash reimbursement of their expenses within an annual limit of  250 or  300 withoutcertification of detailed expenditure. All but a handful of Membersalready claimed, on account of expenses necessarily incurred, relief from taxation upon an amount of their salary of this order. Ascheme on these lines would, in his view, be much simpler and more likely to be favoured by Opposition Members and, therefore, to command that wide measure of agreement in the House which theGovernment had declared to be necessary on this matter. Indeed,he did not think there was any real likelihood that a scheme of subsistence allowances would prove acceptable to the Opposition.The Prime Minister said that he shared the Chancellor^ prefer-ence for a scheme of lump sum allowances for expenses and feared that, even if the Opposition should acquiesce in a scheme of subsistence allowances and accept the benefits to be derived from it,Labour supporters would lose no opportunity of attributing responsi-bility for the scheme to the Conservative Party.Discussion showed, however, that the preponderant opinion inthe Cabinet was in favour of a scheme of subsistence allowanceson the general lines set out in the drafts attached to C. (54) 201.While the difference in the net financial benefit to be derived byMembers generally from the two alternative schemes might not be large, there was thought to be an important difference of principle between the two schemes. Thus, a system of lump sum allowances for expenses could be represented as no more than a device for granting a salary increase and would be likely to be widely resentedat a time when the expenses claims of businessmen were beingrigorously examined and pruned by the Department of Inland
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th June, 1954.Revenue. Subsistence allowances, on the other hand, were demons-trably linked with Members&apos; performance of their parliamentary duties, were known to be already payable to those performing publicservice of various kinds and, unlike lump sum allowances for expenses, could be extended later to Peers without difficulty. Apartfrom these considerations, the evidence suggested that a scheme of subsistence allowances would be much less unpopular among Govern-ment supporters, both in Parliament and in the country, than oneof lump sum allowances.At the same time there was support for the view that the pro-posed day allowance of 12s. 6d. was hardly adequate and was likelyto be greeted with derision. The scheme would have a much better chance of acceptance if the day allowance could be increased to  1.It was suggested that this larger sum could be justified by the lengthof time which the majority of Members found it necessary to spendat Westminster during a full sitting day through attendance at meetings of Standing Committees as well as of the House itself. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that it was possible that the InlandRevenue would take the view that a Member could make personalprofit from a day allowance of  1 and would feel obliged to regardsome part of it as cash remuneration liable to tax.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the right course nowwas to seek the views of the Executive Committee of the 1922 Com-mittee on the two alternative schemes which were before the Cabinet,without indicating which the Cabinet were disposed to favour. when their views were known, the Cabinet must make a final choice betweenthe two. Thereafter, the Government should consult the opposition leaders on the proposal which they favoured on the basis that theGovernment would only be willing to present this to Parliament ifthey were assured that it would enjoy the general support of theOpposition, both in Parliament and in the country. It must be made clear to the Opposition leaders that, in the absence of such an assurance, the Government must reluctantly conclude that no stepsto improve Members&apos; remuneration could be taken at the presenttime.There was general support in the Cabinet for the course of action proposed by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theviews of the Executive Committee of the 1922 Committeeto be obtained on the alternative means of improving the remuneration of Members, through a scheme either of subsistence allowances or of cash reimbursement ofMembers&apos; expenses.(2) Agreed that the Cabinet should make a final choice betweenthe two alternative schemes in the light of the views expressed by the Executive Committee of the 1922Committee.(3) Agreed that Opposition leaders should thereafter be con-suited on the scheme adopted on the basis that theGovernment would be ready to present it to Parliamentonly if it were assured of the general support of theOpposition.
