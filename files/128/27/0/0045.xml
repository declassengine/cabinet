East/West 1.   The President of the Board of Trade recalled that on trade. 22nd June the Cabinet had authorised him to oppose the American(Previous        suggestion that the approved relaxations of existing restrictions on reference:      trade with countries in the Soviet bloc should not be brought intoC.C. (54) 43rd   operation until the situation in Indo-China became clearer.  He had conclusions,    now heard from H.M. Ambassador in Washington that the PrimeMinute 4.)       Minister and the Foreign Secretary wished him to visit washington to discuss this question with Mr. Stassen during the coming week-end.He himself felt some doubt whether it was wise that he should resumediscussion of this subject in Washington without having had theopportunity to consult the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary,whose recent discussions with President Eisenhower and Mr. Dullesmight well have affected our attitude towards the question of East/West trade and, in particular, the extent to which we should still wishto maintain our pressure for the introduction of the agreed relaxation-tions.   It would certainly be helpful if he could meet Mr. Stassenbefore the next meeting of the Consultative Group; but, as this had now been postponed until 19th July, there would be time to arrangehis visit to Washington after the return of the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary.In discussion there was general support for the view expressedby the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to the views of the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary, it seemed preferable that thePresident of the Board of Trade should defer his departurefor Washington&apos; to discuss East/West trade withMr. Stassen until after the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary had returned to London.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange fortheir views to be conveyed to H.M. Ambassador in washington so that the Prime Minister might take them into account before finally deciding whether the Presidentof the Board of Trade should proceed at once to washington.Aden. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the threat to the Colonial Secretary (C. (54) 212) reporting that the security of theSecurity of Aden Protectorate was threatened by an increasing number of frontierthe Aden incidents and seeking the Cabinefs approval for measures to deterProtectorate. raiders from Yemen territory.The Colonial Secretary said that the Imam of the Yemen had long maintained an ill-founded claim to the whole territory of theColony and Protectorate of Aden. In recent months he had intensi-fied his efforts to stir up trouble in the western area of the Protec-torate by supporting the activities of rebels against loyal Chiefs.The number of incidents was increasing and these were clearly apart of a sustained campaign to undermine our authority. Theground forces available to the Governor were insufficient to deal withthe situation, and plans were already under consideration to raiseadditional local levies and to provide them with more arms andequipment. It would, however, be several months before these measures could contribute to improving the frontier situation.Meanwhile, friendly tribes in the Protectorate were becoming increasingly concerned that we should take more vigorous measures for Kheir protection, and the local situation was deteriorating. he therefore sought the Cabinefs authority to warn the Yemen Govern-ment that any further acts of aggression would be met by air actionagainst the bases within Yemen territory from which the raiderscame.46555b 2
The Minister of Defence said that he supported firm and promp action to prevent further deterioration of the situation. bombing operations after due warning were likely to be effective without causing loss of life and, unless vigorous steps were now taken, we might later on find ourselves obliged to maintain a greater military effort over a long period. He was particularly concerned that weshould avoid any further commitment of British ground forces inthis area.The Minister of State reminded the Cabinet that Yemen was amember of the United Nations and that any military action takenacross the frontier could be held to be an act of aggression of whichthe Security Council would be bound to take cognizance. It wouldbe open to us to claim that such action had been taken in self-defence,but in that event we ought to report the matter to the security council and it would be expedient that we should prepare the way for this by giving due warning to the Yemen Government and by securing full publicity for the incursions which were taking place from Yemen territory. It must be assumed that, if we did not reportthe situation to the Security Council, the Yemen would lodge a com-plaint with the Council if we took the military action proposed. in either event there would be serious repercussions on our relationswith Egypt and the Arab States. He had already asked the YemenMinister in London to convey a protest to his Government and had asked for a reply by the end of the week.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a strongly-wordednote of protest to be sent to the Yemen government regarding the raids which had been taking place fromYemen territory into the frontier areas of the aden protectorate, and to consider whether the terms of this note should not be made public.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of State totake steps to ensure that full publicity was given to theincursions which were being made into the Aden Protec-torate from Yemen territory.(3) Invited the Minister of State to circulate a memorandumon the probable international effects of the course ofaction proposed in C. (54) 212.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform thePrime Minister of the substance of the Cabinefs dis-cussion on this question; and agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting in the following week.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth and Colonial Secretaries (C. (54) 193) on the transferof the Cocos Islands to Australia.The Colonial Secretary said that the proposal to transfer the islands to Australia had been announced by the previous Govern-ment in 1951. Discussions had since been proceeding with theAustralian Government regarding the method by which the transfershould be effected. To meet the Australian Governments anxiety to avoid embarrassing public discussion about their &quot; whiteAustralia &quot; policy, the possibility had been considered of carryingout the transfer by an Order in Council; but it had been found thatthe transfer could not be effected in that way without extending the mainland of Australia to include the Cocos Islands. This was not acceptable to the Australian Government because it would give theIslanders rights of unrestricted entry into Australia. The conclusionhad therefore been reached that legislation by the United kingdom parliament was inevitable, and it was now proposed that a short
Reorganisation 4. The Lord Privy Seal said that since the Cabinefs meetingof the on 29th June he had given further thought to the timing of theRailways.       Parliamentary proceedings on the Governments proposals for the(Previous        reorganisation of the railways. He did not see how any government reference:      time could be found for these before the summer recess.  It wouldC.C. (54) 44th   be wasteful to defer the final stages of Bills on which much time had conclusions,    already been spent; and it was hardly practicable at this stage of minute 4.)       the summer to plan on the basis of asking the House to sit intoAugust. In these circumstances he could only suggest that the white paper should be published at once in the hope that, if the labour opposition wished to have it discussed before the recess, they wouldbe willing that one of their Supply Days should be used for thispurpose.The Minister of Transport said that it would be more difficultto secure acceptance of his proposals if a long interval elapsedbetween the publication of the White Paper and the parliamentary proceedings on it. On the other hand, if he now delayed publication,he would risk disrupting the harmonious agreement which had beenreached among the various railway interests. It would therefore be convenient if it could be known, before the White Paper was pub-lished, whether the Opposition would be willing to have it debatedon one of their Supply Days before the recess.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Whip to make discreet enquiries with aview to ascertaining whether the Opposition would be willing to make time available on Supply Days for thediscussion of this and other urgent business for which government time could not be found before the summer recess.enabling Bill should be introduced during the next session. If theCabinet agreed, he would seek the agreement of the australian government that a statement should be made on the occasion ofthe transfer explaining how the future status of the Islanders wouldbe safeguarded. Assurances had already been given privately bythe Australians that the Islanders would enjoy rights of entry toAustralia on a &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; footing; and arrangements had been made with the Singapore Government to preserve theexisting rights of the Islanders to enter the Colony.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be necessary in the enabling Bill to recite therequest of the Australian Government for the transferof the Islands.(b) The Admiralty and the Air Ministry should be kept in touchwith the progress of the arrangements for the transferin view of their continuing interest in the maintenanceof the wireless station and the air strip on the Islands.(c) The timing of the introduction of the proposed enabling bill would require further consideration.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to further consultation with theAustralian Government, the transfer of the Cocos Islandsto Australia should be effected by the passage of anenabling Bill in the United Kingdom Parliament.(2) Took note that the Colonial Secretary would seek the agree-ment of the Australian Government that the assuranceswhich they had given regarding the future status of theIslanders could be made public during the parliamentary proceedings on this Bill.
Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:CC. (54) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. Ther Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had written to the Leader of the Opposition in the terms approved by the Cabineton 29th June. Mr. Attlee had now replied that, while he would beprepared to meet Ministers to hear any proposals which they might wish to put forward; it would be difficult for him to enter into discussions on a proposal contrary to the decision of the House ofCommons.The Chancellor said that he would now arrange to see Mr. Attlee, in company with the Lord Privy Seal and the chief whip. Their main purpose would be to invite his views and, in viewof the terms of his letter, they would not at this stage give him any detailed information about the proposed scheme of subsistenceallowances. As regards the decision of the House of Commons, theywould say that the opinion of the House was on record; it was not for the Government to reaffirm it; and they could not accept any commitment to give effect to it.The Cabinet agreed that the forthcoming discussion with the leader of the Opposition should be handled on the general lines indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, togetherwith the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, would take an early opportunity of discussing the question of Members&apos;Expenses with the Leader of the Opposition on the lines which had been indicated to the Cabinet.Crichel Down.(previous reference:CC. (54) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was discussing with the Ministers directly concerned, and some of his other colleagues, the handling of the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on the Crichel Down Inquiry. Meanwhile, there was one particular point on which he sought an immediate decision from theCabinet.In the statement which he had made in the House of commons on 15th June on the publication of the Report, the Minister of Agri-culture had said that, in view of the nature of the errors made andof the public way in which they had been exposed, he was satisfiedthat it was not necessary for him to take any further action in relationto the officials whose conduct had been criticised in the Report. TheMinister did, however, think it necessary that some of these officials should be transferred to other posts in the Civil Service and that heshould announce this in the forthcoming debate. There was little prospect that public opinion, as reflected in the House of Commons,would be satisfied unless some such transfers were made. On theother hand, the Ministers with whom this had been discussed agreedthat this action would not be consistent with the statement made bythe Minister on 15th June; and they were informed that such a step would be ill-received in the Civil Service if it were thought that theMinister had reversed his earlier decision in response to publicclamour. In these circumstances it was now proposed that a small committee should be appointed, not to review the Ministers decisionon the disciplinary question, but to consider whether, in order tomaintain public confidence in the administration of the department and to ensure the efficiency of the public service, it would be reason-able that any of the officers concerned should be transferred to otherposts in the Civil Service. This Committee would be asked to submit their recommendations before the forthcoming debate, and theappointment of the Committee would not be disclosed until their
findings were announced at the opening of the debate. It was pro-posed that the Committee should consist of Sir Thomas Barnes(formerly Treasury Solicitor), Sir John Woods (formerly Secretary ofthe Board of Trade and now a Director of English Electric CompanyLimited) and Sir Harry Pilkington (President of the Federation ofBritish Industries). This proposal had the full support of the Ministerof Agriculture and also of the Home Secretary, who had preside over the Cabinet Committee on Crichel Down and would be speakingon the Governments behalf in the forthcoming debate.The Chancellor added that this proposed Committee should beappointed by the Prime Minister if only because one of the officials concerned had been appointed by the Crown on the Prime Ministersrecommendation. If, however, the Committees work was to be com-pleted before the forthcoming debate, it must be begun at once in anticipation of the Prime Ministers approval.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the holding of a limited inquiry on the lines suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer and for the suggested composition ofthe proposed Committee of Inquiry.The Minister of Agriculture asked the Cabinet to considerwhether this Committee should also be invited to advise whether, inthe light of the disclosures made in the Report of the Crichel DownInquiry, the Commissioners of Crown Lands should continue to employ Messrs. Sanctuary and Sons as their local agents. TheMinister said that he would welcome independent advice on thisquestion; but, if the Committee were to undertake this further task,they would need to be strengthened by the addition of a leading landagent.It was the view of the Cabinet that this inquiry should be restricted to the conduct of the civil servants criticised in the Report.It should be left to the Minister to determine, in the light of the factsdisclosed in the Report, whether the Commissioners of Crown Landsshould continue to employ Messrs. Sanctuary and Sons as theiragents.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals outlined by the Chancellor of theExchequer for the appointment of a small Committee toadvise Ministers on the question whether any of the officials criticised in the Report of the Crichel DownInquiry should be transferred to other posts in the CivilService.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthis Committee to start its inquiry at once, so that itsfindings might be announced at the opening of the forth-coming debate on Crichel Down in the House ofCommons; and invited him to seek the Prime Ministerscovering approval for the appointment of the Committee.(3) Agreed that it should be left to the Minister of Agriculture todetermine, in the light of the facts disclosed in the Reportof the Crichel Down Inquiry, whether the commissioners of Crown Lands should continue to employ Messrs.Sanctuary and Sons as their local agents.7. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Report Stage of the Finance Bill would be opened on 7th July, and it was hoped that it might be concluded by 9 p.m. onthe following day.
8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (C. (54) 208) on the attitude to be adopted by the UnitedKingdom Government towards a draft Convention on the peaceful settlement of Disputes which was under discussion by the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe.The Minister of State recommended that the United KingdomGovernment should accept Chapter I of the draft Convention, which provided for the compulsory reference of legal disputes to the Inter-national Court. Chapter II provided for the submission of non-legaldisputes to a Conciliation Commission; and this also could beaccepted if disputes affecting Colonial and dependent territories were excluded from its operation. Chapter III, which provided for com-pulsory arbitration on non-legal disputes, was more difficult; and theobjections to our accepting it as it now stood were summarised inparagraph 9 of C. (54) 208. The alternatives open to us were eitherto reject this Chapter, or to seek to incorporate in it such additionalsafeguards as would enable us to accept it in an amended form. TheMinister of State recommended that we should follow the second course and he had indicated, in paragraph 11 of C. (54) 208, theadditional safeguards which might be proposed. If we failed tosecure acceptance of these, we should decline to accept this Chapterof the Convention.The Cabinet were informed that the Commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary would strongly object to the acceptanceof Chapter III in the draft Convention unless it contained theadditional safeguards set out in paragraph 11 of C. (54) 208.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out in paragraph 13 ofC. (54) 208 regarding the attitude to be adopted by theUnited Kingdom Government in discussions in the Com-mittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the draftConvention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st July, 1954.Council ofEurope.(previous reference:C.C.
