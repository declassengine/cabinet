s ^legislative programme:1954-55Session.(previous reference:CC. (54) 7.1stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (54) 340) submitting the recommendations of theCommittee which had reviewed the legislation to be undertaken inthe forthcoming Session of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that his Committee were satisfied thatit would not be practicable to dispense with any of the Bills listed in paragraph 2 of his memorandum. Several of these were suitablefor introduction in the House of Lords, and it would be open to theGovernment not to proceed with them subsequently in the Houseof Commons if it became clear that they had little prospect of passinginto law. The Committee recommended the exclusion from theprogramme of the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill and of certain features of the Sugar Industry Bill, which would be likely to provokeacute controversy in Parliament.The following points were made in discussion:-(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed withthe Committee&apos;s view that the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill shouldbe omitted from the programme and that The Queen&apos;s Speech onthe Opening of Parliament should contain a reference to this subject on the general lines suggested in paragraph 23 of the draft Speechannexed to his memorandum C. (54) 342. This involved abandoning the declared intention to pass this Bill before the end of the present financial year, and an immediate loss of about  3 millions to theExchequer. On the other hand, there were sound reasons forcontending that the right solution was to invite representatives ofthe local authorities and the teachers to negotiate with the responsible ministers a completely new pensions scheme for teachers on a contributory basis. These negotiations would, however, be difficult and it should not be assumed that it would be possible to arrive ata solution which would be both acceptable to the teachers andtolerable to the Exchequer.(b) The Foreign Secretary said that he might find it necessaryto seek approval for the introduction of legislation in pursuance ofthe Agreements recently reached in respect of the future of Germany.The Cabinet (1) Approved the inclusion of the Bills listed in paragraph 2 ofC. (54) 340 in the Legislative Programme for theforthcoming Session.(2) Authorised the preparation of the Bills listed in paragraph 3of C. (54) 340.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (54) 342) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.The following points were raised in discussion of this draft:  (a) The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 6 should be omitted.(b) The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to seeparagraph 10 amended to read &quot; . . . . will so develop the unity and strength of the free nations that the essential basis will beestablished on which an understanding with the East may be sought.&quot;47119-3 B 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.
After discussion it was agreed that, in order to make it clear thatthis paragraph was concerned with Europe, it should be combined with paragraph 9 and that, in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s alternativewording &quot; the Soviet Union &quot; should be substituted for &quot; the East.&quot;(c) It was suggested that the last sentence of paragraph 11, evenif the words &quot; and training &quot; were omitted, would expose theGovernment to demands for a full explanation of the changes whichthey contemplated in the organisation of the Forces and civil defence Services to meet the conditions of nuclear warfare.(Previous The Cabinet were reminded that they had approved the insertionReference: of a passage on these lines in the draft Speech in order that certainC.C. (54) 75th proposed changes in Army organisation the reduction of theConclusions, strength of Anti-Aircraft Command and the disbandment of certainMinute 3.) units might be announced in the course of the Debate on the address.The view was expressed that it would be easier to justify these changes in Army organisation against the background of a full statement of the Governments defence policy as a whole, and thatthe time had come when the Government should make such astatement to Parliament.On the other hand it was argued that a general statement of thiskind would provoke many questions which could not readily be answered at the present time, and that on this account it would be undesirable to encourage wider discussion on defence policy inadvance of the presentation of the annual Statement on Defence inFebruary.In discussion it was suggested that, if the last sentence ofparagraph 11 were made less specific and the closing words were confined to the statement that &quot; at home a strategic reserve will be developed and necessary measures taken to meet possible new formsof warfare,&quot; it would be left open to Ministers to decide at a later stage how far they should go in explaining their defence policy duringthe Debate on the Address.This suggestion was approved.The Secretary of State for Air said that he did not regard thesecond sentence of this paragraph as committing the Governmentto maintain the present unit strength of the Royal Air Force on the mainland of Europe.(d) The Minister of Housing said that he wished to proposerevised versions of paragraphs 18 and 19.(e) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Ministers had yet to consider the nature and scope of the expanded programme of road construction and improvement foreshadowed in paragraph 20. Inthe circumstances this paragraph appeared to be in suitably general terms.(/) The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 33 should be omitted.In the course of the discussion various detailed amendments to the draft Speech were also suggested and adopted.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary to prepare a revised version of thedraft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliamentannexed to C. (54) 342, incorporating the amendments notedabove and the drafting amendments approved in the courseof the discussion.
House ofCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous reference:GC. (53) 49thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet were informed that the Boundary Commissionsappointed under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)Act, 1949, had submitted reports on their first periodical review ofParliamentary constituencies. The Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland were required, by the terms of theAct, to present the Commissions&apos; reports to Parliament togetherwith draft Orders in Council giving effect to their recommendations.They proposed to give notice of presentation of these documents on18th November, with a view to publication on the following day.The Leader of the Opposition had expressed concern about the commissions&apos; recommendations and had asked for an opportunityto discuss them with the Prime Minister.The Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister should explain to the leader of the Opposition that the Government had no discretion inthis matter and had no alternative but to present the Commissions&apos;recommendations to Parliament together with drafts of the orders in Council necessary to give effect to them.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to present to Parliament the reports of the boundary Commissions and draft Orders in Councilgiving effect to their recommendations.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would see the leader of the Opposition and explain to him that theGovernment had no discretion but to proceed inaccordance with the requirements of the Act.Pensions for 4.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, in accordance with theOld Age and Cabinefs decision of 11th November, he had considered whatWar Disability, arrangements could be made to complete the Parliamentary(Previous proceedings on- the National Insurance Bill before the ChristmasReference: recess. If the Report of the Phillips Committee were signed byC.C. (54) 75th 26th November, it could be published by 3rd December. In that conclusions, event, with the necessary intervals between its various stages, the BillMinute 2.)       might be passed through the House of Commons by 14th December.The proceedings in the House of Lords might then be completed intime for Royal Assent to be given on 22nd December. It waspossible, however, that the Committee&apos;s Report might not beavailable until 3rd December; and it could not then be publishedbefore 10th December. In that event it might not be possible todo more than pass the Bill through all its stages in the House ofCommons before Christmas.The Lord President said that, on the less favourable of these assumptions, it still might be possible to induce the Opposition inthe House of Lords to agree to pass the Bill through all its stages intwo days and to sit for that purpose on 24th December, as analternative to holding special sittings of the House immediately after christmas.The Cabinet Took note of these statements, and agreed that every effort should continue to be made to pass the National insurance bill into law before the Christmas recess.
