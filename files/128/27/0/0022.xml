farliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet agreed that the Committee stage of the TelevisionBill would have to be taken on the floor of the House. They invited the Lord Privy Seal to inform the Leaders of the Oppositionaccordingly, and to explore with them the possibility of securing agreement between the Parties on a time-table for the Committeeand remaining stages of the Bill.Jordan. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that a serious situation was(Previous       developing as a result of the latest incident on the Jordan-IsraelReference:      frontier. The Israeli Government had now declared their intentionC.C.(54)4th    of withdrawing their representatives from the Mixed ArmisticeConclusions,    Commission. It would not, he thought, be profitable to seek a minute 5.)      solution in the United Nations or in tripartite discussions betweenFrontier Dispute the United States, France and the United Kingdom,   The Unitedwith Israel.      Kingdom Government might, however, take an independent initiative,&apos;in view of their specially close ties with both Israel and Jordan. Hewas therefore proposing to suggest to the Ambassadors of both countries that secret conversations should be held in London between representatives of their Governments and of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.   The scope of these conversations would be limited to theproblem of avoiding continuing friction on the Jordan-Israelfrontier.The Cabinet Approved the initiative which the Foreign secretary proposed to take with a view to promoting discussions between the two Governments on the problem of avertingdisorder on the Jordan-Israel frontier.East/West 3.   The Prime Minister said that he had received a personalTrade. message from President Eisenhower in answer to our proposals for(Previous       relaxation of the existing controls over trade with countries in the reference:      Soviet bloc.   The President had indicated that, while the UnitedCC. (54) llth   States Government were prepared to go some way in contracting and conclusions,    simplifying these controls, he felt that the United Kingdom proposalsMinute 7.)      went further than public and Congressional opinion in the UnitedStates would be able to accept.  In particular, he considered thatthe controls should continue to extend to equipment and materials which were of high value to the Soviet war potential, and that quanti-tative restrictions should be retained as part of the mechanismof control.  He had suggested that British, American and french officials should meet together soon and try to arrive at agreed proposals which could be submitted to the Paris Group. The PrimeMinister said that he intended to accept this suggestion for an early meeting and to ask the President to indicate in advance whatvariations the Americans would like to see made in the proposalswhich we had put to them.The Foreign Secretary said that it was possible that, when thePresident had received this reply, he would arrange for Mr. Stassento attend these official conversations. It would be useful if an early opportunity could be taken to make it clear publicly that the relaxation-tions which we were proposing concerned only the countries in theSoviet bloc and were not intended to apply to trade with communist china.The Cabinet j:, i,i ...      Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary.45938 B 2
Raw Materfafe.(Previous-Reference:CC (54) 1WJConclusions,Minute3.)Newsprint4. The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to theadvantages which would follow if the existing restrictions on the useof newsprint by newspapers could be discontinued.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had already considered this question. The balance ofpayments prospects of the sterling area were not so favourable that. he could contemplate complete withdrawal of the restrictions on theimport of newsprint, especially as this would provoke demands for similar concessions for other pulp, paper- and board products. Hehad, however, suggested to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterthat some additional imports of Canadian newsprint should now beallowed in order to increase the existing stocks and enable consump-tion to be maintained at the present level. He was prepared to allow an additional 25;000 tons of newsprint from Canada this year and,if it was found necessary in order to obtain these 25,000 tons, toauthorise contracts for 50,000 tons for each of the next four years on the following conditions:  (i) We should consider in the autumn whether there should bean increase of total imports of newsprint next year, or whether theadditional Canadian purchases should be offset by a reduction inpurchases from Scandinavia.(ii) The newspapers should give an undertaking that they would for the time being continue to accept the present allocation scheme.- (iii) This arrangement should be final, subject to the review inthe autumn, unless there was such strong public pressure that it became necessary to re-open the question.The Chancellor added that the first of these conditions was of concern to other Ministers, especially the President of the Board ofTrade. He therefore intended to provide an opportunity for further discussion at the meeting of the Economic Policy Committee on thefollowing day.The Cabinet-Took note that the Economic Policy Committee would discuss the question of imports of newsprint at their meetingon the following day, and that the conclusions reached bythe Committee would be reported to the Prime Minister.Electoral 5.  xhe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeReform. Secretary (C. (54) 110) regarding the line to be taken by the Govern-(Previous ment spokesman in the forthcoming debate on 26th March on the reference: Second Reading of the Representation of the People (St. Albans)C.C.(53)6tli Bill, a Private Member&apos;s Bill introduced by Mr. J. Grimston, M.P.Conclusions, This Bill provided that for a period of ten years any Parlia-Minute 2.) mentary elections in the St. Albans constituency should be conductedAlternative under the alternative vote system if there were more than two candi-Vote. dates.  It was proposed in the memorandum that the Governmentshould try to avoid any public indication of their attitude towardsthe Bill; but that, if this could not be avoided, the government spokesman should argue that the proposal was of such constitutionalsignificance that it could not properly be tried out in a single con-stituency on the basis of a Private Member&apos;s Bill, and that an experiment on so small a scale would provide no useful information about the merits of the alternative vote system.-      .       The Cabinet-Agreed that, if in debate in the House of Commons on26th March it became necessary for the Government toindicate their attitude towards the Representation of the,   . People (St. Albans) Bill, a statement might be made onbehalf of die Government in the terms outlined inparagraph 4 of C. (547 110.

(54) 107) reporting the results ofhis further discussions about the re-organisation of regional offices in Cambridge and Reading.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reluctantlycome to the conclusion that he must abandon his original proposal that all regional offices in Cambridge and Reading should be closed.He hoped, however, that individual Departments would continueto pursue economies by closing regional offices, or reducing their functions, wherever this could be done without serious prejudice to their own efficiency or the work of other Departments. he recommonded that the staffs concerned in Cambridge and Readingshould now be informed accordingly.The Cabinet-Took note of the conclusions reached by the Chancellorof the  Exchequer regarding  the  regional  offices  ofGovernment Departments in Cambridge and Reading.  &apos;Japan.(previous reference:CC.(54)8thConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C.
