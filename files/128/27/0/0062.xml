1. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet on the positionreached in the discussions at the Nine-Power Conference now proceeding in London.The Foreign Secretary said that at the present stage of theConference it was most important that we should do everything wecould to make it easier for Dr. Adenauer to secure the support ofGerman public opinion for any settlement on which agreement mightbe reached. It was possible that the French Governmentwould try to insist that their participation in a general settlement must be conditional on a prior solution of theproblem of the Saar. He, therefore, proposed to tellM. Mendes-France privately that, if the French Governmentwere to do this, we should feel unable to adhere to the offer we had made about the maintenance of British forces on the Continent ofEurope. It would, of course, remain open to the French Governmentto try to reach agreement with the Federal German government about the Saar separately from any general European settlement.The Foreign Secretary said that, if agreement were reached atthe present Conference, it would then be necessary to arrange a fullmeeting of the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.). If the present momentum was to be maintained, thismeeting should be held in Paris during the third week of October,which would involve his leaving London early on 20th October. Inthese circumstances a debate in the House of Commons on foreignaffairs could not be held until the following week, although he could,if necessary, make a statement in the House on 19th October. TheUnited Kingdom Government would become no more committed asa result of the meeting of the N.A.T.O. Council than they would be asa result of a successful outcome to the present Conference. Thesettlement as a whole would in any case remain subject to parliamentary approval in due course.The Lord Privy Seal said that the state of legislative business would make the fourth week of October more convenient than thethird for a debate on foreign affairs, which might be expected to last for at least two days.The Minister of Housing said that there were already signs thatthe Labour Party would take the line publicly that the commitmentwe had entered into to retain forces of a certain size on the Continentwould preclude any reduction in the length of the period of NationalService, and the Government must be ready to deal effectively withthis accusation.The Prime Minister said that he felt sure the Cabinet would wishto record their satisfaction at the progress so far achieved at theLondon Conference, and their best wishes to the Foreign Secretary forits successful conclusion.The Cabinet Took note with approval of these statements.2. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet on theposition reached in his discussions with Mr. Dulles about theproposal that the question of Quemoy should be brought before theSecurity Council.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad now agreed that the proposed initiative in this matter should betaken by the New Zealand Government and that they should do so,
Roman Temple 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thein the City of Minister of Works (C. (54) 301) about the possibility of preservingLondon. the remains of the Temple of Mithras recently discovered on the(Previous        Bucklersbury House site, Walbrook.Reference:C.C. (54) 61st The Minister of Works said that, while the discovery of these conclusions, Roman remains continued to arouse much public interest, the weightMinute 6.) of the agitation in favour of preserving them had been reduced bythe representations made on behalf of the claims of other ancient monuments. His own advisers were of the opinion that any additional money which could be made available for the preservation of ancient monuments could be put to uses better than thepreservation of this Temple. The Chairman of the property company which owned the site had now offered to re-erect the Mitbraeum atground level on a site adjoining Queen Victoria Street and to bear the cost of doing so, which was estimated at about  10,000. it seemed unlikely that the remains of the Temple would greatlyattract visitors if they were preserved in situ in the basement of an office building; whereas, if they were transferred to the site adjoiningQueen Victoria Street, they would be in the open and visible topassers-by. The owner&apos;s offer was a generous one and he recommonded that it should be accepted. He proposed that heshould continue to lend his support to the Roman and MedievalLondon Excavation Council in their aim of investigating otherexposed sites in London where ancient monuments might be found.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that the offer madeby the owner of the Bucklersbury House site to transfer the remains of the Mithraeum and preserve it on an open site adjoining QueenVictoria Street should be accepted, and that an expression of theGovernments appreciation should be conveyed to the owner. Whilethe aims of the London Excavation Council were meritorious, it was felt to be inexpedient that the Government should take any further measures of a special nature to promote their activities.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Works to accept the offer of the owner of the Bucklersbury House site to transfer the remains ofthe Mithraeum to an open site at ground level adjoiningQueen Victoria Street.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would write to the owneiof the site expressing the Governments appreciation ofthe contribution which he was making towards thepreservation of the remains of this Roman Temple.not under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, but under chapter VI, which concerned the investigation of situations likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. Theywere at present awaiting a final indication of the New zealand governments willingness to act, and when this was forthcoming theway would be clear for action which it was hoped would lead to some measure of neutralisation in an area where there was at present a grave, risk of armed conflict.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.
industrial disputes.Docks.(previous reference:CC. (54) 61stConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Minister of Labour said that more extensive strike action had now been taken affecting maintenance men in certainLondon docks. If the strike were declared to be official by the electrical Trades Union, it would inevitably result in a yet widercessation of work. At present work on the repair of ships was notbeing seriously impeded, and he was satisfied that it would be premature for his Department to take any initiative to promote asettlement.Strike action had also been taken by stevedores engaged insorting incoming shipments of meat. Members of the Transport andGeneral Workers Union, which had negotiated a settlement of thematter in dispute, were affected as they worked in mixed gangs with members of the Stevedores&apos; Union. The employers were willing tonegotiate with that Union provided those on strike first returned towork; but, while the present ban on overtime was maintained, theywere unwilling to accede to the Union&apos;s demand that negotiations should only be resumed on the basis that they would cover all outstanding issues between the two sides. The Ministry of Foodwere satisfied that supplies of meat were adequate and, pending asettlement of the dispute, incoming cargoes were being held, where necessary, in cold storage aboard ship.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.ifi cabinet Office, S.W.1.1st October, 1954.
