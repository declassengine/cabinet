3 CC. 74 (54).Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 16th November the House would debate an opposition motion censuring the Government for failure to increase the rates of old-age pension. The Prime Minister undertook to discuss with theLord Privy Seal who should be the second Government spokesmanin this debate, in addition to the Minister of Pensions. The lord privy Seal undertook to prepare, in consultation with the Minister ofPensions, and to submit for the Prime Ministers approval, the draftof a Government amendment to this motion.The proposed debate on Germany would be held on 17th and18th November. On the first day of the debate the Foreign secretary and the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would speak for the Government. On the second day theMinister of Defence would open and the Foreign Secretary would speak again in reply to the debate.Rabbits. 2.   The Minister of Agriculture said that on the CommitteeMyxomatosis. Stage of the Pests Bill in the House of Commons that afternoon anew clause would be moved to make it an offence knowingly to spread myxomatosis among rabbits not previously infected by the disease. Hitherto, on the recommendation of an Advisory Committeewhich he had appointed to consider the problem, he had deprecatedthe proposal that it should be made a criminal offence to spread thisdisease. A statutory prohibition of this kind would be difficult toenforce: it would also be ineffective, as the disease had by nowspread over the greater part of the country. On the other hand, theproposed new clause was likely to command a substantial body of support on both sides of the House, and it might well be carried evenif the Government advised the House to reject it. It was possible thatthe proposal might not be pressed if the Government indicated theirsympathy with its objects and their readiness to introduce legislation at a later stage if they obtained positive evidence that active steps were being taken to spread the disease.In discussion it was argued that public opinion throughout thecountry was strongly opposed to the deliberate spreading of thisdisease and would welcome a statutory prohibition of the practice,even though it could not be uniformly enforced. It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Government would be well advised tobow to public opinion on this matter.The Cabinet Agreed that, on the Committee Stage of the Pests Bill inthe House of Commons that afternoon, the Minister ofAgriculture should accept the proposed new clause making it an offence knowingly to spread myxomatosis amongrabbits.Agricultural 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Court of Appeal hadLand Tribunals, now reversed the ruling given by the High Court, in Woollett v.(Previous        Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, on the constitution ofReference:      Agricultural Land Tribunals.C C (54^ 57 th.Conclusions ^he Minister of Agriculture said that this decision of the CourtMinute 9) &apos; D^ Appeal removed the doubts which the original judgment hadthrown on the validity of all decisions taken by these Tribunals since1947. Now that the legal issue had been determined he was considering whether any concession could properly be made on the merits of the particular case. He recognised the need for a speedydecision on this point.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Agriculture.47262-1 r 9
So ^Air Journeys 4.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lordby Royal of the Admiralty (C. (54) 334) proposing changes in the arrangementsFamily. for escorting aircraft carrying members of the Royal Family on longflights over the sea.It was explained that on these occasions, in addition to the airescort provided by the Royal Air Force, warships were also postedalong the route of the flight. In practice, however, the Royal aircraft was often obliged to depart from its intended course at short notice on account of weather conditions; and this made it unlikely thatthe warships would be able to give effective assistance if need arose.Subject to The Queen&apos;s pleasure, it was proposed that naval escortsshould be provided in future only for flights by the Sovereign.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the proposal made by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposal in. C. (54) 334 that naval escortsshould be provided in future only for flights by the sovereign.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to take Her Majesty&apos;pleasure on this recommendation.Army andAir Force Acts.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 30thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the secretaries of State for War and Air (C. (54) 333) commenting onthe recommendations made by a Select Committee of the House ofCommons in favour of amending the form of the Army and AirForce Acts.The Secretary of State for War said that this reform had beenconsidered by a series of Select Committees since 1952. The final report had recommended that this legislation should in future beintroduced in a form which would allow of its renewal annually, overa period of five years, by Order in Council after Resolutions in each house. It was also recommended that, at the end of eachquinquennial period, the need for revision of the current Acts should again be examined by a Select Committee, unless Parliament decidedotherwise at the time. The report had advocated a number of changes in the present law governing the Army and the Air Force:the most important of these were indicated in the Appendix toC. (54) 333. The Secretary of State for Air shared his view that thesubstance of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations should beaccepted and, if the Cabinet agreed, he proposed to make a statement to this effect in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The passage of legislation in the amended form recommendedby the Select Committee would have the effect of broadening the definition of mutiny. In particular, it would become an offence for two or more members of H.M. Forces to resist authority orto impede the performance of a duty or service, not only in ourown Forces, but also in Allied Forces co-operating with them.(b) In indicating the Governments acceptance of the substance of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations, care should be takento avoid any definite commitment to implement any recommendationwhich purported to bind a future Parliament to appoint a SelectCommittee to review this legislation after the end of a prescribed period.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Army and Air Force Acts should be revisedon the general lines proposed in the report of the SelectCommittee and summarised in C. (54) 333; and took note
that provision had been made in the legislative programme for the introduction early in the new sessionof the three Bills required for this purpose.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War, when announcing the Governmenfs attitude towards the report of theSelect Committee, to bear in mind the point noted inparagraph (b) above.Uganda 6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ColonialProtectorate. Secretary (C. (54) 336 and 338) on the Kabaka&apos;s exclusion from(Previous Uganda and on future constitutional developments in the BugandaReference: Province. In C. (54) 336 the Colonial Secretary analysed the effectC.C. (54) 73rd of the recent judgment by the Chief Justice of Uganda. The courtConclusions, had found that the Kabaka had shown disloyalty and that the united minute 4.) Kingdom Government had therefore been justified in deposing him,but it had held that the Government had no power to proceed against him under Article 6 of the Agreement and had therefore acted in breach of that Agreement. In view of the importance which theGovernment had always attached to the scrupulous observance of theAgreement the Colonial Secretary was satisfied that, in the light ofthis judgment, it would be difficult to defend the continued exclusion of the Kabaka from Uganda. Moreover, his continued exclusionwould certainly prejudice the prospects of securing acceptance ofthe recommendations of the recent Constitutional Conference, atwhich the leaders of the Baganda had agreed to support a schemefor enabling their people to participate in the government of the protectorate. It was an essential feature of this scheme that the kabaka would become a constitutional ruler and the administrationof Buganda would be assumed by Ministers in his name; and itwas unlikely that this plan would continue to be acceptable to theBaganda if they were precluded from choosing Mutesa as theirKabaka. It was therefore recommended that, if the Lukiko acceptedthe constitutional scheme as a whole, there should be an interval of twelve months during which it would be brought into operation andthat, if the Lukiko then chose Mutesa as their Kabaka, he shouldbe allowed to return to Buganda on condition that he surrenderedhis direct rule and became a constitutional ruler.In C. (54) 338 the Colonial Secretary set out the terms in whichhe proposed to announce this decision in the House of Commons.In discussion there was general support for the proposals putforward by the Colonial Secretary in C. (54) 336. The followingparticular points were raised:  (a) So far as possible, the new decision should be presented asa necessary consequence of the legal judgment and not as a reversal of policy. This presentation would make it more acceptable toGovernment supporters and less likely to provoke demands forreconsideration of the decision to exclude Seretse Khama from the bamangwato Reserve of Bechuanaland.(b) The statement annexed to C. (54) 338 was too long to begiven orally in the House of Commons. It would be preferable thatthere should be a much shorter oral announcement, supplemented by a White Paper containing detailed explanation and justification of the Governmenfs decision.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the plan put forward in C. (54) 336, and authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce this in the House ofCommons on 16th November.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to settle the terms of theproposed announcement, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Commonwealth Secretary and the attorney-General.
Persia. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary (C. (54) 335) recommending that the amount of the loanReference: which we had offered to Persia should be increased from  5 millionsCC. (54) 56th   to  10 millions.Conclusions, The Cabinet were reminded that, when they had authorised in minute 7.) July the offer of a loan of  5 millions to Persia, their object hadbeen to give support to the Persian economy, to further the conclusionof a satisfactory oil agreement and to promote political stability in persia. The Persians had, however, secured relief from their immediate difficulties through the grants and loans, totalling over$100 millions, which they had received from the United States. now that an oil agreement had been concluded large sterling earnings would accrue to Persia in a few years&apos; time and it was in our commercial interest to secure a foothold in the Persian market byassisting the Persians to overcome their immediate shortage of sterling. The Foreign Secretary hoped that the Cabinet would be willing to meet the desire of the Persians for a larger loanaccompanied by more favourable terms than we had previously envisaged. He recommended that the Persians should now be offered a loan of  10 millions repayable over five years and that the interestrate on the loan should be Z\ per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that theamount of the loan should now be increased to  10 millions. Hewas, however, reluctant to agree to an interest rate as low as jr. percent. Our recent loan to Pakistan carried an interest rate of 4 percent.; and, if we now lent money to Persia at 3J per cent., we shouldbe open to two criticisms first, that we were lending to a foreign country on terms more favourable than those accorded to a commonwealth country; and, secondly, that we were openlysubsidising our exports. He would therefore prefer that a lower rateof interest, say 3 per cent., should be offered for any part of the loanborrowed for one year only, and that for tne remainder we should adhere to the 4 per cent, rate of interest which had been offeredpreviously.The Minister of State, Board of Trade, supported the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet Agreed that a loan of  10 millions should be offered to persia at rates of interest acceptable to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer; and invited the Minister of State forForeign Affairs to seek to persuade the Persian Governmentto accept the proposal that interest should be payable at per cent, for any part of the loan repaid in the first yearand 4 per cent, for the remainder.Pensions for old age and WarDisability.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 51stConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C. (54) 337) putting forward atime-table for carrying through the proposed improvement in therates of old-age and disability pensions.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that hehad now received advance information of the results of theGovernment Actuary&apos;s quinquennial review of the working of theNational Insurance Scheme and, in the light of this, he had beenable to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the increases which could be made in the various rates of benefit under the Scheme.He informed the Cabinet of the increases which he proposed to make,with the Chancellor^ concurrence, in the rates of National insurance benefits and also in the rates of war disability pensions and pensions for war widows. He also indicated what the corresponding increase would be in contributions under the National Insurance Scheme.
The time-table proposed for the introduction of these improve-ments was summarised in the Appendix to C. (54) 337. TheMinister explained that this was determined by the time needed tocarry through the considerable administrative preparations requiredfor collecting the increased contributions and paying the increasedbenefits. He had done his utmost to meet the political pressure for early improvement in the rates of old-age pension; and the time-tablewhich he now put forward was substantially more attractive, fromthis point of view, than that to which he had originally been working.Under it the new rates of old-age pension would come into operation in April, instead of June. This improvement had been made possible by the Chancellor^ readiness to agree that the increased benefitsmight become payable two months before the first date on whichcollection of the increased contributions could begin. No furtheracceleration of this time-table could, however, be attempted without serious risk of an administrative breakdown.The Minister explained that the plan outlined in the appendix to C. (54) 337 would be supplemented by an increase in the rates ofNational Assistance. This was not shown in his time-table because it depended, not on the decision of the Government, but on theinitiative of the National Assistance Board. He had, however, good reason to believe that before the end of the year the Board would propose an increase in their rates; and if, as he expected, their decision was taken in time to enable him to lay the necessaryRegulations before Parliament early in December, the new rates could come into operation in January. It was likely, therefore, that this improvement, which would benefit the poorest of the old-age pensioners, could form part of the comprehensive plan which he hoped to put before Parliament in the Debate on the Address for improving the position of pensioners generally and increasing benefits under the National Insurance Scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the proposals putforward in C. (54) 337.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Government spokesmen had consistently stated that these plans would be dependent on the results of the Government Actuary&apos;squinquennial review and the recommendations of the PhillipsCommittee. It was important, therefore, that the government actuary&apos;s Report and the Report of the Phillips Committee should beavailable to Parliament before the Governmenfs plans were debated.The Cabinet were assured that the Government Actuary&apos;s report would be published before the Governmenfs plans were announced.It was not yet certain when the Report of the Phillips Committeewould be available; but it was hoped that it might be publishedbefore the Parliamentary proceedings on the National Insurance bill were concluded.(b) The Report of the Government Actuary would providestatistical support for the increases to be made, under the Minister^proposals, both in benefits and in contributions. The special valueof the Phillips Report would lie in the support which it gave to themaintenance of the contributory principle.(c) There was general agreement that it would be inexpedient to attempt to supplement the main scheme by any form of specialChristmas payment to old-age pensioners.(d) It was desirable that the improved rates of national assistance should be brought into operation as early as possible inJanuary.(e) There was no reason to believe that there was any widespreadhardship among old-age pensioners. Hardship was confined mainly to those who were unwilling to ask for supplementary assistance fromthe National Assistance Board; and, although these undoubtedlyincluded the most deserving cases, their numbers were not large.(/) It was most important that the Government should be ableto show that no time was being lost in bringing the improved rates
into operation. It followed that, where legislation was necessary,Parliament should be urged to pass it at the earliest possible date;and that the further time required in completing necessary administrative preparation should be reduced to the minimum.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their consideration of this question attheir meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th November, 1954.
