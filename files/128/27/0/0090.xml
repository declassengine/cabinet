Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the end of the christmas recess.Atomic Energy.       3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord(Previous        President (C. (54) 395) outlining a programme for the development ofReference:      power from atomic energy for civil purposes, and seeking authorityCC. (54) 79th   for an immediate start on a civil programme on these lines.Conclusions, The Lord president said that it was now established that the&quot; 11 ! generation of electricity from atomic energy was technically feasibleCivil and was likely to prove, within the next ten years, competitive withProgramme. electricity generated by conventional methods. The full programmeof development, which had been worked out with the departments directly concerned, would involve capital expenditure of  300 millions over ten years. At present, however, he sought authority only forthe first stage of the programme, viz., the construction of two power stations, to be completed by 1960, at a cost of  50 millions. Theremainder of the programme would be open to review in the light of developments. This civil programme would not compete with military requirements for fissile material, which were covered up to1960 by facilities already existing or under construction.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the successfuldevelopment of atomic power for civil purposes was of crucial importance to the future of the national economy. He thereforewelcomed the proposals put forward by the Lord President, on theunderstanding that the Cabinet would not at present be committed to expenditure beyond the initial outlay of  50 millions.The Minister of Defence also supported these proposals, on theunderstanding that they would not prejudice the arrangements to be.made for meeting military requirements for fissile material after 1960.47403-1 b 2House o  1.   The Cabinet were informed that the Court of Appeal hadCommons. discharged the injunction restraining the Home Secretary fromRedistribution submitting to Her Majesty in Council the Draft Parliamentaryof Seats. Constituencies   (Manchester,   Oldham   and   Ashton-under-Lyne)(Previous Order, 1954. The Court had held that there was no ground for reference: supposing that the Boundary Commission had failed to comply withCC. (54) 89th its statutory obligations. The way was thus open for theConclusions, Government to submit for approval by Her Majesty in Council thoseMinute 1.) of the Orders which had already been approved in draft by bothHouses of Parliament. Parliamentary proceedings on the remainingOrders could, however, be deferred until after the Christmas recess.The Cabinet approved the terms of an announcement to this effect, to be made in the House of Commons that afternoon. this included the statement that the Government were of opinion that thematter was not justiciable and that it was their hope that in this theywould carry with them the House as a whole, as these were gravematters involving its rights.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon in the terms approved in their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the submission tothe Privy Council of such of the Orders giving effect to the boundary Commissions&apos;&apos; recommendations as had alreadybeen approved by both Houses of Parliament.
British 4.   The Minister of Supply informed the Cabinet that he hadEuropean not yet been able to obtain from air work Ltd. a firm assurance thatAirways. they could obtain the Canadair contract for the repair of SabreRenfrew aircraft and would carry out the work resulting from the contract atMaintenance Renfrew. The firm were now anxious, however, to secure thisBase. contract and had every expectation that they would obtain it; and(Previous        in that event they would wish to begin work at Renfrew within twoReference:      or three months. He therefore suggested that the Cabinet might nowC.C. (54) 88th   agree that, as soon as this contract had been secured, BritishConclusions,     European Airways (B.E.A.) might be informed that the GovernmentMinute 3.)       did not wish to raise objection to the transfer of their maintenance work from Renfrew to London.  air work Ltd. were expected to beable to provide employment at Renfrew for at least a year for about300 men, which was the number of B.E.A.&apos;s employees who wouldnot be offered transfer to London.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of allowing the move of B.E.A.&apos;s maintenance work to proceed as soon as firmassurances had been obtained that the Renfrew premises, when they became available, would be leased by air work Ltd. for work under contract with Canadair Ltd. The Cabinet recognised, however, that,if no such assurances were forthcoming, the matter would have to beconsidered afresh.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Supply and the Minister ofTransport to report to the Prime Minister the results oftheir further negotiations with air work Ltd. and, if these should be successful, to seek his authority to inform british european Airways that they might proceed with the transferof their maintenance work from Renfrew to London.Road Traffic 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the SecretaryBill. (C. (54) 401) covering the draft of a statement on parking metersParking Meters, to be made in the House of Lords during the debate on the Second(Previous        Reading of the Road Traffic Bill.Reference: In discussion it was explained that the intention underlying theC.C. (54) 8lst draft statement was that a single full-scale experiment with parkingConclusions, meters should be carried out in London in the first instance. the minute 4.)       area to be covered by such an experiment would have to be fairlyextensive as otherwise cars would avoid the experimental area andpark in the areas immediately adjoining it.The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that, in working outdetailed plans for co-operation with electricity authorities, special consideration should be given to the position of those Scottishelectricity undertakings which were independent of the british electricity Authority.The Cabinet- .(1) Approved the proposals put forward in C. (54) 395 for initiating, at an estimated capital cost of  50 millions, a programme for the production of power from atomic energy for civil purposes.(2) Agreed that the Atomic Energy Authority should open discussions about this programme with the british electricity Authority.(3) Invited the Lord President to consider, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, what steps could betaken to associate with this development those electricity authorities in Scotland which were independent of theBritish Electricity Authority.(4) Invited the Lord President to submit for their consideration the draft of a public statement about this programme.
In further discussion certain omissions from the draft statement were suggested and approved.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government spokesman in the debate inthe House of Lords on the Second Reading of the road traffic Bill should make a statement on parking meterson the general lines of the draft set out in C. (54) 401.Government 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeOffices. Minister (C. (54) 393) suggesting that the resumption of work on theNew Colonial new Colonial Office building should be postponed in the hope that office Building, it might be possible to find means of leaving clear of buildings the^Previous whole of the area from the Central Hall, Westminster, to the HousesReference: of Parliament and from Great George Street to Westminster Abbey.C.C. (54) 55th In discussion it was pointed out that the Government had conclusions, acquired this site compulsorily for the purpose of building a newMinute 8.) Government Office and could not now, without legislation, use it fora different purpose. There would also be practical difficulties inclearing the whole of the larger area which the Prime Minister hadin mind. This would involve, in particular, acquiring the offices of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which was shortly to be rebuilt; and this alone would probably increase to  5 millionsthe cost of acquiring the necessary land. Moreover, it would be many years before the buildings on the south side of Great george street could be reconstructed in conformity with such a plan.Meanwhile, it was very desirable that the Colonial Office shouldbe moved from the temporary accommodation in which it was nowhoused; and it would not be easy to find suitable permanent accommodation for it if the original project was abandoned.Possible alternatives were to construct a building which wouldaccommodate both the Colonial Office and the commonwealth relations Office on the site in Carlton House Terrace now earmarked for a new Foreign Office building, or to provide for the ColonialOffice on the Horseferry Road site now in course of development.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Works to arrange for members ofthe Cabinet to see a scale model showing how the westminster site would look if the present plan for thenew Colonial Office building were completed.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Price of Sugar.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 82ndConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 397) reporting the conclusions which hehad reached, after consultation with the Minister of Food, on the suggestions put forward in the Cabinefs discussion on 6th Decemberwith a view to avoiding an early increase in the retail price of sugar.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatan increase in the retail price could not be avoided by transferringGovernment stocks of sugar to the strategic stockpile. The most that could be so transferred would be 500,000 tons. This wouldinvolve a Supplementary Estimate for  21-7 millions and would not,even so, avert a substantial trading loss. Nor was it possible to ask the sugar refiners to meet from their profits the proposed increasein the wholesale price of sugar. Though their total profits were large, their margin on sales in the United Kingdom was not highand could not reasonably be reduced.   In these circumstances he
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st December, 1954.saw no alternative to his original proposal that the price at whichthe Government sold sugar to the refiners should be increased byan amount which would have the result of raising the retail priceby \d. a lb. He would, however, be ready to consider the timing of this increase, in consultation with the other Ministers most directly concerned.In discussion it was recognised that the Government were boundto incur criticism if, as a result of their heavy purchases before sugarwas derrationed, the retail price of sugar in this country was increased at a time when the world price of sugar was falling. The point wasalso made that, as the price of tea had also risen, it would be preferable that any increase in the price of sugar should be delayedfor a time-possibly until the new rates of National Assistance werein operation, On the other hand, if this price increase was inevitable,there were political arguments in favour of allowing it to come intooperation earlier rather than laier.The Cabinet -(1) Agreed in principle that the price at which the Governmentsold sugar to refiners in this country should be increasedby an amount which was likely to lead to an increase of%d. a lb. in the retail price of sugar.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider the timing of this price increase, in consultation with the other ministers most directly concerned, and to submit theirviews for the Prime Minister^ approval.
