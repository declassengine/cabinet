He and minute 2.)      some of his colleagues had therefore held a private meeting earlier in the week with representatives of the Opposition Parties.  It had emerged from this meeting that they would be willing to accept asolution by which an alternative television programme was providedby a second public corporation, to be financed eventually by anincrease in the television licence fee; but they assumed that in the initial development period the Exchequer would provide the bulk ofthe money required. There had also been some discussion about themeans of controlling the treatment of religion and politics in the competitive television programmes.The Lord Privy Seal recalled that Ministers had already con-sidered the possibility of providing a competitive television service by the methods now favoured by the Opposition Parties, and hadsatisfied themselves that a plan on those lines was impracticable. Itwas clear that there was no prospect of reaching agreement betweenthe Parties on this basis. Subject therefore to the Cabinefs views,he proposed to inform the leaders of the Opposition Parties that theGovernment adhered to their view that a competitive television service must be free to derive the bulk of its revenue from adyertise-ments. There would be no difficulty in reaching agreement betweenthe Parties on the subsidiary question of control over the treatmentof religion and politics in the competitive television programmes, andthis might be the subject of continuing consultations.The Cabinet Endorsed the views expressed by the Lord Privy Seal and authorised him to inform the leaders of the Opposition5 Parties in the House of Commons that the proposals whichthey had put forward provided no basis for an agreementbetween the Parties on the means for providing a com-petitive television service.Raw Materials. 3. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he hadTungsten.       come to the conclusion that State trading in tungsten could bebrought to an end on 1st April. An announcement to this effect would be made in the House of Commons in the following week.This would end State trading in materials, with the sole exception ofjute.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on the Defence White Paper would be held on 2nd March and would be opened by the Prime Minister.
Education.Teachers&apos;Superannuation.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 9thConclusions,Minute 2.)Armed Forces.Officers&apos; retired pay.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet gave preliminary consideration to a memo-memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 69) indicating that, in view of the decision to increase Service pay, he would now beprepared to grant a 10 per cent, increase to those Service officerswhose retired pay had been stabilised in 1935 at a rate 9^ per cent,below that ruling in 1919, and to make a similar increase to retiredcivil servants whose pensions had been similarly stabilised in 1935.Annexed to the memorandum was a draft White Paper explaining the reasons for making these concessions.In this discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that,before it was decided to make these concessions, he would be glad ofan opportunity to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer oneor two other concessions to disabled ex-Servicemen who meritedspecial consideration. The major issues of pensions and national insurance were at present the subject of enquiry by a committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Thomas Phillips, but this Committeewould not present its report until the end of the year.(b) The Commonwealth Secretary said that the concessionproposed for civil servants should extend to such former members ofthe Indian Civil Service as had suffered a similar reduction ofpension in 1935.The Prime Minister said that he would be announcing the increases in Service pay in the course of his speech in the Defencedebate on 2nd March, and he would have to say something thenabout the concession now proposed for these retired Service officers.The Cabinet had had little time to consider the terms of the draft white Paper, and he suggested that the matter should be raised again at the Cabinefs meeting on 26th February. In the meantime theChancellor of the Exchequer could&apos;discuss any particular points withthe Minister of Pensions and National Insurance.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their meeting on 26th February.4. The Prime Minister said that he was doubtful whether itwould be possible to proceed with the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill,in view of the continuing opposition to it among government supporters.In discussion it was pointed out that on the merits there was astrong case for the proposals in the Bill. They had the support of thelocal education authorities and of many of the more responsiblenewspapers; and the Executive of the National Union of Teacherscertainly assumed that the Government would persist with the Bill.If they did not do so, they would give offence to a number of other government supporters who were defending the principles of the Bill.The Cabinet recognised, however, that in view of the division ofopinion among Government supporters it would not be expedient toattempt to obtain a Second Reading of the Bill at the present time.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss withsome of his colleagues the best Parliamentary tactics for handling this situation, and to report their recommendations to the Prime Minister.
Civil Defence.Man-power.(previous reference:CC. (53) 48thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Defence (C. (54) 67) outlining a schemefor giving civil defence training to selected National Service reservistsduring their reserve liability for part-time service.The Home Secretary said that examination had shown that itwould not be practicable to give all National Servicemen some civil defence training as part of their colour service. He was thereforerecommending, in agreement with the Minister of Defence, thatselected National Service reservists who would not be needed in their particular Service during the first twelve months of a war shouldreceive two weeks&apos; civil defence training in each of two consecutiveyears of their reserve liability. In present circumstances nearly all theNational Service reservists so trained would be Royal Air Forcereservists. If war came, these reservists would be called up in theirown Service, organised in operational units, and placed at thedisposal of the Government for civil defence duties. He estimated that about 15,000 men could be made available for training in the first year of the scheme, and about 30,000 in each subsequent year. These men would be used for manning mobile columns, which would be centrallycontrolled. The Government had already been criticised for theirfailure to make any significant progress in building up these mobilecolumns; and he hoped that, if the Cabinet approved the scheme,some reference could be made to it in the forthcoming Defence debate in the House of Commons. The scheme would require legislation,but this would be neither long nor controversial.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The capital expenditure required would be about  70,000 inthe first.year and  130,000 in the second year. There would be additional current expenditure of about  425,000 in the first year,rising to about  850,000 in the second and subsequent years. Thiscost, both in peace and war, would be borne by the departments responsible for Civil Defence, though it might be found convenientthat some of it should be borne by the Service Departments initiallyand recovered thereafter.(b) Any reference made to the scheme in the Defence debate could include a statement that the necessary legislation was being prepared; but, in view of the congestion of the legislative programme,no promise should be made about the date of its introduction.The Cabinet (1.) Approved the scheme outlined in C. (54) 67 for trainingcertain National Service reservists in civil defence duties.(2) Authorised the preparation of the necessary legislation forthis purpose and the initiation of preparatory adminis-trative action.(3) Took note that the Home Secretary and the Minister ofDefence would suggest to the Prime Minister the terms inwhich he might refer to this scheme in the forthcomingDefence debate in the House of Commons.East/west trade.Shipping.(previous reference:CC. (54) 9thConclusions,Minute 6.)Pr^cJ . f .iP lnetJ ft before them a memorandum by their )iTi?lth  E10ard of Trade and the First Lord of the AdmiraltyJC. (54) 70) on the tactics for negotiating with the United StatesGovernment and the Pans Group the question of the export ofshipping to the Soviet bloc. Ft Jh?I&quot;eliden? aJ the Board Qf Trade said ^at he and the FirstLord of the Admiralty agreed that, in the context of the approach toi e?/we &apos;0Tthe^UmteduSt^s govern*ent on the general policy of east/West Trade, we should suggest that ships with a trial speed inexcess of 15 knots should be subject to full embargo and that ships
Royal Tonr. 8.   The Prime Minister drew attention to a public statement(Previous        by the Governor of Gibraltar about the arrangements which he was reference:      proposing to make for the visit of Her Majesty and the Duke ofC.C. (54) 10th   Edinburgh to Gibraltar. This was premature and, in certain respects,Conclusions,    unfortunate. In view of the agitation which had been worked up in minute 6.)       Spain on the subject of The Queen&apos;s visit, careful thought would haveGibraltar.       to be given to the extent to which Spaniards should be admitted to gibraltar during the visit; and it was unfortunate that the governor should have committed himself to the view that the frontier shouldnot be closed during that time. The Colonial Secretary had thereforeinvited the Governor to come to London in the near future for consultations on this subject.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Governor of Gibraltar had been invitedto come to London for consultations on the measures tobe taken to ensure the safety of Her Majesty and the duke of Edinburgh during their visit to Gibraltar.not subject to embargo should be free from any form of quantitativecontrol. This would be consistent with the proposals we intended tomake on all other types of goods for export to the Soviet bloc. Inthe meantime, however, the control over the export of ships wouldhave to be discussed in the Paris Group on the basis of existingcriteria and without waiting for the results of our general approach to the Americans. Unless we made progress on this we should be in danger of losing valuable Russian orders for ships.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that talks between UnitedKingdom and United States officials had already been held within thelimits of the existing policy. Agreement had been reached that an export quota of 40 fishing vessels a year should be allowed. on merchant ships the United Kingdom representatives had suggestedthat a global quota of about 150,000 to 200,000 gross tons of shippinga year should be allowed, while the Americans wished to limit thisquota to 68,000 gross tons. These questions would now be submittedto the Paris Group. Pending the outcome of the Paris discussionshe thought we should hold ourselves free to accept orders for shipping from United Kingdom sources up to a total of 30,000 gross tons inany one year, which was less than half the global figure suggested bythe Americans. Unless we could obtain Russian orders for shippingthere was danger of unemployment in the smaller shipyards duringthis year and prospects in the larger shipyards after 1955 were notpromising.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in our general approach to the United StatesGovernment on a new policy for East/West Trade weshould suggest that ships with a trial speed in excess of15 knots should be subject to full embargo and that shipsnot subject to embargo should be freed from any form of quantitative control.(2) Authorised the United Kingdom representative on the paris group to recommend a global annual quota of about150,000 to 200,000 gross tons of shipping of the types not subject to embargo.(3) Pending the outcome of the discussions in the Paris Group,authorised the acceptance of orders for the export of ships from the United Kingdom to the Soviet bloc up to a totalof 30,000 gross tons in any one year.
The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofWorks (C. (54) 73) regarding the arrangements for welcoming her majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh on their return to london on 15th May.The Minister of Works said that, since his memorandum was circulated, he had ascertained that a good deal of ceremony anddisplay was being arranged. Thus, the Lord Mayor and the Corpora-tion of the City of London were proposing to go in state to welcomeHer Majesty in the Pool of London; and the bridges immediatelyabove the Pool were to be decorated. It seemed, therefore, thatthe main problem would be one of co-ordinating the scale of decorated-tion planned by the various authorities concerned. He stillconsidered, however, that the Government should make themselvesresponsible for the decorations suggested in paragraph 4 of C. (54) 73,at an estimated cost of about  25,000.In discussion there was general agreement that a suitable amountof decoration should be provided on Her Majesty&apos;s return. Thepoint was also made that the national rejoicing would not be confined to London, and it would be appropriate that Her Majesty&apos;s returnshould be signalled by bonfires and beacons throughout the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would wish todiscuss the detailed proposals with the Minister of Works. He hopedthat the Government expenditure involved could be met within theMinisters Estimate for 1954.The Prime Minister said that, in a Question to be asked byMr. Summers on 4th March, it was suggested that church-bells shouldbe rung throughout the country at the moment of Her Majesty&apos; return to this country. This suggestion was welcomed by the Cabinet.The Cabinet (2) Agreed in principle that the Minister of Works should arrange for decorations to be displayed in London, onan appropriate scale, to celebrate the return of The queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 15th May.(3) Invited the Minister of Works to discuss the details of his proposals with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(4) Invited the Lord President to consult the appropriateecclesiastical authorities on the suggestion that church-bells should be rung throughout the country to celebrateThe Queen&apos;s return.9. The Cabinet again considered the Home Secretary&apos;s memo-randa (C. (53) 317 and C. (54) 41) on the recommendations made inthe report of the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and gaming.The Home Secretary said that it had been suggested to him thatit would help the Government to assess the state of public opinionon this question if a debate on the Commission^ report were heldin the House of Lords. He had therefore circulated a further memo-randum (C. (54) 68) outlining the sort of statement which might bemade on behalf of the Government in such a debate. This made itclear that detailed consideration of the Commission^ proposals would serve no purpose unless it were evident that there was a large measure of agreement on the need for amendment of the existing law and for some form of legal facility for cash betting off the coursesubject to a strict system of control. The statement would concludewith a promise that, if there was a general feeling among responsiblepeople that the law should be amended and if all political parties were willing to co-operate in finding a solution, the Government
10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (54) 63) about the recommendations in the Report ofthe Select Committee of the House of Commons on delegated legislation (House of Commons Paper No. 310).The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the Cabinet need concern themselves only with Recommendation (1) of the Select Committee,namely, that debate on &quot; prayers&quot; should regularly cease at11 - 30 p.m., at which hour Mr. Speaker would either put the question or, where this appeared to be justified on certain specified grounds,adjourn the debate until 10 p.m. on the. next ordinary sitting day ofthe House (other than a Friday) when it would again be subject to asimilar procedure. The Select Committee had preferred this meansof avoiding protracted debates on &quot; prayers &quot;to a proposal, which hehad put forward in his evidence, that they should be referred forconsideration to a Committee of the House. Opposition opinion was understood to be generally in favour of trying the Select Committee&apos;splan and, although some Government supporters were known to be opposed to it, the Committee of Ministers under his chairmanshipwhich had considered the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations had agreed to advise the Cabinet to adopt it on an experimental basisduring the remainder of the present Session. It would clearly be forDelegatedLegislation.Report ofSelectCommittee.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 101stConclusions,Minute 3.)would be ready to consider whether it would be possible to workout a scheme on the lines recommended by the Commission whichwould be generally acceptable and might form the basis for legislationwhen opportunity offered.In discussion it was agreed that it would be valuable to testthe state of public feeling on this question by the means proposedby the Home Secretary. It should be kept in mind, however, thatan obstinate and vocal opposition to the Commission^ proposals might well develop, and Government spokesmen should thereforebe careful to avoid committing the Government in any way until itcould be judged whether the controversy which such legislation was bound to evoke could be kept within reasonable bounds. The soleobject of the proposed debate, and of the statement to be made in iton the Governments behalf, was to put Ministers in a better positionto judge whether it would be practicable to proceed with legislation on this subject.On the form of the draft statement annexed to C. (54) 68, it wassuggested that it would be preferable to omit the specific reference tocorruption in the Leeds police force. This might provoke the criticism that the Government were founding too much upon theexperience of a single city. It might be better to substitute a more general reference to the evidence given to the Royal Commissionpointing to laxity and corruption in the enforcement of the existing law.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if a debate could be arranged in the House ofLords on the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon Betting, Lotteries and Gaming, a statement might bemade in the debate on behalf of the Government on thelines of the draft annexed to C. (54) 68, subject to amend-ment of the reference to corruption among the police.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to discuss his proposals withleaders of the Opposition Parties.(3) Invited the Lord President, if the outcome of the consulta-tions to be held under Conclusion (2) above were satisfactory, to arrange for a debate to be held on thissubject in the House of Lords.
Visiting Forces 11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeAct, 1952.       Secretary and the Minister of State (C. (54) 55) recommendingimmediate action to bring into operation the Visiting Forces Act,1952.The Home Secretary explained that the purpose of this Act wasto enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to ratify and give effect to theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) Status of ForcesAgreement (Cmd. 8279 of 1951) which defined the privileges and immunities which each Member of the Organisation would givewithin its own territory to the armed forces of another Member. Anundertaking had been given in the House of Commons that the Actwould not be applied to foreign countries unless the Governmentwere satisfied that they were able to accord reciprocal privileges.The position in this respect was now such that he could recommend to the Cabinet that the Act should be brought into effect and appliedsimultaneously to the United States and to the other N.A.T.O.countries that had ratified the Status of Forces Agreement. He mustwarn his colleagues, however, that the Order-in-Council which wouldbe necessary under Section 8 of the Act would require approval by affirmative resolution of each House and might give rise to somecontroversy in Parliament.The Foreign Secretary said that he fully shared the HomeSecretary&apos;s desire to bring this Act into effect without further delay.One of its effects would be to deprive members of the United states forces of the immunity from the processes of our criminal law whichthey now continued to enjoy under war-time enactments. He wasunder constant pressure to terminate this immunity and the UnitedStates Government were willing that it should be replaced by the modified arrangements for which the N.A.T.O. Agreement provided.The Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusion (2), authorised the Home Secretary totake forthwith the necessary action by Orders-in-Councilto bring into operation the Visiting Forces Act, 1952.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to submit to the legislation committee the draft of the Order-in-Council to be madeunder Section 8 of the Act before it was laid beforeParliament.the convenience of all Members that prolonged and late debates on&quot; prayers &quot; should be avoided, and the proposed arrangement seemed1 likely to secure this object without seriously reducing the degree ofcontrol exercised by the House over delegated legislation.  If there,) seemed to be some risk that the proposed arrangement would preventadequate debate on an important &quot; prayerthrough the expiry ofthe statutory period of 40 days, either debate could be begun before10 p.m. or the Sessional Order embodying the proposed new arrange-ment could be suspended. If his colleagues agreed, he would now proceed with the necessary further soundings in the House and wouldthereafter table the draft of a Sessional Order.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (54) 63 for dealing with therecommendations in the Report of the Select Committee ofthe House of Commons on Delegated Legislation, and invited the Lord Privy Seal to take the necessary steps toput them into effect.
Offences.       12.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (54) 60 and 61) on thequestion whether a Royal Commission should be appointed to review.   the existing law relating to prostitution and homosexuality.The Home Secretary said that since 1938 there had been a sub-stantial increase in the number of convictions of prostitutes forsoliciting, particularly in London, and he was satisfied that nothing more could be done to remedy the situation until the law had been strengthened particularly by increasing the penalty and by modi-fying the requirement to prove &quot; annoyance.&quot; But legislation tostrengthen the law would be contested, especially by women&apos;s organi-sations, and he could not advise the Government to attempt it unless it was supported by the findings of an authoritative enquiry. Therehad been an even greater increase in homosexual offences; and,although he himself doubted the expediency of amending the existing law on this subject, it must be recognised that many responsiblepeople believed that homosexual practices between adult malesshould not constitute a criminal offence. In the present state ofpublic opinion, there would certainly be criticism if an enquiry were held into prostitution and no similar investigation were made intohomosexuality. On balance, therefore, he was inclined to recommendthat a Royal Commission should be appointed to consider both these problems.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was recognised that the amount of sohciting by prostitutesin some parts of central London was deplorable and probablywithout parallel in the capital cities of other civilised countries. Itwas highly desirable that this situation should be remedied: it gaveincreasing offence to respectable citizens and to foreign visitors. Itwas significant that in Scotland, where heavier penalties wereavailable, the number of convictions for soliciting had decreasedsince 1938.(b) At the same time it was recognised that any proposals for amending the existing law would excite keen controversy fromwhich it was unlikely that any Government would emerge with credit.Special doubt was expressed about the expediency of attempting toamend the criminal law relating to homosexuality.(c) The suggestion was made that newspapers might be pro-hibited from publishing details of criminal prosecutions for homo-sexual offences. If a Private Member could be persuaded tointroduce a Bill for this purpose under the ten-minute rule, thearguments for and against a restriction on the reporting of thesecases could be publicly stated. If there then appeared to be asubstantial amount of public support for such a measure, the Govern-ment might facilitate the further stages of the Bill. It was recalled that the legislation applying a similar restriction to divorce pro-ceedings had originated in a Private Member&apos;s Bill.(d) More might perhaps be done to ensure that persons con-victed of homosexual offences could obtain facilities for medical treatment.(e) Lord Winterton had been anxious to raise these questions ina debate in the House of Lords. So far he had been dissuaded fromtabling a motion for this purpose; but he could not be preventedindefinitely from doing so.(/) The view was expressed that, if it were decided to hold an enquiry into these questions, a departmental committee would bemore appropriate for the purpose than a Royal Commission.The Cabinet Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of thequestion whether a formal enquiry should be instituted intothe law relating to prostitution and to homosexual offences.
industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:CC. (54) 1stConclusions,Minute 6.)Docks.13. The Minister of Labour said that he had now received thereports of the Courts of Enquiry which he had appointed to investi-gate the wages disputes in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.These would be published on 26th February. They were likely onthe whole to be valuable in promoting a settlement. The main recommendations were: (i) that the representatives of employersand workers should negotiate on improvements in the general wagestructure and in the conciliation machinery in the two industries;(ii) that there might be established some standing body which couldconsider and advise on the impact of wage levels on the national economy, and could so provide the necessary background against which wage negotiations in particular industries might be conducted on sound lines; and (iii) that some immediate wage increase, possibly to the extent of about one-third of the Unions&apos; claim, would bejustified and that the two sides should resume negotiations with aview to agreeing upon a wage increase of this order. A resumptionof negotiations would be a welcome development as it would reducethe likelihood of precipitate action by the Unions to impose a banon piece-work and overtime or to call a strike. A wage increase tothe extent of about one-third of the Unions1 claim would amount tosome Is., which would be in line with the increases granted recentlyin other industries.A dispute was developing between the employers and the steve-dores on the question whether the working of overtime was whollyvoluntary, which was the view taken by the stevedores, or whether,as the employers contended, men were under an obligation to worksome overtime if required by their employers to do so. He had arranged to see representatives of the employers and the stevedoreson the following day to explore the possibilities of promoting a settle-ment. The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union supported theemployers&apos; view on this question.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th February, 1954.
