Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.European coal and steel community.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 70thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 20) covering a report by officials on the UnitedKingdom&apos;s association with the European Coal and Steel Community(E.C.S.C.).The Foreign Secretary said that M. Monnet, the President of theHigh Authority of E.C.S.C., had now sent a formal letter suggesting that the time had come to reach a formal agreement defining theUnited kingdom&apos;s association with the Community. His letter hadbeen considered by officials of the Departments concerned, whosereport was annexed to C. (54) 20. From the point of view of foreignpolicy he . hoped that we should go as far as possible to meet m. monnet  wishes. Close association with E.C.S.C. would have a valuable psychological effect on the French and would, in particular,help to encourage them to proceed with the establishment of theEuropean Defence Community. The form of association contem-plated in the report entailed no abrogation of sovereignty and was consistent with our international commercial agreements. If theCabinet were favourably disposed towards an association of this kind,the next step would be to consult with the coal and steel interests inthis country and to obtain the views of other Commonwealth Govern-rnents. Thereafter, informal and exploratory talks should be held with M. Monnet before the Cabinet reached a final conclusion on policy or made a conclusive reply to his enquiry.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) These proposals raised major. issues of economic and commercial policy, and no final decision should be taken until the initial consultations had been held and the Chancellor of theExchequer had had an opportunity to assess the economic factors involved. It could not safely be assumed that the form of associationproposed in Appendix B of C. (54) 20 would be found acceptable toM. Monnet or consistent with our future obligations under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In the course of negotia-tion we should be pressed to accept a closer form of association.(b) There would, however, be every advantage in undertakingpreliminary consultations on the general basis that the Governmentwere disposed to favour an association of this kind; and, when thecoal and steel interests had expressed their views, exploratory conversations with M. Monnet would be valuable, especially if they took place in London, where senior officials would be available to take part in them.(c) The proposed form of association included the establishmentof a common market for steel between the United Kingdom and theCommunity. This would have the effect that steel from theCommunity countries would have free entry into the United Kingdomand Colonies, and that the independent Commonwealth countries would lose their existing preferences on steel exports into the UnitedKingdom and Colonies. The plan would be more acceptable to other commonwealth Governments if it could be arranged that Common-wealth steel should have free entry into the European market. Itwas pointed out, however, that this could be conceded only on a reciprocal basis. The Commonwealth countries concerned were unlikely to be willing to give free entry to European steel.(d) The establishment of a common market for steel did notentail any international control of development projects, nor would it necessarily result in the fixing of common maximum prices, though in practice a common market tended to equalise prices, and there45567-2 &apos;        B 2
East/West 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had considered whetherTrade. there might be an opportunity at the Four-Power Meeting at Berlin(Previous to raise the question of an expansion of trade with the Soviet bloc.Reference: He had, however, concluded that he could not open this questionC.C.(54)3rd with the Russians until we had first reached agreement with theConclusions, Americans on a revised list of goods whose export to the Soviet blocMinute 5.) was to be subject to embargo. If we went outside the limits of thepresent agreed list, we should be denied economic aid from the UnitedStates in accordance with the terms of the Battle Act.The Prime Minister said that he would preside over a meetingof Ministers on 25th January to discuss the report by officials forwhich the Cabinet had asked on 18th January. The conclusions reached would be made known to the Foreign Secretary in Berlin.Persia. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had not yet communicated(Previous        to the Persian Government the proposals for a settlement of the oilReference:      dispute which the Cabinet had approved on 12th January.   TheC.C. (54) 2nd    Americans had asked for further time to consider the compositionConclusions,    of the proposed consortium of oil companies; and he had thoughtMinute 4.)       it better to defer any communication to the Persian Government until agreement had been reached with the Americans.   There were twodifficulties to be overcome. First, the Americans were likely to suggestthat some of the smaller American oil companies should be includedin the consortium.  This we could not concede, for it would involveadmitting small companies from other countries;  but the largeAmerican companies could make private arrangements, if they so desired, for giving the small American companies some share of theirprofits from dealings in Persian oil.  Secondly, the Americans were likely to challenge the suggestion that the Anglo-Iranian Oil company should have a 50 per cent, share in the consortium. This was a matter might therefore be some increase in the price of United Kingdom steel.The Minister of Supply said that the Steel Board had already adopted a helpful attitude towards these proposals, and he would seek an early opportunity of discussing them with the Engineering AdvisoryCouncil.(e) The proposals for coal did not include the establishment of acommon market, nor the fixing of common prices. But even thelooser form of association proposed might not be welcomed by theminers. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he proposed to approach the National Union of Mineworkers through the Chairmanof the National Coal Board, who had great influence with them.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Ministerof Supply to enter into consultation with the coal and steelinterests on the basis that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to place the United Kingdom&apos;s association withthe European Coal and Steel Community on a contractualfooting.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to consult the other commonwealth Governments on the same basis.(3) Agreed that, if satisfactory progress were made in these consultations, informal and exploratory discussions should then be opened with M. Monnet, preferably in London.(4) Agreed that no final decision could be taken on the formof the United Kingdom&apos;s association with the european coal and Steel Community until the results of these con-consultations were known.
31 C.C. 4 (54)for negotiation. In the last resort we might have to accept an arrange-ment which took into account the British element of the shell company; but we should insist that British oil interests as a wholeshould have not less than a 50 per cent, share in the consortium.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Jordan.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 17 (Revise)) on the stationing of British forces in jordan.The Foreign Secretary said that the development of the airfield at Amman had now been completed, and he had agreed that a fighter squadron of the Royal Air Force should be stationed there. this move would take place within the next few weeks: the IsraelGovernment would be informed two or three days beforehand.The King of Jordan had recently raised with Her Majesty&apos;ambassador the possibility of stationing further British forces in jordan. The Foreign Secretary therefore recommended that weshould at once proceed with the project, authorised by the Cabinet,for sending an armoured squadron to Jordan for training with theArab Legion; and that we should also ask what other arrangements the King had in mind, indicating our readiness to consider any pro-posal for regularising the position of British ground forces in Jordan.Before the armoured squadron moved, a communication would bemade to the Israel Government assuring them that British troops would not be used in Jordan for any aggressive purpose but remindingthem of our obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty. The texts of the communications to be made to the Governments of jordan and Israel were set out in Annex B of C. (54) 17 (Revise).The Cabinet -(1) Endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s approval of the stationingof a fighter squadron of the Royal Air Force in Amman.(2) Approved the proposals in C. (54) 17 (Revise) regarding the stationing of British ground forces in Jordan.(3) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send instructions toHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Amman and Tel Aviv inthe terms of the drafts set out in Annex B of C. (54) 17(Revise).Suez Canal.(previous reference:C.C.(53)48thConclusions,Minute 3.)Egyptianblockade of israel.6. The Prime Minister drew attention to the decision of theEgyptian Government to intensify their blockade of Israel. Thiswould lead to increased interference with the passage of ships throughthe Suez Canal and the black-listing by Egypt of many ships of allflags trading with the Levant. The Israel Government were proposing to raise the matter in the Security Council and had asked whether theycould count on our support, and that of the United States Government.The Prime Minister said that he hoped we should give prompt and effective support to the Israel Government in this matter. InParliament members of all parties would welcome an initiative designedto assert the rights of free transit through the Canal; and it wouldbe convenient if we could transfer the emphasis, in our currentdifferences with Egypt, from the Base to the Canal.The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious to gain support for Israel&apos;s protest against Egypt&apos;s interference with her trade. TheCabinet should realise, however, that the Egyptian Government hadlegal grounds for their action, in that their war with Israel had notlegally been terminated. It was therefore desirable that we shouldnot take any public position in this matter until we had assured our-selves that we should have the support of some of the other maritimePowers. He had, in the first instance, approached the United States
5*1Government; and, as soon as he knew that they were willing to sup-port Israel&apos;s complaint, he would take steps to verify that some ofthe other maritime Powers would be willing to take the same line.The Israel Government could then be informed that, if they raised the matter in the Security Council, they would have the support ofthe leading maritime Powers.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue to enlist thesupport of leading maritime Powers for the protest whichIsrael proposed to make in the Security Council against thedecision of the Egyptian Government to intensify theirblockade of Israel.Kenya.Courts-Martial.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 79thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Secretary of State for War said that he had now receivedthe report of the court of enquiry which had enquired into allegations,made in the court-martial proceedings against Captain Griffiths,regarding the conduct of British troops engaged in operations againstthe Mau Mau in Kenya. The court had found no evidence of any widespread misconduct by British troops in Kenya; but two furtherisolated cases of misconduct had been discovered one concerningCaptain Griffiths and the other an officer in the King&apos;s African Rifles.General Erskine had decided to institute proceedings by court-martialin both cases, though in one at any rate it would technically have beenopen to him to proceed summarily.The Secretary of State said that he was in full agreement withGeneral Erskine&apos;s decision. He had thought it right, however, toinform his Cabinet colleagues of these impending courts-martial, sincethe officers concerned were alleged to have behaved with nauseatingbrutality and the proceedings, which must be held in public, would undoubtedly attract unwelcome publicity.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Secretary of Statefor War.Food Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (54) 21) urging deferment of certain increases in food prices which the Cabinet had decided, at their meeting on 18th December,should be announced on 28th January to take effect from 21stFebruary.The Minister of Labour said that he felt obliged to seek postpone,-ment of these increases, in view of developments in the industrial situation which had taken place since the Cabinet authorised them.The wages disputes in the engineering and shipbuilding industries were likely to reach a critical stage in the next few weeks; and thesuccess or failure of the attempts to arrive at a reasonable settlementof those disputes would have an important influence on the industrial situation generally. When he received the reports of the courts of Enquiry which were investigating those claims, he intended tomake an earnest appeal to the employers&apos; organisations and tradeunions concerned to give due weight to the Courts&apos; recommendations and to hold further discussions with him before giving any publicindication of their attitude. He also had it in mind to seek theco-operation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in urging upon bothsides of industry that, when outstanding wage disputes had been disposed of, a serious attempt should be made to introduce somestability into the general wages situation in the national interest.These plans would be frustrated if, at the very moment when thereports of the Courts of Enquiry were being considered, the Govern-ment announced these increases in food prices.   They would be
exposed to the criticism that they were deliberately raising the costof the people&apos;s food at a time when they were urging restraint in wage claims. This accusation would be made irrespective of thecost-of-living figures which, as it happened, showed no appreciablechange in the cost of food between December 1952 and December1953. If the present crisis in industrial relations could be sur-mounted, there were grounds for hoping that responsible trade union leaders would thereafter be ready to co-operate with the Governmentin endeavouring to foster a better atmosphere in industry.The Minister of Food said that the interim index of food prices,which was the official yardstick for judging the movement of food prices, showed that a fall of no less than four points had taken placein the six months from July to December 1953. As a result of his announcement in the House of Commons on 28th October of theGovernments intention to de-ration butter, margarine, cheese and cooking fats in the early summer, increases in the prices of butter and cheese were generally expected and the rise of - 36 in the index of food prices which these particular increases would involve hadalready been largely discounted. Postponement of the de-rationing of these items would involve the Government in serious difficulties.The same considerations did not apply to the proposed increases inthe prices of beef and pork.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that it was now clearthat the total cost of the food subsidies (including producers&apos; sub-subsidies) in the current financial year would amount to over  300millions compared with the sum of  220 millions estimated in theBudget. If the price increases now under consideration were notintroduced in February, they could not be introduced before april and the cost of this postponement would be  8 millions, or  4 millionsif price increases were deferred only in the case of beef and pork.If the announcement of price increases were deferred until aftersettlements had been reached in respect of current wage claims,might not the Government be accused of having allowed thesesettlements to be reached on false premises and might not the price increases, when they eventually came to be announced, be a signalfor a fresh round of wage claims? There was also the further con-sideration that, if the price of butter and cheese were not increaseduntil April, the increase would take place shortly before de-rationing and might be widely regarded as being connected with it.The Cabinet were impressed by the financial arguments in favourof some increase in food prices, and they accepted the view that theeffect of the proposed increases in the price of butter and cheesemust already have been largely discounted since it had already been announced that these would be made in the early spring. this consideration did not, however, apply to the proposed increases inthe price of beef and pork and those price increases should thereforebe deferred.The Cabinet (1) Confirmed their approval of the following increases in food prices:  and authorised the Minister of Food to announce them on 28th January, to take effect from 21st February.(2) Agreed to defer the proposed increase in the price of beef and pork and to postpone consideration of the possibilityof increasing the price of bread or milk.ButterCheeseAd. per lb.2d. per lb.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st January, 1954.
