Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was hoped that the current session of Parliament could bebrought to a close during the week beginning 22nd November.The new session would be opened on 30th November.remuneration of Ministers.(previous references:CC (51) 4thConclusions,Minute 3, and cc. (54) 43rdConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 313) on the remuneration ofMinisters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although it might beinconvenient to promote legislation on this subject at the presenttime, there were strong practical grounds for doing so. First, threeyears had passed since the Prime Minister had announced thatsenior Ministers would draw less than their full salary for &quot; the periodof rearmament or three years, whichever ends the first.&quot; Secondly,it was widely recognised that the salaries of Junior Ministers wereIndustrial 1.   The Minister of Labour reported to the Cabinet the latestDisputes. developments in the dock strike. There was no improvement in the docks. position in the London docks, and the efforts of the Stevedores Union(Previous        to spread the strike to other ports had met with some success.Reference:      Substantial  numbers  of  dockers  had stopped  work in Hull,CC. (54)67th   Birkenhead and Liverpool; and the strike had now spread to conclusions.)    Southampton.   Even so, there would be no need to use military labour for the maintenance of essential supplies before the end ofthe present week; and, as the use of troops was likely to lead tosympathetic strikes (e.g., in the Smithfield meat market, thedistribution of oil by road and perhaps the railways), he was anxious that it should be deferred for as long as possible.   The ministerial committee on Emergencies had agreed that, unless the situation deteriorated further, the movement of troops into London need notbegin until the week-end.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Prime Minister said that he had advised The Queen thatshe should avoid going into the dock area during her forthcoming visit to Liverpool. Nothing need be said in advance about thisadjustment of Her Majesty&apos;s programme; but, if it were the subjectof public comment, it should be said that it had been made on theadvice of Ministers.(b) Tugs were still operating in the Southampton docks, but itwas possible that their crews might have come out on strike beforethe departure of the liner Queen Elizabeth on the following morning.The Queen Mother was due to sail in the Queen Elizabeth for thepurpose of fulfilling a series of public engagements in Canada andthe United States. The Cabinet agreed that, if need arose, navaltugs should be used for the purpose of enabling the Queen Elizabethto sail at the scheduled time.The Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty, undertook to arrangefor two naval tugs to proceed to Southampton, from Portsmouth andFalmouth, and hold themselves in readiness to give this assistance if required.(c) The Minister of Labour said that he was collecting such evidence as was available regarding the part played by communists in organising this series of strikes; and he proposed to considerwhether this information should be published, possibly in the formof a White Paper, when the strike was over.The Cabinet Took note of the report by the Minister of Labour and ofthe points made in the discussion.
inadequate by modern standards and the Government were committed to improving them. Thirdly, there was a strong case for extending to all Ministers in the Commons the right to draw theParliamentary salary in addition to a Ministerial salary. With these considerations in mind he had put forward, for the Cabinefsconsideration, the tentative plan set out in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 313.The timing of the introduction of such a plan would have to be carefully considered. Some might think that, even though thenecessary legislation were passed in the coming session, the improvedrates of remuneration should not be brought into operation until after the next General Election. He would wish to have anopportunity of discussing his proposals with the Foreign Secretary;and, when the Cabinet had reached firm conclusions on the matter, itshould be made the subject of consultation with opposition leaders.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The payment of the Parliamentary salary to Ministers, inaddition to a Ministerial salary, would mean that Ministers in the lords would receive less remuneration than Ministers in the commons.   But this differentiation could be justified on the ground that Ministers in the Commons incurred the same expenses as private members in respect of their constituencies. t(b) There was general agreement that some improvement in the remuneration of Junior Ministers would be fully justified.(c) The view was expressed that no improvement should bemade in the remuneration of Ministers, and particularly of senior ministers, until steps had been taken to improve the position of old-age pensioners.The Minister of Pensions said that he hoped to be in a positionto announce before Christmas the Governmenfs plans for increasingthe rates of old-age pensions, but it would be a further six months before all the prospective beneficiaries would have begun to draw their improved rates of benefit.(d) The Prime Minister said that the temporary abatement inthe remuneration of senior Ministers should cease automatically atthe end of the prescribed period of three years.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the temporary abatement of senior Ministers&apos;salaries should be brought to an end in November, 1954.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss his proposals for improving Ministers&apos; remuneration with theForeign Secretary and the Lord Privy Seal and to bring them before the Cabinet again at a later date.Parliament. 4.   The Lord President said that the only assistance which PeersExpenses        now received towards the expenses incurred in discharging theirof Peers.        Parliamentary duties was the refunding of their railway fares. Strong(Previous        representations had been made to him on behalf of Labour Peers,Reference:      who were finding it increasingly difficult to attend the sittings of theCC. (54) 26th   House, and some Conservative and Liberal Peers were in similarConclusions,    difficulties.   As a result of discussions which he had held, he was minute 6.)      satisfied that there would be general support in the House of Lordsfor a scheme by which a Peer would receive an attendance allowance of, say,  3 for each day on which he attended the House; and it was estimated that a scheme on these lines would not cost more than 30,000 a year.   It would be easier to introduce such a scheme inconjunction with other changes, for example in the remuneration ofMinisters, and timing would clearly be important.   He must,however, impress upon his colleagues that, if nothing were done
legislative programme:1954-55Session.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (54) 310) reviewing plans for legislation in the next session, and a memorandum by the former Home Secretary (C. (54)311) about measures to dispense with further emergency powers.The Lord Privy Seal said that he thought it important that theParliamentary pressure on Government supporters should be relaxedin the coming session, so far as this was practicable on the basis ofthe Governments narrow majority, and that no measures should beintroduced which would antagonise Government supporters or makeit necessary to resort to compulsory time-tables. The Cabinet might consider that the programme of legislation outlined in C. (54) 310should be re-examined in detail by a small body of Ministers withthese objects in view.The Lord Chancellor recalled that on 28th July the Cabinet had agreed that next session&apos;s programme should contain no legislationdisplacing emergency powers relating to land and water, apart froma Requisitioned Houses Bill, but had authorised the preparation of atemporary Bill to continue Defence Regulation 55 and associatedRegulations for certain specified purposes on the lines proposed inAppendix II to C. (54) 247. It had become clear that, although aBill for this restricted purpose could be drawn up, it would not be an attractive proposition because, apart from the difficulty of securingits enactment, it would give rise to a separate annual renewalprocedure for the economic powers alone, in addition to the annualmotions to continue the Supplies and Services Acts and theEmergency Laws Acts. Instead, he now proposed the making of anOrder in Council which would revoke the relevant Regulations inpart and specify the limited purposes for which they might be usedin future. He considered this to be the minimum action whichwould be acceptable to Government supporters in the House ofCommons. Even so they would be disappointed with a measure which left it open to a future Government to reimpose economic controls without passing fresh legislation. The Lord Chancellor saidthat he also thought it necessary, in order to maintain the momentumin dispensing with emergency powers, to add to the programme thethree Bills mentioned in paragraph 8 of C. (54) 311. He would,however, be satisfied if the preparation of these three measures could proceed on the understanding that they would be introduced only ifthe necessary time should become available to carry them through parliament.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) If the proposed Order in Council were made and a Prayerwere moved against it, the way would be opened for debate on suchcontroversial matters as the control of newsprint, jute and strategic controls.soon to alleviate the Peers&apos; difficulties, the Opposition in the Houseof Lords would continue to grow weaker and the effectiveness of theUpper Chamber would be undermined.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cost of anarrangement of the kind which the Lord President had describedwould not be serious, but he would wish to consider its political implications and the arrangements to be made to enable Peers to claim, against any attendance allowance, tax relief in respect of theirexpenses.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President and the Chancellor of theExchequer to submit detailed proposals for reimbursingPeers for expenses incurred in the performance of their parliamentary duties.
4*0(b) It would be necessary to pass the proposed Rating and valuation Bill at some stage in the next session. If, however, thedate of the next valuation were to be deferred until 1957, the Billneed not be introduced before next summer.The Cabinet agreed that there might be advantages in deferringthe date of the valuation and invited the Minister of Housing andLocal Government to consider this possibility.(c) The Minister of Education said that he had satisfied himself that early action must be taken to restore the solvency of thearrangements for paying teachers&apos; pensions, but he wished to consider further the nature of the steps which it was proposed to take to thisend, with particular regard to the effect of the introduction of equal pay.(d) The Postmaster-General was most anxious to see theCopyright Bill included in the programme in view of its importancein relation to commercial television.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee composed of:  Lord Privy Seal (Chairman),Lord President,Lord Chancellor,Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for Scotland,Minister of Defence,Chief Whip,to examine in detail the proposals for legislation in the next session, including legislation to replace emergency powers,and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.Parliament. 6.   The Prime Minister said that a Cabinet Committee shouldThe Queen&apos;s be appointed to prepare drafts of The Queen&apos;s Speeches on the speeches.        Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee composed of:  Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),Lord President,Lord Chancellor,Lord Privy Seal,Minister of Defence,Chief Whip,to prepare, for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration, drafts ofThe Queen&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and Openingof Parliament.Civil Defence. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the former(Previous Home Secretary (C. (54) 315) suggesting that, in the debate on the reference: Second Reading of the Civil Defence (Armed Forces) Bill, theCC. (54) llth Government should make it clear that the powers to be conferredConclusions, by the Bill would be used for wider purposes than those alreadyMinute 6.) announced.The Home Secretary said that there would certainly be criticismin the House of Commons if it were thought that the powers sought in the Bill would be used only for the training of 15,000 NationalService reservists of the Royal Air Force. This scheme had alreadybeen criticised as being too small and too slow a contribution to areserve of man-power trained in civil defence duties, and it wouldseem all the more inadequate in the light of the forthcoming White
Paper on Defence. He therefore wished to indicate that theGovernment were considering more extensive measures for thetraining of members of the Armed Forces in civil defence duties.The Minister of Defence said that the powers to be conferred by this Bill were needed in order to provide a legal basis for trainingmembers of the Armed Forces in civil defence duties. He suggestedthat the Governments case in support of the Bill should be madeon this general ground. He hoped that the Government spokesmenin the debate would avoid anticipating the forthcoming White paper on Defence and would decline to be drawn into discussion of widerplans, which had yet to be agreed with the Services, for using the armed Forces in support of the Civil Defence Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the views expressedby the Minister of Defence. It would at this stage be premature togive any precise indication of the extent to which the Governmentcontemplated wider training of the Armed Forces in civil defenceduties.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary, in moving the SecondReading of the Civil Defence (Armed Forces) Bill, toindicate that the Government contemplated using thepowers for which provision was made in the Bill forpurposes wider than those which had already been announced.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would concert with theMinister of Defence and the Chancellor of the exchequer the terms of the statement to be made in the House ofCommons on this point.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theHome Secretary and the Service Ministers, to consider what further steps should be taken to train members ofthe Armed Forces in civil defence duties.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (54) 314) reviewing the implications for the United Kingdom of Japan&apos;s accession to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and seeking the Cabinefs authority to open negotiations with the object ofsecuring certain safeguards for the trade of the United kingdom under a bilateral agreement with Japan.The President of the Board of Trade said that cogent political arguments could be adduced against any proposal which might havethe effect of- excluding Japan from normal friendly commercial relations with the West. Nevertheless, there had been considerabledifficulty in inducing Government supporters and important industrial interests in the United Kingdom to accept the adherenceof the United Kingdom to the G.A.T.T.; and, if Japan were nowto become a member of G.A.T.T., widespread controversy wouldbe aroused unless it could be shown that the trade of the UnitedKingdom had been safeguarded from the dangers of japanese competition. The Cabinet had previously agreed that we should seek an amendment of G.A.T.T. allowing existing members to make their acceptance of an acceding member subject to the terms of a bilateral agreement which would override certain provisions of theG.A.T.T. We could then support Japan&apos;s admission provided she were prepared to negotiate a satisfactory bilateral agreement with us. If the political opposition which was bound to be aroused inthis country by the prospect of Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T.was to be overcome, the Government must be able to show that our arrangements with Japan allowed of our taking emergency action
to limit Japanese imports to this country in case of need. It wouldalso be necessary to safeguard the advantages accruing to UnitedKingdom trade from the preferential treatment afforded by Australiaand other Commonwealth countries to our goods by comparisonwith those of Japan. These safeguards for our trade would not,however, be readily acceptable to Japan and he sought authority tomake it plain to the Japanese that, failing the negotiation of a bilateral agreement incorporating these essential safeguards, weshould have no option but to invoke Article XXXV of G.A.T.T.,the effect of which would be to renounce any G.A.T.T. relationship with Japan. If we failed to put pressure on the Japanese in thisway there was a serious risk that the safeguards which were so important to us would be whittled away under pressure from othermembers of G.A.T.T. during the meetings which were to take placeearly in November, and we should then be forced to invoke article XXXV, with all the serious political and economic consequences which that would entail.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if we failedto come to an understanding with Japan in the field of tradingrelationships, it would be more difficult to secure the continuedpolitical alignment of Japan with the countries of the West. He saw no objection on political grounds to the proposals outlined by thePresident of the Board of Trade in C. (54) 314, but he hoped thatthese would not be put to the Japanese in a manner which might seem tantamount to an ultimatum. The Prime Minister of japan was coming to the United Kingdom on a visit of goodwill, and itwould be against our interests to weaken his political position in japan, since no one who succeeded him was likely to be sowell-disposed to the strengthening of Japanese relations with theWest.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he supported the objectives outlined by the President of the Board of Trade, hethought it important to avoid any threat to resort to Article XXXVof G.A.T.T., at any rate in the opening stages of the discussions withMr. Yoshida. It might be that we should in the end be forced to renounce any G.A.T.T. relationship with Japan by invokingArticle XXXV, but, apart from its political repercussions, this coursewould have serious economic consequences for us.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals set out in C. (54) 314as a basis for the negotiation of a bilateral trade agreement with Japan in connection with the accession of Japan to the G.A.T.T.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to be guided by the views expressed in their discussion regarding themanner in which these proposals should be put to theJapanese Government.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th October, 1954.
