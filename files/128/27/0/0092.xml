Meeting ofCommonwealthPrime Ministers.Statement on defence Policy.(previous references:CX. (54) 54thConclusions,Minute 4 andC.C. (54) 61stConclusions,Minute 7.)Television 2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Postmaster-Development. General&apos;s memoranda (C. (54) 369 and 398) on the composition of(Previous the companies to be appointed as programme contractors by the reference:      Independent Television Authority.C.C. (54) 9lst In discussion further efforts were made to find some acceptableConclusions, means of indicating the Government&apos;s support for the efforts which minute 3.) the Chairman of the Authority was making to secure a properbalance of political opinion among the companies to be appointed as programme contractors. It was suggested that the Chairmanmight be told that if he maintained his present attitude on thisquestion he would have the Government&apos;s support. Alternatively,it might suffice to inform him that the Government supported his present efforts to maintain public confidence in the arrangements for promoting independent television programmes.It appeared, however, from the discussion that the balance ofopinion in the Cabinet was against any direct expression of opinion by the Government on the composition of the programme companies.Most Ministers considered that, as this was a matter which resteawholly within the discretion of the Authority, it would be inexpedientfor the Government to express any view on it. The Postmaster-General could inform the Chairman of the Authority that this wasa matter within the discretion of the Authority, in whom theGovernment had complete confidence, but he should go no further than that.The Lord President said that a reply in those terms wouldevidently meet the views of most members of the Cabinet. he himself would have wished to go further in the direction of expressingdirect support for the Chairman&apos;s efforts to restrict the influence which newspaper interests would be able to exercise, in theprogramme companies.   In view of what he had said in the)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence (D. (54) 42) covering a memorandum by the Chiefs of Staffon United Kingdom strategic intentions. This memorandum hadbeen prepared as a basis- for a discussion on defence policy withthe Prime Ministers of the old Commonwealth countries at theforthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, and it was proposed that copies should be sent in advance of the Meeting tothe Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South africa and the Central African Federation. An earlier version of the report had been considered by the Defence Committee on 20th december and the revised draft annexed to D. (54) 42 incorporated a number of suggestions made at that meeting.In the Cabinefs discussion various further drafting changes were suggested. In particular, it was agreed that paragraph 23 of thememorandum should be omitted, that the opening sentences ofparagraph 16 should be modified, and that the information set outin the Appendix should be rearranged so as to bring out the resources available to the Commonwealth as a whole. It was also agreed thata better title for the memorandum would be &quot;United KingdomDefence Policy.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for thememorandum annexed to D. (54) 42 to be further revised in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to send copies ofthe revised memorandum to the Prime Ministers ofCanada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and theCentral African Federation as a basis for a discussion ofdefence policy at the forthcoming meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers.
Parliamentary debates on this subject, he would find himself in aposition of grave personal embarrassment if it turned out in the eventthat newspapers were able to exercise a dominant influence overthe character of the independent television programmes. He must therefore reserve his right to raise this matter afresh if the Chairmanof the Authority should find himself unable to attain his presentobjective of preventing any substantial increase in the influenceexercised by newspapers among the programme companies.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to inform the Chairmanof the Independent Television Authority that the composition of the companies to be appointed asprogramme contractors was a matter within the discretion of the Authority, in whom the Government had complete confidence.(2) Agreed that the Lord President would be free to raise thisquestion again if the Chairman of the Authority wasunsuccessful in his present efforts to prevent any increasein the influence to be exercised by newspapers among theprogramme companies.industrial 3.   jhe Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that the disputes.        decision of the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) to issueRailways.       strike notices, effective from 9th January, had been taken by majority(Previous        vote at a prolonged meeting of the Union&apos;s Executive on the reference:      preceding day: the minority in the Executive had been in favour ofCC. (54) 88th   pursuing the Union&apos;s claims through the recognised negotiatingConclusions,    machinery.  The Minister said that officials of his Department had minute 2.)       already opened discussions with representatives of the N.U.R., andit was his intention to invite the Union&apos;s leaders to meet him personally at an early date. The only practical step open to him wasto appoint a Court of Enquiry to establish the facts in the disputeand to suggest possible means of promoting a settlement, and he proposed to appoint such a body at the appropriate moment.   Itwas to be hoped that, in spite of their present intransigence, theN.U.R. would be ready to co-operate in the work of a Court ofEnquiry and to refrain from strike action until it had presented itsreport.   The British Transport Commission would be issuing that day a public statement reaffirming their willingness to pursuediscussions with the N.U.R. and to have unresolved differencesreferred to arbitration.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was no substance in the claim that the government ought to make available to the Transport Commission the profit of 124 millions which they were alleged to have made from their operation of the railways during the war. This claim was not atpresent being pressed, but it might be revived and the Governmentshould be ready with a considered statement showing it to be invalid.(b) Plans to maintain essential services in the event of a railway strike were already in a high state of readiness and would continueto be kept under review.(c) A complete stoppage of the railways would soon result ina serious shortage of coal. Plans were being made to alleviate this,so far as possible, by diverting available supplies of fuel to meet themost urgent needs.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points made in the discussion.
