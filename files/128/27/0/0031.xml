Indo-China. 1.   The Minister of State drew the CabinetS attention to a(Previous        message from the Foreign Secretary (Geneva telegram No. 113)Reference:      regarding the embarrassments arising at the Geneva ConferenceCC. (54) 30th   from the divergence of view between the United Kingdom and united conclusions,    States Governments on the question of any immediate militaryMinute 3.)       intervention in Indo-China.   Despite these, the Foreign Secretaryconsidered that, pending the outcome of the negotiations at Geneva,we must decline to be drawn into the war in Indo-China or eveninto promising moral support for measures of intervention of whichthe full scope was not yet known.   We should, however, continueto assure the Americans of our readiness to work with them in establishing a system of collective defence, with the widest possibleAsian support, to guarantee whatever settlement could be achieved in Indo-China and to assure the security of South-East Asia generally.The Foreign Secretary had discussed this situation with the ministers for External Affairs of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, andhad assured himself that they were in full agreement with his views.The Prime Minister said that he was sure that the Cabinet wouldendorse the policy which the Foreign Secretary was pursuing. Atthe same time it must be recognised that the fall of Dien Bien Phu,which now seemed inevitable, would afford great encouragement toCommunists throughout the world. We must seek to counter its effects by pressing forward, as soon as the Geneva Conference was over, the efforts to establish an effective system of collective defence for South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the message from the foreign secretary embodied in Geneva telegram No. 113.Parliament. 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, since the Prime Minister hadExpenses of     made on 14th April his statement on the Report of the Select Corn-Members,       mittee on Members&apos; Expenses, the Opposition had continued to press(Previous        their view that the Government should find time for the proposed reference:      debate on the Select Committee&apos;s Report.  They would expect thatCC. (54) 28th   the next Statement on Business on 6th May should include someConclusions,    indication of the Governments intentions.  If an early debate were minute 4.)       not arranged, there would be increasing bitterness between the parties in the House of Commons, which might be carried to such lengthsas to impede the conduct of Government business.  Moreover, therewas a risk that some Government supporters might join with mem-bers of other Parties in tabling a motion supporting the SelectCommittee&apos;s recommendations.   From the Governments point ofview, there would be disadvantages in holding the proposed debate on a motion inviting acceptance of the Select Committees recom-mendations whether that motion was tabled by the Oppositiononly, or whether it had the support of some members of all Parties.It would be much more convenient if, as the Cabinet had originallyenvisaged, the debate were held on a motion for the adjournmentand were not followed by a division.  As things now stood, it was unlikely that this could be arranged unless the Government were willing to provide time for the debate.In discussion various alternative courses were considered. It was,however, agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the side ofproviding Government time for the proposed debate if, in return, theOpposition were ready to agree that it should take place on a motion for the adjournment and that the House should not be invited to divide at the end of it. If this course were followed, a government spokesman could indicate at the end how the Government were dis-posed to view the matter in the light of the opinions expressed in the debate though he should make it clear that they reserved the right
to; review the position further before bringing forward any definite proposals. On this basis the debate might be held on 13th May. Ifthe Opposition declined this offer, it would be left to them to bring forward a motion on a Supply Day; and the Government would then have to table an amendment and to carry it with the support of theGovernment Whips.The Cabinet-Authorised the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip toinform the Opposition Leaders in the House of commons that the Government would be ready to find time on 13thMay for a debate on the Report of the Select Committee on members&apos; Expenses, on condition that the debate took placeon a motion for the adjournment and was not followed bya division.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd May, 1954.   .,.
