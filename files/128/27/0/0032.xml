Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.A motion for a compulsory time-table for the remaining stages of the Television Bill would be brought forward on 11th May.The Opposition leaders had accepted the suggestion that theReport of the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses should be debated on a motion for the adjournment, and this debate would beheld on 13th May.Education.Teachers&apos;Superannuation.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 30thConclusions,Minute 5.)Indo-China. 3.   The Minister of State drew attention to two telegrams from(Previous        the Foreign Secretary (Geneva telegrams No. 137 and No. 138)Reference:      suggesting that the Governments of the United Kingdom, UnitedC.C. (54) 31st    States, France, Australia and New Zealand should at once consider.Conclusions,    through the Five-Power Staff Agency, the military, political and minute 1.)       economic  problems  involved  in  supporting  any  internationalsettlement on Indo-China which might emerge from the geneva conference.  The Foreign  Secretary considered that such  an initiative would be helpful in maintaining the impetus of the plan for establishing a system of collective defence for South-East Asia andthe Western Pacific.   It was contemplated that the interested AsianGovernments would be kept informed of the progress made in the study of these problems.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) There was general agreement that such an initiative wouldbe valuable as showing our determination to make practical progress towards the establishment of a system of collective defence for this area.1. The Cabinet again reviewed the arguments for and againstproceeding with the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill. They were informed that, if the Second Reading of the Bill were debated in thefollowing week, it was as likely as not that the Government wouldbe defeated. Such a defeat, though it need not lead to a Dissolution,would damage the prestige of the Government and increase thedifficulties of maintaining discipline among Government supporters in the House of Commons. On the other hand, if the Bill were wholly abandoned, the Government would appear to be unable tocarry through a necessary measure of economy and there would beresentment among the majority of Government supporters who haddefended the principle of the Bill.Though these arguments were nicely balanced, the Cabinet feltthat there would be special disadvantages in proceeding with the Billin the following week. The Foreign Secretary faced a difficult situation at the Geneva Conference, where the Western Powers had failed to preserve the united front which they had shown during theearlier meeting in Berlin. United States leadership at the conference was uncertain, and it was possible that the French Government mightfall during the next few days. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s difficulties,already great, would certainly be increased if at this moment theUnited Kingdom Government suffered a defeat in the House ofCommons.The Cabinet-(1) Decided that the Second Reading of the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill should not be taken in the House ofCommons in the following week.(2) Agreed to consider again at their next meeting the future course of Parliamentary proceedings on this Bill.
2M*(b)* The Commonwealth Secretary said that at this stage it should suffice to keep the interested Asian Governments informed of theprogress made in these studies.(c) The timing of any announcement on this should be left tothe discretion of the Foreign Secretary, who was in the best positionto judge its effect on the course of the discussions at Geneva.The Cabinet Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should be authorised toproceed, if the state of the negotiations at the geneva conference still made this desirable, with the proposaloutlined in Geneva telegrams No. 137 and No. 138 forstudying, through the Five-Power Staff Agency, theproblems which would arise from a decision to support aninternational settlement on Indo-China; and invited theMinister of State to inform the Foreign Secretaryaccordingly.Goa. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-wealth Secretary and the Minister of State (C. (54) 159) on India&apos;claim to the Portuguese territory of Goa.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Portuguese Govern-ment had reminded the Foreign Secretary in this connection of theclaims which they might make for United Kingdom support underthe Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and under Article IV of theNorth Atlantic Treaty. The Indian Government, on the other hand,had invited us to confirm their view that neither of these treaty provisions had any bearing on the differences between them and thePortuguese over Goa.It was proposed that the Indian Government should be informed(i) that circumstances could arise in which the Portuguese couldlegally invoke these Treaties with respect to Goa; (ii) that we assumed that the Indian Government, in view of their repeated assurances that they intended to find a settlement by peaceful means, wouldtake no action which would give the Portuguese reasonable grounds for invoking these Treaties; and (iii) that, if the Treaties wereinvoked, both the United Kingdom and Indian Governments wouldbe placed in an extremely embarrassing position. When thePortuguese Government had been told that the position had been explained to. the Indian Government and had been informed of anyassurances that we might have received in reply, they would be advised against bringing this matter before the North atlantic council and assured of our readiness to do everything we could toreduce tension over Goa.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to make a communication to the Indian Government in the termsoutlined in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 159.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange that, when a reply had been received to this communication, advice shouldbe given to the Portuguese Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 of C. (54) 159.ProvisionalLegislativeProgramme:1954-55 SessionGeneral.5. The Cabinet considered proposals by the Lord Privy Seal(C. (54) 157) for a provisional legislative programme for the 1954-55session of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that, by the end of the present session,the Government would be able to claim, broadly speaking, that they
had carried through the legislation to which they had committed themselves and the Cabinet must, therefore, decide which of thealternative projects mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 of his memo-randum should be adopted as the main element in the legislative programme for the next (and perhaps the last) session of the present parliament. In making this choice the Cabinet must bear in mind that the session might prove to be shorter than earlier sessions of thepresent Parliament. Decisions on the main items of the programme should be taken soon in order that the necessary work of preparation and drafting might proceed.The Minister of Transport reminded the Cabinet that they had accepted a commitment to include a Road Traffic Bill in next session&apos;programme. In The Queen&apos;s Speech at the opening of the present session it had been stated that Ministers were &quot; attentively examining the Road Traffic Acts with a view to introducing further legislation toimprove road safety and promote orderly use of the roads.&quot;Attention was also drawn to the probable need for legislation to effect some of the economies in public expenditure which were nowin contemplation. This might make substantial demands on parliamentary time.The Cabinefs subsequent discussion was concerned with theproposals for (i) legislation on health, welfare and safety in non-industrial employment and closing hours of shops, and (ii) legislation necessary to permit the final dismantling of emergency powers.Safety and The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeWelfare. Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Labourand the Minister of Agriculture (C. (54) 122), proposing that theprovisional programme for the next session should include legislation on health, safety and welfare in non-industrial employment andclosing hours of shops, and a memorandum by the Lord President(C. (54) 128) reporting the views of the Home Affairs Committee onthis question.The Home Secretary said that the reports of the Gower&apos;s committee on these matters had been made in 1947-49 and it was becoming increasingly difficult to resist pressure from interestedorganisations for legislation to give effect to the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations. There was undoubtedly practical justification for such legislation, and the Government should consider whether they could afford to delay much longer reforms which affected so large a proportion of the working population. On the other hand, this legislation would occupy much Parliamentary time and would involveemployers generally in fresh obligations and expenditure,The Minister of Labour said that responsible trade union leadersattached considerable importance to this matter as well as to theproposals for a National Occupational Health Service on which theCabinet had on 28th April deferred a decision. There would be advantages in taking some action to satisfy them, but he recognisedthat these plans for further social progress must now be looked atafresh in conjunction with any proposals for securing economy in public expenditure.The Minister of Transport said that in principle it was certainlydifficult to justify the continued exclusion of railways from statutory requirements in respect of health, welfare and safety; but he believedthat any fresh expenditure which the British Transport commission might find it possible to incur in the immediate future ought to be devoted to increasing the wages of the more highly-skilled men ratherrather than to improving the conditions of employment of railway workers generally.The Lord President said that opinion in&apos; the Home AffairsCommittee on this matter had been very evenly divided but it hadbeen recognised that, however justifiable this legislation might be inprinciple, it was not likely to be viewed with favour by a majority ofGovernment supporters in Parliament or the country.
The President of the Board of Trade said that he would deprecatelegislation which would have the effect of adding to the existingdifficulties and handicaps of industrial employers.,, The Prime Minister said that in his view priority in further socialprogress should be accorded to improvement of the position of old-age and war-disability pensioners,. but plans for legislation on thelines recommended by the Gowers Committee should in the meantimecontinue to be studied.Emergency The Home Secretary said that in paragraph 4 of C. (54) 157 thePowers. possibility was mentioned that the whole structure of emergency powers might be abandoned before the end of the present Parliament.With the co-operation of his colleagues he had been able to bringabout a considerable reduction of these powers, but there were strong arguments for making a special effort to complete the process duringthe lifetime of the present Government. First, it was the Govern-menfs declared intention to dispense with all emergency powers which were not needed and to embody the remainder in permanent legislation. Secondly, the revocation of these powers would put itbeyond the power of a future Government to revive economic controlswithout fresh Parliamentary authority.In discussion the view was expressed that, while this aim was desirable in principle and in accord with Conservative opinion, thelegislation needed for its attainment would contain features whichwould be highly controversial and unpalatable to government supporters.The Prime Minister said that the project appeared to him, never-theless, to be one deserving of further study. It would be in keeping with the Governmenfs general theme and purpose, and it wouldinvolve no fresh expenditure of public money.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for his Committee on emergency Legislation to investigate the possibility ofdispensing altogether with emergency powers before theend of the present Parliament, and to report to theCabinet.(2) Appointed a Committee consisting of:  Lord Privy SealLord PresidentHome SecretaryChancellor of the ExchequerSecretary of State for ScotlandMinister of HousingChief whip to consider the provisional legislative programme forthe next session in the light of the Cabinefs discussion and to make recommendations thereon to the Cabinet.Mixed Service 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of organisation. State (C. (54) 160) on the recruitment of Ukrainians to the MixedRecruitment of Service Organisation (M.S.O.).Ukrainians. j^g Minister of State explained  that the  M.S.O.,  whichperformed certain auxiliary services for the British Army in theBritish Zone of Germany, was composed wholly of non-Germans,mainly Poles and some Baits. Ukrainian displaced personsrepresented the only important source from which new recruits couldbe drawn and, in spite of the possible political disadvantages of recruiting them, the Foreign Secretary had concluded that military
requirements made it necessary to do so. He therefore proposed toagree to their recruitment on the conditions set out in paragraph 7of C. (54)160.The Minister of Defence expressed support for this proposal.The Cabinet-Approved the recruitment of Ukrainians to the MixedService Organisation on the basis proposed in C. (54) 160.King George VI       7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofMemorial.       Works (C. (54) 158) seeking authority to approve the final scheme forthe King George VI Memorial.The Minister of Works said that a large measure of agreement on the form of this memorial had now been reached between thevarious personages and authorities concerned and, although he himself still felt some doubts about it, he recommended that heshould now be authorised to approve it under the Public StatuesAct, 1854, with a view to the final scheme being submitted for theapproval of Her Majesty The Queen.The Prime Minister said that it seemed to him to be preferable that, before any formal advice was tendered on this matter to theCrown, informal steps should be taken to find out whether thescheme for the memorial was likely to be acceptable to The queen and to the Queen Mother.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Works to ascertain informallywhether the proposed scheme for the George VI Memorialwas likely to be acceptable to Her Majesty The Queen andto Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th May, 1954.
