1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Opposition were delaying theprogress of the Committee Stage of the Housing Repairs and RentsBill; and, unless they could be brought to agree to a voluntary time-table, it would be necessary to apply a compulsory time-table pro-viding for the completion of the Committee Stage by 18th March.If this course had to be adopted, the time-table motion would be debated on the floor of the House on 22nd February.In view of the approaching end of the Four-Power Meeting inBerlin, it would be necessary to grant the Opposition^ request for a two-day debate on Foreign Affairs. It would meet the foreign secretary&apos;s convenience if this were held on 24th and 25th February,without any earlier statement by him; and every effort would bemade to persuade the Opposition to accept this arrangement. Theymight, however, press the suggestion that, if the debate could not beheld earlier in the week, it should be preceded by the issue of a white Paper summarising the results of the Berlin Meeting.2. The Minister of Education reported that considerable oppo-sition had developed among Government supporters to the Bill toincrease the superannuation contributions of teachers. She had,however, addressed a meeting of Government supporters on thisquestion and she understood that many of those attending it were now persuaded of the need for the Bill. She was satisfied that it represented a just and fair settlement, and that the Governmentshould proceed with it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Bill was necessaryfor the purpose of limiting Exchequer liability on sound financiallines. The only alternative was to ask the taxpayers to continueto pay  2-J millions a year toward the cost of teachers&apos; pensionsbecause the teachers were unwilling to pay their fair share. he recommonded that Ministers should continue to explain informally to private groups of Government supporters the objects of the bill and the justification for it. He would willingly play his part in this.He would hope that by this means the way could be prepared for taking the Second Reading of the Bill in the House of Commonsearly in March.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Education would continue their efforts to rallysupport for the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill.3. The Prime Minister drew attention to a telegram fromKhartoum (Khartoum Telegram No. 28) reporting a speech madeby the Prime Minister of the Sudan on the occasion of the anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement. The speech was strongly biased in favour of Egypt, and contained statements tothe effect that the Sudan would never consider herself free unlessthe Suez Canal was evacuated, and that Britain should realise thatthe time had passed for forcible occupation of other people&apos;s lands.These hostile sentiments would be ill-received in this country.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.-1 B 2
4. The Minister of State said that the Four-Power meeting in Berlin would be concluded before the end of the week. It was already clear that no agreement would be reached over germany or Austria, but there was still a possibility of some agreement abouta Conference on the Far East.The Prime Minister said that, even though no decisions were reached, some advantage might accrue from the fact that there hadbeen no violent disharmony in the conduct of the discussions andno lasting sense of frustration at their conclusion. The cabinet would wish to have an early opportunity of hearing the foreign secretary&apos;s account of the Meeting; and, if it were convenient tohim, the Cabinet might meet for that purpose on the afternoon of22nd February.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (54) 52) suggesting that the United Kingdom shouldtake a 50 per cent, share in the cost to be incurred by the UnionMiniere du Haut Katanga (a Belgian Company) in respect of thecompletion of a treatment plant and further exploration work foruranium.The Lord President said that the Belgian Congo was a majorsource of uranium for the Combined Development Agency (C.D.A.)and we provided 50 per cent, of the Agency&apos;s funds. When, early in1953, we had hoped to secure our uranium needs from Australia,the Cabinet had decided to limit to 10 per cent, the United Kingdom&apos;s share in any further expenditure by the C.D.A. in the Congo. Ourhopes of meeting the bulk of our uranium needs from Australia had,however, been disappointed and we were still dependent on thesupplies available to the C.D.A. Moreover, the Cabinefs decisionto limit our share in any further expenditure by the C.D.A. in the congo had been taken under a misapprehension. In fact, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom were each obliged by the terms oftheir agreement to pay 50 per cent, of new expenditure incurred bythe C.D.A. If the United States took more than 50 per cent, of theuranium mined, we were proportionately credited with dollars inthe dollar account supporting the agreement. If we were to reduce our contribution in sterling below the 50 per cent., the only result would be that we should be debited by that amount in the dollaraccount. There seemed, therefore, no alternative but to continue tomake a 50 per cent, contribution to the cost of new work undertaken by the C.D.A.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that there was no alternative to the course&apos; proposed by the Lord President. Hesuggested, however, that we should in addition make some tokenpurchases of uranium from Canada and continue to keep in mind thepossibility of future purchases from Australia. We should not getourselves so far committed to obtaining uranium supplies from theC.D.A. that we no longer had the need or the resources to buy fromthe Commonwealth.The Commonwealth Secretary supported the views expressed bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should con-tinue for the time being their participation in the CombinedDevelopment Agency, on the basis of a 50 per cent,contribution towards new expenditure incurred by it; butinvited the Lord President to arrange for some tokenpurchases of uranium from Canada and to keep in mind thepossibility of future purchases of uranium from Australia.
East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C.(54)4thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister(C. (54) 46) covering a report by a Committee under his Chairmanshipwhich had considered, in the light of the Cabinets discussion on18th January, the possibility of extending trade with countries in theSoviet bloc.This Committee had agreed that, on the new strategic hypothesisof a prolonged period of international tension without major war, itwould be reasonable that the restriction on exports to the soviet bloc should in future be confined to goods of direct military valuetogether with some which, though not of direct military value, had a significant indirect military importance. The Committee had con-cluded that, if that principle were applied, the existing Embargo Listof Strategic Industrial Goods could be reduced from 263 items toabout 135. Appendix I of their report contained a revised version of this List comprising 133 items, on which full agreement had beenreached by all the interested Departments of the United KingdomGovernment. The questions reserved for decision by the.cabinet were: (i) whether copper should be added to this List; and(ii) whether there should also be added three further types of machine tool whose export to the Soviet bloc had been the subject of criticismduring the controversy on this question in 1950.The Cabinet first considered whether the export of copper tothe Soviet countries should continue to be prohibited. In favour ofthis course it was argued that copper was an important factor in munitions&apos; production and that the Soviet countries would be short of it in war. It would therefore be to our advantage to prevent them from building up a strategic stock of copper for use in war.It was also argued that we should have a better chance of persuading the Americans to accept our revised Embargo List if it includedcopper.On the other side it was pointed out that the peace-time uses of copper were so numerous that it must be regarded as a basic industrialproduct. Its continued denial to the Soviet countries would be moreconsistent with the earlier policy of seeking to hamper their generalindustrial development. There was a prospect of a substantialworld surplus of copper, which would make it easier for the Sovietcountries to satisfy their requirements despite any embargo by countries in the Paris Group. If the embargo were lifted, sterling area countries could expect to secure a significant share of the expanding market in Soviet countries; and much of the dealingswould be conducted through the London Metal Exchange.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of excluding copper from the revisedEmbargo List which was to be discussed with the United states authorities even though some concession might have to be madeto them on this point in the course of those discussions.As regards machine tools, it was argued that the three disputeditems (certain types of vertical boring and turning mills, large centrelathes and large planing machines) had no greater military significancethan some of the items which it was proposed to free from embargo.Moreover, two of these had hitherto been subject only to quantitativecontrol; and it might prove difficult to persuade the other membersof the Paris Group to agree that they should henceforward be subjectto embargo. There would be special difficulty in proposing the embargo of large planing machines, since machines for planingarmour-plate were already subject to embargo.On the other hand, it was argued that these large machine toolswould be generally supposed to be required for munitions&apos; produc-tion; and it was recalled that they had been so represented byConservative spokesmen in the debate in the House of commons on 18th September, 1950. Even though circumstances had changed since then, the Opposition were bound to charge the Government withinconsistency if they now proposed a revised Embargo List which did45742-1 B 3
not include these particular types of machine tool. Such a chargev/ould tend to confuse the issue and to weaken the governments general case for seeking enlarged opportunities of trade with theSoviet countries.It was the general view of the Cabinet that in these circum-stances the three types of heavy machine tool discussed in para-graph 6 of the report annexed to C. (54) 46 should be includedin the revised Embargo List of Strategic Industrial Goods.As regards the tactics to be followed in presenting these pro-posals to the United States Government, it was agreed that the revised Embargo List should be put forward as the result of applying a new policy consistent with the new hypothesis of a prolonged period of international tension without major war. It wassuggested in discussion that it might be inexpedient to inviteMr. Harold Stassen, the Director of the Foreign Operations Admini-stration, to come to London to discuss this question in person both because this might weaken the influence which he could exercise onthis matter in Washington, and also because the subsequent negotia-tion of a new agreement in the Paris Group might be made moredifficult if it were known that it had been the subject of prior f[. jconsultation between ourselves and the Americans. The PrimeMinister said that he would prefer to put the suggestion toMr. Stassen and leave him to form his own judgment on both these points.The Cabinet (I) Approved the revised Embargo List of Industrial Goods setout in Appendix I of the report annexed to C. (54) 46,subject only to the addition of the three types of machine tool mentioned in paragraph 6 of that report.(2) Agreed that it would be a reasonable policy in presentcircumstances that the countries represented in the paris group should henceforward be free to export to theSoviet bloc any goods save those included in the munitions List, the Atomic Energy List and the List of strategic Industrial Goods revised in accordance with conclusion (1) above.(3) Agreed that this revised List of Strategic Industrial goods should be presented to the United States Government asthe result of applying a new policy consistent with the     g .new hypothesis of a prolonged period of international     f &apos;tension without major war.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would ascertain whetherthe Director of the Foreign Operations Administrationof the United States Government would be willing tocome to London to discuss this matter in person with theUnited Kingdom Ministers concerned; and, if that could. not be arranged, would consider by what other means weshould seek to reach agreement with the United StatesGovernment on a new policy for extending trade with theSoviet bloc on the lines approved by the Cabinet.(5) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty.would submit, to the Cabinet a separate report on the export of ships to countries in the Soviet bloc.7. The Cabinet discussed the timing and presentation of theproposed increases in Service pay.As regards presentation, the Minister of Labour said that awk-ward comparisons could be drawn between the increases proposed for skilled tradesmen in the Services and the increases claimed inthe current wages disputes in the engineering and shipbuilding industries. It was therefore important that the scheme should beso presented as to cause the least possible embarrassment to the armed Forces.Pay. : .(previous reference: .C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,inutc 3.)^
Sill8. The Prime Minister drew attention to a telegram from theGovernor of Kenya stating that there was now some possibility thatGeneral China might be ready to arrange for a substantial numberof Mau Mau rebels to surrender under the conditions of the amnestyoffer and that, if he were able to bring this about, this would justifythe commutation of his sentence. The Prime Minister expressed theview that, once negotiations had been opened with General China onthat basis, it would not be justifiable to execute the death sentenceeven if the negotiations failed.The Colonial Secretary did not dissent from that view. he himself adhered to his original opinion that this sentence should havebeen carried into effect, despite any attempt by General China topurchase his life by an offer to give information or to procure the surrender of a number of his followers. But the exercise of clemencywas a matter for the Governors discretion, in which he did not propose to intervene.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements.Detention of The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Colonial Secre-MauMau tary (C. (54) 50) recommending that more effective steps should beSupporters. taken to neutralise the passive supporters of Mau Mau and, inparticular, the large numbers of unemployed Kikuyu who had driftedinto Nairobi. He proposed that the Governor of Kenya should beauthorised to hold substantially increased numbers of these persons in detention and that, while under detention, they should be required toundertake Useful employment. This course had been recommendeddespite the fact that it was thought to involve a technical breach ofthe Forced Labour Convention of 1930 and of the Convention on human Rights adopted by the Council of Europe.The Colonial Secretary said that, since his memorandum was circulated, the legal difficulties had been further discussed with repre-sentatives of the other Departments concerned. As a result it was now agreed that breach of the two Conventions could be avoided ifKenya.General China.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute 8.)employers&apos; representatives in their efforts to resist those claims. he hoped that the Service Ministers would do their utmost to meet his views on the presentation of the scheme.As regards timing, the Cabinet agreed that the announcementof the scheme must be made before the debates in the House ofCommons on the Service Estimates. It would be preferable that ageneral announcement should be made in the Defence Debate on 2nd March, and that the details should be published later that day in the form of a White Paper. An early announcement was madeall the more desirable by the partial disclosures which had alreadybeen published in certain newspapers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the scheme of the increases in Service pay whichthe Cabinet had approved on 10th February should be announced in general terms in the course of the DefenceDebate on 2nd March, and that the details should bepublished later that day in a White Paper.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consult with the Ministerof Labour on the terms of the general announcementand of the proposed White Paper, with a view to reducing as far as practicable the difficulties to which this announcement was likely to give rise in the settlement ofthe current wages disputes in the engineering and ship-building industries.
the employment to be undertaken in the detention camps were insome way related to the emergency. It was therefore proposed thatthe regulation authorising compulsory employment should containwords to the effect that any person detained in a special detentioncamp might be usefully employed in work which, in the opinion ofthe officer in charge, would assist in bringing the emergency to anend. He proposed to instruct the Governor to make the regulationin this form. In these circumstances it woiild probably be unnecessary to pay market rates of wages for work undertaken byprisoners in the detention camps.The Minister of Labour welcomed this modification of the pro-posal originally put forward in C. (54) 50. It would be much easier to defend this modified plan if it were challenged at an InternationalLabour Conference or elsewhere.The Cabinet (2) Approved the proposals for large-scale detention of MauMau supporters in Kenya, and for requiring them toundertake useful employment while under detention, onthe basis proposed in the discussion; and authorised theColonial Secretary to instruct the Governor of Kenyaaccordingly.british honduras.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 70thConclusions,Minute 6.)9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (54) 56 and 57) recommending the immediate publica-tion of certain documents indicating that the leaders of the People&apos;sUnited Party (P.U.P.) in British Honduras had sought aid fromGuatemala.The Colonial Secretary drew attention to his proposal inC. (54) 56 that publication of the documents contained in Annex Ato that paper and Annex B to C. (54) 57, which he recommended,should be followed by the immediate appointment of an enquiry into their authenticity and into other current allegations of links betweenthe P.U.P. and Guatemala. The alternative course would be to publish the documents and await public reactions to them beforeinstituting any enquiry.In discussion there was support for the view that it would be prudent to take all practicable steps to establish the authenticity ofthe documents in question before they were published, and that anyenquiry which might be instituted for this purpose should not be confined to that narrow issue but should extend to current allegations of links between the P.U.P. and Guatemala generally.The Colonial Secretary said that this course would be acceptable to him. The Cabinet should realise, however, that such an enquiry,even if it could be initiated on a confidential basis, would be boundto become a matter of public knowledge before long.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Ministers of Latin-American States were due to meet in conference in Caracas on1st March and there would be some advantage in deferring for aslong as possible any charges of interfering in the affairs of british honduras which we might eventually find it necessary to bring, if only by implication, against the Guatemalan Government.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for an enquiry tobe held into current allegations of links between the P.U.P.and Guatemala, with particular reference to the documentsannexed to his memoranda, and to defer publishing these documents until this was made necessary by the course ofthe enquiry.
National FoodSurvey.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 4.)Betting,Lotteries and gaming.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute 10.)1.1. The Cabinet again had before them memoranda by theHome Secretary (C. (53) 317 and C. (54) 41) on the recommenda-tions made in the Report of the Royal Commission on Betting,Lotteries and Gaming (Cmd. 8910).The Home Secretary said that this matter had lost its immediateurgency as Mr. G. R. Mitchison, M.P., had now indicated that he did not intend to proceed with his Motion and resolution on thesubject, which were down as Second Order for 19th February.  On10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (C. (54) 42) on the question whether, before publication of the National Food Survey&apos;s Annual Reports for 1952and 1953, the Government should announce special measures to helpfamilies with three or more children.The Minister of Food said that these Annual Reports, whichwould become available during the course of the present year andwhich he would be pressed to publish without delay, would showthat the nutritional position was generally satisfactory and, inparticular, that there was no ground for anxiety about the diet of old-age pensioners. They would, however, reveal a deterioration inthe nutritional standards, as reflected in consumption of calciumand protein expressed as a percentage of need, of families with three or more children, which accounted for 20 per cent, of the population and about 40 per cent, of schoolchildren. This deterioration had notbeen halted by the increase made in 1952 in family allowances. while he had no specific proposal to make at this stage, it was for con-sideration whether the Government ought not to be ready with plans for helping such families, for example by increasing the amount of milk supplied free to children in schools.The Minister of Health said that the evidence available in his department for example, the weights of children entering the Stateschools tended to confirm that there had been some deterioration in the health standards of children belonging to larger families. it seemed desirable, however, that the problem should be examined in greater detail before specific remedies were considered and it mightbe found convenient to refer it for such examination to the inter-departmental standing Committee on Medical and NutritionalProblems.The Minister of Education said that, when these Reports were published, the Government were likely to incur renewed criticism for having raised the price of school meals.It was the general view of the Cabinet that several aspects ofthe problem required closer investigation. For example, did consul-tation of three thousand households every quarter constitute anadequate basis for Government action in a matter of this kind? was it the case that family allowances were proving inadequate or rather that they were not spent on objects of the kind for which they were intended? Did the decreased consumption of calcium and proteinin larger families reflect under-nourishment of children or of parents?The Cabinet (1) Agreed that publication of the National Food Survey Reportsfor 1952 and 1953 should not be delayed on account ofthe points raised in C. (54) 42.(2) Invited the Minister of Food and the Minister of Health toobtain the comments of the inter-departmental standingCommittee on Food and Nutritional Problems on the findings of those Reports on the nutritional standards of larger families and on the points raised in the cabinets discussion; and to report further to the Cabinet on thisquestion in the light of the Committee&apos;s comments.
\othe other hand, the subject was bound to attract public attentionbefore long owing to the need for an enquiry into the state of theLeeds Police Force, which had become seriously corrupted throughthe prevalence of illegal betting in that city. He would, therefore,welcome early authority from his colleagues to explore, in informal discussions with Opposition leaders, the possibilities of promoting asolution to the problem in an atmosphere as free as possible fromParty controversy.The Cabinet-Agreed to consider the Home Secretary&apos;s memoranda(C.  (53)  317  and  C.  (54)  41)  at  their meeting  on24th February.International 12.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLabour Minister of Labour (C. (54) 25) seeking authority for the issue of aConference, White Paper declaring the Governments attitude to three Conven-1952. tions and three Recommendations adopted by the InternationalLabour Conference in 1952.The Minister of Labour said that he was proposing ratification of one Convention, acceptance of one Recommendation, and rejection of the remaining two Conventions and two Recommendations on technical grounds. The general effect of his proposals wassummarised in paragraph 3 of C. (54) 25. They would not involveeither legislation or additional public expenditure.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (54) 25 for dealing with the conventions and Recommendations of the InternationalLabour Conference, 1952, and authorised the Minister ofLabour to present these proposals to Parliament in a white paper.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th February, 1954.
