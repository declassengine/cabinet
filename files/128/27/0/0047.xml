The most suitable forum forsuch explanations would probably be the Conservative Members&apos;Foreign Affairs Committee, and an early meeting of this body might,therefore, be arranged at which the Foreign Secretary and theSecretary of State for War might speak.&quot; The Foreign Secretary said that he would be ready to meetConservative Members as suggested, but it did not seem necessarythat action on the Government&apos;s proposals should be deferred in themeantime.Balances.(previous reference:-CC(54)2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)The Cabinet- &apos;...   (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the defencev-    negotiations with the Egyptian Government to be resumed on the basis of the agreed minute annexed toC. (54) 220.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War and the Chief Whip, to arrangefor the military grounds for the proposed settlement with egypt to be explained in confidence to interestedGovernment supporters at an early date.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as the defence negotiations were now to be resumed, he hoped that this opportunitycould be taken to remove the restriction on Egypfs withdrawals ofher sterling balances in accordance with the Sterling ReleasesAgreement. In return for this the Egyptian Government were now prepared to facilitate increased trade with this country.The Foreign Secretary said that he would prefer that this shouldnot be handled as part of the defence negotiations. Indeed, there might be advantage in withdrawing the restriction before the defence negotiations were resumed. ,The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to decide, in.consultation with the Foreign Secretary, the appropriate moment: for lifting the existing restriction limiting the&apos; exercise of Egypfs right to draw on her sterling balancesibqqui; is accordance with the provisions of the Sterling Releases,;&apos;-*r*;-&apos;-&quot;Agreement.   - -r   v&quot;&quot;\
Eas*/W*s*TiT.Cz.(previous reference: -C.C(54)45thConclusions,Minute 1.). 3. ITie Chancellor, of the Exchequer said that in washington telegram No. 1387 the President of the Board of Trade had sought authority to conclude an agreement with Mr. Stassen on therelaxations to be made in existing restrictions on trade with countriesin the Soviet Woe. At his request the President had how provided,in Washington telegrams Nos. 1399 and- 1400, further information about the nature of the proposed agreement and the Justification for it. While it seemed clear that some features of the agreement wouldbe likely to be criticised in Parliament, his personal impression wasthat on balance it would be to our advantage.The Minister of State; Board of Trade, expressed agreement withthis view. It was true that under the proposed agreement we shouldforgo the opportunity of supplying the Russians with a rolling millworth some  17 millions, but oh the other side a useful field of trade would be opened up, offering scope for an increase of our exports to countries in the Soviet bloc amounting to some  30 millions. Itmust also be remembered that, if this opportunity were riot takento reach agreement with the United States Government, there wouldbe little prospect of any early relaxation of the existing restrictionson East/West trade. At the same time it was difficult for us toaccept the condition that the agreement should not be brought intoeffect so long as the Indo-China situation remained uncertain. Itwas most important that any restrictions which were to be removedshould be lifted before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess.It was, therefore, for consideration whether we should not warnMr. Stassen, when concluding the proposed agreement, that if nodate for introducing the proposed relaxations should be fixed at the ministerial meeting between the two countries which the UnitedStates Government proposed should be held immediately before theforthcoming meeting of the Consultative Group, we might well haveto proceed on the basis of whatever agreement the ConsultativeGroup might reach.The Minister of Supply agreed that the proposed agreement would be likely to be to our advantage. On the other hand, theAmerican arguments for declining to agree to our supplying atin-plate rolling mill to the Russians were not, in fact, sound and inhis view one further attempt should, if possible, be made to secureAmercan agreement to the raising of the embargo on this item. If,however, this should not be considered practicable, we should atleast make it clear to Mr. Stassen that we were only agreeing to this in the interests of securing a settlement and on the understandingthat he would reconsider it before the end of the year.The Foreign Secretary said that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington was strongly against making any further attempt tosecure the inclusion of rolling mills at this stage, and he would prefer to accept his advice. He was also disinclined to threaten at: thisstage that we might feel compelled to put relaxations of restrictionsinto force without American agreement to our doing so, if that agreement were indefinitely deferred. Generally, he was in favour of concluding an immediate agreement with the United StatesGovernment on the basis now proposed, but of making it clear toMr. Stassen that we should find it difficult to defer indefinitely the putting into force of any relaxations upon which the ConsultativeGroup might agree.The Cabinet- &apos; . iInvited the Minister of State, Board of Trade, to inform theL :  &apos;7 President of the Board of Trade in Washington that he had   &quot;&quot;        the authority of the Cabinet to conclude an agreement withMr. Stassen on the basis proposed, provided that he warned&quot;/      -  Mr. Stassen (i) that, if no agreement about the timing of any-jijfi .ij - agreed relaxations could be reached at the proposed further-&quot;&quot;&quot;-Ministerial meeting, we should be faced&apos;with a position
which it would be very difficult for us to hold; arid (ii) thatwe could not accept his arguments for excluding rolling millsfrom the list of items on which the embargo should be lifted,and were only agreeing to their exclusion in the interests ofsecuring a settlement and on the understanding thatMr. Stassen would reconsider this question again before theend of the year.      -Washington . 4. The Cabinet considered what steps would need to be takenTalks. to inform Parliament of the results, of the discussions which the(Previous Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary had held during their reference: recent visit to Washington and Ottawa.

On the other band, no Government time was availableMinute 1.) for a debate on foreign affairs before the summer recess, and thereParliamentary was as vet n0 indication that the Opposition would wish to make oneDebate. of ^eh Supply Days available for this purpose.  It was the general view of the Cabinet that in the circumstances the best course wouldbe for the Prime Minister to make as full a statement as possible earlyin the following week.During the course of the meeting the Chief Whip ascertained, atthe Cabinefs request, that the Leader of the Opposition would be content if a statement were made in the House of Commons on12th July.The Cabinet-     :(i) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement in the House of Commons on 12th July on the results ofthe visit which he and the Foreign Secretary had recently made to Washington and Ottawa.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to send advancecopies of this statement to other commonwealth governments...........;.____________............________AngtoSoviet The Cabinet were informed of a proposal that the Prime MinisterMeeting.        might meet M. Malenkov, with a view to exploring the possibility of arranging a meeting of Heads of Governments of the United States,United Kingdom and Soviet Union.The Cabinefs discussion on this proposal is recorded separately.Atomic Energy.      5.   The Prime Minister said that the Defence Policy CommitteeWeapons       had approved, on 16th June, a proposal that our &quot;atomic weaponsProgramme.    programme should be so adjusted as to allow for the production ofhydrogen bombs in this country.    His recent discussions in washington and Ottawa had been conducted on the basis that weshould produce hydrogen bombs.  He therefore suggested that theCabinet should now formally approve the proposal that hydrogen1    bombs should be produced in this country, and should endorse the- preliminary action which had already been taken to this end.  .The Prime Minister said that we could not expect to maintain our influence as a world Power unless we possessed the most&quot;    * up-to-date nuclear weapons. The primary aim of our policy was to- : prevent major war; and the possession of these weapons was now the main deterrent to a potential aggressor.  He had no doubt that-..     the best hope of preserving world peace was to make it clear to* potential aggressors that they had no hope of shielding themselves. . from a crushing retaliatory use of atomic power. For this purposev. .1 i; %&apos;:Vthe Western Powers must provide themselves, not only with ar.&apos;-i!.&quot;s-..-.        sufficient supply of up-to*iate nuclear weapons, but also with a

The President had at first seemed ready togive this serious consideration and had discussed the possibility that, if such a meeting were held in London, he might attend theopening, and perhaps the concluding, stages - being represented in-the interval by the Vice-President and the Secretary of State.Towards the end of the visit the President had been&apos;rather lessforthcoming, possibly as a result of consultations with his Secretaryof State, and had given the impression that it would be difficult for him to assent to such a meeting at the present time having regardto the state of public opinion in the United States,    Nevertheless,at his Press Conference on 30th Tune, he had said publicly that onthis question he differed more in emphasis than in substance from-the views which had been publicly expressed by the Prime Minister.He had recalled that he had always expressed his readiness to confer with anybody if the deeds of the other side convinced him that therewas sincerity there.     He had also said that the United States weresincere in their search for peace and that, if there were any proof that the other side would keep their agreements, he thought that&quot;all of us would be quite content to do almost anything to advance that cause&quot;.Ii i&apos; &apos;i ,The Prime Minister said that, while these .conversations with the President had related to the possibility of ameeting on a three-Power or four-Power basis, he had formed theimpression while in Washington that the President would not be sur-prised if he sought an opportunity for a bilateral meeting withM. Malenkov,    When he had previously suggested this in May, 1953,the President had deprecated ouch ci &quot;solitary pilgrimato&quot;,    IWitmuch had happened since then, and he believed that the President .would not now seel^to dissuade him from undertaking such a mission.On his journey home he had decided, after consultation with theForeign Secretary, to send a personal message to M, Molotov askinghow the Soviet Government would view the idea of a friendly meeting&quot;with no agenda and no object but to find a reasonable way of livingside by side in growing confidence, easement and prosperity&quot;.Such a meeting might be the prelude to a larger re-union, though hehad no warrant to say this beyond his own hopes.    The draft of his proposed message had been seen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who had suggested some valuable improvements;  and the messageThe circulation of this paper lias been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........Mv..7^...
had been despatched to Moscow on 4th July (Foreign Office tele gram-&apos;.&apos;to Moscow No. 873).     On his return to London the previous evening &apos;he had received a friendly reply which included the statement that,&apos; : . ..in the view of the Soviet Government, such a personal contact might serve to pave the way for a broader meeting, if this were acceptedby all the parties interested in easing international tension andin strengthening peace.    Later in the evening he had discussed this exchange of messages with the Foreign Secretary,1 the lord president, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the. Minister of      - .&apos;&quot;Housing.    With their agreement he had conveyed to President  -Eisenhower the substance of his message to M, Molotov and the text of the latter&apos;s reply and had invited an expression of the presidents views (Foreign Office telegram to Washington No. 3209).M, Molotov&apos;s message had been delivered in person by the Soviet Ambassador in London.    The Prime minister had taken the opportunity of making it clear to the ambassador that his was a personal message on which the Cabinet had not yetbeen consulted, and also that it had been sent without specific prior consulation with President Eisenhower.It would be for the Cabinet&apos;to decide, when    .. .President Eisenhower&apos;s views were known, what further message     ishould be sent to M, Molotov.    If a definite proposal fox* a meeting were to be made, place and timing would be important.    The .mootingcould hardly be held before the proceedings of the Geneva&apos;Conference/had been brought to a head, and this might mean that it could not take place before the middle of August.    He would be reluctant to ,go to Moscow, and he hoped that the Russians might agree&quot; to come--to Stockholm or Vienna.    As regards a larger meeting, it was evident that the Americans would not assent to this unless the-Russians gave some practical proof of their sincerity.&apos;   It was his i hope that they might be persuaded to indicate for this purpose a firmintention to conclude a peace treaty for Austria.- &apos; THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that theCabinet should now await the expression of the Presidents views.They should also take account of the probable reactions of this project upon, public opinion in Europe.    Such a meeting was likely to arouse particular apprehensions in Western Germany.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he had had anopportunity for reflection since seeing these messages on the        -    .;previous evening.    He was glad that the Cabinet were not being askedto express a final opinion that day,, for he would certainly wish to reserve his opinion until President Eisenhower&apos;s views were avail-able ,      If the President were critical of this project, that.wouldweigh heavily with him.    For in present circumstances lie thought &apos;. it more than ever important to avoid anything which might seriouslyimpair the partnership between this country and the United States.-At the end of the discussion THE PRIMEMINISTER said that the texts of his exchange of messages withM. Molotov and of his message to President Eisenhower would be circulated to members of the Cabinet for their personal information.&apos;He would also arrange for his Private Secretary to make available
to any member of the Cabinet who wished to see them the earliermessages which, he had exchanged with President Eisenhower onthis subject in 1953.The Cabinet -(1)     Agreed to resume their discussion ofthis question as soon as the Prime minister had received a reply to his message to president Eisenhower.AtomicSnergy1TechnicalCo-operation; AtomicI Bank Plan(previous reference:C.C.(54) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)TritiumAt the Prime Minister&apos;s requestLORD CHERWELL gave the Cabinet a summary report of thediscussions which had been held in Washington and Ottawa on atomicquestions.The Americans had indicated their readiness toco-operate more fully with us in future over the whole field of atomic energy development .     For the moment this full co-operation was precluded by the terms of their legislation, but most of thesebarriers would be removed by the amending legislation which, it was hoped, would be passed before Congress rose for the summer recess.Meanwhile, the Americans had undertaken to provide us with full information of the effects of their hydrogen bombs.    They were alsoready to give us details of the dimensions and characteristics oftheir bombs, so that R,A,F, aircraft could be adapted to carry theUnited States type of bomb.    They were anxious to collaborate with us in the interpretation of intelligence about atomic research and production in the Soviet Union.     To the extent that this involveddisclosure of their own atomic secrets, this had hitherto been pre-.eluded by the, terms of their legislation; but it was now hoped thatthere could be closer collaboration in this when the amending legislation had been passed.The Americans were anxious to proceed withtheir plan for an international pool of uranium for the developmentof the civil use of atomic energy, despite the refusal of the SovietGovernment to co-operate in this scheme.    In view of the extentto which the Americans were now prepared to assist us in thedevelopment of our atomic projects, it had been thought inexpedient to offer further opposition to the Atomic Bank Plan.    We had there-fore agreed that international discussions might go forward, but some time was likely to elapse before an effective international agreement was concluded.The Canadian Government had undertaken to explore the possibility of providing us with supplies of tritium,which would enable us to expedite the production of atomic weapons :in this country.The Cabinet  -(2)     Took note of this statement byLord Cherwell.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.7th July, 1954.
multiplicity of bases from which a retaliatory attack could be launched. They must put themselves in a position to ensure that nosurprise attack, however large, could wholly destroy their power of effective retaliation. These considerations, in his view, made it essential that we should manufacture hydrogen bombs in the UnitedKingdom so as to be able to make our contribution to this deterrentinfluence. -The Lord President said that he accepted the strategic argumentoutlined by the.Prime Minister. Plans were now in preparation forthe. production of the hydrogen bomb in this country. If furtherscientists could be recruited, this additional production could beundertaken without serious disruption of the existing programme forthe manufacture of atomic weapons. Some preliminary steps to thisend had already been taken with the approval of the Defence PolicyCommittee.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet had had no notice that this question was to be raised and he hoped they would not beasked to take a final decision on it until they had had more time toconsider it.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at alater meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.7th July, 1954.
