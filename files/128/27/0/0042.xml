Indo-China. 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had received from President(Previous        Eisenhower a message asking whether the statements made by the reference:      new Prime Minister of France were to be interpreted as evidence ofC.C. (54) 39th a readiness to surrender completely in South-East Asia, and invitingConclusions,    an expression of his views on the problems which would then arise.Minute 1.)      The Prime Minister said that he had prepared, and discussed with theForeign Secretary, a draft of a reply to this enquiry which might serve as a basis for their forthcoming discussions in Washington on thecurrent problems of South-East Asia and the Middle East.In discussion of this draft, which was read to the Cabinet, thefollowing points were made:  (a) The concluding words of the second paragraph should be adjusted so as to give further emphasis to the importance of securingthe support of Asian countries for a system of collective defence inSouth-East Asia.(b) The second part of the first sentence of paragraph 5 couldbe omitted, as the objective of &quot; building the world defensive frontagainst Communist aggression &quot; was sufficiently stressed in a laterparagraph.(c) In the final sentence of paragraph 5, the area of disputeremaining in the Anglo-Egyptian defence negotiations would bebetter described as &quot;limited &quot; rather than &quot; small.&quot;(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that, when we hadreduced our military commitment in Egypt, the resulting saving in overseas military expenditure would not be wholly offset by theacceptance of an increased military commitment in South-East Asia.The Prime Minister said that he would certainly look for a netsaving as a result of the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, andin his forthcoming conversations with President Eisenhower he wouldnot fail to emphasise our urgent need to reduce our overseas military expenditure. The Foreign Secretary said that, with this inview, he hoped to secure American agreement to the early with-drawal, or substantial reduction, of our forces in Korea. As regardsMalaya, though large reinforcements might not be immediatelyrequired, it was important that we should be seen to be strong enough to hold our position there even though Siam&apos;s independencewas undermined by Communist encroachment.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) to(c) above, the message which the Prime Minister proposedto send to President Eisenhower on future policy in South-East Asia and the Middle East. (This was subsequentlydespatched in Foreign Office telegram No. 2883 of21st June.)(2) Took note that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary,in their forthcoming discussions in Washington, wouldstress our urgent need to reduce the burden of our over-seas military expenditure.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at a meeting heldearlier that afternoon the alternative means of improving the financialposition of Members, either by subsistence allowances or by cashreimbursement of expenses, had been put before the Executive Com-mittee of the 1922 Committee. The possibility had been mentioned that, if a scheme of subsistence allowances were adopted, it mightbe found possible to increase the rate of the proposed day allowancefrom 125. 6d. to  1. Four members of the Committee had favouredsubsistence allowances, though some of them had recognised thatcash reimbursement of expenses would be more likely to be accept-able to Labour Members and, therefore, to the House as a whole.
CC 42 (54)These members had based their preference on the ground that sub-sistence allowances would be less open to misrepresentation as aconcealed salary increase, and would be more readily understood and accepted by opinion in the country. Seven members of the Com-mittee had favoured cash reimbursement of expenses on the groundthat it would be more dignified than payment of subsistence allow-ances. Three members of the Committee had preferred that no improvement whatever should be made in Members&quot; remunerationat the present time, but one of these had said that he would preferreimbursement of expenses if it should be decided that some improve-ment must be made. The Committee as a whole had expressed thehope that a free vote of the House would be allowed both upon any resolution and upon the necessary Supplementary Estimate.In addition, the following detailed points had been made:  (a) The hope had been expressed that nothing would be saidpublicly by the Government which would give any encouragement to the idea of a non-contributory pension scheme for Members.(b) One member of the Committee had supported the idea ofrelating Members&apos; pay to that of the Civil Service, but the difficultiesof any such course had been explained to him.(c) The possibility of establishing some independent body todetermine Members&apos; pay had also been discussed.(d) Scottish Members had expressed the view that subsistenceallowances should be made payable in respect of nights preceding, as distinct from nights following, full sitting days.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he himself stillpreferred the scheme for cash reimbursement of expenses, since thiswould be better calculated to meet the needs of Members generally.It could not fairly be represented as a concealed salary increase, forthe expenses in respect of which Members would receive periodicalcash reimbursement would have to be accounted for in detail in due course in the claims which Members submitted to the Inland revenue for tax relief on their expenses as a whole. On the other hand, the suggested rate of day allowance under the proposed subsistencescheme would, in his view, be likely to create genuine bitternessamong London Members.The Prime Minister said that, if the Government were now toindicate that they were unwilling to put forward any scheme saveone for subsistence allowances, the Labour Party might accept this for what it was worth to their Members, but lay the whole responsi-bility for it on the Conservative Party. Such a scheme was also likelyto give rise to anomalies. The Cabinet might therefore wish to con-sider making an announcement on the following lines:  (i) that, while accepting in principle the vote of the House,they did not consider the time appropriate for a salaryincrease;(ii) that they recognised the hardship caused by the expensesnecessarily incurred by Members in the course of their parliamentary duties and were prepared to make pro-posals for meeting this situation;(iii) that they felt that this was a matter in which the house should as far as possible proceed on a basis of generalagreement, and they proposed consultation between party leaders on the details of the form which such assistance should take: it was their hope that proposals could be formulated before the summer recess.In pursuance of an announcement on these lines the government might thereafter hold discussions with the Opposition on the basis ofthe two alternative schemes which they were at present considering.The Cabinet recognised the advantage of an early announcement that the Government could not see their way to propose a directincrease of the Parliamentary salary at the present time.   Such n
statement would go far to&quot; relieve the- uneasiness created by the vote of the House of Commons on 24th May. On the other hand, therewere obvious dangers in entering into free discussion with the Opposi-tion Leaders on this question.- First, this might result in considerable further delay and expose the Government to fresh charges ofindecision. Secondly, if the Government Were to enter into discus-sions With the Opposition without a clear view of the kind of arrange-ments they could accept, they might find themselves committed to ascheme which Would not prove acceptable to their supporters and could be carried through the House of Commons only with the aid of opposition votes. It seemed important that any discussions withthe Opposition Leaders should be conducted within the limits of ascheme Which the Government would be prepared to put before theHouse.It remained the preponderant view of the Cabinet that thescheme to be put before the&apos; Opposition Leaders should be one of subsistence allowances.- Such a scheme was1 not only likely to bemore generally favoured in the country but should prove more acceptable to&quot; a majority of Government supporters in the House ofCommons,- in spite of the balance of opinion within the ExecutiveCommittee Of the&quot; 1922 Committee. It followed that the Govern-menfs statement to the House of Commons should indicate that theyadhered to their view that it would not be right to make any directincrease in the Parliamentary salary at the present time; that theyhad, however, been considering other means of relieving some of thefinancial difficulties of Members and had devised a plan which theywere ready to discuss with the Opposition Leaders. When such astatement had been made, the Government would put before theOpposition Leaders the proposed scheme of subsistence allowances,Which they would be prepared to modify in detail to meet Oppositionsuggestions, but not to alter in principle. If agreement could bereached between the Parties on a suitable scheme of this kind, theGovernment would then put it before Parliament; but, if no agree-merit could be reached, no improvement of the financial position ofMembers would be practicable at the present time.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare and submit for their consideration the draft of a statement tobe made in the House of Commons on the general lines suggested at the end of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd June, 1954.
