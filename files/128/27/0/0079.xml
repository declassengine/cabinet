(54) 61stConclusions,Minute 3.)Quemoy.(previous reference:CC. (54) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the course of negotiations between France and Western Germany about the Saar gave cause for concern. The French President might find it difficult to persuade the French Assembly to endorse the various concessions which he had come to accept in his discussions with Chancellor Adenauer. TheDutch Government, who were well acquainted with the complexities of the Saar problem, were on this account anxious to enlist theassistance of the United Kingdom and if possible the United states in these negotiations before the next meeting of the North atlantic treaty Council. He hoped that this would not prove necessary, butthe outlook was not encouraging.The situation in Southern Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia was deteriorating through the inability of these three countries to form a stable administration. The United States Government had not found it possible to associate our Ambassador in Washington with thediscussions which had taken place in Washington between- Mendes-France and Mr. Dulles on this problem, but it appeared that they had reached no definite decisions. He had accordingly proposed to Mr. Dulles that tripartite discussions should now beheld in Washington to agree upon the measures which it was possibleto take to stabilise and consolidate the situation in this area.The Foreign Secretary said that he expected shortly to receivethe draft of the treaty on mutual defence to be entered into by theUnited States and Nationalist China. We had sought to ensure thatthe terms of this agreement would make it clear that Formosa wouldnot be a privileged sanctuary for the Chinese Nationalists, and thatthe United States had undertaken no commitment to join in thedefence of the islands close to the mainland of China which were in47188-3b 21. The Prime Minister said that he thought it would be right that he should make a general statement on defence during theforthcoming Debate on the Address. He had in mind a broadappreciation, which, without treating problems of defence in anydetail, would present in symmetric form many points which hadalready been made separately. It would be necessary soon to announce certain changes which it had been decided to make in our defence programmes, such as those affecting Anti-Aircraft command and the Auxiliary Air Force; and it was preferable that these changes should be made known in the context of a broad statement on defence policy. It would be convenient if arrangements could be made which would enable him to make his statement on 6th December,but he would be willing, if necessary, to make it somewhat earlier,possibly on 2nd December.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Parliamentary time-table forthe Debate on the Address could not be determined until the termsof any amendment tabled by the Opposition was known. He wouldsound the Opposition through the usual channels, but they wouldprobably not be willing to come to any definite arrangements until they had had an opportunity of seeing the terms of The Queen&apos;sSpeech. If it became necessary to concede another day for the debate on the Address, this might jeopardise the time-table for thepassage of the Pensions Bill.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make informal inquiries witha view to arranging that a Government statement on defence should take place on Monday, 6th December, or failing this, on Thursday, 2nd December.
Sale of ArmsAbroad.Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 78thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet resumed consideration of a memorandum bythe Foreign Secretary (C. (54) 358) proposing that the number ofBritish aircraft to be supplied to the Middle East countries should belimited with a view to obtaining equilibrium of armaments in thearea.The Foreign Secretary said that, in accordance with the cabinets decision at their meeting earlier that day, he had discussed theproposals which he had put forward in his memorandum with theMinister of Defence and other Ministers concerned. It was evidentthat the scale and timing of our deliveries of aircraft and, indeed, ofother arms to Middle East countries turned on the delivery of Mystereaircraft which the French Government were understood to haveagreed to supply to Israel. If it was confirmed that twelve of thesemodern types of aircraft were to be supplied to Israel possiblyfollowed by a further twelve Israel would acquire a decisive militarysuperiority in the Middle East. This was bound to prompt demands from Arab countries for comparable increases in their armaments;and they would tend to look to the United States rather than to us for their aircraft, since we were unable to supply swept-wing fightersat present. It was probable that the United States would in thesecircumstances be willing to deliver Sabre aircraft to the arab countries, so giving further impetus to an arms race in the middle east. It was therefore proposed to ascertain from the Near EastArms Co-ordinating Committee in Washington the precise nature ofthe programme contemplated by the French Government for thesupply of Mystere aircraft to Israel. At the same time a further approach would be made to the French Government. Once it was established that Israel would shortly receive Mystere aircraft, weshould no longer be justified in withholding supplies of the british aircraft for which we had received orders from Middle East countries,though the delivery of Meteors should be spread out over 1955.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the foreign secretary.the possession of the Nationalists. Despite the assurances we hadreceived from the United States Government on both these points,the documents which had now been drawn up in connection with thetreaty were obscure in both respects. The statement which theUnited States Government proposed to issue on the 30th Novembermet neither point; and there was little prospect that definiteassurances on either point would be contained in the Notes to be exchanged between the United States Government and NationalistChina on the signing of the treaty. The publication of the documents in this form would have the effect of increasing rather than reducingtension in the Far East. He proposed to send a message toMr. Dulles urging him to amend the terms of his public statement toinclude both these safeguards. Failing this, he hoped that these two points could be made clear in the exchange of Notes and that these would then be published, with the treaty, at the same time as mr. Dulles&apos; statement.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary and endorsed the terms of his proposed approach to the UnitedStates Government.
The Cabinet-Approved the issue of a statement in the terms proposedby the Lord President.Cabinet Office, SWA,25th November, 1954.Atomic Energy.       4.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet that plans had(Previous        been laid to carry out further tests of atomic weapons in AustraliaReference:      and that the Australian Government had agreed that a British teamC.C. (54) 2nd    should visit Australia with the object of seeking a suitable permanentConclusions,    site for such trials.   Some members of this party, which was leavingMinute 3.)       shortly, would undoubtedly be identified in Australia as members ofthe team which had attended previous tests.   It was therefore proposed to make an announcement on 25th November which would indicate that the purpose of the visit was to investigate the possibilityof further atomic weapon trials.   The terms of this announcementwere acceptable to the Australian Government.
