Four-power meeting.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 9thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet his impressions ofthe Four-Power Meeting in Berlin. One of the most noticeablefeatures had been the extreme rigidity of the Soviet attitude towardsEuropean problems. There had been no yielding, even on Austria,where it might have been thought that the Russians could gain some public approval at little cost. This attitude was probably due to the fear that, if any concessions were made, others would at once be demanded. Thus, the Russians justified their retention of troops in hungary because it was on their line of communication to Austria;and, if they had agreed to withdraw their troops from Austria, therewould no doubt have been a demand for a withdrawal from Hungary.It had also been suggested that the dominating influence in Russianpolicies was now held by the military leaders, and that they had insisted that no positions in Europe should be sacrificed. If either of these explanations was correct, it was clear that Russian policy wasdictated by a sense of weakness and was for that reason unlikely to change. He did not think, however, that the Russians had any real fear of the Germans in the immediate future or that they would regard the ratification of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)as a serious threat demanding some form of military counter-action.It was even possible that M. Molotov had recognised that the E.D.C.was itself an insurance against future German aggression. On theother hand, there was no doubt that the Russians were genuinelyalarmed by the development of United States bases throughout theworld and by the large programme of airfield construction in western europe.In general the discussions had not been marked by any bitter-ness and, even though little result had been achieved, there was noheightened tension in the relations between the Four Powers.The relations between the Soviet Union and the Chinese People&apos;republic would need careful study. M. Molotov had shown himselfmost anxious to reach agreement on a Five-Power Meeting at Geneva.His attitude on this had been much less rigid: he had been preparedto negotiate on it. Mr. Dulles and M. Bidault had formed the viewthat the reason for this was that since Stalin&apos;s death the chinese communists were less ready to accept advice from the Kremlin andthat the Russians feared that the Chinese leaders, unless treated withcare, might entangle the Soviet Union in dangerous commitments.M. Molotov had signally failed to cause any break or dissensionamong the Foreign Ministers of the three Western Powers.M. Bidault had retained his resolution despite Russian blandishmentsand bullying. Mr. Dulles had taken a considerable political risk in supporting the Five-Power Meeting at Geneva,The Foreign Secretary said that the most urgent question was now the ratification of the E.D.C. In Berlin he had gained theimpression from many Germans, from both political and businesscircles, that Western Germany was becoming impatient of the policyof the Western Powers. The Germans were once again growingprosperous, and with their prosperity had come a strain of arrogance.It was urgent, therefore, that France should ratify the E.D.C. andthat the Bonn Agreements, which had been concluded nearly twoyears ago, should come into force at an early date. He had had further discussions with M. Bidault about United Kingdom associa-tion with the E.D.C. and there were certain proposals which he wouldlike to discuss with the Minister of Defence before they were con-sidered by the Cabinet. We could not give the French an assurance that we would retain British forces in Germany on a pre-determinedlevel, especially as it was certain that once the E.D.C. had been ratified the Americans would reduce their forces in Germany. Itmight, however, be possible to find some means of earmarking for service with the E.D.C. some British troops, perhaps an armoured brigade group. There were technical difficulties about this proposal,but he would like to consider it.45742-2b 2
The Prime Minister said that he was not surprised or dis-appointed by the results of the Four-Power Meeting. The agreement to hold.a Five-Power Meeting at Geneva meant that negotiations onFar Eastern problems would be continued. In Europe the Russianattitude should help the French Parliament to proceed to ratification of the E.D.C. Public disappointment at the lack of political agree-ment on Europe would be greatly offset if we could secure american agreement to an expansion of East/West trade. It would be evidencethat we were continuing to try to find peaceful means of living side by side with the Soviet Union. He agreed that the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence should study further the suggestion thatan armoured brigade group might somehow be attached to the E.D.C.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement on the Four-Power Meeting in Berlin.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary and the Minister ofDefence would consider methods of bringing about a closer association between the United Kingdom and theE.D.C. and would report on this to the Cabinet.2. The Colonial Secretary said that the Parliamentary Delega-tion composed of six Members of Parliament drawn from both parties had now returned from Kenya and he had undertaken to publishtheir report. Included in an appendix to this report were the precise terms of the Mau Mau oath. This was of such obscenity that he did not think it could be included in a Government publication whichwould be on sale to the public. On the other hand, there could beno more convincing evidence of the desperate violence and dangerof the Mau Mau movement, and it would be valuable if this could bebrought home to Members of Parliament and to the public.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the terms of theMau Mau oath should not be included in a Government publication.The appendix including this oath should, however, be made availablein some convenient place in the Palace of Westminster, where it couldbe seen by Members of both Houses of Parliament and also by Lobbycorrespondents. It should also be communicated to newspaper proprietors by the most appropriate channel. If at a later stagestrong Parliamentary pressure developed in favour of its being published, the position could be reconsidered.The Cabinet Agreed that the terms of the Mau Mau oath should not beincluded in the report of the Parliamentary Delegation onthe situation in Kenya, but should be made available to members of both Houses of Parliament and, for their information and guidance, to Lobby correspondents andnewspaper proprietors.3. The Foreign: Secretary said that the United States state department had suggested that the shares in the proposed consortiumof the oil companies in Persia should be divided as follows: Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) 35 per cent., United States Com-panies 35 per cent., Shell Company 30 per cent. This did not givethe A.I.O.C. a sufficient share. He would have preferred that the oil companies themselves should decide their respective shares; but,if the Americans insisted that Governments should lay down thepercentages, he would propose that the A.I.O.C. should receive 44 percent., and that the other seven companies, including Shell, should
toreceive 8 per cent. each. If this proved unacceptable, he would beprepared to go so far as to suggest that the A.I.O.C. should hold40 per cent., Shell 20 per cent, and the other companies (includingthe French) 40 per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer endorsed this proposal. Hewould be unwilling to see the American share rise above 40 per cent.,since any greater share would have a damaging effect upon our balance of payments.The Cabinet Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal and authorised him to arrange for the United States Government to beinformed accordingly.Antarctica. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that a number of Argentine naval(Previous        representatives, including the Minister responsible for the ArgentineReference:      Navy, were about to make a tour of the disputed areas in theC-C-(53) 50th   Antarctic in an unarmed naval transport.   This expedition was conclusions,    doubtless being undertaken for publicity purposes, and he had been minute 5.)       considering how we might best counter its effects.   If we paid no attention to it, this would be taken as a sign of weakness. We might make a formal protest to the Argentine Government, but past experience suggested that this would evoke no satisfactory response.If we sought to prevent the visit by force, the Argentinians might feel obliged to retaliate, and they were in a position to bring up navalreinforcements more quickly than we. could.  It had therefore beensuggested that we might make some show of naval force and welcome the Argentine party as our guests, thus demonstrating our claim tosovereignty over those parts of the area which we regarded as british territory.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that a frigate would bearriving at Deception Island on the following day. If she could locatethe Argentine transport, she would be able to anticipate her arrival in any of the disputed areas to which we laid claim and could makethe appropriate offers of hospitality to the Argentine representatives.The Cabinets (1) Agreed that in the circumstances described by the foreign secretary, British naval officers should receive theArgentine naval representatives as their guests in any territory over which the United Kingdom Governmentclaimed sovereignty.(2) Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to send instruc-tions accordingly to the Captain of the frigate now inthese waters; and invited him to settle the terms of these instructions, before despatch, with the Foreign secretary and the Prime Minister.Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C: (53) 51stConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 66) submitting for decisionoutstanding differences between Ministers on the level of guaranteed prices to be fixed in the forthcoming annual review of farm prices.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that reduction of the food and agricultural subsidies was one of the few possible means ofalleviating the present heavy burden of expenditure. He hoped tosubmit to his colleagues in the near future long-term proposals for reducing the scale of subsidies to home food production; but his present report was confined to the issues raised by the forthcoming45742-2b 3
annual review of farm prices. All the Ministers concerned agreed in principle that guaranteed prices should be reduced in total; but,whereas the Agriculture Ministers wished to restrict this reduction to  38 millions, the Minister of Food favoured reductions totalling 78 millions. So far as the disputed items were concerned, he himselfdoubted whether it would be expedient to reduce the price of milkby as much as 2d. a gallon, for farmers generally attached particular importance to their receipts from milk. The subsidy for eggs wasgetting out of hand, but he had agreed to discuss this further withthe Agriculture Ministers and the Minister of Food on the following day. For cereals the right solution might be to make a reduction of. a cwt. but not to introduce a sliding scale in addition. he expected that the Ministers concerned would be able to reach agree-ment on the fertilisers&apos; subsidy without undue difficulty. At presentthe farmers were genuinely apprehensive about their future prospectsin view of the trend of world supplies and prices. If it should prove impossible to secure from the forthcoming review an adequatereduction in the total amount of the producer subsidies, he wouldhave no alternative but to recoup the Exchequer so far as possible by further increases in retail prices of food for example, of milk.The Minister of Agriculture said that farmers were undoubtedlyexpecting to receive increased prices from this as from past reviewsand there was no possibility of reaching agreement with them on any settlement which involved a net reduction. A settlement would,therefore, have to be imposed by the Government. To meet theChancellor he had already gone as far as he possibly could and,indeed, further than he really considered to be justified. It mustbe recognised that the Governments present difficulties were largely due to the success of their policy of expanding agricultural produc-tion. When farmers had responded so well to appeals to produce more food, they would feel justifiably aggrieved if they were nowtold that they were producing so much of certain commodities that prices had to be cut back severely. The cost of guaranteed prices to the Exchequer must, clearly be reduced, but the reduction must bemade gradually. It would be particularly unfortunate to make asubstantial reduction in the guaranteed price of cereals in the veryyear when the world price of wheat had for the first time fallen belowthe guaranteed home price. It also seemed unwise to take actionwhich might endanger the general level of agricultural production at a time when the balance of payments prospects appeared to bedisturbing. The Government were in danger of incurring the hostility, not only of the farmers, but of those of their supporters inthe House of Commons who took a special interest in agriculture.The Minister of Food said that he accepted the need for a stable and prosperous agriculture and agreed that reductions in guaranteed prices must not be introduced too suddenly. On the other hand, ifthe reductions to be made in the forthcoming review were inadequate,there was a serious risk that the farmers would forfeit the confidence of the public and this might have much more serious consequences forthe future of our agriculture. The fact was that we were maintainingarrangements, for example for eggs and liquid milk, which werejustifiable under a siege economy but were quite indefensible at thepresent time. If the first approach to the farmers in the forthcomingreview were based upon the price reductions which he favoured therewould be opportunity to retreat, if necessary, towards the figuresfavoured by the Minister of Agriculture.The Minister of Labour said that it would be most unfortunate if a failure to secure adequate reductions in the producer subsidies should make it necessary to increase the retail price of milk. A risein the price of such a staple article of food, involving a rise of ratherunder half a point in the cost-of-living index, would riot be understoodat a time when the supply of milk was clearly plentiful and wouldbe bound to have serious repercussions On current wage negotiations.
Royal Tour.uganda protectorate.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute .11.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (54) 64) about the forthcoming visit of the queen to Uganda.The Colonial Secretary said that, during the course of her presentCommonwealth tour. The Queen was due to spend from 28th to30th April in Uganda, where she would be opening the Owen FallsDam. The Lukiko had passed a respectful resolution asking thatThe Queen s visit to Buganda should be postponed and oneNationalist newspaper had suggested that, if it should take place, itshould be marked by mourning. The Governor was fully satisfied,however, that these demonstrations would not in the event affect thewarmth of the welcome which would be accorded to The Queen andthe Duke of Edinburgh by all sections of the community, and he advised that the plans for the visit should be maintained, subject onlyto the omission of a brief engagement at Mengo, the headquarters of the Buganda Government. The Colonial Secretary endorsed theGovernor&apos;s advice.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should advise her majesty that her visit to Uganda should proceed as planned,subject to the omission of the proposed engagement atMengo, but invited him to keep the matter under review inthe light of any subsequent developments in Uganda.uganda protectorate.(previous reference: &apos;C.C.(53)79thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (54) 72) submitting for approval the draft ofa statement on the future of Uganda which he proposed to makein the House of Commons on the following day.The Colonial Secretary explained that, the object of his proposed statement, which would involve Her Majesty&apos;s Government in no fresh commitments, was to regain the initiative in handling thesituation resulting from the deposition of the Kabaka.The Cabinet  .Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make the statement annexed to C. (54) 72 in the House of Commons on23rd February.The Home Secretary said that milk and eggs were the two mostimportant agricultural products from the point of view of the numerous small farmers in Wales and Northern Ireland.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the proposed price reductions to be put before the farmers at the opening of the forth-coming review must be such as to leave it open to the Governmentto make concessions as the negotiations proceeded. At the sametime, if reductions of the total amount favoured by the Minister ofFood were put forward even at the outset, the result might be sucha shock to farmers&apos; confidence that further negotiations would be seriously prejudiced. The right basis on which to start the negotia-tions might, therefore, be a figure for total net reductions intermediatebetween those favoured by the Minister of Food and those favoured by the Minister of Agriculture.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would dis-cuss further with the Ministers concerned the detailed arrangements to be adopted in respect of eggs and thesubsidy on fertilisers,(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, agreed provisionally that,at the forthcoming price review, negotiations with theNational Farmers&apos; Unions should be opened on the basisof proposals for price reductions amounting in total toabout  58 millions.
Town and country planning Act,1947.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the method of financing compensation payments under the Bill to amend the Townand Country Planning Act, 1947.The Minister of Housing said that a decision on this question was now urgently necessary. If the amending Bill were not passed this session, there would be no authority to pay compensation whichhad been outstanding in some cases for many years; and, if the bill was to be passed this session, it should be introduced within the nextfew days. The Minister recalled that under the Act of 1947 the state was to have bought all development rights in a single operation, whichwas to have been financed by borrowing. Under the amending Billcompensation would only be paid when development was frustratedby refusal of planning consent, and the total cost of compensationover the next few years was not likely to exceed  75 millions. Hehad proposed that Parliament should be invited to agree that this sum of  75 millions should be borne on the Consolidated Fund andamortised by annual charges on the Votes. He felt justified in making this proposal because the amount of the compensation to be paidin any particular case was determined by the Bill as the amount ofthe admitted claim under the original scheme for the purchase of alldevelopment rights. Moreover, though payment was now to be madecase by case as planning consent was refused, the operation was stillessentially one of buying capital values and it seemed justifiable onthat account to defray its cost by borrowing. There were also strong political arguments in favour of this course. The Government wouldbe criticised for having destroyed the 1947 scheme, which had been designed to ensure that good planning would not be frustrated ordistorted by a financial veto. He could not meet that criticism if itcould be said that the amount of planning to be undertaken in any given year would be determined in future, not by the merits, but bythe amount of money included in the annual Estimate. He believedthat, after a few years, the course of planning administration and thecost of compensation would settle down to a routine; and, when itwas seen that the amounts involved were not such as to offer specialtemptations to a Chancellor of the Exchequer seeking economies in times of economic difficulty, it would be possible to revert to thenormal procedure of asking Parliament to vote the necessary moneyannually in Estimates. He recognised that, if the novel procedure which he proposed for the interim period could be regarded as a precedent, it would be a dangerous one. But he believed that this problem was unique, and that the solution which he proposed neednot establish a precedent. First, the amount of the compensation to be paid in any particular case was pre-determined: it could notexceed the admitted claim. Secondly, it would not be possible toestimate the total amount to be paid in compensation in anyparticular year, for no one could say in advance what planningconsents would be refused in that year. Thirdly, for this service thecommon practice of reducing Estimates in search of economy would cause special damage. Ordinarily, if an Estimate was reduced, a benefit was deferred: but under this service, if planning consent hadto be granted because money was not available to compensate a refusal, positive and lasting damage would be done in that buildingwould be undertaken which, by the criteria of sound planning, shouldhave been prevented.The Minister said that he had been an advocate of planning formany years. He was convinced that, if it could be said that by thisamending Bill planning would once again be dominated by financial considerations, all the old controversies over land values would be revived. If his proposal were accepted, it could be claimed thatplanning decisions would in future be made on their merits and that compensation would follow automatically on the basis of the provedclaims.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Minister^proposal was contrary to the traditional principles on which
Parliamentary control of public expenditure was based. ministers responsible for a service involving the exercise of a discretion had always been required to finance those services by monies voted byParliament annually in advance under the Estimates procedure.No service involving a Ministerial discretion had ever been financed from the Consolidated Fund. In an attempt to meet the Ministersdifficulties, he had suggested that all the automatic payments underthe amending Bill and all the claims which had accumulated sincethe 1947 Act was passed might be paid out of the Consolidated Fund.This would cover about  60 millions of the total which the Ministeihad mentioned. He must, however, insist that compensation payments arising from current administration in the future should bemet from the annual Votes.The Minister of Housing said that, for the reasons which hehad already indicated, he could not accept this solution. The point which he was anxious to make clear to the public was that the future administration of planning would not be subjected to any financialveto. Therefore, his difficulties would not be lessened by any arrange-ment which distinguished in this way between past and future cases:indeed, they might be increased, for the distinction would tend toemphasise the extent of financial control over future administration.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was argued that under the scheme proposed in the amending Bill, the Ministers discretion would be subject to definitelimits. The amount of the compensation payable for loss ofdevelopment rights in a particular case was determined by the Bill.Where planning consent had already been refused, compensationmust be paid forthwith. And in future cases the decision would betaken on planning considerations alone, and compensation would follow automatically if planning consent were refused.(b) It was also argued that, if a fund were created from which to meet claims as they materialised, the only discretion exercisable bythe Minister would be to say whether the circumstances had arisenwhen the pre-determined payment should be made. This, it wassuggested, differentiated this particular piece of administration fromthe services normally financed by annual Votes.(c) Account must also be taken of the fact that this amending bill was designed as an alternative to an earlier scheme which had as its object the removal of all financial obstacles to sound planning.If the amount of planning to be undertaken in any given year was to depend on the total included in an annual Estimate, or the furtheramount to be voted by a Supplementary Estimate, it would be moredifficult for the Minister to claim that planning authorities would be free to take their decisions by reference solely to planningconsiderations.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later;       meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd February, 1954.
