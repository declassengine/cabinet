Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.SelectCommitteeon Estimates.InvestigationsAbroad.(previous reference:CC. (54) 28thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 13th April, he had continued to resist the suggestion thata Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Estimates, accompaniedby its clerk, should investigate conditions in some British Embassiesabroad. The Select Committee had, however, been disposed to presstheir suggestion and had asked him to reconsider his attitude towardsit. The Law Officers, whom he had consulted, thought it would be inexpedient that the Select Committee should take any action whichmight be thought to imply that the House of Commons was seeking to exercise a jurisdiction in a foreign country. This confirmed him in the view that the Select Committee should not conduct formalinvestigations overseas; and he proposed to inform the Committeethat, after considering their further representations, he remained ofthis opinion.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Indo-China.(previous reference:CC. (54) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3.   The Minister of State reported the latest developments in&apos; the negotiations on Indo-China at the Geneva Conference.  The pro-posals put forward on behalf of the Viet Minh were evidently designedto make a good impression on popular opinion in Indo-China, andthe French attitude at Geneva was by no means firm.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he was grateful for the steps which the Foreign Secretary was taking to ensure that theGovernments of India, Pakistan and Ceylon were kept informed ofthe progress of the discussions at Geneva.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.ParliamentExpenses ofMembers.(previous reference:CC (54) 3.1stConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been con-sidering how best to handle the debate which was to be held in theHouse of Commons on the following day on the Report of the SelectCommittee on Members&apos; Expenses. On reflection he thought it better that the Government spokesman should not be in the position ofreplying to the discussion, and he proposed to intervene towards themiddle of the debate. It now seemed likely that the Opposition wouldgive time for a second debate in the following week on a motionrecommending the adoption of the Select Committee&apos;s Report. this might be an official Opposition motion, or a motion tabled bymembers of all Parties it was now known that several government supporters would be ready to add their names to such a motion. Inthese circumstances he Would be careful, in the first debate on thefollowing day, to avoid committing the Government to any particularsolution. He Would, as previously agreed, indicate some of the courses which might be adopted as alternatives to the recommend a-tions made by the Select Committee and he would, in particular, givea detailed description of a possible scheme of subsistence allowances.
There were, however, various points on which he would: welcomefurther guidance from the Cabinet. These were as follows:  (a) As the proposal for a non-contributory pensions scheme wasto be rejected, the Members&apos; Fund would remain the only source of relief for former Members in financial difficulties. Should any men-tion be made of the possibility that the Exchequer might make some contribution towards this Fund?The Cabinet considered that no prospect should be held out ofan Exchequer contribution to the Members&apos; Fund.(b) Should anything be said about the possibility of increasingthe salaries of junior Ministers?The Cabinet thought it preferable that this matter should betaken up at a later stage, when a definite conclusion had been reached on the remuneration of Members.(c) Would it be reasonable to suggest that country Membersstaying in London at week-ends during the Parliamentary sessions should be entitled to draw the proposed subsistence allowance forFriday, Saturday or Sunday?It was the view of the Cabinet that the subsistence allowance should be payable only for days on which Parliament was sitting.(d) Should any reference be made to the possibility that sub-sistence allowances might be paid to Peers who were required bytheir Parliamentary duties to remain overnight in London?The Cabinet, while maintaining their view that a system of subsistence allowances, if adopted for the House of Commons, shouldbe extended to the House of Lords, agreed that it would be inappropriate-priate to make any reference to this in the forthcoming debate in the commons.The Cabinet Noted with approval the line which the Chancellor of theExchequer was proposing to take in speaking in the forth-coming debate in the House of Commons on the Report ofthe Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses.Education. 5.   The Cabinet had agreed to consider further at their presentTeachers&apos; meeting the future course of Parliamentary proceedings on the superannuation. Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill.(Previous The Chief Whip said that he had now discussed the Bill withReference:      22 of the 26 Government supporters whose attitude towards it wasCC. (54) 32nd  in doubt.  Their objections were not so much to the policy of theConclusions,    Bill as to its timing and its apparent discrimination against teachersMinute 1.)       as compared with other public employees.   Nine of the Memberswhom he had seen could now be relied upon to vote for the SecondReading, but 13 were likely to abstain. In addition one of the four members whom he had not seen was understood to be likely to vote against the Government. As there was at the present time more sick-ness among Government supporters than among the Opposition there could be no certainty that the Second Reading could be carried.  Ifthe Government were defeated and thereafter were to ask the house for a, vote of confidence, or were confronted with a vote of censure,they-were likely to be able to command only a small majority.The Minister of Education said that the Government should atleast put it beyond doubt that they intended to proceed with the Billwhen opportunity offered. She was finding it increasingly difficult to answer satisfactorily the many enquiries about the governments intentions which she was receiving from Members of Parliament,teachers&apos; organisations and the general public.:
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the case which couldbe made for the Bill had in no way been weakened by the arguments advanced against it. The teachers were not being treated harshly andwere, in fact, likely to receive less favourable terms at a later date ifthe measure were long deferred. If the attempt to obtain increased contributions from teachers were not pursued, the general body of tax-payers would incur an immediate liability of  2 millions and an increasing liability in future years. Nor would it simplify the prob-lem to link it with a review of other comparable superannuationschemes: indeed, by so doing the Government would only incurincreased embarrassment. At the same time, it was not strictlynecessary to proceed with the Second Reading of the Bill in theimmediate future and the Supplementary Estimate which would berequired in the absence of legislation could, if necessary, be deferred until February 1955.The general view of the Cabinet was that the balance of advan-tage was still against submitting the Bill for Second Reading at thepresent moment. If the Government were to be defeated on it, thiswould not only mean the loss of the Bill but would damage theGovernments prestige and weaken the influence which the foreign secretary was exercising at the Geneva Conference. It would alsotend to increase the difficulties of the Government Whips in musteringthe necessary support to complete the remaining stages of the many important Bills still before the House of Commons, and might seriously prejudice the Governments intention to bring forward indue course other measures designed, to secure economy in public expenditure. On the other hand, complete abandonment of the bill might in the long run do little less damage to the Governments pres-tige and to their plans for securing necessary economies; and it wastherefore desirable that the Government should reaffirm their support for the principle of the Bill and their intention to pass it into law as soon as this was possible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that he should prepare, in consultation with the Ministers directly concerned, thedraft of a statement to be made in Parliament, restating the case for the Bill, explaining why the state of Parliamentary businessprevented the Government from making immediate progress with it,but reaffirming their intention to settle the matter on the lines proposed in the Bill within a reasonable period.The Minister of Education and The Lord Privy Seal said that itwas desirable that such a statement should be made in the House ofCommons in the following week.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Minister of Education and the Chief Whip, to prepare and submit to the Cabinet a draft of a parliamentary statement on future proceedings on the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill.Colonial 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ColonialExports. Secretary (C. (54) 152) on the effect which the relaxation of import restrictions was having on colonial producers, particularly in theWest Indies.The Colonial Secretary said that he was not seeking decisions:   from the Cabinet at this stage on any of the points mentioned in his memorandum, but he had considered it right to inform his colleagues
ISEgypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:CC. (54) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Minister of State said that he proposed to state in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, in reply to a Question byMr. Shinwell, M.P., that the Anglo-Egyptian defence negotiations were at present suspended and that in the meanwhile none of our troops were being withdrawn from the Canal Zone.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.Russian Ballet. 8. The Minister of Slate said that, following the fall of DienVisit to London. Bien Phu, the French Government had cancelled an arrangementpreviously made for a series of performances in Paris by a Russianballet company. It had now been suggested that this company mightbe brought over to this country to give a series of performances atthe StOll Theatre, London. Would it be right, out of consideration for French susceptibilities, to prevent this or to discourage it?The Home&apos;Secretary said that to refuse the members of this company leave to land here for the purpose of fulfilling such an engagement would be contrary to the general policy governing the admission of foreigners to this country.of the background to current negotiations with a Jamaican deputa-tion on Jamaican exports. There was no doubt that the relaxation of our import restrictions would have serious consequences on certaincolonial producers, and among the possible means of helping them which might have to be considered were the following:  (i) greater freedom for the Colonies to import non-sterling(particularly dollar) goods;(ii) the provision of direct financial assistance by the UnitedKingdom Government, possibly under Colonial Development and welfare arrangements, to improve the efficiency and marketingstandards of certain colonial industries; and(iii) revival of Imperial Preference by increasing protective dutieswhere these were specific and had remained unchanged for manyyears in spite of substantial increases in the prices of commodities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that no immediatedecisions were needed on any of these points, and said that he would co-operate with the Colonial Secretary and other Ministers concernedin seeking practical solutions to any actual problems of this kind which might arise. The future of Imperial Preference would nodoubt be fully considered as part of the review of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade which the Cabinet had already authorised.The Minister of Food pointed out that, as a result of action bythe United Kingdom Government, Jamaican exports of sugar would show a substantial increase in the present year, and that much ofthe difficulty Which was being experienced by the Jamaican bananaindustry was due to competition from other British colonial territoriesrather than from foreign countries.The Cabinet Took note of C. (54) 152 and of the views expressed in thediscussion.
It was also the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inexpedient to take any official steps to discourage the theatricalinterests concerned from pursuing the project for bringing this company to London.The Cabinet Agreed that no special facilities should be given or with-held with a view to influencing the decision whether theRussian ballet company which was to have performed inParis should be brought over to this country to give a seriesof performances in London.Sudan. 9.   The Minister of State said that it now seemed likely that,(Previous        as a sequel to the riots in Khartoum on 1st March on the occasionReference:      of General Neguib&apos;s visit, Sayed Siddik, the Mahdi&apos;s son, would beCC. (54) 19th   arrested and put on trial for murder.   A British magistrate had conclusions,     advised that there was a prima facie case against Sayed Siddik, the minute 2.)       Council of Ministers had decided not to intervene and the Mahdihimself had made it clear that, in his view, the law should be allowedto take its normal course.   There was no reason to suppose thatSayed Siddik would not receive a fair trial, which might result inhis acquittal, and in the circumstances there seemed to be no ground for intervention by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th May, 1954.
