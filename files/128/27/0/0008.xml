Japan. 1,   The Lord Privy Seal said that the Japanese Trade Agree-Trade with the ment was to be debated in the House of Commons that day on the sterling Area, basis of a motion by the Opposition. Government supporters repre-(Previous senting Lancashire constituencies had put down an amendment to reference: that motion which, while recognising that the Agreement would bringC.C. (54) 6th advantages to the trade of the Empire, urged that &quot; any further conclusions, arrangements should provide such safeguards of the interests of the minute 6.) textile industry as the experience of the coming year may show to benecessary.&quot; It would be convenient, in the handling of the debate,if the Government could accept this amendment.The President of the Board of Trade said that the wiser coursewould be to accept the amendment. The Agreement was limited toone year and renewal would have to be considered in the light of experience gained during that year. The textile industry was con-cerned mainly about its Colonial markets, but no guarantee couldbe given that those markets would be reserved for the Lancashiretrade. He would have to make it clear during the debate that&apos; theUnited Kingdom Government could not dictate the trade policies of Colonial Governments; but, subject to this, he could accept theamendment.The Colonial Secretary endorsed this view.The Cabinet-Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to acceptthe amendment to the Opposition motion on the JapaneseTrade Agreement on the basis which he had indicated inthe Cabinefs discussion.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Armed Forces. 3. The Lord President said that, as a result of discussions in pay- the Committee which the Cabinet had appointed on 3rd February(Previous       to work out details of a scheme for increases in Service pay, the reference:      Minister of Defence and Service Ministers had now agreed to reduceC.C. (54) 7th    the total increases of  18 millions authorised by the Cabinet to a conclusions,    figure of  16^ millions, of which  10i millions would be found in minute 3.)       1954 within the limits of approved Service Estimates.   They were willing to discuss with the Minister of Labour how these pay increasescould best be presented with a view to reducing their effect on currentwage negotiations in industry.  They considered, however, that thegeneral scheme should be announced before the debates on theService Estimates and that the details should follow within two days of the general announcement.The Minister of Labour said that, if these increases in service pay were to attain their object of retaining experienced men in regular service, they must be made to appear attractive to those men.His difficulty was that, the more this was done, the harder it wouldbe for him to hold industrial wages to a reasonable level; He washoping to hold the general level of wage increases in industry toabout Is. per week, but some of the proposed increases in service pay were in the region of 14s. to 49s. a week. He would thereforelike further time to consider the questions of presentation and timingin relation to current wage negotiations in industry. The difficult period in these negotiations would be between 20th February andthe middle of March.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Labour to examine the details of the revised scheme of increases in Service pay totalling  16^ millions, and toconsider how best this scheme could be presented toParliament.(2) Agreed that, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer or theMinister of Labour found in the revised scheme any points of disagreement which they could not resolve in consulta-tion with the Minister of Defence and the service ministers, the Cabinet should meet on the following day to settle any points still outstanding.(3) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the revised scheme of increases in Service pay and agreed that itshould be announced before the forthcoming debates on service Estimates.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of theCabinet&apos;s decision to increase Service pay, it would be more difficultto continue to resist the claim for improvement of the retired pay of certain Service officers. The total cost of the improvement claimedC.C. (53) 77th   was insignificant in comparison with the cost of the proposedConclusions,    increases in Service pay. It would, however, give rise to consequentialMinute3.)      claims; and he would like to reflect further on the whole question and submit precise proposals to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (4) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would submit a further memorandum on the retired pay ofcertain Service officers.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.0?previous reference:In discussion the following points were made:-(a) There had been no increases in Service pay since 1950, andit would be unreasonable to compare the increases now proposedwith a Is. increase in industry which was to be added to a numberof earlier increases made since 1950.(b) The Government could not hope to emerge with credit fromthe debates on the Service Estimates if no announcement of pay increases was to be made until after those debates. Increases madethen would seem to have been extracted from the Government by pressure applied during the debates. It was generally agreed thaton this account the announcement could not be deferred beyond4th March.(c) It could be shown that the proposed increases were designedto give greater rewards to experienced and skilled men and were,therefore, not comparable with an addition of 7,s. to basic wage ratesin industry. On the other hand, this increased differential in the pay of Servicemen could be used as an argument for differentialincreases for skilled men in industry; and the result would beincreased costs and the loss of competitive power in export markets.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he acceptedthe Cabinet decision, he still believed that a fair settlement mighthave been made within a total of  8 millions.The Prime Minister said that the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Labour should have a further day in which toconsider the detailed figures of the scheme proposed by the lord president and the method of its presentation to Parliament. If they desired to raise further points, the Cabinet should meet on the follow-ing day to discuss them. Subject to this, the proposals could beregarded as approved.
Judges&apos; 4.   In the light of the discussion recorded in the precedingRemuneration Minute, the Cabinet reviewed the prospects of making progress inBill. Parliament with the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill.  It was the general(Previous       view of the Cabinet that an announcement of increases in Service payReference:      and of improvement in the retired pay of certain Service officersC.C. (54) 1st    would create a climate of opinion in Parliament which would makeConclusions,    it possible to proceed with the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill.Minute 7.)The Lord Privy Seal said that, while he accepted this view, hewould like to have a further opportunity to consider the precise timingfor taking the Second Reading of this Bill in the House of Commons.Five-Power 5.   The Cabinet considered a telegram from the Foreign Secre-Meeting.        tary (Berlin telegram No. 120) commenting on the proposal for a(Previous        Five-Power Meeting (Berlin telegram No. 113) which the united reference:      States Secretary of State had put forward at a private discussionC.C. (54) 5th    between the four Foreign Ministers in Berlin. The Foreign SecretaryConclusions,    had pointed out that in further discussion of this question it mightMinute 3.)       be difficult to maintain the unity of the three Western Powers; buthe had added that their main concern must be to prevent anyappearance of disunity, even though that might mean that he wouldhave to defend positions which fell short of what the United Kingdomalone might have been able to offer.The Minister of State said that, in his view, the american proposal was unfortunately worded and unduly restricted in its scope. He hoped that it might be possible to persuade Mr. Dulles toaccept a modified draft. It was most important that the offer to holda Five-Power Meeting should be kept open, even if its scope was. restricted. He agreed with the Foreign Secretary, however, that wemust avoid any appearance of disunity between the Western Powers.The Minister of Housing emphasised the need to give support to the French Foreign Minister. It was now likely that no agreement would be reached on the unification of Germany and in these circum-stances M. Bidault, who had been firm in his support of the european defence Community, would need all the help we could give him in persuading the French Parliament to proceed to its ratification. Hewas unlikely to find support for this course unless it was clear to french public opinion that he had not sacrificed French interests in indo-China.The Prime Minister said that the fact of a Five-Power meeting would be more important than its form. If small results were obtained from Berlin, there would still be hope that something bettermight be obtained from a Five-Power Meeting, and it would be apoint gained if the United States and the Chinese People&apos;s Govern-ment sat down at the same conference table. For these reasons hethought the Cabinet might tell the Foreign Secretary that he should do his best to secure a Five-Power Meeting, and that he need not feel obliged to defend every detailed argument used by the French and the americans on particular points, though he should maintain the unity of the three Western Powers on all issues of principle.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to send a message to theForeign Secretary on the lines suggested by the PrimeMinister.
&apos;37&apos;&amp;M \ ?M 62Egypt, 6.   When the Cabinet had considered on 28th January theDefence possible courses which would be open to the Government in the eventNegotiations, of a breakdown in the defence negotiations with Egypt, they had been(Previous disposed to agree that the best alternative policy would be to windReference: up the Base in the Canal Zone, to re-deploy the British Forces in theC.C. (54) 7th Middle East in our own time, and in Egypt to stand on our rightsConclusions, under the Treaty of 1936. They had appointed a Committee of minute 2.) Ministers to consider the military and legal implications of such a&apos;&quot;      :        policy.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (54) 45) presenting the conclusions of this Committee.The Appendix to this memorandum outlined the military planrecommended by the Chiefs of Staff, after consultation with the commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, for carrying out such a policy.This envisaged that the Base would be wound up by clearing Tel ElKebir first and rolling up from the south. It would be two years before this process could be completed, and the Treaty force (of10,000 ground troops and 2,000 R.A.F.) would eventually take up their position in an area round Moascar / Abu-Sueir. They wouldthere be adjacent to a land-force Treaty area, though not within it;and they would be in a position to control the bridges over the suez canal and the supply of black oil to Cairo. Their lines of com-munication, and their eventual line of evacuation, would be throughPort Said. The project of a defended perimeter near Suez, whichhad been mentioned in the Cabinefs discussion on 28th January, hadbeen abandoned partly for legal reasons, but mainly because therewas no accommodation for such large numbers of troops near Suezand it would not be justifiable to build it at this stage.The Committee were satisfied that a reasonable legal defencecould be put forward for this policy if it were challenged before aninternational tribunal during the two years that would necessarily be spent in winding up the Base and evacuating seven-eighths of theBritish Forces now in Egypt. We should be on strong legal groundsif we had announced that we were in process of evacuating the base and reducing our troops to the numbers prescribed in the Treaty andif we had ensured that all our actions taken in Egypt thereafter weredemonstrably directed towards that end. For we were clearlyentitled to take a reasonable time to withdraw, and during that time we should be entitled to safeguard the security of our troops. Itwould not be necessary to announce in advance the precise positionswhich we expected to be occupying in 1956; and the questionwhether we could justify in law the positions actually occupied in1956 would depend on the circumstances at that time.In discussion of this alternative policy the following points weremade:  (a) This plan for winding up the Base could not be carried through successfully without Egyptian co-operation. Some of theBritish authorities in Egypt thought it unlikely that this co-operationcould be secured if the policy had to be presented to public opinion in this country as a policy of standing on our rights under the Treatyof 1936.The Prime Minister said that it should not be assumed that the egyptians would necessarily withhold their co-operation. If this plani were put into operation, it would be seen in Egypt that large numbersof British troops were being withdrawn; and the Egyptians mightwell feel that they need not offer active opposition to that part of the&apos; plan which provided for the evacuation of seven-eighths of theBritish forces now in Egypt. If, on the other hand, the Egyptiansshowed active hostility and resorted to violence, a new situation would be created in which it would be easier for us, both politically and militarily, to take a firmer line.: (b) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he was mainly concerned about the security of the small force of 12,000
which under this plan would eventually be concentrated in the middleof the Canal Zone, with no power to safeguard its communications with Port Said or Suez.The Prime Minister said that any military attack on this force would be regarded as an act of war which would justify us. not merelyin reinforcing those troops, but in using air power in retaliation against the Egyptian forces.(c) If this policy were adopted, we should have to explain why we attached less importance than we had hitherto to the maintenanceof an effective Base in the Canal Zone. It would have to be made clear that no Base could be effective in war without the co-operationof the local government and the availability of local labour. Thepolicy would have to be presented simultaneously with the plan forthe re-deployment of our forces in the Middle East in areas where local co-operation was more likely to be forthcoming.(d) If this policy were adopted, it would probably be expedient that, in addition to any public announcement, we should also make our intentions plain in a secret communication to the egyptian government. This could go further than the public announcement:it could, in particular, make it clear that any interference with our withdrawal by organised Egyptian forces would be regarded as an act of war.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that further study should be made of the alternative policy outlined in C. (54) 45. In particular, a detailed time-table should beprepared, showing the sequence of the military movements involved and their relation with the political steps which would have to betaken. For this purpose it could be assumed that the small british force of 12,000 which would eventually remain in Egypt under this plan need not be confined wholly within the areas prescribed in theTreaty for land forces.The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss the prospects of securing a new defence agreement with Egypt.The Lord Chancellor reminded the Cabinet that the alternative policy outlined in C. (54) 45 had been suggested as one which mightbe adopted only if the defence negotiations with Egypt came to nothing. He himself believed that the more satisfactory course wouldbe to conclude a new defence agreement and he would be ready, ifnecessary, to make some further concessions to the Egyptians inorder to obtain such an agreement.The Prime Minister said that the terms which had been offered to the Egyptians in October had been presented as our final offer.It was on this basis that we had persuaded the United States Govern-ment to urge the Egyptians to accept them. And we had hithertoresisted all American suggestions that those terms should be modifiedwith a view to making them more acceptable to the Egyptians. Werewe now to give away, because of Egyptian intransigence, what we hadbeen unwilling to concede in response to the suggestions of ourAmerican friends ? This would surely weaken our bargaining position with the Egyptians. And it would certainly provoke criticism from government supporters in the House of Commons.The Minister of State said that we should certainly be on weakground if we appeared to be offering concessions to the Egyptiansat this stage. There was, however, some possibility of alterations inthe October terms which would be to our advantage. Thus, on theclause regarding the availabihty of the Base in war, it had nowbeen suggested that the Egyptians might be willing to accept a formula Which included a reference to attacks on Turkey or Persia;and this would probably be preferable, from our point of view, toour own formula which in effect involved arbitration by the united nations. On the Wearing of uniforms by British technicians in the base, we had less scope for varying our terms Without appearing to
make concessions to&quot; the Egyptians. But it was perhaps arguable that our essential needs would be met if the Egyptians could bebrought to agree that these technicians, though not entitled to wearmilitary uniform, would have the right of carrying personal armsand would be exempt from the jurisdiction of the Egyptian courts.In further discussion the Cabinet showed little disposition to compromise on the October terms, particularly on the clause assertingthe right of British technicians in the Base to wear military uniform.It was argued that we should derive little long-term advantage from a defence agreement with Egypt if we seemed to have been forced toaccept unsatisfactory terms under Egyptian pressure. An agreement concluded in that atmosphere would impair our influence in othercountries of the Middle East.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no steps need yet be taken to bring to a conclusion the current negotiations for a new defence agreement with Egypt.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Minister of State toarrange for further study to be given to the details of thealternative policy outlined in C. (54) 45, and for a time-table to be prepared of the military and political actionwhich would have to be taken under that policy.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting, in thelight of a report of the studies to be made in pursuanceof Conclusion (2).transport charges.Increase in freight Rates.(previous reference:C.C.(52) 98thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofTransport (C. (54) 1 and 40) and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (53) 362) on an application from the British Transport Commis-sion for authority to increase railway freight charges by 10 per cent.,subject to a limit of 10s. a ton.The Minister of Transport said that, in accordance with thestatutory procedure, he had referred this application to the transport tribunal, who had advised that the proposed increases of freight charges should be approved. The increases had to some extent beenmade necessary by the wage increase which the Government hadencouraged the British Transport Commission to grant. It was alsorelevant that, while railway freight charges were 2\ times what theyhad been in 1939, the rise in the general level of wholesale prices and, in particular, of coal prices had been substantially greater. there seemed to be no alternative but to approve the proposed increases;and, as every week&apos;s delay in their taking effect was costing the Com-mission some  500,000 in revenue, he sought authority to announcehis approval at once. He had also felt bound to warn the Cabinetthat the Commission would soon be applying for a further increasein London passenger fares and also that in due course he would wishto bring before his colleagues proposals for helping the Commissionto finance the modernisation of the railways.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the proposed increases in freight charges must be approved. He would be readyto consider on their merits any proposals which the Minister might put forward for helping the railways to finance modernisation but,as he had explained in C. (53) 362, he was opposed to any form ofGovernment subsidy for the railways.While there was general agreement that the proposed increases in freight charges must be approved, the Cabinet thought it important to make it clear in debate that the Government had not resignedthemselves to the prospect of periodical increases of railway charges and would pursue with vigour their efforts to ensure that rising costs would be offset by economies resulting from greater efficiency.
The Cabinet -Authorised the Minister of Transport to announce in Parlia-ment his approval of the proposed 10 per cent, increase in railway freight charges, and to publish the report of theTransport Tribunal on this subject.Kenya. 8.   The Prime Minister said that the Governor of Kenya, inGeneral China, considering whether he should recommend commutation of the(Previous        sentence of death passed on a leader of the Mau Mau rebels knownReference:      as General China, should give due weight to the fact that it was nowC.C. (54) 4th    being claimed on General China&apos;s behalf that he had given himselfConclusions,    up in response to the Governments offer of an amnesty.   In view of minute 7.)       the importance of convincing Mau Mau supporters generally of thereliability of this offer, might it not be advantageous to exerciseclemency in General China&apos;s case, even though the Government didnot in fact accept his claim to have surrendered under the terms ofthe amnesty?   It appeared from paragraph 3 of the Governor^telegram No. 113 that he would be prepared to consider commu-tation in certain circumstances.The Colonial Secretary said that on the facts there was no room for doubt. The judge who had tried General China had statedpublicly that he did not believe that the rebel leader had given himselfup in response to the surrender offer. On the question of expediencyhe was in full agreement with the Governors view that commutationof the sentence would have a deplorable effect in Kenya, particularly among the Governments Kikuyu supporters, and would encourage the rebels to fight to the last in the belief that they would, even then,be treated with clemency. He did not share the Governors view ofthe circumstances in which commutation of this sentence would bejustified. There was, however, another case of a Mau Mau leaderin which a claim that surrender had been made in response to theGovernments surrender offer might possibly be established. In that event commutation of that sentence might be considered to bejustified.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s view that commu-tation of the sentence passed on General China would notbe warranted but that, where a claim to have surrenderedin response to the Governments surrender offer could be clearly established by a Mau Mau leader, commutation of sentence might be justifiable.Cancer of theLung.Effect ofTobaccoSmoking.9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofHealth (C. (54) 47 and 51) on the relation between smoking andcancer of the lung.The Minister of Health said that the Home Affairs Committeehad supported his view that it was unavoidable that he should announce in Parliament at an early date that he had been advised byhis Standing Advisory Committee on Cancer and Radiotherapy thatit must be regarded as established that there was a relation, though not a simple one, between smoking and cancer of the lung and thatit was desirable that young people should ,be warned of the risksapparently attending on excessive smoking, particularly of cigarettes.If the Cabinet agreed, he proposed to make an announcement on12th February m the terms of the draft answer to a written Question
annexed to C. (54) 51, and to hold a Lobby Conference with theobject of encouraging the Press to maintain a due sense of proportionin their comments on his statement.The Prime Minister said that it was desirable that the minister should also make public as much as possible of the facts and argu-ments on which the Advisory Committee had based their advice.The Lord President said that the Home Affairs Committee had felt some doubt about the propriety of authorising the medical research Council to accept a sum of  250,000 which certain Britishtobacco companies had offered for research into causes of cancer.On further consideration, however, the Ministers concerned were satisfied that this offer could suitably be accepted on the basis thatthe companies had consulted the Minister of Health, who had advised that the money would be best put at the disposal of the Council.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft Answer annexed to C. (54) 51 and authorised the Minister of Health to publish it in theOfficial Report of the House of Commons for12th February.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for the simultaneous publication of as many as possible of thefacts and arguments on which the advice of his standing advisory Committee was based.(3) Agreed that the tobacco companies&apos; offer of  250,000 for research might be accepted by the Government on thebasis outlined by the Lord President.Betting,Lotteries and gaming.previous reference:C.C. (53) 68thConclusions,Minute 8.)Pool BettingBill.10. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 317 and C. (54) 41) on the recommendations madein the report of the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and gaming (Cmd. 8190) and on the Governments attitude to the PoolBetting Bill.The Home Secretary said that the Pool Betting Bill introduced by Mr. F. W. Mulley, M.P., went some way towards carrying outthe Royal Commission^ recommendations on football pools, whichhad been approved by the Home Affairs Committee. The Govern-ment&apos;s failure to define their attitude to the Bill when it had recentlycome up for Second Reading had already been the subject ofunfavourable comment and, if they continued to maintain a neutralattitude when the Bill again came before the House on 12th February,they would be likely to incur further criticism. He therefore pro-posed that the Government spokesman on that occasion should makeit clear that, if the Bill received a Second Reading, the Governmentwould assist its further stages.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, in the resumed Second Reading debate on the pool Betting Bill on 12th February, the government spokesman should state that, if the Bill obtained a SecondReading, the Government would assist in its further stages.(2) Deferred consideration of the  other issues  raised inC. (53) 317 and C. (54) 41.
Royal Tour.Temple of theTooth.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 67thConclusions.Minute 2.)11. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PrimeMinister (C, (54) 39) and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 49)and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (54) 48) about aproposal that The Queen, during her forthcoming tour of Ceylon,should visit the Temple of the Tooth at Kandy.The Prime Minister said that, whereas the late Prime Ministerof Ceylon had been of the opinion that in all the circumstances the Queen should not visit the Temple, the present Prime Ministerof Ceylon was strongly in favour of such a visit and hoped thatHer Majesty would be willing to observe Buddhist etiquette by removing her shoes when she entered the Temple. It has been ascertained that The Queen was anxious to meet the wishes of herCeylonese subjects in this matter, and there did not appear to beany ground on which the Cabinet should consider tendering advice in a contrary sense.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th February, 1954.
