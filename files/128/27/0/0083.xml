commonwealth relations.(previous reference:CC. (54) 81stConclusions,Minute 5.)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 307) submitting the conclusions ofthe Cabinet Committee which had been appointed in April, 1953, toconsider what status should be accorded in future to colonial territories which, on attaining full independence, desired to remain within the Commonwealth.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Committee hadspent more than a year on this task and had reached unanimousconclusions. They had started with a bias in favour of a two-tier system of Commonwealth membership, under which the upper tierwould be restricted to those countries which were in full control oftheir external relations and were capable of making a significant contribution towards their own defence. They had, however, been forced to the conclusion that such a system would not be practicable,for the reasons summarised in paragraphs 10-11 of the report annexed to C. (54) 307. There was no doubt that most countries whichwere candidates for Commonwealth membership would not be content with an inferior status and would choose to secede from theCommonwealth, on attaining full independence, rather than acceptsecond-class membership. Even if some were willing to remain inthe Commonwealth for a time in an inferior position, their discontentwould be exploited by influences hostile to Commonwealth solidarity.The Committee had therefore felt obliged to recommend that nochange should be made in what had generally been assumed andexpected to be the normal course of Commonwealth development,namely that Colonial territories desiring to remain within theCommonwealth on attaining full independence would be regarded aseligible for full Commonwealth membership. But, though all members of the Commonwealth would continue in form to be equalin status, it would not follow that in fact all would have equal weightand influence in Commonwealth councils. Between the existing members of the Commonwealth a measure of discrimination was already applied in practice. The Asiatic members did not at presentreceive from the United Kingdom Government as much informationas was made available, e.g., on defence questions, to the othermembers. If the membership of the Commonwealth were further increased, we should clearly have to develop still further the existing practice of treating each particular country on its individual merits.,and it would doubtless prove convenient to extend the practice of holding Commonwealth meetings confined to groups of countries ona regional or functional basis.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he was not asking thatany executive decision should be taken at the present time. Theneed for such a decision would not arise until the Gold Coast attainedfull independence in 1956 or 1957. If she should then apply for full membership of the Commonwealth, this would be a matter forconsideration, not by the United Kingdom Government alone, butby the Governments of all members of the Commonwealth. It wasnot too soon for United Kingdom Ministers to consider the generalcourse of policy which they would be disposed to follow in that eventand to take informal steps to ascertain the provisional views of someof the other Commonwealth Prime Ministers. If, therefore, theCabinet found themselves in broad agreement with the policy outlined in C. (54) 307, he hoped that private conversations on this question would be held with the Prime Ministers of Australia and NewZealand while they were in London for the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers. During his recent visit to Ottawahe had already discussed the matter privately with the Prime Ministerof Canada, who was in general agreement with the line of approachsuggested in C. (54) 307.In discussion several Ministers said that they greatly regretted the course of Commonwealth development which was envisaged inC. (54) 307. The admission of three Asiatic countries to Common-wealth membership had altered the character of the Commonwealth,and there was great danger that the Commonwealth relationship
would be further diluted if full membership had to be conceded tothe Gold Coast and other countries in a comparable stage ofdevelopment. It was difficult to believe that it would be possible toextend to this wider circle the close and intimate co-operation whichhad been maintained between the older Commonwealth countries.It was unfortunate that the policy of assisting dependent peoplesto attain self-government had been carried forward so fast and so far.At the same time there was general agreement with the conclusionof the Cabinet Committee that it would be impracticable to develop a two-tier system of Commonwealth membership. It would be unrealistic to suppose that Colonial territories, on attaining inde-pendence, would be content to accept a status within the Common-wealth which would be formally inferior to that of other members.In these circumstances it seemed best to follow the course recommended in the report and, while conceding formal equality of status, to develop practical methods of consultation which would permit free and close co-operation between those members whichactually exercised an effective influence in world affairs. Common-wealth discussions on defence questions were already confined inpractice to those countries which were willing to accept military commitments for mutual defence; and there was no reason why thistest for full participation in discussion of policy and plans should notbe applied more strictly, as time went on, and perhaps extended toother fields. By these means some members of the Commonwealthmight develop a closer common association, even though there wasno difference in constitutional status between them and the othermembers.In further discussion the following particular points weremade:  -(a) It had been proposed in C. (54) 307 that this question shouldbe discussed informally with the Prime Minister of South Africa, aswell as with the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia and NewZealand. Since this proposal was made, however, Mr. Strijdom had succeeded Dr. Malan as Prime Minister of South Africa, and it wouldbe preferable that this question should not be broached with himuntil it became more clear what policy he intended to follow inrespect of South Africa&apos;s relations with the Commonwealth. In any event it was unlikely that he would himself attend the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, and it would be inappropriate-priate to discuss this question with any other member of his Cabinetattending on his behalf.It was possible, though not perhaps likely, that a critical stage in South Africa&apos;s relations with other members of the Common-wealth might be reached before the need arose for a Commonwealthdecision on an application by the Gold Coast for commonwealth membership. But, before that need arose, we should have been obliged to disclose our intention to grant full independence to theGold Coast in connection with the application which we shouldhave to make to the United Nations for amendment of the Trustee-ship Agreement in respect of Togoland.(b) If the Gold Coast were admitted to full commonwealth membership, it would be necessary to regularise the position of thePrime Minister of the Central African Federation who (as PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia) had for years attended Meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers as an observer, though not as of right. It would become necessary to admit him to these Meetingsas of right, and possibly to make other changes which would accord to the Federation, within the limits set by its constitution, tnepractical substance of full Commonwealth membership. these changes should not, however, override the relations with the Crownwhich were highly prized by the two Colonies included within theFederation.(c) It was pointed out that the right of direct access to the sovereign could not now be said to be, as implied in paragraph 2 of
C. (54) 307, an essential mark of Commonwealth membership.Though all the independent members of the Commonwealthcontinued to recognise the Sovereign as Head of the commonwealth and as the symbol of the free association of its peoples, the Common-wealth already included one Republic (India) whose people had nopersonal allegiance to the Sovereign and whose Government hadnot the right of direct access to The Queen in the sense in which thatwas enjoyed by other Commonwealth Governments.id) Strong efforts should be made to prevent any furtherencroachment on the position of the Judicial Committee of the privy council as the final arbiter of law throughout the Commonwealth.The existence of the Judicial Committee as a final court of appealcould be developed into a strong practical and constitutional link between Commonwealth peoples. It was worth considering whether,as a practical demonstration that this was a Commonwealth institu-tion, arrangements could not be made for sittings of the Committeeto be held on occasion in Commonwealth capitals other than London.ie) The Commonwealth contained a number of countries in varying stages of development ranging from complete dependence to full nationhood. Some of the difficulties discussed in C. (54) 307arose from the fact that so sharp a distinction was made between the few fully independent countries on the one hand and, on the other,all those which had not yet attained independence. This tended togive undue prominence to the attainment of full independence,though it was in fact only the last stage in a long process of constitutional development. It would be preferable that moreemphasis should be laid on the gradual nature of this constitutionalevolution to independence. From this point of view it would be advantageous if at some stage the Colonial Office and the Common-wealth Relations Office could be combined into a single Departmentof Commonwealth Affairs which would be concerned with all commonwealth countries whatever the stage they had reached intheir constitutional development.In the meantime, while responsibility continued to be divided between the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office,it was agreed that the Commonwealth Relations Office should not undertake responsibility for relations with any Commonwealthterritories before they had reached the stage of full independence.(/) Ministers agreed in principle with the proposals outlined inparagraph 9 of C. (54) 307 for training Gold Coast officials in the handling of international business.ig) It was desirable that the policy of the United KingdomGovernment in respect of future Commonwealth development should, so far as practicable, be continuous whatever political party was in office. For this reason it would be advantageous if, at theappropriate stage, confidential consultations could be held with theOpposition on the general outline of the policy which the Govern-ment were proposing to pursue in this matter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas no need for the Cabinet to take any executive decision at thepresent time on the points raised in the report of the Cabinet Com-mittee which the Commonwealth Secretary had presented inC. (54) 307. It would be most unwise to take precipitate decisions ona matter which had such far-reaching consequences. Certainly therewas no need to anticipate events. The precise nature of the executivedecision to be taken, when the time came, might well be influenced bycontemporary circumstances which could not at present be foreseen.At the same time, it was right that Ministers should look ahead andshape the general course which, subject to contingencies, they thoughtit best to follow. And, as this was not a matter for decision by theUnited Kingdom alone, it would be prudent to ascertain theprovisional views of Prime Ministers of some of the other Common-wealth countries. No formal consultations should be held at thisstage, but the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime
Ministers would afford a convenient opportunity for informal talks on this question with the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia andNew Zealand. It would be convenient for this purpose if a version of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s report could be prepared in a form inwhich it could be handed to those Prime Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s memorandum(C. (54) 307) and of the accompanying report on thefuture of Commonwealth membership.(2) Approved in principle the specific proposals put forward in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iv) of paragraph 11 ofC. (54) 307.(3) Agreed that, at the forthcoming meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, the opportunity should be taken to holdprivate conversations with the Prime Ministers ofCanada, Australia and New Zealand on the future courseof Commonwealth development and to ascertain how fartheir provisional views were in accord with thoseexpressed in C. (54) 307.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th December, 1954.
