industrial disputes.Postmen&apos;sWages.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 24thConclusions,Minute 6.). 1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster General (C. (54) 127) seeking authority for the course ofaction which he proposed to follow in handling a claim by the Unionof Post Office Workers for increased wages.The Postmaster General said that the Union had made a claim for up-grading the value of the work of postmen. On this claim the arbitration Tribunal had found that there were no grounds for placing a higher value on the work of London postmen, but thatcertain points affecting provincial postmen ought to be examined.The Union were seeking to interpret this award as meaning that theprovincial&apos;men should receive an increase in wages and that the wages of London postmen should automatically be raised to preserve thecustomary differential between London and the provinces. this interpretation could not be accepted. He recognised, however, thatpostmen&apos;s wages had not been increased since January, 1953, and that since then the index of weekly wage rates had risen by 5 points.There might therefore be a case on economic grounds for an increasein postmen&apos;s wages. The Union had not so far made a claim on those grounds, because it had hoped to get an increase first on valueof work grounds, and then to claim a further increase on economic grounds. In these circumstances he thought the best course wouldbe for him to see the General Secretary of the Union and tell him(i) that the Government could not accept his interpretation of the tribunals award; (ii) that they were prepared to seek an elucidationof this award through the Minister of Labour and subsequently todiscuss with the Union the question of the pay of provincial postmen;and (iii) that, if the Union felt that they had a good case for makinga claim on economic grounds, the Post Office, as always, would beready to discuss it. He could not promise that even on this basis a stoppage would be avoided; but, if it occurred, the Governmentwould be on firm ground in resisting it and might hope for public support in doing so.The Minister of Labour supported the Postmaster General&apos;sproposals. He would prefer that the offer to discuss a more generalclaim should be put, not in terms of a claim on economic grounds,but in terms of a claim based on grounds other than the value of work.The interview with the General Secretary of the Union should takeplace as soon as possible.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Home Secretary said that, if there were a stoppage, he hoped that the use of troops would be deferred for as long as possible and that every effort would be made to deal with the situation bythe use of volunteers. Troops had not so far been used in a dispute in which the State was the employer. The Postmaster General under-took to consider this further, though he was doubtful whether it wouldbe possible to find the necessary number of volunteers.(b) If negotiations broke down, it was important that theGovernment should enter a conflict with as much public support and sympathy as possible. The Minister of Labour said that his Depart-ment would watch very carefully the presentation of the issue to thepublic.The Cabinet Authorised the Postmaster General to see the General Secre-tary Of the Union of Post Office Workers and to explain thatthe Government could not accept his interpretation of theTribunal&apos;s award, but were prepared to seek an elucidationof the award through the Minister of Labour and subse-quently to discuss the pay of provincial postmen; andfurther that, if the Union felt that they had a case for makinga claim on anything other than value of work grounds, hewould be ready to discuss it.46069 B 2
2 ) LUIndustrialDisputes.Railways.(previous reference:CC. (53) 79thConclusions,Minute 1.)European coal and steel community.(previous reference:C.C.(54)4thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Fuel and Power, the Minister of Supply and the commonwealth secretary (C. (54), 126, 131 and 132) reporting the results of the consultations which the Cabinet had on 21st January invited themto undertake with a view to ascertaining the views of other Common-wealth Governments and of the coal and steel industries of the UnitedKingdom on the suggestion that the United Kingdom should enterinto a contractual association with the European Coal and steel community. They also had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (54) 133) suggesting that, beforenegotiations were opened with the Community, a Committee ofMinisters should consider in the light of these reports the problemsof commercial policy to which this association would give rise.The Foreign Secretary said that four months had passed sinceM. Monnet, the President of the High Authority of the Community,had invited our views on the basis of our association with theCommunity, and it would be embarrassing if our reply to his enquiryhad to be delayed much longer. From this point of view he would prefer that an immediate reply should be sent to M. Monnet, offering to open negotiations at the earliest convenient opportunity and making it plain that it was our object to reach an agreement with theCommunity which would include the establishment of a common market for steel. The alternative would be to remit the problem forfurther study by a Committee of Ministers, as the President of theBoard of Trade proposed; but he hoped that, if that course wasadopted, the Committee Could be asked to report by the end of April.The Minister of Supply said that the steel industry were appre-hensive about the possible consequences of establishing a common market in steel. He himself was disposed to accept their conclusionthat, if the matter were considered solely from the point of view ofour economic interest, there were few advantages and some potentialrisks in entering into a contractual association with the Community.But the industry recognised that these risks might be outweighed by international political advantages which they were not competent to assess. And he believed that, if they were intimately associated withthe negotiations, they might in the end be brought to accept a contractual  association including a common market.    It was02. The Minister of Labour said that further negotiations were now taking place with the Railway Unions about their wagesstructure. The National Union of Railwaymen were demanding anincrease of 10s. 6d. in the basic rate. The footplate workers hadthreatened to strike on 24th April unless they were satisfied that theTransport Commission intended to increase their differentials; butit was likely that, as a result of negotiations during the day, this threat would be withdrawn. The clerical and administrative workerswanted even greater increases. The claims made by the Unionstotalled  26Jr millions, while the increases which the transport commission had in mind amounted to no more than  2^ millions.The immediate issue for the Cabinet to decide was whether theTransport Commission should be encouraged to resist the claim ofthe National Union of Railwaymen for an increase in the basic rate.If this claim were not resisted, all subsequent settlements related tothe award of 7s. to the railwaymen would be reopened, and a freshwages cycle would be started.The Cabinet Endorsed the view of the Minister of Labour that theTransport Commission should be encouraged to resist thedemand of the National Union of Railwaymen for a further increase in the basic rate of pay for railwaymen.
High 4.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Prime MinisterCommission of South Africa had now given notice that he would table in the territories. Union Parliament on 12th April a resolution proposing the renewal(Previous of negotiations for the transfer of the High Commission Territories to reference: the Union. The representations made to him in pursuance of theC.C. (54) 24th Cabinefs decision of 31st March had apparently led him to modifyConclusions, the terms of the resolution, but had not dissuaded him from tablingMinute 2.) it. This initiative would receive widespread publicity in this country,and Questions about the Government^ attitude towards it were bound to be asked in both Houses of Parliament.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he saw no advantage indeferring a positive reply on the ground that the resolution had notyet been passed by the Union Parliament. He would prefer to say at once that the United Kingdom Government could not considertransfer of the Territories at this time.important for this purpose that they should have an early opportunityof direct discussion with the technical experts of the Community.If, however, M. monnet  enquiry were now answered in terms whichimplied that the United Kingdom Government had accepted theprinciple of the common market, the good-will of the industry was likely to be lost. Indeed, the Government might be faced withdetermined opposition from all sections of the iron and steel industryand the engineering industry, employers and workers alike; and thiswould involve them in serious political embarrassment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that M. Monnet was nowin the United States and would not be able to come here for negotia-tions until the end of May. We could therefore inform him that wewere ready to enter into the discussions which he had proposed assoon as was convenient to him. This answer need not imply that we accepted, even in principle, the plan of association which he had proposed in his communication of 24th December. Meanwhile, aCommittee of Ministers could consider the problems involved andformulate definite proposals to be put to M. Monnet when thenegotiations began.The Minister of Fuel and Power supported the suggestion madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the President ofthe High Authority of the European Coal and steel community that we should be ready to discuss with him,as soon as it was convenient for him to come to london for this purpose, the precise form of our association withthe Community.(2) Agreed that a Ministerial Committee comprising repre-sentatives of Foreign Office,Treasury,Commonwealth Relations Office,Board of Trade,Ministry of Supply,Ministry of Fuel and Power,should formulate, and submit to the Cabinet not later than10th May, instructions to the United Kingdom delegation which would negotiate with the President of the high authority the form of the United Kingdom&apos;s association with the Authority.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it should be stated, in reply to any Questionsasked in Parliament, that the United Kingdom Govern-ment could not consider transfer of the High commission territories to the Union at the present time.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to seek the PrimeMinister^ approval of the precise terms in which thisanswer should be given.Food- 5.   The Minister of Food said that, in order to ensure adequateBacon imports. and regular supplies of bacon when rationing was ended in July, he(Previous        was anxious to increase imports of Danish bacon in 1955 from reference:      200,000 tons to 220,000 tons.  This addition would give the DanesCC. (53) 68th   confidence in the British market and would encourage them to keepConclusions,    production at the level needed to meet our demands.   It would minute 3.)       involve increased overseas expenditure.   On the other hand, if theimports arrived at regular intervals and retail prices were main-tained, there would be an Exchequer profit on the transaction. And,if he undertook to buy an additional 20,000 tons, he could make ita condition of the contract that supplies should be shipped at statedintervals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toaccept this proposal on the understanding that the Minister of food would take all practical steps, whether by conditions of the contractor by arrangements for storage, to ensure evenly-spaced deliveries ofbacon to retailers.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Food to enter into contracts forthe import of 220,000 tons of Danish bacon in 1955 on theunderstanding that arrangements would be made to ensureregular deliveries of supplies to retailers.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th April, 1954.
