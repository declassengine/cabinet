BritishEuropeanAirways^RenfrewMaintenanceBase.2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofTransport and Civil Aviation (C. (54) 345) and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (C. (54) 347) about the desire of British european airways (B.E.A.) to close their maintenance base at Renfrew andto transfer the remaining work to London Airport.The Minister of Transport said that, in view of the strength oflocal feeling on this matter, the Chairman of the Corporation had sought the Government&apos;s views on it. It was not a matter on whichhe could give a formal direction to the Corporation, but he could hardly decline the request for an expression of the GovernmenfsViews. It had been confirmed by an independent accountant thatB;E.A. would stand to save at least  800,000 over the next five yearsby making this change irt their arrangements; and the Chairmanhad made it clear that, if the Corporation were required to keep the base open, they would expect the Government&quot; to recoup themfinancially for the additional cost involved. The Minister said thathe was proposing to discuss the matter with representatives of theScottish Trade Union Council and the Scottish Council (Developmentof Industry), when he met them later in the week; but, although. 47188-2b 2ParMament. 1.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the Debate onDebate on the Address in reply to the Queen&apos;s Speech on the opening of thethe Address.     forthcoming session.The Cabinet were informed that, according to present plans,notice of presentation of the National Insurance Bill would be given on Tuesday, 30th November, which would rule out discussion onthis topic during the Debate. The recent debates in the House ofCommons oh foreign affairs had had the result that there was verylittle in that field which could suitably form the subject of furtherParliamentary discussion at the present time. In these circumstances it was to be hoped that the Opposition would agree that the debate on the Address should be concluded on 6th December. The SecondReading of the National Insurance Bill could then be taken on 7th December. As part of these arrangements it might be necessaryto undertake that time would be found after the Christmas recessfor a general debate on all aspects of the problem of provision for old age, which had been the subject of enquiry by the PhillipsCommittee.The Cabinet recognised that the reference in the Queen&apos;s speech to the taking of rrieasUres &quot; to meet possible new forms of warfare &quot;would provide the Opposition with an opening to raise defence issuesduring the course of the Debate on the Address. It would suit the convenience of Ministers if any debate on defence matters couldbe deferred until 6th December, but this would depend on the subjectChosen for any amendment which the Opposition might decide totable On the Address.The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion on the defence problems which were likely to be raised in the Debate and on theform which any Government statement on them might take.In the course of further discussion the view was expressed thatthe Opposition might choose to make the cost of living the principalissue in the Debate. The Government might find it desirable to take an opportunity in the course of the Debate to give some indication of their policy on agriculture and education.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume^ at a meeting to be held later that day,discussion of the arrangements for the Debate on the address, with particular reference to the form and timing of any statement to be made on defence policy.
he would announce no decision until after he had held those discus-sions, he considered that B.E.A. would have to be told that theGovernment did not wish to press them to cancel the proposed move.Until it was definitely known that the premises would be available on a known date, it was difficult to take effective steps to findalternative tenants for them.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that opinion in the HomeAffairs Committee had been evenly divided on this question. he recognised the force of the economic arguments for the course whichthe Minister recommended, but there was no doubt that a plan which involved moving work on aircraft from a Scottish development area to a populous part of London would provoke strong criticism on both sides of the House of Commons and from opinion in Scotlandgenerally.In discussion it was argued, on the one hand, that to compelB.E.A. to carry on activities which had been conclusively shown tobe unjustified on commercial standards would be inconsistent withthe Governments constant pressure on the nationalised industries to become self-supporting and to dispense with Exchequer subsidies.It was also pointed out that, if the Government were to recoup B.E.A.financially for the loss they would sustain by maintaining their base at Renfrew, they would find it difficult in future to resist demands for financial assistance from firms which they were seeking to persuade to establish factories in development areas.The view was expressed, on the other hand, that the Governmentwould be justified in taking a broader view of this matter. Therewere sound reasons for discouraging further concentration of industryin London. From the general employment point of view, moreover,B.E.A.&apos;s proposal would involve, on the one hand, redundancy for at least 250 of their employees in an area where there was in anycase a risk of an increasing degree of unemployment, and, on theother, an intensification of the labour demand in North-West Londonwhere there was already a shortage of skilled workmen.It was the view of the Cabinet that no final decision could betaken on this question until the outcome of the Ministers discussions with representatives of both sides of Scottish industry was known,and until further information was available about the possibilitiesof providing continuing employment for B.E.A.&apos;s employees at theRenfrew base.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to makea further report on this matter in the light of his forth-coming discussions with the Scottish Trades union council and the Scottish Council (Development ofIndustry).(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Supply to report on the prospects of finding analternative tenant for the Renfrew premises, who could provide alternative employment for the men who wouldbe displaced from their employment if the B.E.A. movedtheir maintenance base to London.Pensions for 3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of old Age Pensions and National Insurance (C. (54) 350) submitting his fulland War proposals for improvements in war pensions and in benefits underDisability. the National Insurance Scheme.   They also had before them a(Previous memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 351) on reference: the future of the scheme for relieving old age pensioners of someC.C. (54) 76th part of the duty on tobacco.
In discussion of these papers the following points were raised:  (a) Attention was drawn to the heavy burden which this scheme would eventually impose upon the Exchequer. Although the netadditional cost to the Exchequer in the first two years would notexceed  25 millions a year, the Exchequer^ share of the total costof National Insurance was likely to rise to  389 millions in 15 years&apos;time and to  517 millions in 25 years&apos; time. This considerationamply justified the Government in declining to be rushed intoprecipitate action in this matter. On the other hand, the increases in benefits which were now to be made should hold the position forsome time to come. They would also enable the Government to claim that this was the only country in the world which granted asubsistence pension without a means test.(b) The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had accepted all the detailed proposals set out in C. (54) 350 with one exception, viz., the rate ofthe increment to be paid to a man who deferred his retirement afterattaining the age of 65. Such a man could at present increase theamount of his eventual weekly pension by 3s. for each year workedafter the age of 65. If the present relations were preserved betweenthe increment and the normal pension rate, the increment could beraised from 3s. to 4s. when the ordinary pension rates were increased;and, if this were done, it would still be possible to argue that no one would lose financially by deferring his retirement. On the otherhand, the Phillips Committee were likely to recommend that theseincrements should not in future be increased when pension rates were raised; and, on this account and also because of the eventualcost, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would prefer that this particular proposal should be held over for consideration at a later stage.The Minister said that there were political arguments in favourof either course. He recognised, however, the special force of thesuggestion that this additional concession should be held in reserveso that it might be used, if necessary, to balance any unpopularchanges in the National Insurance Scheme which the government might have to introduce at a later stage in consequence of the PhillipsReport.(c) Under present arrangements it was contemplated that theReport of the Government Actuary would be published when theGovernment^ plans were announced on 1st December, even thoughthe Report of the Phillips Committee could not be published until a few days later. In discussion it was suggested that there wouldhave been advantages in publishing the two Reports simultaneously.For the Phillips Report, by its support for the contributory principle,would help to offset criticisms, based on the Government Actuary&apos;sReport, that over the past five years the rate of contributions underthe Scheme had been unduly high. It was agreed that theGovernment Actuary&apos;s Report should be published at the latestmoment consistent with the Ministers statutory obligations in respectof its presentation to Parliament.id) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the tobaccotoken scheme for old age pensioners was both expensive and difficultto administer. He would have liked to bring it to an end, or at least to reduce the amount of the concession made under it. But he recognised the political difficulty of withdrawing a concession fromthose who already enjoyed it; and he had therefore put forward thesuggestion that the scheme should in future be confined to those already drawing old age pensions.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that thisproposal, by differentiating between old age pensioners of differentages, would create anomalies which it would be difficult to defend.The financial saving would be small; and he feared that it would
involve the Government in serious political odium withoutcompensating financial advantage.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the reception of theGovernment^ scheme as a whole would be seriously damaged if it,were accompanied by the limitation of the tobacco token schemewhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no increase should at present be made in theincrements payable to an old age pensioner on accountof years worked after reaching the age of 65.(2) Agreed that for the present ho change should be made in thetobacco token scheme for old age pensioners.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) above, approved theproposals set out in C (54) 350 for improvements inthe National Insurance Scheme and in the rates of warpensions; and took note that the Minister of Pensionsand National Insurance would announce the Govern-ment&apos;s plan in the House Of Commons on 1st December.4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 354 and 356) onthe problems created by the&apos; rising scale of immigration of Africansand West Indians into the United Kingdom.The Home Secretary said that the rate of immigration had greatly increased in recent months, and it was now expected that about 10,000 would come to this country from the West Indies in1954, as compared with a little over 2,000 in 1953. The gatheringmomentum of this movement made it a matter of some urgencythat the Government should provide themselves with means of controlling it. It was, however, important that this should be donein such a way as to reduce the scope for controversy. He therefore proposed that a Departmental Committee should be appointed toconsider what changes should be made in the law relating to the admission of any class of British subjects to this country. ThisWould serve to focus public opinion on this question and would help to gain public support for legislation to deal with it.. In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Commonwealth Secretary said that most other commonwealth countries already had power to deport Britishsubjects, and legislation on this limited aspect of the problem mighthave been introduced without any preliminary enquiry. He agreed,however, that as it would not be practicable to pass such legislation during the present session, there was no reason to exclude this partof the problem from the general enquiry proposed by the HomeSecretary.(b) While there would be great practical difficulty in controlling the admission to this country of citizens of the Irish Republic, theirexclusion from any new system of immigration control applicable tocitizens of Commonwealth countries would be misunderstood andresented.&quot; (c) It was important that means of dealing with this problem should be made available without delay. Since most of the relevant information had already been collected, the proposed DepartmentalCommittee should be able to present their report Within a few months.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to submit proposals for the membership of the Departmental Committee suggested inC. (54) 354.
Sale of ArmsAbroad.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 1stConclusions,Minute 4.)The middle east.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 358) proposing that the number of British aircraft to be supplied to Middle East countries should be limited with aview to maintaining equilibrium of armaments in the area.The Foreign Secretary said that it was an important objective of our foreign policy to reduce tension in the Middle East as a first step towards the settlement of differences between Arab countries and Israel. We should therefore continue to adhere to the policy laid down by the tripartite declaration of 1950, under which we had undertaken to keep an even balance in our sales of military equipment to Israel and the Arab States. He feared that we should endangerthis balance if we were to carry through the proposed programme for the sale of 45 jet aircraft to Egypt. On political grounds hewould have preferred that we should refrain from supplying anymore military equipment to Middle East countries; but he recognisedthat it would not be practicable to refuse to meet any of the orders which the Egyptians had already placed in this country, and that wehad no means of preventing other countries from selling armamentsto Middle East countries if we declined to do so. Indeed, the balanceappeared already to have been disturbed by the orders which theFrench had accepted for the supply of Mystere aircraft. Our recent decision to offer Centurion tanks to Israel had also caused disquietin Jordan. He hoped that the Cabinet would approve the proposals in C. (54) 358 for reducing the number of British aircraft to be delivered to Egypt and Syria, and that by consultation with theUnited States and France it would be possible to concert an agreed programme by which each country would be guided in futuredeliveries of armaments to Middle East countries.In discussion the following points were made:  -(a) It was important that we should establish more precisely the nature of the commitments undertaken by the FrenchGovernment for the supply of Mystere aircraft to Israel. It shouldbe possible to obtain this information from the Near EastArmaments Co-ordinating Committee. It was, however, doubtfulwhether it would be appropriate to ask this body to undertake the wider review envisaged by the Foreign Secretary.(b) The orders which had been placed by the Egyptians in thiscountry about four years ago, and on which they had paid substantialdeposits, should not be considered on the same footing as fresh orders which Middle East countries were now seeking to place with us.(c) If a proper balance of military strength was to be maintained between countries in the Middle East it would be necessary to take into account the quality as well as the number of their aircraft andother armaments.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of defence to consider these questions further, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, with a view to submittingagreed proposals for considering by the Cabinet at their next meeting.
