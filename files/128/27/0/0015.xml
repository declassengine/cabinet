Sudan.(previous reference:C.C,(54) (4thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet had before them Foreign Office telegrams Nos. 59,60, 61, 76, 77 and 78 from Khartoum containing appreciations of thecurrent situation in the Sudan; and a telegram from Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Cairo (No. 310) giving the latest information on political developments in Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that he agreed with the estimatemade by the Minister of State in paragraph 2 of telegram No. 77.He considered that the Governor-General should send for the sudanese Prime Minister and tell him that any attempt to replaceIbrahim Ahmed on the Governor-Generals Commission would leadto further disturbances and make orderly government of the Sudanimpossible. The Governor-General should therefore ask the PrimeMinister to give an undertaking in writing that he would not take any action designed to secure this replacement. The Prime minister should also be pressed to issue a declaration of confidence in allSudan Government officials; and to agree that further provocativeinterference by the Egyptians should be stopped. He should be persuaded, in particular, that it was out of the question that GeneralNeguib should return for the opening of Parliament on 10th March,or that Major Salah Salem should pay further visits to the Sudan atthe present time. There was a chance that the Prime Minister wouldgive the necessary assurances; but, if he refused, the Governor-General should declare a state of constitutional emergency underArticle 102 of the Constitution. He would then be at liberty to callon British troops to maintain law and order. If it was foundnecessary to declare a constitutional emergency, it was obviouslydesirable that the Governor-General should have the support of hisCommission, and it would be much harder to obtain this if action were delayed until after the opening of Parliament on 10th Marchwhen the Prime Minister could take steps to remove Ibrahim Ahmedfrom the Commission. It might be argued that the Governor-?General was not justified in insisting that Egyptian Ministers shouldnot visit the Sudan while the Minister of State remained in Khartoum;but, if this point were taken, it could be maintained with truth thatthe presence of the Minister of State was in no way provocative andthat, unlike the Egyptians, he had refrained from making partisanstatements. It would be a mistake at this stage to denounce theAnglo/Egyptian Agreement, though it was possible that, if theGovernor-General declared a constitutional emergency, the Egyptiansthemselves would denounce it. A policy of drift in the Sudan might lead to civil war, and, quite apart from the effect in the Sudan itself,that would destroy all chance of concluding any form of defence agreement with Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that he had embodied these views ina draft telegram of instructions to the Minister of State on which hewould like to have the Cabinefs views. Copies of the draft were handed round at the meeting.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Sudanese Prime Minister might give the assurancesrequired but, under cover of this apparent compliance, might alert hisown followers to take violent action. This might, however, be pre-vented by making it clear to him that any violent action by his supporters would at once be countered by action on the part of theMahdi&apos;s followers.(h) The draft telegram suggested that the Governor-general should threaten the declaration of a constitutional emergency only if the Prime Minister refused assurances that he would take no actionto replace Ibrahim Ahmed on the Commission; and that, if he refusedassurances on the other two points the declaration of confidence inthe Sudan Government officials, and the stopping of Egyptian inter-ference a declaration of constitutional emergency need not automatically follow and the matter should be referred to London for
(..    ....Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th March, 1954.further consideration. This delay would be acceptable only ifessential conditions of security permitted. The Foreign secretary undertook to amend the telegram to make this point clear.(c) A force of two battalions and one Fighter / Bomber Squadronwas being held in readiness in the Canal Zone to move at seventy-two hours&apos; notice to Khartoum. It was agreed that this force should now be made ready to move at twenty-four hours&apos; notice.(d) At the present moment there was only one British battalion,under strength, in Khartoum. In the event of a sudden emergencythis battalion might not be able to protect the Palace and at the sametime to secure the airfield possession of which was essential to theplan for rapid reinforcement of the British troops in Khartoum.Timing was therefore of the utmost importance; and the Governor-General should be told to let the Commanders-in-Chief, middle east, know the exact hour and day of his meeting with the SudanesePrime Minister so that, if the necessary assurances were not given,the troops from the Canal Zone could fly in without any delay.(e) If the Governor-General felt that in the interests of securityit was essential to have another British battalion in Khartoum before he sent for the Sudanese Prime Minister, he should be free to makethe necessary arrangements for its arrival direct with the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East. It could be said that this battalion wasstaging through Khartoum on its way to Kenya.The Foreign Secretary said that he would amend his draft tele-gram to the Minister of State to take account of the points made in discussion. He would also seek to make it more clear in the emphasisand order of the telegram that the Governor-GeneraFs first task, inthe interests of the Sudanese people, was to exert the utmost pressure on the Sudanese Prime Minister to give the desired assurances.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would send immediateinstructions to the Minister of State, revised in accordancewith the points made in their discussion.(2) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to arrange that the forces heldin readiness in the Canal Zone to reinforce Khartoumshould be ready to move at twenty-four hours&apos; notice.
