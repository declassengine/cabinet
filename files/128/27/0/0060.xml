european defence.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 59thConclusions.Minute .1.)1. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet on his recentvisits to Brussels, Bonn, Rome and Paris for discussion of theproblems arising from the French rejection of the European defence community (E.D.C.) Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that in all the capitals which he had visited, except Paris, he had been impressed and encouraged by the obvious sincerity with which our initiative in seeking a solution to europe&apos;s problems had been welcomed and by the general willingness to follow our lead. Broadly speaking, and subject to certain detailedcomments, there could now be said to be general support in principleamong the Governments with which he had conferred for a settlementbased on the admission of Germany to the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.), subject to safeguards, and German andItalian adherence to the Brussels Treaty. Contrary to his expectations,the Benelux Powers had shown no anxiety over the proposedreorientation of the Treaty of Brussels. Dr. Adenauer, for his part,naturally attached importance to early termination of the occupationregime, but. he was realistic enough to recognise that special arrangements would continue to be needed for Berlin and that it was bound to take some time to work out the tripartite arrangements which would be necessary in respect of the occupying forcesremaining in Germany. Provided that Dr. Adenauer&apos;s attitude hadnot stiffened as a result of his subsequent discussions with Mr. Dulles,it should prove possible to work out a solution of this aspect of theGerman problem as a separate issue. The Italian Government were generally sympathetic to our line of approach.The attitude which he had encountered when he reached Parishad been less forthcoming. The main French preoccupation was toensure that as many as possible of the arrangements which must nowbe devised to govern German admission to the Western Alliance anda German defence contribution should be embodied in a reconstitutedBrussels Treaty; and the French Government would have muchpreferred that Germany&apos;s admission to N.A.T.O. should be postponed until such arrangements had been completed to their satisfaction.After prolonged discussion, however, M. Mendes-France had beenbrought to admit that Germany&apos;s admission to N.A.T.O. could not be deferred, and agreement had been reached on the terms of amemorandum which defined the respective positions of the British andFrench Governments in this matter. Copies of this memorandumwere handed round to the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the undertaking he had given to the French Government on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment was to consider how much of the arrangements could inpractice be entrusted to the Treaty of Brussels Organisation. Forexample, it might be found possible to embody within the brussels treaty framework arrangements between the continental countries concerned to govern the manufacture of armaments and itssupervision (the latter, possibly, with British participation).Arrangements on these lines might well prove, on further examination,to be acceptable to us provided, as M. Mendes-France had agreed,that the execution of any military arrangements were carried out bythe N.A.T.O. machine and that that machine was not duplicated.Indeed, it might be preferable that agreements limiting the size ofcontingents should be concluded under the aegis of the brussels treaty rather than through the machinery of Supreme Headquarters.Allied Powers in Europe, whose interest was naturally to secure thelargest possible N.A.T.O. forces. General Gruenther, with whom hehad discussed the matter, was favourably disposed to arrangements on the lines proposed, and had promised his co-operation. We hadnot as yet received any request for fresh assurances about the levelof forces which the United Kingdom would undertake to retain onthe Continent of Europe: moreover, under arrangements on the linesnow. contemplated, we might not be called upon to commit any forces to the Continent for more than a limited period, and the extent ofour commitment might remain subject to periodic review.
2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had received a message from the United States Secretary of State expressing his concernover recent developments in the Chinese situation. Mr. Dullesfeared that, if the Chinese Communists persisted in their preparations for an attack on the island of Quemoy and in their propaganda thatsuch an attack was but a first step in a planned offensive againstFormosa, there was grave risk that they would come into openconflict with the United States. The decision whether or not toparticipate in the.defence of Quemoy presented difficulties for theUnited States Government which Mr. Dulles had said he wished todiscuss on his arrival in London that day. Our Chiefs of Staffconsidered that Quemoy, which was a small island close to theFormosa.(previous reference:CC. (53) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Foreign Secretary said that he now intended to try to convene a conference of the nine Powers most closely concerned inthese matters, opening in London on 27th September. He believedthat such a conference would have fair prospects of success, providedthat the attitude of the United States Government proved to be ingeneral harmony with our own. Whether this was the case should become apparent from the discussions which the Prime Minister andhe would be having with the American Secretary of State later that day.There was general support in the Cabinet for a settlement on thelines indicated by the Foreign Secretary. The arrangements whichwere now taking shape were generally in line with those enunciated bythe Prime Minister at Strasbourg at an earlier date, which the french had themselves rejected in favour of the closer form of european union embodied in the E.D.C. Treaty, and it could be argued in defence of them that closer union could be more easily developedgradually than superimposed. The greater use of the Brussels treaty organisation within the wider N.A.T.O. framework should appeal tothose elements in all countries which still cherished the European idea,and rally those in this country who tended to be hostile to the idea ofGerman re-armament. The Government could take credit for havingdevised a new remedy for Europe&apos;s present difficulties, which hadevoked among our partners in Europe a response which waseverywhere favourable and in most countries enthusiastic.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to joinhim in congratulating the Foreign Secretary on a striking and mostpromising initiative in European affairs. The course which theUnited Kingdom Government must pursue seemed clear, althoughthe Cabinet must not under-estimate the dangers which it wouldinvolve. At home elements ill-disposed towards the Governmentwould miss no opportunity of accusing them of overriding Frenchwishes in the interests of a resurgent Germany. In the United states the advocates of peripheral defence and &quot; Fortress America &quot; wouldintensify their campaign in favour of American extrication from europe. The Prime Minister said that he was glad that we werenot yet faced with requests for undertakings about the military forces which we would be prepared to keep on the Continent. Though theymight be entirely in keeping with the spirit and implications of our existing Treaty commitments, their timing would require most carefulconsideration and they should, if possible, be accompanied by similarundertakings by the United States Government.The Cabinet (1) Recorded their approbation of the outcome of the foreign secretary&apos;s recent discussions in Brussels, Bonn, rome and Paris.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue his efforts topromote a settlement in Western Europe on the basis ofGermany&apos;s admission to N.A.T.O., subject to necessarysafeguards, and a concurrent re-constitution of the Treatyof Brussels Organisation with German and Italianparticipation.
mainland of China, could not be defended successfully againstinvasion from the mainland and that its retention was not essentialto the defence of Formosa. There were therefore good reasons, on military grounds, for advising Mr. Dulles to avoid committing UnitedStates forces in defence of Quemoy or other nearby islands whichwere close to the mainland of China. The Foreign Secretary saidthat he proposed to inform Mr. Dulles of the views of the Chiefs ofStaff and also to impress upon him that public opinion in thiscountry would be unwilling to support the United States if theyshould become embroiled with Communist China for the sake ofQuemoy. The alternatives before the United States Governmentseemed to be to accept the loss of Quemoy, if it should be attacked,without engaging United States forces in its defence, or to forestallthis possibility by reaching some arrangement with the chinese communists under which Quemoy might be transferred to them aspart of a wider accommodation. This second course offered some prospect of bringing about a detente in Chinese-American relations and Mr. Dulles might welcome the good offices of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in promoting an arrangement which, among other things, might provide for the evacuation from Quemoy ofthose Chinese who were attached to the Nationalist cause; for theneutralisation of an agreed area of the waters between the Chinesemainland and Formosa; and for the renunciation by the chinese communists of the use of force in support of their claims to Formosaand perhaps other islands in this area.The Prime Minister said that it seemed unlikely that the chinese communists could hope to achieve their aims against Formosa by military means so long as they were opposed by the United StatesSeventh Fleet as well as by the army maintained by the Nationalists.The United States for their part would feel bound in honour todefend the people of Formosa against Communist attack, but theymight be content to confine themselves to logistic support for thedefence of Quemoy. The long-term solution of this difficult situation might possibly be found to lie in promoting an agreement for theneutralisation of the island over a lengthy period, accompanied byan undertaking on the part of the United States to prevent hostile action by Nationalist forces against the Chinese mainland.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.3. The Minister of Food said that statements recently issuedby the Fatstock Marketing Corporation sought to ascribe to theGovernment responsibility for the difficulties which farmers were finding in disposing of their pigs for bacon curing. The price forsuch pigs had been assessed too highly and their collection was nowarranged without the need for any effort on the part of the farmers.Before the abandonment of controls by the Ministry of Food, thesupply of bacon pigs had matched the capacity for bacon curing.Subsequently, however, the Fatstock Marketing Corporation, aco-operative organisation set up by the farmers over which theGovernment had no control, had offered unduly favourable terms for bacon pigs, with the result that twice as many pigs were being offered as could be treated by the curing plants. Bacon was still being imported from Denmark under contracts placed by the Ministryof Food, but these supplies had not aggravated the difficulty indisposing of home-grown pigs for bacon. There was therefore nofoundation for the allegations made by the Fatstock MarketingCorporation and he was taking all possible steps to correct theirmisrepresentations.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th September, 1954.Food.Bacon Pigs.(previous reference:C.C.
