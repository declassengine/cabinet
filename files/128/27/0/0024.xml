Road and rail transport.London Fares.(previous reference:CC. (53) 44thConclusions.Minute 2.)183CC. 24 (54)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C. (54) 113) reporting that the British Transport Corn-mission were about to apply to the Transport Tribunal for an increasein London passenger fares.The Minister of Transport said that the Commission estimatedthat they needed an additional revenue of  5 millions a year frompassenger transport in the London area. Under the procedureprescribed by the Transport Act, 1947, they had to apply to theMinister for increased freight charges but to the Transport tribunal for increased passenger fares. He had reason to believe that their first intention had been to seek authority from the Tribunal forimmediate increases of London fares, without enquiry, sufficient to yield an additional  2-1- millions a year; but they now intended thattheir application should take the form of a comprehensive newLondon Passenger Charges Scheme submitted under Section 76 ofthe Act, which would be subject to a full-scale public enquiry by theTribunal. Whilst any further increases in London fares would be unwelcome, the Commission^ present case for seeking them appearedto him to be sound. Thus, even after the proposed increases (whichwould, in particular, leave the minimum 2d. fare unchanged), thetotal increase in fares as compared with those in force before the war would be 94 per cent., whereas the increase in costs had been notless than 140 per cent. The Government would not in his view bejustified in giving a formal direction to the Commission prohibitingthem from making their application to the Tribunal. If they were allowed to proceed with their application, an announcement of itssubmission to the Tribunal would be made within the next two days,but it was unlikely that any increase in London fares would come intooperation before September.There was general agreement that the Government would not bejustified in giving a direction to the Transport Commission in thismatter and that in the circumstances the proposed application to theTransport Tribunal must be allowed to go forward.The Cabinet Took note of C. (54) 113.HighCommissionTerritories.(previous reference:CC. (54) 17thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet had before them further memoranda by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 115 and 119) on the question ofthe transfer of the High Commisson Territories to the Union of SouthAfrica.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that on 10th March theCabinet had authorised him to instruct the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in South Africa that, if it should become clear that theSouth African Government intended to raise this question in theUnion Parliament, he should at once inform Dr. Malan that in that event nothing could stop an immediate debate in both Houses ofParliament at Westminster and a definite statement by the UnitedKingdom Government that they could not consider transfer at this time. The South African Government had now sent him a copy ofthe resolution which they proposed to table in the South AfricanParliament requesting transfer of the Territories (Appendix toC. (54). 115) and had invited the comments of the United KingdomGovernment upon it. In discussion with the High Commissioner for south Africa in London he had repeated at length the arguments against the raising of this issue at the present time. Dr. Geyer had urged him to put these arguments to Dr. Malan: even if they didnot succeed in deterring the South African Government from pro-ceeding with the resolution, they might at least help to keep the atmosphere friendly^
Germany.Return ofCapturedArchives.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 85thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 109) regarding the request of the German federal government for the return to their custody of the German diplomaticdocuments which fell into Allied hands at the end of the war.The Foreign Secretary said that the German Government were now asking that these documents should be returned to their custodyand that the project for the publication of selected documents on german foreign policy should be carried on from Germany on aquadripartite basis, German historians being added to the existingteam of British, French and American historians. This request was strongly supported by the United States Government. It was equallystrongly opposed by the British historians associated with the publi-cation project, who said that they could have no confidence in the historical integrity of the work if it were transferred to Germany onthe conditions proposed and were likely to withdraw from the projectif the German proposal were adopted.The Foreign Secretary said that the views of the Britishhistorians could only be fully met by retaining the documents in theUnited Kingdom until the publication project had been completed.In view of the attitude of the German and United States Govern-ments, this would be quite impracticable, and some compromisetherefore semed inevitable. He therefore proposed that he should accept the principle of transferring these documents to Germany and continuing the publication project from there, subject to the safe-guards already agreed, but should make the additional condition thatthe principal documents of the Weimar period should be microfilmedbefore they were handed over to the Germans.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Cabinet would presumably wish to reaffirm their previous decision about the attitude which the Government should adopt on the question of transfer,and he sought authority to write to Dr. Malan in the terms of thedraft letter annexed to C. (54) 119.in discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was agreed that the fourth paragraph of the draft letter should end with the words &quot; at the present time.&quot;(b) The Colonial Secretary suggested that the draft lettergenerally, and particularly the penultimate paragraph, laid rather too much emphasis on the closeness of our collaboration with the SouthAfrican Government. If the letter came to be published, the toneof some of these references might excite criticism in view of the native policy of the South African Government.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was not his intention that the letter should be published immediately, but it might befound desirable to publish it at a later date if the Government were pressed to disclose what steps they had taken with a view to pre-venting this issue from being raised. He was of the opinion that thedraft reflected the true position, but he would certainly reconsiderits terms in the light of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s comment.(c) It was suggested that the letter should be marked &quot; Personal&quot;in order to ensure that it should not be published without agreement by both Governments.The Cabinet Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (c) above,authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to write to dr. Malan in the terms of the draft letter annexed toC. (54) 119.
(0 185 CC. 24 (54)In discussion it was suggested that, before the documents were returned to the Germans, microfilm records should be made, notonly of the documents of the Weimar period, but of all the maindocuments which had not already been published. This would be a safe guard against the possibility that a German Government mighthr future be tempted to publish, for purposes of historical con-troversy, records which were incomplete or inaccurate. It shouldalso help to mollify the British historians, who could at least be assured that material for objective historical research would beretained in British custody.The Cabinet Agreed that the German diplomatic documents which had fallen into Allied hands at the end of the war might bereturned to the custody of the German Federal Governmenton the conditions set out in C. (54) 109, provided that steps could first be taken to make microfilm records, not only of the principal documents of the Weimar period, but ofall the main documents which had not already been pub-lished in the selection of Documents on German Foreignpolicy:Raw Materials..       4.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, afterNewsprint.      the Cabi-nefs discussion on 24th March, the Economic Policy Com-(Previous       mittee had agreed that the newspaper industry should be allowed to reference-.      buy an additional 25,000 tons of newsprint from Canada in 1954CC. (54) 22nd  so as to bring their stocks up to the minimum: working level of 80,000Conclusions,    tons.  The industry were, however,, to- be told that they were not atMinute 4.)       liberty to enter into any forward contracts for purchases in future years.  He had done his best to persuade the industry to accept thisdecision, but without success.   They had continued to press very strongly their claim that they should be allowed to contract now to buy 50;000 tons of newsprint from Canada in each of the next fouryears.  They justified this claim partly by the need to assure their future supplies and partly on the ground that they could not obtainthe 25,000 tons in 1954 unless they accepted firm commitments to buy a further 50,000 tons in each of the four following years.The Prime Minister said that he had hoped that means would befound to bring to an end the existing control over newsprint. Itwould surely be a mistake to spend a substantial additional amountof foreign exchange without escaping the odium of the control. Itmight be worth making a little more foreign exchange available ifthe newspapers could thereby be freed from all control over newsrprint. There was no doubt that this control was producingunwelcome results, not only in inequalities between one newspaperand another, but also in the growth of disreputable weekly magazineswhich were not subject to the control.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, in order toincrease supplies to the point at which control could be entirelyrelinquished, annual imports would have to be increased by 100,000tons: in addition to the 50,000 tons which the industry wished to buy from Canada, another 50,000 tons a year would have to be bought from Scandinavia. The growth of the weekly magazines towhich the Prime Minister had referred could not be checked withoutextending the existing system of control and perhaps importing into it an element of official censorship which had hitherto been avoided.In further discussion it was pointed out that the balance ofpayments prospects of the sterling area were not such as to warrant the risks involved in freeing from all control the import of newsprintinto the United Kingdom.   It was also suggested that Ministers

The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 3rd MarchExpenditure.    the Cabinet had agreed that in the course of 1954 means must be(Previous        found of securing a drastic reduction in public expenditure in 1955,Reference:      and had invited him to submit to the Prime Minister proposals on theC.C.

He had pro-Minute?.)       posed to the Prime Minister that two Cabinet Committees shouldbe constituted for this purpose, with the task of reviewing civil expenditure and defence expenditure respectively.   He consideredthat the work of these Committees would be more effective if theywere directed to relate their recommendations to a specified financialtarget.   He had therefore proposed to the Prime Minister that the suggested Committee on Civil Expenditure should be instructed to formulate recommendations which would result in a total saving of 100 millions on the expenditure forecast for 1955.   The corres-ponding target which he had proposed for the Committee on defence expenditure was  150 millions.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 11thConclusions,Minute 13.)6. The Minister of Labour reported that there now seemed tobe a good prospect that the employers&apos; and employees&apos; representatives in the engineering and shipbuilding industries would make a jointrecommendation to their respective constituents for a settlement ofthe wages dispute in these industries. If this should happen, it would represent a very satisfactory outcome of these protracted negotiations.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st March, 1954.should not accept without further enquiry the statement that theindustry could not buy 25,000 tons of newsprint from Canada in1954 without entering into a forward contract involving eight timesthat amount. The Canadian Government might be willing to bring pressure to bear on the Canadian suppliers of newsprint to adopt amore accommodating attitude.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider this matter furtherat their meeting on the following day.
