Parliament. ].   The Lord Privy Seal said that the Second Reading of theIndustrial Organisation and Development Bill was to have beentaken in the House of Commons on 4th February, but opposition toits provisions had developed among Government supporters and pro-ceedings on the Bill would have to be delayed for the time being. he therefore proposed that on 4th February the House of commons should debate the results of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos;Meeting in Sydney.The President of the Board of Trade said that the opposition tothe Bill which had developed among Government supporters was based on objections to the principle of a compulsory levy on industry.This, however, was the alternative to the Labour Governments deviceof the Development Council and, as such, was preferred by organisedindustry. He proposed to see whether the Federation of BritishIndustries would be willing to give public support to the principlesof the Bill, and he would report again on this to the Cabinet.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Egypt- 2.   The Prime Minister drew attention to a telegram from HerDefence Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo (No. 133) suggesting that, in orderNegotiations,    to break the deadlock in the defence negotiations, he should be(Previous        authorised to open further discussions with the Egyptians on the reference:      availability of the Base, provided that there were no further seriousC.C. (54) 6th    incidents in the Canal Zone.   The Prime Minister said that these conclusions,    incidents should not be linked with the defence negotiations, and weMinute 2.)      should adhere to our final offer to the Egyptians.  He agreed, how-ever, that we must soon take steps to end the present deadlock.  Itwas evident from the record of a conversation between Gamal AbdulNasser and a member of Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy that the Egyptiansfelt that time was on their side and that it was of no advantage tothem to conclude an agreement.  Our interests, on the other hand,were ill-served by a protraction of the negotiations, which would pre-. vent us from making progress with the re-deployment of our forces and the building up of a strategic reserve. But, before we made any move, we must have a positive plan to put into operation if negotia-tions broke down, and he hoped that the Committee of ministers which was considering this plan would report to the Cabinet withoutdelay.The Lord Chancellor said that his Committee were awaiting the formulation of a definite military plan which entailed obtaining information from the Commanders-in-Chief in the Canal Zone. he hoped they would be able to report to the Cabinet on 10th February.The Minister of State said that he agreed that, until we had a positive alternative plan, it would be inopportune to open discussions with the Egyptians about the availability of the Base or any other points in the proposals which we had put to them in October. Hethought, however, that, when a suitable time arrived for discussions,we might derive some advantage from offering an alternative formulaabout the availability of the Base which did not link it up in any way with action by the United Nations.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion on 10th February, on thebasis of a report by the Cabinet Committee under theChairmanship of the Lord Chancellor.
Armed Forces.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)Pay.3.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda:  C. (54) 32: by the Minister of Defence, the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Air submitting proposals for increases in Service pay.C. (54) 35: by the Secretary of State for War, seeking approval for special concessions to married men serving overseas.C. (54) 38: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer commenting on these two papers and making alternative proposals.The Minister of Defence said that, since the current rates ofService pay were fixed in 1950, civilian earnings had risen in response to increases in the cost of living and the disparity was now such thatit was becoming increasingly difficult to retain men in regular service with the Armed Forces. In all three Services the rate of re-engage-ment was much too low and, unless this could be corrected, their efficiency was bound to deteriorate. The Chiefs of Staff had expressed the view that, if current trends continued, the services would in a few years&apos; time be incompetent to fulfil their commit-ments. This low rate of re-engagement was due to the counter-attractions of civilian life. He was not asking for a general increasein Service pay, but for selective increases designed to reward skill and experience.  The total cost of his scheme was  21 millions.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the current rate of re-engagement among Chief Petty Officers was only half of what was needed and among Petty Officers and stokers was even lower. Thisprejudiced the future efficiency of the Navy. It could not be denied that civil life offered greater rewards and easier conditions. Whateverstatistical comparisons were made, sailors knew very well that semi-skilled workers in the dockyards had higher pay and shorter hours.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Royal Air force must be able to retain the skilled men needed to service and main-tain aircraft and their equipment. At present they had only 72 percent, of their requirement in this group and, unless the rate of re-engagement could be improved, they would have by 1957 only40 per cent. These skilled men were going out into civilian life, wherethey had good offers of employment. The result was that skill and experience which ought to be used in front-line units had to beemployed uneconomically in training establishments.The Secretary of State for War said that regular engagementsin the Army were now for three years only, though men couldre-engage for further periods of three years up to a maximum of22 years. There were now only 74,000 men in the Army serving onthe old five-year or seven-year engagements. Of 35,250 men who had reached the end of those engagements during the past year, only4,750 had re-engaged. These figures indicated how difficult it wouldbe to retain an adequate cadre of regulars when all had the option of re-engaging or taking their discharge at three-year intervals. AsArmy training became more technical, soldiers found it easier to getcivilian jobs; and the low rate of re-engagement was undoubtedly dueto the attractions of civilian life. If present trends continued, theN.C.O. structure of the Army would be gravely prejudiced.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was unable, for two reasons, to accept the claim submitted on behalf of the Services.First, the total amount of the claim was too large. In view of thegeneral industrial situation, it would be unwise to announce at thisstage increases in Service pay amounting to as much as  21 millions.Secondly, while he accepted the need for improving the rate of regularre-engagemeht, the increases proposed were not sufficiently directed to that purpose. They would in fact cover about 60 per cent, ofthe regulars in the Services. More selective increases should, hethought, be.worked out which would be more narrowly confined to providing incentives to re-engagement. He was also doubtfulwhether it Was necessary to increase the pay of officers at the present
&quot;7751C.C. 7 (54)time. While he agreed that decisions on Service pay should be announced during the debates on the Defence Estimates in March,it was not essential that they should be included in the Defence white paper. There was time, therefore, to consider the matter more care-fully. He suggested that he should examine it further, with theMinister of Defence and the Service Ministers, with a view to formu-lating a more selective list of increases totalling not more than 8 millions.. In the discussion which ensued the following points weremade:  (a) There was general agreement on the importance of improving the current rate of re-engagement in all three Services. The efficiency of the Services could not be maintained without an adequate cadreof experienced N.C.O.S and skilled tradesmen. The pay increasesawarded must be clearly and effectively directed to this purpose. Itwas also suggested that, in settling the detailed rates, it would not be enough to consider only what ought to satisfy men of a given rank and experience: more regard should be had to the amounts actuallyneeded to hold men in the Services despite the counter-attractions of civilian life.(b) The Service Ministers claimed that the pay increases whichthey had proposed would be recognised in the Services as designedto reward experience and technical skill and, as such, to provideincentives to re-engagement.(c) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thathe would have liked to have more information about the causes of thefailure to maintain the rate of re-engagement. Was it clear that itwas the inferior pay which caused men to leave the Services? Ifthey were influenced rather by those amenities of civilian life whichcould not be provided within the Services, the situation could not be remedied by increases in pay. For this reason it would have beenuseful if the Departments had completed the work which had been undertaken with a view to producing an agreed yardstick for relatingService pay to civilian earnings. He thought that even now it wouldbe valuable if this could be completed.(d) Some Ministers doubted whether it was necessary to include in this scheme any pay increases for officers. Would it not be wiser to confine the award to N.C.Os. and men?As against this it was argued that future efficiency depended onretaining in the Services an adequate number of those officers whowere now in their thirties and held rank equivalent to that of Captainor Major. It was the officers in this age group who were in the mostserious financial difficulties, and the Services could ill afford to lose their experience. Improved prospects at this stage of a Service careerwould also help to attract a better type of recruit: it was noticeablethat the quality of entrants to Sandhurst and Cranwell was deteriorating. Finally, it was recalled that the 1950 award had been criticised by the Conservative Party, then in Opposition, as dis-proportionately ungenerous to officers; and Conservative ministers would be exposed to damaging criticism if they now brought forward a scheme which made further improvements in the pay of other rankswhile leaving the relative position of officers unchanged.(e) The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet ofthe heavy burden of defence expenditure. It was this, more than anything else, which had prevented the Government from making further reductions in the level of taxation or arresting the rise in thecost of living. Little had been achieved as a result of his appeals tohis colleagues to reduce the size of Departmental Estimates; and hehad a formidable task ahead of him in framing his forthcoming budget. In these circumstances he found it very difficult to concedein full these claims for increases in Service pay.The Parliamentary secretary i Ministry of Labour, said that itwas the view of his Minister that this was a most inconvenient time
at which to make large increases in Service pay. In industry currentwage claims were tending to be settled by awards of&quot; around Is. aweek and, from his point of view, it was desirable that any increases in Service pay should conform as nearly as possible to a comparablefigUre. ;;; ?In reply to these points the Service Ministers said that they hadbeen willing to meet, within the approved total of the Defence Esti-mates, half of the cost in 1954 of the pay claim which they hadpresented. They now agreed to meet, within their Estimates, 50 percent, of whatever figure might be approved by the Cabinet for improvements in Service pay.(f) It would be a false economy to make pay increases whichwere too small to produce the desired effect in arresting the declinein the rate of re-engagement for regular service. The small increasesmade by the Labour Government in 1949 had given rise to so muchdissatisfaction that the Government had found themselves compelledto make a much larger award in 1950. The Secretary of State forWar said that in his opinion increases totalling less than  18 millions would in practice fail to secure the objects which the Cabinet hadin mind.After some further discussion the Cabinet reached thegeneral conclusion that, as the Services were willing to find from within their approved Estimates for 1954 a sum of  10^ millions for increased Service pay, it would be reasonable that a total annual expenditure of  18 millions should be provided for pay increases designed to maintain the element of experience andtechnical skill in the regular cadres of the Services.The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss the proposals put forward by the Secretary of State for War in C. (54) 35 for special allowances for married men serving in the Army overseas.The Secretary of State for War said that this was a special and temporary problem arising from the fact that 80 per cent, of theArmy&apos;s fighting units were serving overseas. The Army now con-tained a higher proportion of married men than it did before thewar; and of the married men now serving overseas 66 per cent, wereseparated from their wives. Though marriage allowances were nowpaid to all married men above the age of 21, there had been no increase in the proportion of married men in a unit who were entitledto take their dependants with them overseas. Moreover, in many ofthe overseas stations where the Army was serving there were nomarried quarters. Units were moved frequently, and there were fivebattalions which had not spent more than two months in this countrysince the end of the war. In these circumstances men who wereseparated from their families for long periods were inevitably pressed by their wives to leave the Army so that the. family could be re-united.To alleviate these conditions he had for some time been urging anumber of minor concessions on such matters as home leave,travelling expenses of dependants, disturbance allowances andremoval expenses. These would not be costly, and he was confident that they would do much to arrest the present drain of experiencedmen from the Army. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggestedthat acceptance of any pay increases should be conditional upon thewithdrawal of this claim for further concessions on overseas allow-ances. He hoped that this point would not be pressed; for theconditions of Army service at the present time were so exceptionalthat.some further concessions must be made to married men whowere serving overseas and separated from their families.In discussion it was generally recognised that there were specialgrounds for making these concessions to married men serving in theArmy overseas. There might be less justification for extending themto the Navy and Air Force. The Secretary of State for War saidthat, for his part, if the Cabinet approved these concessions inprinciple, he would be prepared to find half of the cost in 1954 withinthe total of his approved Estimates.
ColouredWorkers.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 106thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 34) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 37)on the possibility of restricting the number of coloured people seekingemployment in this country and on the particular question of their employment in the public service.The Home Secretary said that this problem should be considered in its true perspective. The total number of coloured people atpresent in this country was about 40,000, compared with 7,000 beforethe last war, and about 3,000 were entering the country each year.In June 1953 the number of coloured people registered as unem-ployed was 3,366 and 1,870 were in receipt of national assistance.Of 62 persons convicted in the Metropolitan Police District in the twelve months ending 31st August, 1953, of living on women&apos;simmoral earnings 24 had been coloured men. No further action toprevent the immigration of coloured people could be taken without legislation, which might take one of two forms. One possible course was to extend immigration control to all British subjects from over-seas. Such an extension could not be confined to coloured peopleonly. It would involve additions to the staff of the Home Office andthe Ministry of Labour. The alternative course would be to take power to deport British subjects from overseas who were convicted of a serious criminal offence or found to be a charge on public funds.He recognised that a case could be made for measures to.excludeor remove from this country the riffraff amongst British subjects from overseas, and the fact must be faced that at any time the occurrence of some shocking crime involving a coloured person might give riseto strong public feeling on the matter.  There was already evidenceThe general conclusion of the Cabinet was that the conces-sions claimed in C. (54) 35 should be considered sympatheticallyon account of the special conditions of Army service at thepresent time, on the understanding that half of their cost in 1954would be found within the total of the approved Army Estimates.The Cabinet (1) Accepted the need for a scheme of improvements in service pay designed to maintain the element of experience andtechnical skill in the regular cadres of the Services, withina total annual cost of  18 millions, of which  10^ millions would be found in 1954 within the approved total of theDefence Estimates.(2) Agreed in principle that further concessions should be made,on the lines indicated in C. (54) 35, to married men serving in the Army overseas, on the understanding that half ofthe cost in 1954 would be met from within the approvedArmy Estimates; and agreed that, if a case should bemade for extending similar concessions to married menin the Navy or Air Force, half of the cost in 1954 should similarly be borne within the approved Estimates for theNavy and Air Force.(3) Appointed a Cabinet Committee consisting of Lord President (in the Chair),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Minister of Defence,First Lord of the Admiralty,Secretary of State for War,Secretary of State for Air,to work out the details of a scheme, within the limits of conclusions (1) and (2) above, and to report their recom-mendations to the Cabinet in a week&apos;s time.
mOverseas 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in C. (53) 315Information     the Overseas Ministers had proposed to the Cabinet, on the basisServices.. .     of the Report of the Drogheda Committee, that Departmental Esti-(Previous        mates for 1954 should provide for a net increase of  630,000 in reference:      expenditure on overseas information services and also allow  366,000C.C. (53) 8.1st   in respect of rising costs.  Subsequently, the Home Secretary&apos;s Com-Conclusions,    mittee had recommended in C. (53) 359 that these estimates should minute 2.)      provide for no net increase of expenditure as compared with 1953but that, as a corollary, economies recommended by the drogheda committee and estimated to cost eventually  250,000 in a full year should not be enforced.  Since the Cabinet had deferred a decisionon this recommendation on 29th December there had been furtherof some racial feeling in those districts, for example in London,Liverpool and Manchester, where there were concentrations of coloured people. On balance, however, he did not believe that theproblem had yet assumed sufficient proportions to justify legislation which would involve a reversal of our traditional practice and wouldantagonise liberal opinion. It had to be recognised that any actionwhich the Government might take could be easily misrepresented asintroducing a &quot; colour bar.&quot;The Commonwealth Secretary said that in all other Common-wealth countries except India and Pakistan there were legislativerestrictions upon the immigration of British subjects. Power to deport undesirable British subjects was available in all thosecountries. He thought it unlikely that opinion in other parts of theCommonwealth would be disturbed if powers were taken to deportfrom this country British subjects from overseas.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that in all theColonies there was power to restrict entry, and to deport, Britishsubjects from other parts of the Commonwealth. While the ColonialOffice would be bound to raise strong objection to the imposition inthis country of any restrictions based upon colour grounds alone, theassumption by the United Kingdom Government of power to deporton clearly defined grounds might well be found to be practicable.The Prime Minister said that the rapid improvement of com-munications was likely to lead to a continuing increase in the numberof coloured people coming to this country, and their presence herewould sooner or later come to be resented by large sections of theBritish people. It might well be true, however, that the problem hadnot yet assumed sufficient proportions to enable the Government totake adequate counter-measures.Some support was expressed for the view that the traditionalpractice in this matter might need modification in the light of changing conditions. Apart from the improvement of means oftravel, the raising of standards in the Colonies made their inhabitantsbetter adapted to European conditions and they were attracted to thiscountry by the high level of its Social services. There were, more-over, sound arguments for the view that it was no longer incumbenton the United Kingdom to follow a policy more liberal than thatin force in other Commonwealth countries and there might, there-fore, be a case for assuming a power to deport from this countryBritish subjects from overseas.The Cabinet-Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the colonial secretary to submit a memorandum summarising thepresent powers of other Commonwealth and colonial governments to deport British subjects.

(54) 5thConclusions,Minute 8.)ElectricalContractingIndustry.discussion between Ministers and he now proposed the followingcompromise:  (i) That the Drogheda economies should be enforced to theextent of  171,000 in 1954.(ii) That an additional sum of  150,000, to be allocated byagreement between the overseas Departments and theiragencies, should be allowed in respect of rising costs.This, together with the proposal in (i) above, would givethe overseas Departments  321,000 against the  366,000estimated to be required to meet rising costs.(iii) That an additional sum of  82,000 should be provided inrespect of new services as follows:  A settlement on these lines would mean an increase of  232,000 inthe total sum to be provided in Estimates for 1954, which he regardedas not ungenerous. If his colleagues agreed, he would ask theFinancial Secretary, Treasury, to discuss this proposed settlementforthwith with representatives of all the Departments concerned.The Cabinet Approved in principle the settlement suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer and invited him to arrange forthe Financial Secretary, Treasury, to discuss the details withrepresentatives of the Foreign Secretary, commonwealth secretary, Colonial Secretary and President of the Boardof Trade.6. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thatthe rank and file in the electrical contracting industry were beginning to show stronger resistance to the orders to strike which they were receiving from the Electrical Trades Union. This was satisfactory,but the strikes seemed likely to continue until their effect on theUnion&apos;s finances began to become more significant.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour.(i) Foreign Office   ...(ii) Colonial Office.........(iii) Commonwealth Relations Office 40,00035,0007,000Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd February, 1954.
