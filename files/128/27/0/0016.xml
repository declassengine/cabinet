14*Sudan.(previous reference:CC. (54) .15thConclusions.)The Cabinet reviewed the developments which had taken place inKhartoum since their discussion on 4th March.On 6th March the Governor-General had made strong represen-tations to the Sudan Council of Ministers about their attitude towards their officials. He had also spoken, as instructed, to the SudanesePrime Minister on the importance of maintaining a proper balanceof representation on the Governor-GeneraFs Commission and on theneed to check further Egyptian interference in Sudanese affairs.From these conversations it had emerged that the Sudan Governmenthad been intending to remove Ibrahim Ahmed from the Commission.It had now been made clear to them that a serious view would betaken of any action upsetting the balance between the Sudanesemembers of the Commission. The Leader of the Opposition in theSudan Parliament had also been warned of what was afoot; and thePakistani Chairman of the Commission had been encouraged by hisGovernment to use his influence to preserve the balance of represen-tation on the Commission. This matter would not, however, come up in the Sudan Parliament until 15th March.On the question of reinforcing the British troops in Khartoum,various exchanges had taken place since the Cabinet &apos;s meeting on 4th March. The Governor-General and the Minister of Stateconsidered that reinforcements would be required if a constitutionalemergency were declared, particularly if it arose from disturbancesprovoked by a further visit by General Neguib. They did not,however, think it would be wise to send in any reinforcements beforethe declaration of a constitutional emergency: indeed, they thoughtthat the premature arrival of reinforcements might precipitate dis-order. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had passed through Khartoum on 7th March, had made various suggestions for ensuring that the reinforcements could arrive more quickly inKhartoum if they were needed. Effect had already been given tosome of these suggestions.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Eight transport aircraft (Hastings) had been sent out fromthis country to the Canal Zone in readiness to carry the reinforce-ments to Khartoum. These were capable of flying direct from the canal Zone to Khartoum without stopping at Wadi Haifa.(b) If the existing British battalion in the Sudan was not to be reinforced in advance of the declaration of a constitutional emergency,it was desirable that it should be concentrated as much as practicable in Khartoum.The Secretary of State for War undertook to ascertain, and reportto the Prime Minister, the detailed disposition of the British troops now in the Sudan.(c) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had suggested that naval forces might be sent to Port Sudan, so that they could dealwith any possible disorders there, thus leaving the ground forces free of this commitment. In pursuance of this suggestion a frigate with one troop of Royal Marine Commandos had sailed from Suez andwas due to arrive at Port Sudan on 10th March. The frigate hadnot yet been ordered to disembark the landing party on arrival.-It was the view of the Cabinet that, unless the situation deteriorated, it would be preferable that the frigate should not putin to Port Sudan but should remain within call.(d) It now seemed unlikely that General Neguib would returnto Khartoum for the opening of the Sudan Parliament on 10th March.The situation might therefore remain relatively; calm until 15th March,when it would be known whether the Government intended toproceed with their proposal for removing Ibrahim Ahmed from theGovernor-GeneraFs Commission.(e) The Minister of State would be returning to London on 9th March.
The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the action taken by the Governor-General inpursuance of the instructions sent to him by the foreign secretary after the Cabinefs meeting on 4th March.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Air to bring sixHastings aircraft to a state of readiness to move atthirty-six hours&apos; notice from this country to the canal zone.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to give instructions that the frigate which had sailed for Port Sudan shouldnot put in there without further orders, but should remainin the vicinity.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th March, 1954.
