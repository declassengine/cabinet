/ / oHouse ofCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 87thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet considered the situation created by the decision taken by Mr. Justice Roxburgh, in proceedings in the High court for a declaration that the report of the Boundary Commission for england did not comply with the terms of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, to grant an interim injunctionagainst the Home Secretary restraining him from submitting to her majesty in Council the Draft Parliamentary Constituencies(Manchester, Oldham and Ashton-under-Lyne) Order, 1954. TheCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal(C. (54) 399) containing the draft of a statement to be made on thismatter in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Lord Chancellor said that an appeal against this injunctionhad at once been made on behalf of the Crown and was at that moment being heard by the Court of Appeal. The Attorney-General,who was conducting the appeal, would seek to establish that therewas no evidence that the Boundary Commission had acted wronglyand that, even if they had done so, Mr. Justice Roxburgh had notbeen justified in granting an injunction. He would ask that theinjunction should at once be discharged. Pending the decision ofthe Court of Appeal the Government ought not to continue with parliamentary proceedings on the remaining Draft ConstituenciesOrders. If, however, the injunction were discharged and, evenmore, if the Court of Appeal declined to give the plaintiffs leave to appeal to the House of Lords the Government would be well-advised to proceed with the outstanding Orders without further delay. If the plaintiffs submitted a petition to the House of Lordsfor leave to appeal, the ultimate determination of the case wouldbe likely to be deferred for some considerable time.The Cabinet recognised that Mr. Justice Roxburgh&apos;s action in granting an interim injunction threatened to raise issues of the gravest constitutional importance. If his decision were upheld bythe Court of Appeal, a serious situation would arise. Recourse tothe House of Lords as the ultimate appeal tribunal would be complicated by the fact that in their legislative capacity the Lordshad already approved all the Draft Orders. It was, however, thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the Government should not take up a position publicly on the wider constitutional issues before the judgment of the Court of Appeal had been given. The Cabinet also agreed that the submission to The Queen in Council of those DraftOrders which had already been approved by Parliament should be deferred until that judgment had been given.The Cabinet considered whether the statement to be made inthe House of Commons that afternoon should contain any specific reference to the Government^ view of the constitutional rights ofParliament. After discussion it was agreed that it would be sufficientat this stage if it were clearly stated that it must not be assumed thatthe Government accepted the view that this was a justiciable matterand not one for Parliament itself to decide. But no words shouldbe used which implied in any way that the matter could rightly beheld to be sub judice.In discussion of the business to be taken that day in the Houseof Commons in place of the remaining Draft Orders, it was agreedthat a start should be made with consideration of the Draft national assistance (Determination of Need) Regulations which, it was hoped,could be completed by about 7 o&apos;clock on the following day. Itwould be for consideration, in the light of the progress made inthe Court of Appeal, whether or not proceedings should thereafter be resumed on the remaining Draft Parliamentary ConstituenciesOrders.The Cabinet-Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon in the following terms:-&quot;The grant of an interim injunction by a judge of the High Court in the matter of the vires of the
report issued by the Boundary Commission for Englandraises issues of constitutional importance and it mustnot be assumed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government acceptthe view that this is a justiciable matter and not a matter for Parliament itself. Nevertheless, so far as to-day&apos;business is concerned, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusion that it would be preferable not toproceed to-day with the consideration of the remainingdraft Orders. It is therefore proposed, in agreement withthe Opposition, to begin this afternoon the debate on theNational Assistance Draft Regulations which will be concluded at about 7 o&apos;clock to-morrow.&quot;Cyprus. 2.   The Colonial Secretary made a brief report to the Cabinet(Previous on the disturbances which had broken out in Cyprus following the reference: decision of the United Nations Assembly that they should not force.C. (54) 70th the time being discuss the substance of the Greek resolution on conclusions, Cyprus. These disturbances had been organised mainly by minute 4.)       schoolchildren and students. The Governor had reported that public order in the island had now been restored and that the situation was in hand.In the House of Commons that afternoon statements would bemade on behalf of the Government, both on the proceedings in theUnited Nations Assembly and on the local situation in Cyprus. Itwas possible that these statements might give rise to a debate on the adjournment.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th December, 1954.
