This might change the mood of the strikers and would give theMinister of Labour an opportunity to bring together the three partiesto the dispute.Essential supplies of food and fuel were being well maintained,and it was unlikely that there would be any need to use military labour in the docks for this purpose before the end of the week.The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies, which was reviewing theposition from day to day, recommended that no steps should be takento use military labour in the docks, at any rate until the Minister ofLabour had been able to judge what effect was produced by the interim report of the Court of Enquiry.The Cabinet Took note of the position, and endorsed the recommenda-tion of the Emergencies Committee that military labour should not be used in the docks until the Minister of labour had been able to judge the effect produced by the interimreport of the Court of Enquiry.Canada. 3.

Meanwhile, thereshould be no occasion for any change in Pakistani status within theCommonwealth.
Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (54) 69thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (54) 320) outlining the statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons on 28th Octoberregarding the amendment of the law in Cyprus relating to thepublication of seditious material in the Press.The Cabinet welcomed the proposed statement and the colonial secretary&apos;s intention to add to it a passage reaffirming the government&apos;s policy on the question of sovereignty over Cyprus.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that theGovernor of Cyprus had decided not to.proceed with the broadcastin which he had proposed to counter some of the statements madein a recent broadcast by the Archbishop of Cyprus. They were also informed that all Colonial Governors had now been asked to consult the Colonial Office before accepting invitations from the british broadcasting Corporation to broadcast while on leave in the UnitedKingdom.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statement on Cyprus whichthe Colonial Secretary was proposing to make in the Houseof Commons on 28th October, as outlined in C. (54) 320.uganda protectorate.(previous reference:CC. (54) 69thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Colonial Secretary said that he had now heard that theChief Justice of Uganda was unlikely to deliver for another week hisverdict in the action challenging the grounds on which the UnitedKingdom Government had withdrawn their recognition of the kabaka. Meanwhile he had authorised the Governor of Uganda toreturn to London for consultation. It would be convenient that heshould be here when the Courfs judgment was given.The Colonial Secretary also drew attention to a report, published in the Sunday Express on 24th October, which suggested to him thatthere might have been some unauthorised disclosure of information regarding the current review of this question.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to enquire whether there had been any unauthorised disclosure of information on this subject to the Press.United Statesand CanadianLoans.(previous reference:CC. (53) 72ndConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 318) regarding the payment of interest onthe United States and Canadian Loans.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was evident, fromthe conversations which he had held with the Secretary of the UnitedStates Treasury, that there was no early prospect of securing the revision of that part of the United States / United Kingdom LoanAgreement which prescribed the circumstances in which we mightapply for waiver of interest. He was satisfied that the United StatesGovernment would not at present be able to overcome the political difficulties which stood in the way of any revision of this part of theAgreement. He would not, however, allow this question to be overlooked and would take it up again with the United states administration at a later stage.
European coal and steel community.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (54) 323) setting outthe terms of the agreement under which it was proposed that theUnited Kingdom should enter into closer association with theEuropean Coal and Steel Community.The Minister of Housing said that the draft agreement annexed to his memorandum differed only in minor respects from theproposals on which the Cabinet had authorised him to negotiate.The arrangements now proposed were acceptable to the UnitedKingdom Ministers concerned. The British coal and steel industries had been fully consulted on them. He had no hesitation in asking the Cabinet to endorse the terms of the agreement. There was,however, a troublesome point about the grant of diplomaticimmunity to representatives of the Community in the UnitedKingdom. Though no provision was to be made for this in theagreement itself, it was to be foreshadowed in the joint communiqueannouncing the conclusion of the agreement. He had done his utmost to dissuade M. Monnet from insisting on this, as it wouldrequire the passage of an enabling Act by the United kingdom parliament. If the Cabinet so desired, he would be ready to makea further effort to induce M. Monnet to agree that arrangements forthe grant of these diplomatic immunities in the United kingdom should be deferred until the seat of the High Authority had beentransferred from Luxembourg to the Saar. But his colleagues might feel that it would be even more difficult to induce Parliament toaccept this concession if it were presented separately from theagreement for closer association with the High Authority. The factthat our Delegation to the Authority in Luxembourg had enjoyeddiplomatic privileges for the past two years should make it easier tojustify the grant of reciprocal privileges to representatives of the high authority in London.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that it would bedifficult for us to decline to accord diplomatic immunities to representatives of the High Authority in this country in view of the privileges which had been accorded to our own Delegation in luxembourg.In discussion general concern was expressed about the progressive extension of diplomatic immunities. It was recognised,however, that a special case could be made for the grant of suchimmunities to the representatives of the High Authority in thiscountry, in return for the facilities which had already been grantedto members of the United Kingdom Delegation to the High authority in Luxembourg. It was also agreed that, if this proposal had tobe put to Parliament, it might be easier to put it in the context ofMeanwhile, we had no option but to pay the interest whichwould fall due in December on, the United States Loan and on theCanadian Line-of-Credit. He sought the Cabinefs authority to make these payments in the normal way in December.The Cabinet (1) Took note that no progress could be made for the time beingtowards the revision of those provisions of the UnitedStates /United Kingdom Loan Agreement (Command6708) which defined the circumstances in which applica-tion could be made for waiver of the payment of interest.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe payment in due course of the interest due in Decemberon the United States Loan and the Canadian Line-of-Credit.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th October, 1954.the new agreement for closer association of the United kingdom with the High Authority. But, before we were finally committed toit, the Minister of Housing might make a further attempt to induceM. Monnet to refrain from pressing the point at this time.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Housing to conclude anAgreement for the closer association of the UnitedKingdom with the High Authority of the European coal and Steel Community in the terms annexed to C. (54) 323.(2) Agreed that legislation should be introduced to conferdiplomatic immunities on the representatives of the high authority in this country, unless such a step proved to be unnecessary in the light of the further discussions on thispoint which the Minister of Housing proposed to holdwith M. Monnet.
