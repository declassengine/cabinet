IS?175CC. 23 (54)Atomic Energy. 1. On 29th March the Prime Minister had discussed with someHydrogen of his Ministerial colleagues the terms of a statement which he wasBomb. proposing to make in the House of Commons in reply to a number(Previous        of Questions about the series of test explosions of hydrogen bombsReference:      which the United States authorities were conducting in the Pacific.CC. (54) 2.1st    These Questions, which had been tabled by members of the LabourConclusions,     Opposition, implied that it was the duty of the Government to useMinute 4.)       their influence to persuade the United States authorities either toabandon this series of tests or at least to bring it under some form ofinternational control.   In his statement on 30th March the PrimeMinister had made it clear that the Government were not preparedto make any such representations to the United States government or to take any other action which might impede American progressin building up their overwhelming strength in nuclear weapons, which provided the greatest possible deterrent against the outbreak of a third world war.The Prime Minister said that it was now clear that, in view ofthe public anxiety which these experiments had aroused, the Houseof Commons should be given an early opportunity for a full debate on this question.  The Cabinet endorsed this view.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chief Whip to seek the agreement of the Opposi-tion that a debate should be held on 5th April on thequestions arising from the current series of nuclearexplosions in the Pacific.(2) Agreed that the Prime Minister and the Foreign secretary should speak on the Government^ behalf in this debate.The Cabinet also considered what answer should be returnedto a Question by Mr. Hamilton, M.P., for answer that day by the under-Secretary of State for Air, asking how many R.A.F. aircraft had made flights in the vicinity of the recent test explosion in the pacific and whether they had suffered any damage.The Cabinet were informed that, by arrangement with the UnitedStates authorities, R.A.F. aircraft were operating in the area for thepurpose of collecting scientific data on the effects of the testexplosions; and that one such aircraft had made successful flightsfor this purpose, without damage, after each of the explosions on1st and 26th March. Two other aircraft which had been assigned to this duty had been lost in transit between Australia and the base in the Pacific from which the experimental flight was tohave been made. One was believed to have fallen into the sea,and its crew had been posted missing: the second had made a forcedlanding on an island, without injury to the crew. It had been intended that these operations should remain secret; but president eisenhower had now agreed that the Prime Minister might disclosesome limited information about them if he thought this essential forthe purpose of satisfying opinion in Parliament.Alternative draft answers to the Question were considered by theCabinet. The first was to the effect that it would not be in the publicinterest to disclose in detail all the measures taken by British and american authorities to gain scientific information about the effects of nuclear explosions, wherever they occurred; but it would be addedthat no British Service personnel had suffered any radio-active effectsas a result of the explosions in the Pacific on 1st and 26th March. Thesecond draft stated that, in return for similar facilities granted to the americans on the occasion of our nuclear test in Australia, we hadbeen given certain limited facilities for collecting scientific databearing on the effects of the current series of nuclear experiments inthe Pacific; that for this purpose an aircraft of the Royal Air force had made a flight in the vicinity of the explosion of 1st March, somehours after it occurred, and that a similar flight had also been made on26th March; and that no injury or damage had been suffered by this
DParliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Budget debate would occupy the House on 6th to 8th april and would be concluded on 12th April. The Chancellor of theExchequer would open on 6th April, and would make the concludingspeech on 12th April. It was agreed that the Economic Secretary,Treasury, should speak on 8th April. The question whether thereshould be a second Government spokesman on the final day could bedecided later when it was known what course the debate was taking.On 8th April there would be a short discussion on a motion com-memorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Entente Cordiale. this had the support of all political parties, and was to be moved byMr. Edelman, M.P., in his capacity as chairman of the Franco-BritishParliamentary Committee. The Cabinet considered whether it wouldhave been more appropriate for this motion to be brought forward bythe leaders of the political parties; but they agreed that it would be preferable not to interfere with the arrangements which had now been settled through the usual channels. They invited the Foreign Secre-tary to speak briefly in support of the motion after it had been intro-duced by back benchers of all parties.Parliament 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had prepared aExpenses of     draft of a Government statement on the Report of the Select Corn-Members,       mittee on Members&apos; Expenses.   This rejected all proposals for(Previous        increases in Members&apos; salaries, indicated what the Government would reference:      be prepared to concede by way of subsistence allowances and furtherCC.

He would be willing, if his colleaguesso desired, to circulate as a basis for further discussion by the Cabinetthe draft statement which he had prepared and a paper outlining apossible scheme for giving Members subsistence allowances andfurther assistance in kind.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate thepaper which he had prepared on the expenses of Members,and agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting in the following week.aircraft or its crew-on either occasion. The answer would go on to disclose that two other aircraft assigned to this duty had been lost in transit between Australia and the base in the Pacific from which the experimental flight was to have been made.The Prime Minister said that he greatly preferred the second ofthe alternative drafts. He thought it would be unwise to withholdfrom the House information about the loss of two of the aircraftassigned to this duty. The Cabinet accepted the Prime Minister^view.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the information contained in the longer of thetwo draft answers to this Question should be given to theHouse by the Under-Secretary of State for Air, if theQuestion was reached that afternoon; or, if it was not reached and was subsequently withdrawn, by the PrimeMinister in the course of his speech in the forthcoming debate on 5th April.
Jordan.(previous reference:GC (54) 22ndConclusions.Minute 2.)Meeting of theAnglo/JordanJoint defence board.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chiefsof Staff (D. (54) 17) outlining a military plan for assisting Jordan in theevent of major aggression by Israel.The Minister of Defence said that at the meeting of the Anglo-Jordan Joint Defence Board in September, 1953, our representatives had been pressed to say what action we should take to honour our obligations under the Treaty in the event of a major attack on Jordanby Israel. The Board was due to meet again on 5th April and, if we failed to give any indication of our intentions, the Jordanians wouldsuspect that we were not going to honour our obligations. TheChiefs of Staff had therefore prepared a plan for military action,which involved the invasion of Israel by British forces from the south.Was it politically acceptable that a plan of this kind should be disclosed at the meeting of the Board? Quite apart from that question he himself thought it would be wise that the armouredsquadron now at Ma&apos;an should be sent to Mafraq to train with theArab Legion. That would be at once an assurance to Jordan and a warning to Israel that if an act of aggression were committed british forces would be involved.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that thememorandum before the Cabinet had been prepared in the absenceof the Chiefs of Staff themselves, who did not wish to support therecommendation that this particular plan should be disclosed at themeeting of the Anglo-Jordan Joint Defence Board. The plan itself was militarily sound, and it would be difficult to give effective support to Jordan if we were limited to helping the Jordanian forces to defendtheir own territory because it would take too long to move anysubstantial numbers of British forces into Jordan. The Chiefs ofStaff had in any event hoped to build up the armoured squadronat Ma&apos;an to the strength of an armoured regiment and to move itto Mafraq, but that could not be done in the immediate future.Our intentions in this respect might, however, be disclosed at themeeting of the Anglo-Jordan Joint Defence Board on 5th April, andthis might be sufficient to convince the Jordanians that we had plans for carrying out our obligations under the Treaty.The Prime Minister said that he was much relieved to hearthat the Chiefs of Staff were not in favour of disclosing to theJordanians a plan involving British invasion of Israel. Leakage ofsuch a plan would have very grave consequences. Would it not bepossible either to defer the meeting arranged for 5th April or, if itmust be held, to avoid any disclosure of military plans?The Foreign Secretary said that it was laid down in our treaty with Jordan that when a threat of aggression existed immediateconsultation would take place between the two Powers. On theother hand it was also laid down in the Treaty that it was their first duty to try to resolve problems by peaceful means. It could notbe denied that a threat now existed and it would be valuable ifthe Prime Minister would send a message to the Prime Minister of israel reminding him of our obligations under our Treaty with jordan and urging him to avoid any provocative action.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to consider further the suggestion made by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff thatthe disclosure of plans at the meeting of the Anglo-Jordan joint defence Board on 5th April should be confined to our intentionsto increase the armoured squadron to a regiment and to move itto Mafraq. He thought that something on these lines might meetthe iimnecli&amp;te necessity for 2ivm2 soine remiss tir&amp;iice to JordanThe Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the substance of the plan outlined in D. (54) 17should not be divulged to Jordan at the meeting of theAnglo-Jordan Joint Defence Board on 5th April.
Malaya. 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary (C. (54) 117) recalling the conclusions reached by the reference:      Committee which the Cabinet had appointed on 19th February,CC. (53) 13th   1953, to consider what action might have to be taken for the defenceConclusions,    of Malaya if a Communist regime were established in Siam, and minute 2.)       recommending that these conclusions should now be communicatedto the United States Government as part of the representations to bemade to them to induce them to join in concerted efforts to checkCommunist encroachments in Siam.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out by the Foreign secretary in C. (54) 117 and authorised him, in particular, to discloseto the United States Government the views of the Chiefsof Staff on the military action that would be needed tosafeguard Malaya if a Communist regime were established in Siam.Coal Prices.(previous reference:CC. (53) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (C. (54) 116) recommending that theNational Coal Board should be authorised to make certain changesin coal prices with effect from 3rd May.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it was estimated thatthe Coal Board, which had started 1954 with an accumulated deficit of  13 millions, would incur an additional deficit of  17 millions inthe current year. The estimated yield from increased productivityhad already been earmarked to meet the cost of a wage award to theday-wage men, and it was, therefore, necessary to look to increased prices to offset other factors responsible for the deficit, which included the following:  (i) Higher charges for interest and depreciation in respect ofincreasing capital investment  5 millions. While it was satisfactory that the annual rate of investment had risen from  29 millions to  65 millions since the present government took office, the increased charges which resulted had to be borne for a number of years before the investment yielded a return.(ii) Reduction in profits from exports  4 millions.(iii) Cost of increases in piece-work wages  5 millions.All concerned were agreed that, instead of a flat-rate price increase,which on this occasion would have to be at a rate of 4-8 per cent.,there should be differential price increases designed to influencedemand, to encourage fuel economy and to take account of the high cost of production of certain coals. Under the Board&apos;s proposals the cheaper forms of household coal would actually be reduced in price.Furthermore, he recommended that the proposed price changes should come into effect on 3rd May, the date on which the price of house coal was due to be reduced by \0s. per ton under the summerprices scheme. In consequence, the prices of the five lower grades of household coal would be reduced on that day by sums ranging from(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the instructions tobe given to our representatives on the Anglo-Jordan joint defence Board in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would submit to thePrime Minister the terms of a message which he mightsend to the Prime Minister of Israel.
Is. to 16s. a ton, while only the two highest grades (which represented a small percentage of total consumption) would become more expensive.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had reluctantly agreed that coal prices must be increased in spite of the serious additional burden which the Board&apos;s proposals would impose, particularly on the trawling industry and the railways.They had further agreed that, if coal prices had to be increased, therewere great advantages in increasing the price differentials as theMinister proposed.The following were the main points covered in the cabinets discussion:  (a) Had the case for making price increases at this juncture beenfully established?The view was expressed that, if prices were automatically raised to offset prospective deficits resulting from wage awards or from increased railway freight charges (which in turn resulted fromincreases in railwaymen&apos;s wages), the miners would be encouraged to look for continuing wage increases. Would it not strengthen thehands of the Coal Board in resisting fresh claims if they were able topoint to a mounting deficit on their operations?The view was expressed, on the other hand, that it was difficult to assess the probable psychological effect of such a factor. There were,moreover, strong arguments in favour of not deferring the price increases which were considered to be necessary. It was the statutoryduty of the Board to make ends meet taking one year with another and, in view of the Board&apos;s accumulated deficit of  13 millions, theGovernment would be open to serious criticism if they prevented theBoard from taking the action which they considered necessary toprevent the deficit from mounting to  30 millions by the end of 1954.An increasing deficit would tend to undermine confidence in theGovernments competence in economic and financial matters. Therewas also reason to believe that, if prices were not increased, certain members of the Coal Board might resign and there might be seriousagitation in some coal fields where the miners already felt that theGovernment were, for political reasons, refraining from charging the steel companies an economic price for high-grade coking coal. Therewas, moreover, the further consideration that a moderate increase in coal prices now might have less embarrassing consequences for theGovernment than the more substantial increases which would other-wise become inevitable later.(b) Would not the proposed price increases be better deferred atleast for a month or two?It was suggested that, instead of both raising prices and at thesame time making the seasonal reductions in the price of householdcoal on 3rd May, it would be preferable to defer both the price increase and the seasonal reductions, if, indeed, the latter should not now be abandoned altogether.It was explained that the system under which the prices of house-hold coals varied between winter and the summer was a self-balancingone, related to a notional average price, and that it continued to serve a valuable purpose. It had long been customary to bring summerprices into operation at the beginning of May and any departure from past practice in this respect would excite comment. If summerreductions in household coal prices were to take place on 3rd May,the proposed price increases must either be introduced at the sametime or deferred for a substantial period; for household coal prices could not be reduced on 3rd May and then altered again on 1st Juneor 1st July. Adoption of the date 3rd May for the proposed price increase would also mean, first, that for all household coals other thanthe two top grades any increase of price would be cloaked by the summer reduction and, secondly, that the accumulating deficit of theCoal Board would be kept to a minimum.
(c) The view was expressed that it would be difficult to avoidcontinuing increases in the price of coal until the country became lessdependent on coal as a source of heat and power through theincreased use of oil and other substitutes. Consideration should begiven to possible means of bringing it home to the miners that, bycontinually forcing up the price of coal, they were providing industryand householders with a sharper incentive to adopt substitutes for coal and thereby increasing the prospects of eventual unemploymentin the coal fields.(d) Emphasis was laid on the gravity of the consequences whichthe introduction of differential price increases of the kind proposedin C. (54) 116 would have for the trawling industry. It might, inparticular, lead to the abandonment of trawling from such ports asSwansea.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister.of Fuel and Power should authorisethe National Coal Board to bring into operation on 3rd may the differential increases in the price of coal outlined inAppendix B to C. (54) 116.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st March, 1954.
