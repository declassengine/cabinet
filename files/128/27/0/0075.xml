Pensions for 2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumOld Age and by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (54); 337) on war Disability, the time-table for carrying through the proposed improvement in the(Previous        rates of old-age and disability pensions.Reference: The Cabinefs discussion again centred on the question whetherCC. (54) 74th   the new rates could be brought into operation earlier than was conclusions,     proposed in C. (54) 337.   This turned mainly on the time neededMinute 8.)       to complete the administrative arrangements for (i) collectingincreased contributions and (ii) making the increased payments.Under the first head it was necessary to print a large number ofspecial stamps of different values.   Under the second, it wasnecessary to print new pension books, to calculate the new amount ofpension payable to each pensioner and to issue the new books to the pensioners in person at the local offices of the Ministry of Pensionsand National Insurance.   In order to emphasise the insurance; principle on which the National Insurance Scheme was based, it had originally been assumed that the increased benefits should not bebrought into operation before the corresponding increase in contributions became effective. The Chancellor of the exchequer had, however, recognised the political need to expedite the paymentof increased rates of old-age pension, and he had now agreed thatthese new rates should come into operation at the end of April eventhough the collection of the increased contributions could not beginbefore June. Thus, the factor limiting any further acceleration ofthe time-table was, not the printing of the contribution stamps, butthe exchange of the pension books. The Minister of Pensions was satisfied that this exchange could not be completed before the lastweek in April. A total of about 5 million books had to be exchanged,and there would be a serious risk of an administrative breakdownif his Department attempted to undertake this considerable operation in the winter months when its offices were handling a heavy burdenof current work on claims for sickness benefit. He was satisfied,in the light of past experience, that the Government would be runninga very serious risk if they attempted to bring this part of the scheme into operation before the last week of April.Wireless 1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-Licences. General (subsequently circulated as C. (54) 339) seeking approval ofthe terms of a statement to be made in Parliament about charges forwireless licences.The Cabinet were informed that, as a result of an action brought by Davey Paxman and Co. Ltd. against the Postmaster-General,which was due to be heard on 15th November, it had been discoveredthat there had been no sound basis in law for the charges made underthe Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904, for certain classes of licence,including broadcast receiving licences. The only ground on whichDavey Paxman&apos;s claim could be contested was that the charges hadbeen levied under a mistake of law, but it was agreed that thePostmaster-General would be ill-advised to use this line of defence.It was therefore proposed that all charges made under the 1904 Actshould now be validated by retrospective legislation, and that anannouncement of the Governmenfs intentions should be made beforeDavey Paxman&apos;s case was heard. For the future the matter hadbeen put beyond doubt by the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1949.The Lord President said that this problem had been fully considered by the Home Affairs Committee, which had concluded that the introduction of validating legislation was the proper course to adopt.The Cabinet Approved the draft statement annexed to C. (54) 339 and agreedthat it should be made on behalf of the Government in bothHouses of Parliament that afternoon.
In further discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance had recently discussed with the Social Services group of government supporters in the House of Commons the difficulties in the way ofany emergency scheme designed to give early benefit to old-age pensioners. As a result of the Ministers explanations, the membersof this group were now satisfied that there was no case for any specialChristmas payment to pensioners, and that recourse to an emergencyscheme would prejudice the insurance principle and lead to administrative confusion. The demand which they were nowdisposed to press was that the legislation required for a permanent scheme should be passed through all its stages before Parliamentdispersed for the Christmas recess.The Cabinet agreed that there would be great political advantage in getting this legislation on the statute book before Christmas.Members could then feel that they had done all in their power to expedite the payment of the increased benefits.(b) Final orders for the printing of contribution stamps and pension books could not be placed until Parliament had finally settledthe precise amounts of the new contributions and benefits. Thiswould be a strong argument to use in urging Parliament to pass theBill through all its stages before Christmas so that the necessary administrative preparations could go forward. If, however, thepassage of the Bill were delayed, some preliminary preparations couldbe put in hand in anticipation of Parliamentary approval.(c) There was no evidence of any widespread hardship amongold-age pensioners. Enquiries made by the Minister of Foodshowed that old-age pensioners generally were spending more money on food, and that their increased expenditure was not due wholly to increases in food prices. In terms of averages, old-age pensionerswere consuming more milk, butter and tea, but less meat and eggs,than the rest of the community. It was significant that their consumption of butter was greater, and their consumption of margarine less, than the national average.(d) The poorest of the old-age pensioners would not benefit from the proposed scheme except to the extent that the rates ofnational assistance were raised. It was important that these rates should be increased at the earliest possible moment. It was whollywithin the responsibility of the National Assistance Board to decide whether these rates should be raised, and the decision must be left totheir discretion. Once their decision was taken, however, it wouldbe open to the Minister of Pensions to urge them to lose no time in bringing the new rates into operation. There was reason to hope that payment of increased rates of assistance might begin before the endof January.(e) The proposed improvements in benefits under the national insurance Scheme could be justified by reference to the Report of theGovernment Actuary&apos;s quinquennial review of the working of theScheme. This Report would be published before the governments plans were announced.In earlier discussions of this question Government spokesmenhad also argued that alterations in pension rates should await theReport of the Phillips Committee. Presentation of this latter report had been delayed; and, although it would probably be in the handsof Ministers before the Governments plans were announced, itcould not be published before the middle of December, at the earliest.Now that it was known that the Report would not contain an agreedrecommendation in favour of raising the retirement age, there was less reason for postponing the announcement of the governments plans until after its publication. But its support for the contributoryprinciple would be of value in Parliamentary discussion of theGovernments plans, and every effort should be made to ensure thatit was published before the Second Reading of the National insurance bill.
The general conclusion which emerged from the cabinets discussion was that the Government should aim at passing thenecessary legislation through all its stages in both Houses ofParliament before the Christmas recess, and that thereafter the improvements which were to be made in the rates of national assistance, war pensions and pensions and benefits under the national insurance Scheme should be brought into operation at the earliest moment consistent with the avoidance of any breakdown in administrative arrangements. No time should be lost in carryingout any preliminary work which could be done in advance of thenecessary legislative sanctions; and no opportunity should be lostof advancing, wherever practicable, the dates suggested in the time-table annexed to C. (54) 337.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the National Insurance Bill should,if practicable, be passed through all its stages in bothHouses of Parliament before the Christmas recess.(2) Invited the Lord President and the Lord Privy Seal toconsider what special steps should be taken to facilitate the passage of this legislation before the Christmas recess,and invited them to submit their comments and a proposed time-table for consideration by the Cabinet inthe following week.(3) Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to take immediate steps for the preparation of the national insurance Bill.(4) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, gave general approval tothe time-table outlined in C. (54) 337 for bringing intooperation the proposed improvement in the rates of warpensions and of pensions and benefits under the national insurance Scheme, but invited the Minister of Pensionsand National Insurance to take advantage of any opportunity that offered for bringing any part of thatplan into operation at a date earlier than that nowproposed.Defence Policy.       3.   The Minister of Defence said that, if valuable financial(Previous        savings were not to be lost, it was necessary to put into effect without reference:       delay three of the changes affecting the Army and the Royal AirCC.(54)73rd   Force which the Cabinet had approved on 5th November, viz:  Conclusions, (i) the reduction of the strength of Anti-Aircraft CommandMinute 1.) to ten regiments of light artillery;(ii) the disbandment of eighteen units, including the secondbattalions of eight regiments; and(iii) the approved changes in the organisation of the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force.If these changes were announced in reply to Parliamentary Questionsor in statements made after Questions, demands would probably bemade for opportunities to debate them. It had therefore beensuggested that a preferable course would be to include in The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament a general statement of the government&apos;s intention to make certain changes in the organisationof the Forces to meet possible new forms of warfare, and to announce the particular changes proposed in the course of the Debate on the address. He sought the Cabinefs authority to proceed on theselines.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange that a passageon the lines proposed should be included in the draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.
