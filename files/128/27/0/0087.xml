The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition were expected to vote at their full strength against the Governmenfsmotion taking note of the reports of the Boundary Commissions,but to leave it to interested Labour Members to challenge about tenof the necessary Orders. A small number of Government supporterswhose constituencies were adversely affected by the boundary commissions&apos; recommendations would like to be able to vote againstthe relevant Orders. Such action would, however, increase theimpression of confusion which the Opposition were anxious toengender as a ground for claiming that there was not a broad enoughmeasure of agreement in the House to justify the carrying out of the boundary Commissions&apos; recommendations.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their earlier decision that Government supporterswhose constituencies were adversely affected by the boundary Commissions&apos; recommendations should be discouraged from going further than abstaining in the divisions on the relevant Orders.(2) Agreed that Members who were critical of proposals by the commissions for alterations in the names of constituenciesmight be given a private indication that this subsidiaryfeature of the Commissions&apos; recommendations might receive consideration at the appropriate time, but thatno variation of the Commissions&apos; recommendations couldbe contemplated at the present stage.industrial disputes.Railways.(Previous :Reference:CC. (54) 86thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Minister of Labour reported the result of the discussion on the railway wages dispute which he and the Minister of transport had held on the previous day with the Chairman of the transport commission. The Chairman was not asking that the Governmentshould put the Commission in a financial position to meet the wagesclaim of the National Union of Railwaymen (N:UR.). It was his view that the Government should not intervene at this stage but should allow the normal processes of negotiation to run their course.The Minister said that this was in line with the view which had beenprivately conveyed to him by the British Employers&apos; Confederation,who feared that premature intervention by the Government in this dispute might jeopardise the working of the normal machinery of wage negotiation throughout industry. The Minister agreed that theGovernment must take care to avoid getting into a position in whichthey appeared to be taking the place of the Transport commission as parties to this wage negotiation.The Chairman of the Transport Commission had suggested that,as,a next step, he should issue a public statement in which, afterrecalling the earlier stages of the negotiation, he would offer to discuss with the N.U.R. any particular cases where anomalies were thought to have been created by the new level of wages established for foot-plate staff by the award of the Railway Staff National Tribunal. The47402-1 B 2
statement would go on to make it clear, however, that the new claimput forward by the N.U.R. went much further than this, and thatit should be considered at arbitration on its merits. The statement would conclude that, if the arbitration tribunal accepted the claim in whole or in part, the Transport Commission would consult withthe Minister of Transport on any financial consequences which, theaward might entail.The Minister said that the purpose of such a statement was to invite the men to go to arbitration on the substance of their claim.It was already known that they were reluctant to do this, and thestatement might therefore provoke them into calling a strike. on balance, however, he was inclined to think that it would be rightto allow the statement to be issued, despite this risk.The Minister of Transport said that he was in broad agreementwith the course proposed by the Minister of Labour, though he believed that there was a strong probability that it would lead tothe issue of strike notices.Later in the meeting the Cabinet resumed their discussion onthe basis of the draft of a Government announcement incorporatingthe statement which the Chairman of the Transport Commissionwished to issue. Discussion turned mainly on the final paragraphof that statement, which indicated that the Commission would consult with the Minister of Transport on any financial consequences involved by an award of the arbitration tribunal. This paragraph would be closely scrutinised by the men, who would wish to read into it some assurance that the Government would be ready to assist theCommission to meet the cost of conceding their full claim. It would help, therefore, to avert a strike if the paragraph were amended soas to apply, not only to any increase awarded at arbitration, but toany increase granted by the Commission in resumed negotiationswith the men. On the other hand, it was argued that this extensionof the final paragraph would be inconsistent with the earlier part ofthe statement, in which a distinction was drawn between the minor adjustments which the Commission were prepared to discuss andthe major claim which they wished to see taken to arbitration. Itwould also make it more difficult for the Government to maintainthe position that they should not be called upon to intervene untilall the ordinary processes of collective bargaining, including arbitra-tion, had been exhausted. And it would go a long way towardsimplying that the Government were ready to help trie Commissionto meet the cost of any concession which they might make to themen. It was the general view of the Cabinet that the final paragraphof the Chairman&apos;s statement should read as follows: &quot; If the railway staff National Tribunal should conclude that the N.U.R. claim shouldbe met in whole or in part, the Commission will consult with theMinister of Transport as to the means by which any additional cost should be met.&quot;In further discussion it was suggested that, if the proposed statement by the Chairman of the Transport Commission was to be incorporated in a Government announcement, that announcement should also contain some further indication of the Government&apos;s own views on the points to which they attached importance, e.g., theobjections to any form of Government subsidy to wages in a nationalised industry and the need for more efficient redeploymentof the labour force on the railways.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofTransport to submit, for their consideration on the following day, a revised draft of a Government announcement on therailway wages dispute incorporating the proposed statement by the Chairman of the British Transport Commission.
East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 84thConclusions,Minute 6.)The Cabinet (1) Subject to the point recorded in paragraph (a) above,approved the draft telegram annexed to C. (54) 385, and authorised the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor its despatch.(2) Invited the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to presentthe case for our proposals orally to Mr. Stassen during his forthcoming visit to Paris.(3) Took note of the points recorded in paragraphs (b) and (c)above.4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (54) 385) and the Minister of Transport(C. (54) 387) on the plan for obtaining a comprehensive settlementof all outstanding matters concerning strategic controls over tradewith countries in the Soviet bloc.The President of the Board of Trade said that the terms for asettlement contained in the draft telegram annexed to C. (54) 385,which covered shipping, rolling-mills and copper wire, were the most favourable terms from our point of view to which there was anyserious possibility of securing American agreement. Modificationof his proposals in regard to shipping on the lines desired by theMinister of Transport would, in his view, destroy any chance of persuading the Americans to accept a general settlement on the lines proposed. If, on the other hand, his comprehensive proposals were put forward and rejected, it would be open to us to try to obtainmore favourable terms in respect of shipping as of other particularmatters. He therefore proposed that a message should be sent toMr. Stassen on the lines of the draft annexed to his paper, and thatthe Economic Secretary to the Treasury should put the case orallyto Mr. Stassen, whom he would shortly be meeting in Paris, andattempt to enlist his sympathy and support for these proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that he fully supported the proposalsof the President of the Board of Trade. Although certain features of the suggested settlement were disagreeable from our point of view,the proposed arrangements would be binding upon us for one yearonly.The Minister of Transport said that the alternative formula inrespect of shipping which he had suggested in C. (54) 387 would meet in substance the desire of United Kingdom shipping interests to be free to sell ships built during the war. It would, in his view, bedifficult to justify acceptance of more stringent restrictions on thesale of second-hand ships, even as the price of a general settlement with the Americans on all outstanding matters concerning strategic controls.The following further points were made in discussion:  (a) The words &quot; in the first instance &quot; in paragraph 3 (ii) of thedraft telegram annexed to C. (54) 385 might be taken as implyinga disposition on our part to agree to continue to participate in theproposed scheme after the expiry of the initial period. The wording of this paragraph should be reconsidered in the light of the Cabinefsdesire that we should not be under any obligation whatever to remain a party to any such scheme for longer than one year.(b) The Departments concerned should consider what special arrangements could be made to prevent the export to countries inthe Soviet bloc of certain special types of copper wire.(c) The Naval Staff had now reviewed the case for continuing to prevent on strategic grounds the export of fast vessels from thiscountry to countries in the Soviet bloc. They were now prepared toagree to the export of ships capable of speeds up to 16 knots, but no more, if this were thought expedient.
Sale of AnnsAbroad.Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 79thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty (D. (54) 38) seeking approval, subject to the viewsof the Near East Arms Co-ordination Committee, for the sale to Israel of two small naval vessels of the destroyer type.The Cabinet were informed that the Government of Israel hadbeen enquiring about the possibility of buying small naval vessels of the destroyer type which were no longer required by the Admiralty,or of arranging for the construction of new vessels of a smaller typein this country. They had been making similar enquiries elsewhere,but it seemed that they would prefer to buy two Hunt class frigateswhich the Admiralty had available for disposal. If we refrained from supplying such ships, other countries would undoubtedly be willing to do so. The transaction would not unduly disturb thebalance of naval strength between Israel and Egypt, and it was likely that the Egyptians would also wish to obtain some naval vesselsfrom us in replacement of her out-of-date ships. The agreement ofthe Near East Arms Co-ordination Committee would be obtained in the normal way before the sale of the ships was completed.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) We should seek to preserve a balance in the naval strengthof Israel and Egypt. It would be premature to decide now to sellthese ships to Israel. We should first try to reach an agreement withthe Egyptians about the naval vessels which they wished to obtain from us and at, the same time ascertain more definitely whatprogramme the Israelis had in mind. We should then examine theproposals in consultation with the United States Government.(b) It was in our interests to encourage the Israelis andEgyptians to replace their obsolete naval vessels by buying olderships no longer required by the Navy rather than by placing ordersfor the construction of new ships in British yards.The Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to make further enquiries with a view to ascertaining the plans of the Israeliand Egyptian Governments for obtaining naval vessels fromthe United Kingdom.Germany. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for Air (D. (54) 40) seeking the Cabinefs approvalReference: of a proposal that, when a German Air Force was formed inC.C. (54) 55th pursuance of the London Agreements, German airmen should be conclusions, trained in the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force.Minute 3.) Tne Secretary of State for Air said that the Federal GermanTraining of the Republic would not itself be able to train the modest air force which german Air it would be authorised to form on the ratification of the LondonForce. Agreements: it would look to the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates and Canada to give the assistance required. The UnitedStates would doubtless offer extensive training facilities without charge, but it was unlikely that they would be able to meet all the initial needs. It would be to our advantage to encourage theGermans to look to the Royal Air Force for guidance. By assistingwith training we should improve our chances of obtaining orders from Germany for British training aircraft and other equipment.Before going further with this, however, he sought the views of theCabinet since the training of German airmen by the R.A.F. wouldbe unpalatable to some sections of opinion in this country.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Preliminary approaches had also been made to us to assist in various ways the re-establishment on the authorised scale ofGerman naval and land forces.   Other countries were already
preparing to enter this market, and our commercial interests shouldnot be neglected. We should not lose this opportunity to offset thecost of maintaining substantial British forces on the continent ofEurope.(b) It must be recognised that the training of German airmenin this country would be more likely to provoke public criticism.For this reason further thought should be given to the extent towhich the Royal Air Force could provide the necessary training facilities in Germany. The Germans might be ready to bear thecost of capital expenditure, e.g., on airfields, required for this purpose.(c) We should not commit ourselves to any programme for thetraining of German airmen by the Royal Air Force until after theLondon Agreements had been ratified by member Governments.The Cabinet -(1) Agreed in principle that, after the London Agreements hadbeen ratified, the Royal Air Force should assist in thetraining of the new German Air Force.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to consider, and reportto the Defence Committee, to what extent it would bepossible for the Royal Air Force to provide these training facilities in Western Germany.7. The Cabinet had before them-(i) a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (54) 383) covering a report, which had beenprepared for publication, on the treatment of British prisoners-of-warcaptured in Korea; and (ii) a memorandum by the Attorney-General(C. (54) 386) drawing attention to the fact that Chapters VI and VIIof the report contained defamatory statements about individualswhich might be made the subject of proceedings for libel.In discussion there was general agreement that the public shouldbe made aware of the treatment accorded by the Chinese to british soldiers who became prisoners-of-war during the hostilities in Korea.The Foreign Secretary said that he was in favour of publishing the report annexed to C. (54) 383, and this proposal met with general support in the Cabinet.Discussion turned on the question whether any alteration shouldbe made in Chapters VI and VII of the report with a view to reducingthe risk of successful actions for libel. On this point The Attorney-General said that he did not know what evidence would be availableto support a plea of justification or fair comment. Unless therewas some prospect that such a defence might succeed, the cabinet might think it wiser to adjust the wording of these Chapters so asto avoid making imputations of treacherous conduct against namedindividuals. The suggestion was also made that Chapter VI mightbe omitted and that, in Chapter VII, individuals need not be mentioned by name: these adjustments would not affect the main purpose of the report, which was to expose the conduct of theChinese.As against this it was argued that it was a part of the purpose ofthe report to expose the conduct of British Communists, and thatthe Government need not feel any obligation to deal gently with the individuals mentioned by name in these Chapters of the report;Much of the information about their activities which was includedin the report had already been published by newspapers in theUnited Kingdom, and this earlier publication had not resulted inany proceedings for libel. If these individuals were so ill-advisedas to start proceedings, by reason of the publication of this report,they would draw further adverse publicity on themselves and, evenif their proceedings were successful, it seemed likely that the damagesawarded would be negligible.
The Cabinet agreed that the Government should not seek toprotect themselves against the possibility of libel actions by asking that the report should be published by order of the House ofCommons. The report should be issued as a Stationery Officepublication, and the Government should accept whatever risk therewas that proceedings for libel might be taken against the Crown.The Cabinet -Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the report annexed to C. (54) 383 to be issued as a Stationery Officepublication.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th December, 1954.
