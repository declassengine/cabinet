3CC. 28 (54)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the Easter recess.Education. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the Second Reading of the teachers&apos; Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill had not been included among the superannuation, business to be taken in the week following the Easter recess, sincethe Government could not rely on commanding their full votingstrength in that week. They agreed, however, that an early decision must now be taken on the future course of Parliamentary proceedings on this Bill.The Cabinet Agreed to consider at their first meeting after Easter thefuture course of Parliamentary proceedings on the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill.(previous reference:CC. (54) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)SelectCommittee on estimates.(previous reference:C.C.(53)3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Investigationsabroad.3. The Lord Privy Seal said that a proposal had been made that a Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Estimates, accom-panied by its clerk, should investigate conditions in some BritishEmbassies abroad. The Conservative Party had successfullyopposed a similar proposal when in Opposition and he had therefore thought it right to indicate informally to the Chairman of the SelectCommittee that such a proposal would not meet with the Govern-menfs approval. It was open to members of the Select Committeeto travel abroad as individuals in pursuance of their duties and, whenthey did so, they were entitled to claim reimbursement of theirexpenses. There were, however, constitutional objections to a pro-posal that a Sub-Committee of a Select Committee should formallymake investigations abroad in a corporate capacity accompanied byan official of the House.The Cabinet Endorsed the action of the Lord Privy Seal in indicating that the Government would not look with favour on aproposal that Sub-Committees of the Select Committee on estimates should conduct formal investigations overseas.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:CC. (54) 26thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet were reminded that the Government had under-taken that a statement would be made on their behalf in the Houseof Commons before the Easter recess on the Report from theSelect Committee on Members&apos; Expenses. They considered thedraft of such a statement which was handed round at the meeting.The Prime Minister said that this statement should either deal effectively with all the main arguments on both sides of this question or, as he would prefer, be kept quite short.The Cabinet considered the draft statement paragraph by para-graph and approved a number of amendments and omissions.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement on this question in the House of Commons on the following day in the terms agreed in their discussion.
IloPensions for old Age and war Disability.(previous reference:CC. (53) 30thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet considered&quot; memoranda by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (54) 138 and 139) on the possibility of increasing the rates of old-age and retirement pensions and of war disability pensions.The Minister of Pensions said that changes in the structure of theNational Insurance scheme must be deferred until the Governmenthad received the Report of the Phillips Committee on the Economicand Financial Problems of the Provision for Old Age, and theGovernment Actuary&apos;s Report on his first quinquennial review of theworking of the National Insurance scheme. The Actuary&apos;s report should be available by the end of 1954; but it now seemed unlikelythat the Phillips Committee would submit their report until early in1955. This probably excluded the possibility of passing compre-hensive legislation on pensions in the present Parliament. Mean-while, however, legislation could be passed dealing solely with pension rates, especially as the Phillips Committee were not concerned withthat question. There would be two advantages in making an earlyincrease in the rate of old-age and retirement pensions. First, itwould reduce the numbers in receipt of national assistance, whichwere already too large and were increasing. Secondly, it wouldrelieve large numbers of pensioners who were now suffering hardship;because they were too proud to apply for national assistance. Theobject should be to restore the purchasing power of the pension tothe level at which it had stood in 1946. A corresponding increase should be made in contributions. For employed persons this wouldmean an increase of about Id. a week for both worker and employer.For the self-employed an increase of about Is. a week would berequired. Larger increases had been made in contributions in 1952without serious political difficulty. For the Exchequer the increased cost would in the first two years be more than offset by the saving on national assistance, for it was contemplated that there would beno corresponding increase in assistance rates. The ultimate cost tothe Exchequer would be heavy: but it had always been recognisedthat old-age pensions would impose a mounting burden on theExchequer. The Minister said that he himself was doubtful whetherthis burden would in fact reach the total of  400 millions a year in25 years&apos; time, as the Government Actuary forecast. The Actuary&apos;estimate assumed a rate of unemployment almost double that whichhad prevailed since the end of the war, an increase in the incidence of sickness and an even longer expectation of life. Even if all theActuary&apos;s estimates were realised, they might be offset by increased productivity and by a reduction in defence expenditure.The Minister said that, despite the difficulties, he was impressed by the case for increasing pension rates before the end of the present parliament. The timing of such a step would, however, need careful thought. Two limiting factors would have to be borne in mind:(1) Because of the complicated administrative arrangements involved,the new rates could not come into operation until six months after they had been announced. (2) The initial payments at the new ratescould not begin during the first three months of any year, duringwhich his local offices were liable to be under heavy strain by reasonof winter epidemics. This meant that the Government had a choice of three possible courses:  (i) An interim scheme for increasing pension rates could be announced at the end of May 1954 and be brought intooperation before the end of 1954.(ii) An interim scheme could be announced in October 1954 andbe brought into operation in May 1955. This would beopen to the objection that the announcement would haveto be made not very long before the completion of theGovernment Actuary&apos;s review and the receipt of the reportof the Phillips Committee; and it might then be thoughtthat the Government might have waited a little longeruntil they could proceed with a more comprehensivereform of old-age and retirement pensions.
(iii) If no action were taken until the reports had been received,no decision could be announced before March 1955, andthe increased rates would not come into operation before october 1955 at the earliest. This would be an incon-venient date if it were thought that Parliament might bedissolved in the autumn of 1955; for it was undesirable that increased National Insurance benefits and contri-butions should come into force on the eve of a GeneralElection.In conclusion, the Minister said that, whatever decision was taken on the rates of old-age and retirement pensions, a corresponding increase would need to be made at the same time in war disability pensions.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) There was general agreement that these pension rates oughtto be increased before the end of the present Parliament. It wouldhave been preferable to introduce comprehensive legislation dealing,not only with rates, but with such adjustments as could be made inthe National Insurance scheme with a view to reducing the burdenof pensions on the Exchequer. Such legislation could not, however,be introduced until the Report of the Phillips Committee had beenreceived and considered; and it was now clear that this report would not be received in time to enable the Government to frameand pass the necessary legislation and leave a reasonable intervalthereafter before the next General Election. An interim increase ofrates seemed therefore to be inevitable.(b) There were, however, some disadvantages in promoting an interim scheme. It should not be assumed that there would be noprotests against the proposed increase in contributions. The planproposed could also be criticised as bringing no financial advantage to the 1  million in receipt of national assistance, who would berepresented as the poorest section of the community. It should beremembered that the 1953 Budget had been similarly criticised asgiving no relief to the poorest classes.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not atthis stage exclude the possibility of seeking some relief for theExchequer even under an interim scheme. One possibility was thatthe Exchequer should cease to pay a share of the contributionactuarially required, leaving the full contribution to be paid by employers and workers. Or he might ask his colleagues to considerthe possibility of withdrawing the concession of cheap tobacco for old-age pensioners, which cost the Exchequer  14 millions a year andcreated quite a considerable black market. On this latter point theprovisional view of the Cabinet was that it was not likely to be foundpracticable to include in an interim scheme provision for withdrawingthe tobacco concession from old-age pensioners.(d) Changes in the structure of the National Insurance scheme,following the recommendations of the Phillips Committee, were not likely to have much popular appeal; and it might be difficult to secureParliamentary acceptance of them, if all the increases that could bemade in pension rates had already been conceded. It would clearly be preferable that Parliament should be asked to accept some of theunpopular changes at the same time as the increases in rates werebeing conceded. From this, point of view it would be convenient ifthe Phillips Committee could submit an interim report. If this werenot possible, they might at least be asked to give an informal indica-tion of the recommendations which were likely to find a prominentplace in their report. The Government could then assure themselves that their interim legislation was consistent with the broad lines which the report of the Phillips Committee was likely to take.The Prime Minister said that, before they reached any finaldecision, the Cabinet should have more information about theprobable date and content of the Phillips Committee&apos;s report, and
should also have before them in broad outline the schemes whichwould be introduced under each of the alternative courses open tothem. The provisional conclusion which seemed to emerge fromthe discussion was that the choice lay between (i) An interim scheme dealing only with pension rates and contributions and coming into operation in January 1955.This could not presumably cover any of the matters nowunder discussion by the Phillips Committee, but it should at least be consistent with the recommendations which that Committee were likely to make,(ii) An interim scheme designed to come into operation in June,1955. This might deal not only with pension rates and contributions but with some of the matters now underconsideration by the Phillips Committee.In further discussion the point was made that, if ministers decided in favour of the second of these courses and the preparation and passage of the necessary legislation were for any reason delayed,so that the scheme could not come into operation until later thanJune, 1955, there was a risk that it might still be a matter of public controversy at a time when the Government might on other groundswish to ask for a Dissolution.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Pensions would arrange for private consulta-tions to be held with Sir Thomas Phillips on the probabledate and content of his Committee&apos;s report and on thepossibility of his being able to submit an interim report.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to submit an outline of theschemes which might be introduced under each of thealternative courses which the Prime Minister had indi-cated in summing up the Cabinefs discussion.6. The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions on Indo-China which he had held with Mr. Dulles, the United States Secretaryof State, had led to the issue of a joint communique declaring the readiness of the two Governments to consider, with the otherGovernments principally concerned, the possibility of establishing asystem of collective defence for South-East Asia and the western pacific. The statement which he had made in the House of commons that afternoon, announcing the results of these discussions, had been well received. There was no doubt of the ultimate importance ofestablishing collective defence arrangements in this area. It wouldinvolve a large extension of United States commitments and wouldbe welcomed by Australia and New Zealand. It would also remove the anomaly of Britain&apos;s exclusion from the Anzus pact.The Prime Minister said that he hoped that the forthcomingattitude adopted by Mr. Dulles towards the problems of South-east asia might be followed by an equally positive contribution towardsthe problems of the Middle East. It would be very helpful if asystem of collective defence could be established for that area also.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
3Trieste.(previous reference:CC. (53) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)Royal Tour.Uganda.(previous reference:CC. (54) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)7 CC. 28 (54)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 145) describing the progress made in the secret talks on Trieste which had been taking place in London since earlyFebruary between representatives of the United Kingdom, UnitedStates and Yugoslavia.The Foreign Secretary said that the Yugoslavs were now on theverge of agreeing in principle to a territorial solution of the Triestedispute approximating, with certain frontier adjustments, to the division of the Free Territory along the zonal boundary. their agreement would, however, be subject to certain conditions, of whichthe most important was that the Yugoslavs should receive thenecessary financial help to construct a new port in Zone B at SanNicola and a new railway line linking it with the interior. the americans had indicated that they would be prepared to find$20 millions for this project, and they hoped that the United KingdomGovernment would also make some contribution towards it in sterling. He proposed that, if the Italians and the Yugoslavs reachedan agreement on the Trieste problem, the United Kingdom Govern-ment should contribute a sum of  2 millions towards this project.This would be a single capital payment; and, if an agreement hadbeen reached, we should be saving the present costs of occupation,which were running at  2 millions a year. Other financial demandsbeing made by the Yugoslav Government should be considered separately.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although he had hoped for economies in overseas expenditure, he was willing to agreeto this payment of  2 millions as a condition of settlement of theTrieste problem. His agreement was, however, given on the under-standing that no more financial aid would be extended to the italians and that other Yugoslav financial demands would be considered separately.In discussion it was suggested that, if a capital sum of  2 millions was to be contributed by the United Kingdom Government, it mightbe made a condition of the grant that some contracts for work on theport or the railways should be let to British firms.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the progress made in the discussion of theTrieste problem.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government mightcontribute a sum of  2 millions as part of a final settle-ment of the dispute, as proposed in C. (54) 145, on theunderstanding that no corresponding offer of financial aidwould be made to the Italians and that other Yugoslavfinancial demands would be considered separately.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the possibility ofmaking the grant of  2 millions conditional upon theletting of contracts to British firms.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (54) 146) describing the modified arrangementsfor the Queen&apos;s visit to Uganda.The Colonial Secretary said that Her Majesty had now approved the details of the changes suggested for the second day&apos;s programmeof her visit to Uganda. He was satisfied that, under this revised programme, the security risks would be reduced to negligibleproportions.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum (C. (54)146).
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th April, 1954.Local 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theGovernment Minister of Housing and Local Government (C. (54) 111) outliningReform. a comprehensive scheme of Local Government reform, and a memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (54) 120) on theproblems of Local Government reform in Scotland.The Minister of Housing said that he was not suggesting that theCabinet should at this stage come to any conclusion on the proposals outlined in his memorandum. He hoped, however, that the cabinet would be willing to appoint a small Committee of Ministers to makea study of these and allied problems, including the future develop-ment of the New Towns. This Committee could work out broad principles of policy, which should be submitted to the Cabinet. Itcould then be considered whether the policy could be put into effect in the present Parliament or whether it should form part of theproposals to be put before the country at the next General Election.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that theseproposals should be studied, and he would wish to be associated withthe proposed Committee of Ministers. He thought that theCommittee should aim at recommending changes in Local Govern-ment finance which would result in a net saving to the Exchequer.The Prime Minister said that he was content that the proposals should be further studied, on the understanding that the Cabinet werein no way committed to introducing legislation on this subject duringthe present Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the memoranda by the Minister of Housing andthe Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (54) 111 and 120).(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint aCommittee of Ministers to study the proposals made inthese memoranda and to recommend to the Cabinet the broad principles of future policy on Local Governmentreform.
