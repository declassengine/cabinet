. The Foreign Secretary said that he was most reluctant to agreeto this. We had already made a number of concessions. We had withdrawn our suggestion of a neutral meeting-place, such as Lugano,and had fallen in with the Soviet preference for Berlin despite itsmany disadvantages. We had given up our original proposal that allmeetings should be held in the Allied Control Authority buildingwhich, although in the American sector, had been the meeting-placeof the Four Occupying Powers. If we gave way again, we should give an impression of weakness that would augur ill for the successof the Meeting. If, therefore, agreement could not be reached onthe basis of holding every fourth meeting in the Soviet Embassy, hesuggested that the British, French and American Ambassadors in moscow should be instructed to propose to M. Molotov that, unless he was prepared to instruct his representative in Berlin to agree, itwould be better to give up Berlin as the meeting-place and return tothe idea of holding the conference in some neutral town where these difficulties would hot arise.In discussion the point was,made that the Meeting was in factbetween two sides on one side the Soviet Union and on the other the United Kingdom, the United States and France. There was atleast this justification for the Soviet contention that meetings shouldbe held alternately in the Eastern sector and in the Western sector.On the other hand, it was argued that the Meeting was one of fourSovereign States and that each of the four Foreign Ministers hadequal rights in the choice of meeting place.: The Prime Minister suggested that, before any approach wasmade to Mi Molotov, a further effort should be made to persuade theRussians to agree that all meetings should be held in the allied control Authority building. It could be represented that, on administrative grounds, this was far the most convenient course andthat we should be ready to adopt any measures which would markthe fact that, although the building was in the American sector, it was regarded, for the purpose of the Meeting, as neutral ground. Itcould be suggested, for example, that the flags of all the Four powers should be flown on the building during the Meeting. If the Russiansrefused to accept this argument, then we should continue to suggestthat every fourth meeting should be held in the Soviet Embassy. if by these efforts the deadlock could not be broken, the matter shouldbe referred back to Governments..    ;        &apos;    ;!The Cabinet-V ; Invited: the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the french foreign Minister and the United States Secretary of State: that the instructions to their representatives in Berlin should. i     be on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister and that, ifthe deadlock still persisted, the&apos; matter should be referred;.; -     1 again to Governments so that further measures, such as an approach to M. Molotov, might be considered.45550Pour-Power 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in the preliminary talks in meeting.       ^ Berlin about the administrative arrangements for the Four-Power(Previous        Meeting, the Soviet representative was adopting an intransigentReference:      attitude.  He had at first proposed that all meetings should be heldCC.

Hehad now taken up the position that meetings should be heldalternately in the Soviet Embassy and in the building chosen bythe Western Allies.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord(Previous President (C.: (54) 7) recommending that we should agree to increasedReference: technical co-operation in atomic energy with Australia and SouthC.C. (53) 67th Africa without seeking to impose bargaining conditions designed to conclusions, give us an assured supply of uranium.Minute 1.)The Lord President said that, as a result of Lord CherweH&apos;s visit to Australia, it had become clear that for the present we could not hope to get a firm agreement with the Australians over uraniumsupplies. They would be unwilling to discuss this issue until after their General Election in July, and even then it might be some time before they felt that they could forecast their resources sufficientlywell to warrant the making of firm supply agreements. He consideredthat, despite this uncertainty, we should release to them all theinformation and technical assistance they might need for their ownatomic&apos;energy work. The South African Government were alsoseeking technical co-operation from the United Kingdom and hesuggested that we should offer to receive South African technicians- -. - v, for-training here. It would first be necessary to get the United States. , and Canada to agree-to our passing on atomic energy information ofnon-United States origin; but he did not think there would be any difficulty about this., It was the general view of the Cabinet that, although it was unfortunate that we could not yet expect assured supplies of uraniumfrom Australia, it would be wise to give what information we could to both Australia and South Africa in the hope that this would markthe beginning of a great Commonwealth effort in atomic energy.&apos; The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations in the memorandum by theLord President (C. (54) 7).(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to authorise the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Australia to make a communication to the Australian Government in the;       general terms of the Annex to C. (54) 7.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, subject to a satisfactory reply from the Australian Government, to instruct HerMajestyVAmbassador in Washington to clear the way with the Americans and Canadians for the necessaryexchange of information with Australia and SouthAfrica. - &apos;2. &apos; The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that,strikes: of electrical contractors&apos; staff- had now started at selectedfactories, The Electrical Trades Union had not. yet found full support for these tactics and had been obliged to raise strike pay by a thirdin order to obtain a better response. The Union had ordered a fullstrike on the. following Monday, and the response to this order would show how far they had the support of their members. By the middleof the. following week it should be possible to judge whether theGovernment could usefully take any further action with a view topromoting a settlement.The Cabinet-&quot;&apos;&quot; ;   Took note of this statement.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 12) recording a conversation which he had held with Sir William Fraser, Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company(A.I.O.C.).The Foreign Secretary said that Sir William Fraser had now accepted the fact that the A.I.O.C. could not expect to regainexclusive rights in the production and marketing of Persian oil. He had also accepted the view of Her MajestyY Charge dAffaires at Tehranthat it would be undesirable to ask the Persian Government to agreethat two or three representatives of the Company should visit Tehranin order to form their own judgment. The Foreign Secretary therefore proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Charge dAffaires should make a communication to the Persian Government in the following terms:  &quot; Her Majesty&quot;&apos;s Government have considered the reports ofmy conversations with Persian Ministers. It appears that thePersian Government wish a solution to be sought on the basisof the participation of several Companies in a group rather thanV that of a single Company. The A.I.O.C., with the approval ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government, are therefore resuming their talks with other Companies in order to see whether it is feasible toform such a group, in which A.I.O.C. would have an appropriateshare and which would be in a position to negotiate a compre-hensive settlement with the Persian Government. It is the hopeof Her Majesty&apos;s Government that the settlement would embraceall features of the problem and would thus avoid the necessity.    of any submission to arbitration.&quot;This communication deliberately avoided mention of the share whichA.I.O.C. should have in the consortium. This was a matter whichshould first be agreed with the United States Government, and he proposed that we should now tell them that in our view &quot; an appropriate share &quot; meant 50 per cent. The American oil companies would be willing to accept this figure, but it might be more difficult to persuade the United States Government to do so. If a solution couldbe found on these lines arbitration would be unnecessary, since a.I.O.C. would obtain their compensation in the form of payments and free oil from the other Companies forming the consortium.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was important to ensure that the consortium would be a: British registered company dealing in sterling oil. If, therefore,agreement could not be reached on a 50 per cent, share for A.I.O.C.,every effort should be made to arrange that the Shell Company&apos;sholdings in the consortium should be enough to bring the total Britishshares up to 50 per cent.(/?) Owing to the high rate of taxation in the United Kingdomthere might be some difficulty in arranging that the consortium shouldbe a British registered company carrying on its business in a place where it would be liable to United Kingdom taxation. It would inany case be of great importance to ensure that payments to Persiashould not in future be made out of taxed profits. .The Cabinet-Agreed that, as the next step in the Persian oil dispute, her majesty&apos;s Charge dAffaires in Tehran should make a com-inunication to the Persian Government on the lines suggestedby the Foreign Secretary.45550 b 3Persia.(previous reference:C.C.

Egypt-Defence . ,Negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.); 5. The Cabinet had before them, the following memoranda onthe defence negotiations with Egypt :rt ,C. (54) 6: by the Foreign Secretary explaining theadvantages and disadvantages of the various courses now opento us in the conduct of the negotiations.C. (54) 9; by the Chiefs of Staff, commenting on the military aspects of the matter.C. (54) 11: by the Foreign Secretary, covering a note on theiegal position regarding the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936,prepared in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers.     ;C. (54) 14 (Revise): by the Foreign Secretary regarding therequest of the United States Secretary of State for a text of theproposed Heads of an Agreement.The Foreign Secretary said that of the courses now open to us hepreferred the conclusion of an agreement with Egypt on the terms which we had now offered. If we failed to obtain such an agreement,the next best course would be to tell the Egyptians that we wereprepared for revision of the 1936 Treaty according to its terms andthat, as it was clear that agreement with them on that revision wouldbe impossible, we should be prepared to go to arbitration on the termsof such a revision in accordance with the Treaty. But this course,which was set out as course (c) in C. (54) 6, would deprive us of the base and of the right of re-entry to it in war; and the Chiefs of Staffin C. (54) 9 had expressed the opinion that a Base in the Canal Zonewas essential for the support of Our own and Allied Forces in theMiddle East in war. He had therefore concluded that, in spite of thepolitical attractions of course (c), it would be better to make a further effort to obtain an agreement with Egypt on the terms that we had offered in October. He proposed to send a note of these terms to theUnited States Secretary of State, and he hoped that Mr. Dulles wouldthen bring stronger pressure to bear on the Egyptian Government to persuade them to conclude an agreement on these terms.In discussion the following points were made:-(a) The proposed agreement with Egypt would replace the 1936Treaty. There were some valuable provisions in this Treaty whichhad not been included in the proposed agreement. The ForeignSecretory undertook to consider whether there was any means bywhich these could be continued.(b) If failure to reach an agreement led us to adopt course (c), weshould be obliged to reduce the strength of our forces in Egypt to the10,000 prescribed by the 1936 Treaty. A force of this strengthwould be insufficient to withstand an Egyptian attack upon the canal Zone-although, if we were attacked, we should be at liberty to reinforce the area.(c) It could not be assumed that the conclusion of an agreement would lead to friendly co-operation between ourselves and the egyptians. There was good reason to suppose that the egyptians would continue to stir up trouble in the Sudan for some years,whether we concluded an agreement or not.(d) The conclusion of ari agreement would give us no controlover the Base after 1961. If the Base was essential in war, whatarguments could be used to show that an agreement lasting only until1961 had any value? In reply, The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that during the succeeding seven years we should do our best to induce in the Egyptians a sense of military responsibility, sothat at the end of that period they would be ready and able to operate the Base in support of the defence of the Middle East as a whole. Weshould also hope during the same period to secure greater militarycohesion among the other Arab States.   It would be our aim to
43SterlingBalances.arrange for the defence of the Middle East to be secured by the jointefforts of the countries in this area, stiffened by a small number ofBritish troops stationed at strategic points.The Prime Minister said that we were committed to the terms offered to the Egyptian Government oh 21st October, 1953. these terms should be sent to the United States Government. It waspossible that, as a result of American representations in Cairo, theymight be accepted. He thought, however, that the next step shouldnot be decided until the results of this communication to the UnitedStates Government were known.The Cabinets (1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should instruct her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington to hand to theUnited States Secretary of State the text of the offer madeby Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the Egyptian Govern-ment on 21st October, 1953.(2) Agreed to resume discussion of defence negotiations in Egyptwhen the results of the action in (1) above were known.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was now clear from information received from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairothat, if the Egyptian Government introduced the relaxations of restrictions on sterling imports which they had in mind, our exporttrade would benefit by some  6- 7 million. He did not, however,urge that the  10 million of their sterling balances should on this account be released to Egypt if other valuable results could beobtained by withholding them.The Prime Minister said that it would be better to defer thisdecision for a time. There was no certainty that by this delay weshould necessarily lose the advantages to our export trade.Middle east defence Policy.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that at this stage of the defence negotiations with Egypt it would be opportune to follow up thesuggestion of the Turkish Government that we might pre-stockmilitary equipment at Mardin, on the frontier between Turkey and syria. If we.could make satisfactory arrangements with Turkey forthe joint defence of this area, and subsequently bring Iraq into these arrangements, Egypt would (apart from the question of the Base) seemto be of less strategic significance. Early progress on this with theTurks might have a good political effect, not only on the Egyptians,but also on the Iraqis.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, from the Commonwealthpoint of view it would be useful to pursue this suggestion. If we failed to get an agreement with Egypt, an arrangement with turkey would help to convince the Commonwealth countries, and especiallyNew Zealand, of our determination to develop alternative meansof securing the defence of the Middle East.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it would be valuable strategically to pre-stock stores and equipment in Mardinin peace-time,, for the maintenance of troops operating in war on the axis through Mosul in support of the Iraqis. This would have to becoupled, however, with pre-stocking in Jordan. There were somepractical difficulties to be overcome. There was said to be no spareport capacity in Alexandretta; and the railway running east fromAlexandretta to Aleppo and Mosul had a limited capacity of1,000 tons per day. Only the minimum number of British administra-tive troops required to look after the stores and equipment wouldbe stationed at Mardin in peace-time; we should have to rely onTurkish forces in that.neighbourhood for local protection.
Jordan.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 68thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding minute the Cabinet were reminded that the stationing of Britishtroops in Jordan would form an essential part of any northwardre-deployment in the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the continuing tension between Jordan and Israel, he had asked the War Office to defertaking action on the Cabinefs decision of 19th November that an armoured squadron might be sent to Ma&apos;an in Jordan for training withthe Arab Legion, and had refrained from sending to the Governmentsof Jordan and Israel the communications which he was to have madeto them regarding our intentions in stationing British troops in Jordan.At the present stage of the defence negotiations with Egypt, there might now be advantage in making this approach to these twoGovernments. -The Cabinet Reaffirmed their decision of 19th November regarding thedespatch of an armoured squadron to Jordan, and invited the Foreign Secretary to submit for the Prime ministers approval drafts of the communications which he would propose to make to the Governments of Jordan and Israelin pursuance of that decision.Civil Aviation.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 44thConclusions, :Minute 3.)Comet Aircraft.8. The Minister of Civil Aviation said that he welcomed thedecision of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) to suspend temporarily their normal Comet passenger services in conse-quence of the loss of the Comet G-ALYP off the Island of Elba on10th January. Indeed, if this action had not been taken by B.O.A.C.,he would have felt obliged to order it himself. All the availableremains of the lost aircraft would be subjected to the most minuteexamination and there was a fair prospect that a reasonable body ofevidence could he collected upon which to base some judgment onthe cause of this deplorable accident.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.The Prime Minister said that the project required careful study.He would like to know what forces the Chiefs of Staff would proposeto operate from the advanced base at Mardin and how many Britishtroops would be required there in peace-time; what aid the Turks would give, and what would be the means of local protection; whattonnage of stores would be involved; and what port facilities wouldbe required.The Cabinet-(1) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to prepare a staff study, forconsideration by the Defence Committee at an early meeting, on the proposal for pre-stocking British military stores and equipment at Mardin in Turkey.(2) Agreed that the Defence Committee should at the samemeeting consideT the form of approach to be made to theTurkish Government on this question.
Privileges and immunities.international organisations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 65thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 365) seeking authority to present to Parliamentduring the present Session eight Orders-in-Council conferringimmunities and privileges in this country upon the internationalstaff and national delegates at meetings of certain international organisations.The Foreign Secretary recalled that in July 1952 the cabinet had authorised the resumption of the grant of these immunities and privileges, which had been suspended by the Labour Government in1950 in deference to criticisms in both Houses of Parliament. Of theten Orders-in-Council which he had then been authorised to present to Parliament, one had now been made and three had become un-necessary. To the remaining six, two amending Orders must nowbe added making eight Orders still necessary.The Cabinet recognised that the presentation of these Ordersmight well excite opposition in both Houses and involve an appre-appreciable loss of Parliamentary time in view of the fact that, undersection 1 of the International Organisations (Immunities and Privi-leges) Act, 1950, each Order had to be approved separately by an affirmative resolution of both Houses. They considered, however,that these objections were outweighed by the arguments in favour ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals. Failure to present the Orderswould in certain cases involve our defaulting on obligations which wehad undertaken. It had also to be remembered that our own dele-gates to meetings of these international organisations held in theterritory of other member countries were accorded correspondingprivileges and that it was to our advantage to encourage the holding of meetings of the organisations in this country in view of the foreign exchange which was thereby earned. In the case of the North atlantic treaty Organisation, in particular, early action was desirable in viewof criticisms which the Public Accounts Committee had directed atthe Inland Revenue for according taxation privileges in anticipation of the necessary Parliamentary authority.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to present to Parliamentduring the present Session Orders-in-Council under the Inter-national Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950,in respect of the eight international organisations listed inthe Appendix to C. (53) 365.East and central Africa.Activities ofIndianCommissioner.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in view of our representations, the Indian Government had now decided to recallMr. Pant, the Indian Commissioner in East and Central Africa.Mr. Pant had been instructed to return to Delhi before the end ofJanuary.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13 th January, 1954.
