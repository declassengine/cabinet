european defence.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary recalled that, in the situation arisingfrom the rejection of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)Treaty by the French Assembly, we had made it Our first concern toascertain Dr. Adenauers views on possible alternative means of associating Germany more fully with the free world and obtainingan early German defence contribution. Telegram No. 705 from our high Commissioner in Bonn showed that Dr. Adenauer did not shareour desire for an early conference of the eight or nine Powers most closely concerned but favoured discussions with us on a bilateralbasis leading to a plenary meeting of the Council of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.). The Foreign secretary said that in these circumstances he proposed himself to visit the benelux capitals, Bonn and Paris, in that order, for explanatory discussions with the Governments of the countries concerned. Onthe military side he still thought there was no alternative to bringingGermany into N.A.T.O., subject to as many safeguards asDr. Adenauer could be brought to accept. It seemed to him possible,however, that general agreement to Germany&apos;s admission would notbe obtainable without an undertaking on our part to retain on thecontinent of Europe, so long as the present emergency situation mightpersist, say three divisions, compared with the four and a halfdivisions we now had there in practice, and the single division whichwe had undertaken to commit to E.D.C. He recognised that suchan undertaking would have to be made subject to a suitable provisoto safeguard our balance of payments. On the political side he regarded suggestions for a modified form of E.D.C. as quite impracticable, but some new proposal whereby the concept of a european community could be kept alive within the N.A.T.O.framework would in his view be welcomed alike by our Allies andby responsible opinion in this country. The plan which he now hadin mind for this purpose was that Germany and Italy should beinvited to adhere to the Brussels Treaty, which would thereby be nolonger directed against Germany but transformed into an instrumentcovering all Western Europe and providing for mutual assistance inthe event of aggression either by one of the parties or by an outsidePower. A suggestion on these lines might, apart from its other advantages, dispose Dr. Adenauer more favourably towards theprogramme of future action which we considered more appropriatethan that which he at present favoured.In discussion there was support for the line of approachproposed by the Foreign Secretary. It was pointed out that, so longas the E.D.C. plan to which we had seen objections of principlefrom the outset had held the field, we had felt under no obligationto propose constructive alternatives. But the position had now changed. Extension of the scope of the Brussels Treaty, which hadthe advantage of a duration of fifty years, would provide a focus for those in all countries, including Western Germany, who still clung tothe conception of a united Europe. Germany and Italy would thereby be enabled to take their part in the cultural and kindredactivities which were already being pursued under the Treaty&apos;s aegis.Some doubts were, however, expressed about the wisdom and thenecessity, at least at this stage, of our undertaking any rigid commit-ment as to the size of the forces which we should retain on theContinent, and it was suggested that this matter would be better left for discussion in due course through the normal machinery ofN.A.T.O.The Prime Minister said that, while he did not question the wisdom Of the proposal to extend the Brussels Treaty to coverGermany and Italy, he would welcome an opportunity to refresh his mind about the exact nature of the obligations which the Treatyimposed. He felt more serious doubts about the prudence of ourentering into firm commitments as to the forces we should retain Onthe Continent in the absence of any corresponding commitment onthe part of the United States Government.   In any case ought not
France to be left for a time in anxiety about her Allies&apos; intentions,rather than rewarded for her recent actions by further promises ofBritish support?The Foreign Secretary said that in his forthcoming discussionshe would be careful to avoid encouraging the belief that we shouldbe prepared to enter into more definite commitments as to the forces which we would retain on the Continent. But, on his return, he might well find himself compelled to seek Cabinet approval to ourentering into such commitments as the price of a settlement of theproblems confronting us.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary, in his forthcoming discussions in the Benelux capitals, Bonn and Paris, to explore the possibilities of promoting a solution of theproblems arising from the French rejection of the E.D.C.Treaty through admitting Germany to the North atlantic treaty Organisation, subject to all possible safeguards, and enabling her to adhere concurrently to the Brussels Treaty.2. The Foreign Secretary said that American insistence thatthe South-East Asian Collective Defence Treaty should be signed ata predetermined hour that day had made it difficult, during the closingstages of the Manila Conference, to ensure that full account was taken of views held in London on the various points which had arisen onthe outstanding Articles. He hoped, however, that it would be foundthat all our requirements had been met, apart possibly from someviews of the Colonial Secretary on the terms of the first two clauses of the proposed Pacific Charter which was to accompany the Treaty.The Colonial Secretary said that he had thought it important toavoid references in the latter document to &quot; self-determination,&quot;particularly in view of the present situation in Cyprus.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it appeared from Manilatelegram No. 78 that the final text of Article IV (i) and Article VIIIwould be such as in theory to bring the Treaty into effect (except forthe United States) in the event of Indian aggression against Pakistan.If this should prove to be so, the effect on India would be most fortunate. We should probably have to take the line in public that war between members of the Commonwealth was unthinkable and,therefore, that the question of our possible involvement in this contextdid not arise.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.3. The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 15th June the cabinet had authorised acceptance of the Chinese offer to send arepresentative to London with the function of discussing practicalarrangements for establishing diplomatic arrangements between theUnited Kingdom and China. His colleagues would be glad to know that the representative selected by the Chinese Government for thispurpose was as suitable an individual as we had reason to hope for.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.
Soviet Union.Visit ofParliamentaryDelegation to moscow.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 55thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (54) 284) stating that the invitation receivedby the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons on27th July to arrange for a Parliamentary Delegation to visit Moscowhad been accepted, and that he did not consider that there was sufficient justification for postponing this visit, which was due to takeplace between 30th September and 16th October.The Lord Chancellor said that, in accordance with custom,Mr. Speaker and he had left the selection of the members of theproposed delegation to be discussed between the Whips in bothHouses. There was no truth in statements which had appeared in thepress that he had considered leading the delegation himself.The Cabinet Took note that a delegation of Members of the two houses of Parliament, to be selected on the basis of discussions between the Party Whips, would be visiting Moscow between30th September and 16th October.Pakistan.constitutional development.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 281) seeking approval of certainaction to be taken on receipt of a request from the pakistan government to retain her membership of the Commonwealth afterbecoming a republic.The Commonwealth Secretary said that we might now expectPakistan to become a republic about the middle of February 1955,and at some stage to address to ourselves and other commonwealth governments a formal request to be allowed, nevertheless, to remain within the Commonwealth. Since the Prime Ministers&apos; meeting ofApril 1949, at which it was decided that India should remain in theCommonwealth although becoming a sovereign independent republic,it had been implicitly understood that Pakistan could, if she sorequested, have the same status within the Commonwealth as India.He, therefore, now sought authority:  (i) to indicate to other members of the Commonwealth, on receipt of such a request from the Pakistan Government,that the United Kingdom Government were willing toagree and, subject to the views of other members, toarrange for the matter to be placed on record in somesuitably formal way;(ii) to arrange for the preparation of the short Bill, alreadyincluded in the provisional legislative programme(C. (54) 246), which would be required to make thenecessary provision about the operation of UnitedKingdom law after the expected change in Pakistaniconstitutional status.The Cabinet Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to proceed on thelines proposed.Civil Aviation.Developmentof gatwick airport.(previous reference:GC. (54) 51stConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the formerMinister of Transport and the Minister of Housing (C. (54) 236 and237) regarding the report of the public enquiry into the proposeddevelopment of Gatwick Airport, together with a further memorandum by the present Minister of Transport (C. (54) 282).The Minister of Transport recalled that in 1953 a Committee ofthe Cabinet, under the Lord Chancellor^ chairmanship had recommended adherence to the plan to develop Gatwick Airport andthat the Governments views in this sense had thereafter been
USpublished in a White Paper (Cmd. 8902). Meanwhile a public enquiry had taken place, the report of which (Cmd. 9215) hadbeen published on 20th July and was discussed in C. (54) 236 and 237.Development of Gatwick was now a matter of urgency as, even if itwere begun forthwith, the airport would not be in operation before1958, when it was estimated that London Airport would no longer be capable of handling all the air traffic offering. He therefore soughtfinal approval for the Gatwick project on the understanding that further consideration would need to be given to arrangements for compensating those who would suffer from the airporfs development,and that the form and timing of the announcement of theGovernments decision should be considered by a small ministerial committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that development ofGatwick should now be approved but expressed concern about the contemplated arrangements for compensation.The Colonial Secretary said that he fully adhered to the views which, as former Minister of Transport, he had expressed inC. (54) 236.The Minister of Housing said that he would not oppose approvalof Gatwick&apos;s development, although he greatly regretted the way in which the matter had been handled from the outset and had little doubt that the project would, in fact, cost more than the  6 millionsestimated and might well prove in the end not to have been well founded from the point of view of our long-term civil aviation needs.Payment of compensation might possibly be found to be justifiablein cases where, for example, individuals had clearly purchasedproperties on the basis of the late Governments firm statement thatGatwick would not be developed, but it would be difficult todetermine where the line should be drawn. In his view no announce-ment should be made until the Government were in a position to disclose their plans about compensation and about the alleviationof other local grievances, for example, in regard to the alignmentof the London-Brighton road, to which expression had been given during the recent public enquiry. These aspects of the problemmight with advantage be examined in the meantime by officials ofall the Departments concerned.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the Government should announce their intention of proceeding with the proposed develop-ment of Gatwick Airport as the main alternative civilairport to London Airport.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for officials ofthe Departments concerned to consider all outstandingaspects of the matter which required to be decided before an announcement was made, and to submit the officials&apos;recommendations upon them for approval by the HomeAffairs Committee.Conway 7.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofBridge. of Transport (C. (54) 283) recommending that German firms of structural engineers should be allowed to tender for the erection ofa road bridge at Conway, Caernarvonshire, subject to certain specified conditions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee, which had considered this matter at an earlier stage, had concluded that we should not be justified in excluding German firmsfrom competing for this contract provided that the conditions to
Coal Imports.(previous reference:CC. (54) 48thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (C. (54) 285) seeking authority to arrangefor the import of a further 2 million tons of coal.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the high rate ofindustrial activity which had been maintained during the summerhad led to increased demand for coal, consumption of which nowstood at a record level. At the same time coal production washandicapped by the difficulty of attracting and keeping men,particularly in the coalfields of Yorkshire and the West Midlands,where competition was particularly strong from other industries.Productivity was expected to continue to increase, but this wouldnot be sufficient to cover the widening gap which we must expectthrough the wastage of man-power and the growth of coalconsumption. In these conditions he thought it would be prudent to take action now to raise our imports from 2 million to 4 million tons. He would review the coal situation again before the end ofOctober and would refer to the Cabinet if further measures seemednecessary to safeguard coal supplies during the coming winter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed thecoal outlook with the Minister of Fuel and Power and was satisfiedthat the additional imports now recommended were necessary.However, imported coal cost more than home-produced coal andwould aggravate the problem of our balance of payments. Thedifficulties foreseen in providing from our own resources all the coal which we should need next winter raised the question whether wecould afford to maintain our exports of coal at their present level of nearly 14 million tons, important though it was to retain our foreing markets. If the present trend continued it might also become necessary to accord somewhat less favourable treatment to agricultural interests in developing the production of coal fromopencast sites. In fairness to the Minister of Fuel and Power it shouldbe mentioned that the cold summer had been responsible for increasing the consumption of coal by about 1 million tons.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange forthe import of a further 2 million tons of coal, as proposedin C. (54) 285.which the Minister of Transport proposed to secure their adherence relating to imported materials and observance of the Fair wages resolution of the House of Commons were not departed from.There was general support in the Cabinet for this view, subjectto the following points:  (a) The German firms should not, as suggested in paragraph 4of C. (54) 283, be given an opening to indicate what their tenderwould be if imports were allowed.(b) The Presidents of the Federation of Civil EngineeringContractors and of the British Constructional Steelwork Association,when they were informed of the decision to allow German firms to tender, should be made aware of the conditions which it was proposedto impose upon them.The Cabinet Subject to the points recorded in paragraphs (a) and (b)above, approved the course of action proposed by theMinister of Transport in C. (54) 283.
industrial 9.   The Minister of Labour said that the current negotiationsDisputes. between the Chairman of the British Transport Commission and theRailways. Railway Unions about railwaymen&apos;s wages were at a critical stage(Previous There was some possibility that agreement could be reached withReference: the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) in respect of certainCC. (54) 57th of the grades which they represented, and as other members of theConclusions, same grades belonged to other Railway Unions, a wider measureMinute 8.) of agreement might thereby possibly be brought aboutThe Cabinet Took note of this statement.Economic 10.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would soonPolicy. be leaving London to attend, for the first time, the meetings of the visit of the Boards of the International Monetary Fund and the InternationalChancellor of Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He was encouraged the Exchequer by the marked improvement which had recently taken place in ourto Washington, non-sterling capital position. His presence in Washington would give him the opportunity for useful discussions with the Secretary of theUnited States Treasury and with the Finance Ministers of other commonwealth and European countries. Reports in the press thathe was contemplating an early move towards the convertibility of sterling were, of course, without foundation. He intended; however,to make it clear to the United States Government, whose own recentrecord in these matters fell far short of what we had hoped, thatwe intended to maintain the momentum of our policy of freeingtrade and payments so far as possible. He had in mind in thisconnection an early increase in the amount of the overseas travel allowance, and he hoped to be able to follow this by a partialrelaxation of the restrictions at present imposed on the paymentof legacies from persons in this country to persons in the UnitedStates.The discussions which he hoped to have with commonwealth finance Ministers should enable him to obtain some indication ofthe line which other Commonwealth countries were likely to adoptat the meeting between Commonwealth officials to be held in london in October in preparation for the forthcoming review of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.). In discussing the delicate issues of Imperial Preference and Japanese trade he proposedto be guided by the views expressed in his memorandum to theCabinet C. (54) 268. On Imperial Preference, in particular, he proposed to give a clear indication that the United Kingdom Govern-ment expected to be treated by other Commonwealth governments on a reciprocal basis, and it would naturally be his aim to promote the greatest possible measure of agreement among commonwealth governments on these matters.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.South Africa. 11.   The Minister of Defence said that in the course of furtherSimbnstowh discussibns the South African Minister Of Defence had indicatedNaval Base. that, if the Sihionstbwn Naval Base were transferred to South Africa,(Previous the South African Government would be prepared to give us an reference: unqualified guarantee that it would be available to the Royal NavyCC. (54) 58th in peace and to the Royal Navy and its Allies in war.  Mr. ErasmusConclusions, had, moreover, made it clear that, as part of an arrangementMinute 2.) providing for the transfer of Simonstown, the South African Govern-ment would be willing that the Cdmmahder-in-Chief, South Atlantic,
should remain in the Cape Peninsula and continue to fly his flagat his headquarters there; would guarantee to safeguard the positionof coloured workers at Simonstown; and would accept on secondmentduring a transitional period such senior and subordinate officers ofthe Royal Navy as might be mutually agreed to be required tomaintain the efficiency of the Base until the South African Navy were ready to resume full responsibility for it. The report of a working party which had considered this last matter in detail suggested thatit might be some years before the process of transfer could, in fact,be completed. It was also relevant that the South Africans had confirmed their undertaking to send an armoured division and certainsquadrons of aircraft to the Middle East in the event of war. Thefullest possible co-operation of the South African Government inall these matters was of great importance to us and a comprehensiveagreement in which the transfer of Simonstown would take its dueplace might be greatly to our advantage.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that when Dr. Malanhad recently raised the question of the future of the Protectorates wehad begged him to concentrate rather on those matters, includingdefence, on which co-operation between ourselves and South Africapromised to be fruitful. There had been indications that Dr. Malanmight wish to revive earlier suggestions of a regional pact to whichthe South African Government and other Governments withterritories in Southern Africa might be parties. Such a developmentmight not be unwelcome to us as representing a move by SouthAfrica away from neutrality. On the particular question ofSimonstown he had now received legal advice to the effect that itwas by no means certain that, in a future war in which South Africaremained neutral, we should, in fact, be able to rely on the 1921Treaty to ensure our continued use of the facilities of the Base. he did not suggest that at this stage any decision should be taken evenin principle about the future of Simonstown, but he sought authorityto bring the current discussions with Mr. Erasmus to a conclusion on the general basis that they had achieved substantial progress towards agreement between ourselves and South Africa on defence matters but that much further work and discussion would berequired before any final agreements could be reached.The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Admiralty, expressed agreement with the views of the Minister of Defence in this matter.The First Sea Lord confirmed that the South African naval authorities based their case for the return of Simonstown on practicalgrounds connected with the planned development of the SouthAfrican Navy.The Foreign Secretary suggested that undue importance shouldnot be attached to any plans which Dr. Malan might have in mind for a regional pact in Southern Africa, which other Powers withterritories in that area might well be unwilling to join.The Prime Minister said that he could not regard as valid the argument that our use of Simonstown might be restricted on legalgrounds in the event of a future war in which South Africa wasneutral. He recognised that the significance of Simonstown was largely symbolical; but he would find it hard to reconcile himself to its surrender, which would dishearten those elements in SouthAfrica who remained steadfast in their loyalty to this country andwere sadly in need of encouragement at the present time.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Defence and the commonwealth secretary to conclude their current discussions with theSouth African Minister of Defence on the basis proposedby the Commonwealth Secretary, on the understandingthat Mr. Erasmus and his colleagues would be left under
no misapprehension that the position of the UnitedKingdom Government in regard to a possible return ofthe Simonstown Naval Base to the South african government had been in any way prejudiced by thediscussions which had so far taken place.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence and the commonwealth secretary to submit to the Cabinet in due course their proposals for a comprehensive defence agreement with south Africa.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th September, 1954.
