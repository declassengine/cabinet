The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week. They decidedwhich Ministers should speak on behalf of the Government duringthe two concluding days of the Debate on the Address and duringthe two days&apos; debate on the Second Reading of the national insurance Bill.Rural Roads. 3.

Legislative Programme for the present session, which the cabinet had approved on 16th November, and he would like to say in debate that the Government expected to be in a position before long tomake known their proposals on this subject and hoped that thenecessary legislation could be introduced in the present session.  Hewould be careful to avoid any commitment on the question whetherthis legislation should apply only to Wales or should be extendedto cover the whole of Great Britain.47262-2The Cabinet-Approved the statement on the Rural Roads Bill whichthe Minister of Agriculture proposed to make in the courseof the Debate on the Address.b 21. The Foreign Secretary said that the announcement of the mutual security treaty between the United States Government andthe Chinese Nationalists had not occasioned much unfavourablecomment in the Press in this country. It might therefore be possibleto proceed, after a suitable interval, with the plan for raising in theSecurity Council the problem of Quemoy and the other islands offthe China Coast.The Foreign Secretary said that he sympathised with the sharpAmerican reaction to the Chinese treatment of the American airmencaptured in Korea, and he proposed to indicate his support of theattitude of the United States Government in this matter when he spoke in the Debate on the Address on 6th December.The Cabinet were informed that a factual statement had beenprepared on the treatment accorded to members of the British forcescaptured during the Korean campaign. It was proposed that thisshould be published shortly.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.. (2) Invited the Minister of Defence to circulate to the Cabinet,before  publication,  the statement on the treatmentaccorded to British prisoners of war captured during the korean campaign.The Foreign Secretary said that M. Mendes-France was stillpursuing his plan whereby, as part of a settlement on Austria, theforces of the Occupying Powers might be allowed to remain longeron Austrian territory than had hitherto been contemplated. Therewere obvious dangers in such a plan, apart from the impressionwhich it gave of disunity between the three Occupying Powers. Witha view to lessening this impression, it had been agreed that we andthe United States Government should make it known thatM. Mendes-France had informed us in advance of his intention toput this proposal forward.
Road Traffic 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofBUL Transport (C. (54) 361) on the proposed inclusion in the Road(Previous Traffic Bill of provisions authorising the introduction of parkingReference:       meters.C.C. (54) 46th Tne Min[ster Qj Transport said that the use of parking metersconclusions, had been recommencied in the report of the Working Party on CarMinutex) Parking in the Inner Area of London, published in 1953, and formedParking Meters. part 0f his general plans for dealing with traffic congestion in cities,particularly in London. The exaction of a charge for parking on the highway was intended as one means of inducing those who at presentparked their cars in the streets throughout the day to take them togarages. The system would yield revenue to subsidise theconstruction of garages which were not otherwise a soundcommercial proposition. It was proposed that, in the first instance,parking meters should be installed on an experimental basis only,but there was at present no power to make such an experiment. Ifthe Cabinet agreed that the necessary powers should be sought in theRoad Traffic Bill, the Government spokesman would explain, on theSecond Reading of the Bill, the Government^ general plans fordealing with traffic congestion and the tentative nature of their intentions in respect of parking meters. The Minister said that, if desired, he would submit in due course his detailed plans for introducing parking meters in particular areas where they would form part of a coherent plan of traffic control.The Cabinet were informed that the proposal to include these provisions in the Road Traffic Bill had been approved bya Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committee and had alreadybeen announced by the former Minister of Transport in the Houseof Commons on 23rd June, 1954.The Lord President said that he was apprehensive about theseproposals, which might well prove unpopular and might in practicepenalise the resident of central London who wished to park his carfor short periods for entirely legitimate purposes, while leaving thevisitor from outside who wished to park.his car for the whole daylargely immune from the proposed parking charges. It seemed likely that, unless these meters were installed on a large scale, theproblem of congestion would merely be transferred from one area toanother. He had therefore doubted whether the Government wouldbe justified in including these particular provisions in road trafficlegislation until there was a clearer comprehensive plan covering allthe various means of reducing traffic congestion. If the cabinet should decide to include these provisions in the Bill in order thatexperiments might be made, he hoped that the tentative nature of theGovernment^ intentions would be made clear to Parliament and thepublic.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Governmentwould be justified in including these provisions in the Bill in order thatexperiments might be made to test the value of parking meters in reducing traffic congestion. It should be made clear that they werenot committed even in principle to the permanent use of parkingmeters, and that they would welcome free discussion of theiradvantages and disadvantages both in Parliament and among thepublic.The following further points were raised in the course ofdiscussion:  (a) It was suggested that greater use might be made of parts ofthe Royal Parks for the parking of motor vehicles. As against this, itwas pointed out that the use of open spaces in the Parks for thispurpose would be resented by members of the general public andthat, generally speaking, the Parks were too far distant from places of employment to serve the purposes of those who brought their carsdaily to London.
commonwealth relations.(previous reference:C.C.(53)26thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum-, by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 307) submitting the conclusions oLa Cabinet Committee appointed on 14th April, 1953, to consider what status should be accorded in future to Colonial territories which,on attaining full independence, desired to remain within, theCommonwealth.In a preliminary discussion it was agreed that the policy of theUnited Kingdom Government on this question ought to be settledbefore the opening of the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers in London, so that Ministers might be able to take that opportunity for informal discussion of this problem with someof the Prime Ministers attending that Meeting. The subject was,however, one of great importance and could with advantage bediscussed at a special meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Agreed   to   consider   the   Commonwealth   Secretary&apos;smemorandum (C. (54) 307) at a special meeting in thefollowing week.Sudan.compensation and pensions for Officials.&apos; (previous reference:C.C. (54) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 370) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (54) 371) about the compensation and pensions payable to british officials in consequence of the interruption of their careers in theSudan.The Foreign Secretary said that, under the Anglo-Egyptianagreement on the Sudan, the Governor-General had a special responsibility to ensure equitable treatment for members of the SudanService. In the uncertainty created by the constitutional changes which were taking place in the Sudan, many British officials had beeninclined to leave the Sudan before the end of the interim period before the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium came to an end. In his negotiations with representatives of the British officials, the Governor-General had given assurances which pledged him to securecompensation on a higher scale than was provided by the legislation(b) The proposal for the introduction of parking meters had originally been linked with the plan for constructing undergroundgarages in some of London&apos;s principal squares. The Governmentwere not, however, committed to the construction of theseunderground garages, which appeared to be open to serious objectionsnot only on financial grounds but also from the point of view ofamenities.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the plans of theMinistry of Transport contemplated the building of garages aboveground as well as under ground, and that the surplus revenue fromparking meters would provide a valuable means of encouraging thebuilding of such garages.(c) If parking meters should come to be used on any substantial scale, it would be important to pay due regard to the effect whichthey would have upon the amenities of London&apos;s streets and squares.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Road Traffic Bill should include provisionsdesigned to enable experiments with parking meters to becarried out.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to submit to the PrimeMinister the draft of the statement on parking meterswhich would be made by the Government spokesman inthe debate on the Second Reading of the Bill in the Houseof Lords.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to bring before hiscolleagues in due course his proposals for the experimentalintroduction of parking meters.
which the Sudanese Parliament had since, enacted. In this difficult situation the, &quot;Governor-General had suggested. that the UnitedKingdom Government should accept responsibility for meeting thedifference, at&apos;a total cost of  140,000. The Governor-Generalconsidered that his honour was involved and he might well resign if his suggestion was rejected. This.,would put the Government in an embarrassing position. The Foreign Secretary therefore hoped thathis colleagues would agree that -the Governor-General might beauthorised to inform the British officials that means would be found of bringing their compensation into line with the pledges which hehad given to them.As regards the security of these pensions, the only point nowoutstanding was the risk that the Sudan Government might defaultduring, the interim period before the Anglo-Egyptian Condominiumcame to an end. On this he proposed that the Governor-general should be authorised to tell the British officials that they could restassured that the United Kingdom Government would, if the need arose, seek the approval of Parliament for measures to guaranteethem their pensions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governor-general had only himself to blame for the position in which he now found himself. His handling of the negotiations had been most unsatis-factory, and he had plainly exceeded his authority. Nevertheless itwas now necessary to find a solution which would not embarrass usin relation to compensation claims for British officials elsewhere. Hesuggested that the powers enjoyed by the Governor-General underArticle 88 of the Anglo-Egyptian Statute for the Sudan might befound to provide a satisfactory safeguard in the event of the sudan government defaulting on the payment of pensions to british officials. The difficulties of supplementing the compensation.payable by the Sudan Government were more complex and he would wishto consider further how this could be done without creating an embarrassing precedent.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Circumstances in the Sudan differed in certain respects fromthose in Colonial territories. The Governor-General was not responsible solely to the United Kingdom Government, nor were british officials in the Sudan employed by the Crown.(b) It should be borne in mind that any assurances which mightbe given to British officials in the Sudan regarding the security oftheir pensions were likely to become known to British officials in theGold Coast and Nigeria.(c) Consideration should be given to the possibility ofestablishing a special fund from which payments might be madeex gratia to former British officials in the Sudan on grounds of specialhardship.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, to,.,        re-consider the questions raised in C. (54) 370 and 371 in theJ ;&apos;;* light of the Cabinefs discussion.
