1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of Stateand the Minister of Defence (C. (54) 187 and 206) on the resumptionof the defence negotiations with Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that the main points of the proposed new approach to the Egyptians were summarised in paragraph 8 ofC. (54) 187. The essence of the plan was that we should reduce sub-stantially the scope of our Base in the Canal Zone and should be content to have it maintained in peace by civil technicians. In returnwe could press for an agreement of longer duration:. we might begin by asking for twenty years, and might accept twelve years or even ten.And, as we would now propose to remove much more equipment from the Base, we must stipulate that the withdrawal of Britishtroops from the Canal Zone would be spread over two years insteadof fifteen months. Draft Heads of an Agreement had been prepared in accordance with the proposals in C. (54) 187 and 206, and copiesof these were circulated at the meeting.The Minister of Defence said that the minimum military require-ments in the Canal Zone were summarised in C. (54) 206. TheService authorities were now prepared to accept the disadvantages of having the Base maintained by civil technicians in peace. this meant, however, that a larger quantity of stores and equipment wouldhave to be removed from the Base,, and this process could not becompleted in less than two years. Although there would be militaryadvantage in securing an agreement of longer duration than seven years, it was more important that the evacuation period should notbe reduced below two years.In discussion the following particular points were made:  (a) Was it certain that civil technicians would be available tomaintain the Base in peace?The Cabinet were informed that this problem had been discussed with some leading British contractors who were satisfied that theycould accept a contract and provide the labour required though they were not anxious to undertake the responsibility and consideredthat this method of maintaining the Base would be neithereconomical nor efficient.(b) The Cabinet were reminded of the military advantages of transferring the Headquarters organisation of the British forces inthe Middle East from the Canal Zone to Cyprus It was important that this move should be carried out as soon as it could be done without weakening our bargaining position in the defence negotia-tions with Egypt. There was some risk of premature disclosure ofour intentions in the Press and the Foreign Office and Ministry ofDefence might with advantage prepare an official announcement, tobe held in readiness for immediate issue if need arose.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as soon as thedefence negotiations were resumed, he would wish to be free toremove the existing restriction limiting the right of the Egyptians todraw on their sterling balances within the limits of the SterlingReleases Agreement. He hoped that this restriction could beremoved before the end of the summer.(d) On 28th January the Cabinet had asked the Foreign Officeand Ministry of Transport to keep under review the timing of further representations to the United States Government regarding theproposal that the maritime Powers should jointly seek from theEgyptian Government firmer guarantees regarding the freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal. The Minister of Transport was proposing to ask the Cabinet to consider this question again inrelation to the proposed resumption of negotiations for a defence agreement with Egypt.46406-3 b 2EgyptDefenceNegotiations.(previous reference:CC. (54) 33rdConclusions,Minute 7).
The Cabinefs main discussion turned on the manner in whichthe United States might be associated with the proposed defence agreement with Egypt and on the question whether, before the forth-coming discussions in Washington, any intimation should be givento the Egyptians of our readiness to resume the defence negotiations.The Prime Minister said that, while he accepted the militaryargument for redeploying our forces in the Middle East, he con-tinued to be impressed by the political disadvantages of abandoning the position which we had held in Egypt since 1882. This was boundto be deplored by certain sections of Conservative opinion, and the resulting political situation would not be made easier by the develop-ments which were taking place in the Sudan. He believed that our withdrawal from Egypt could be made more palatable to publicopinion in this country if it could be presented as a part of a com-prehensive Anglo-American plan for building up a defensive frontagainst Communist aggression throughout the world. He hoped thatthe forthcoming talks in Washington might result in a declarationforeshadowing the creation of a collective defence system in South-East Asia which would displace, or at least reduce the importanceof, the ANZUS Pact, from which the United Kingdom had been excluded. Such a development would be welcomed by those sectionsof public opinion in this country which would be most disturbed bythe surrender of our position in Egypt. A close Anglo-Americanassociation in the Middle East, parallel with that created in the atlantic and proposed for South-East Asia, would help to mitigate the political effects of our proposed withdrawal from Egypt.Finally, he considered that our willingness to conclude a defence agreement with Egypt would be a useful bargaining counter in theforthcoming talks in Washington. He did not wish to be committed to resuming the negotiations before he had explored in those talksthe extent to which the United States could be persuaded to support us in the negotiations, or even to be associated with us in them.The Foreign Secretary said that he was doubtful whether the americans would be willing to join us in the proposed negotiationswith Egypt or, for that matter, whether their direct association withthe negotiations would make it easier to reach a satisfactory agree-ment. Their influence with the countries of the Middle East wasnot greater than ours: indeed, our own influence in the Middle Eastas a whole might be damaged if we seemed to be unable to settleour differences with Egypt without American help. The air stagingfacilities which we hoped to secure in the Canal Zone would certainly be of value to the Americans as well as to us; but there were political advantages in retaining sole rights to these and making them avail-able to the Americans on request. For these reasons he would prefer that American support for our new approach to Egypt should takethe form of: (i) strong public approval of our new proposals;(ii) some link between our new defence agreement and their economicand financial aid to Egypt: and (hi) public endorsement at theappropriate stage of the clause in the agreement relating to freedomof navigation through the Suez Canal. In these circumstances hethought it would be wise if, before he left for Washington, he gave the Egyptians some reason to expect that the defence negotiations would be resumed after his return. He feared that, if he delayed thisuntil after his return, it would be said that we had resumed thenegotiations at the behest of the United States Government. Thiswould weaken his bargaining position with the Egyptians and wouldalso cause some political embarrassment in the House of Commons.The Prime Minister said that, while he agreed that american support in the defence negotiations with Egypt might take the formsuggested by the Foreign Secretary, he still believed that sometactical advantage would be lost in the forthcoming discussions in washington if it were known at the outset that we were now readyto resume those negotiation^.   He would prefer to keep this issue
Indo-China. 2. The Cabinet had before them (i) a report by the Chiefs of(Previous Staff (D. (54) 26) on the Five-Power Military Conference in Washing-Reference: ton on the current military problems in South-East Asia; and (ii) aC.C. (54) 42nd memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (54) 207) defining theConclusions, the stage reached in the Geneva Conference and outlining the aimsMinute 1). to be pursued in the forthcoming talks in Washington on the problemsof Indo-China and South-East Asia.The Foreign Secretary said that the latest developments atGeneva had confirmed him in his view that a negotiated settlementof the Indo-China problem was not beyond reach. He had been particularly interested in the further light thrown on the Chineseattitude by the report of the Canadian Ambassador, GeneralRonning, on his latest talk with Mr. Chou En-lai (C. (54) 205). Theprospects of a settlement would, however, be seriously damaged ifpremature steps were taken to set up some form of South-East AsiaTreaty Organisation. Nor were we likely to carry the principal asian countries with us in this if we proceeded precipitately to a public discussion at which they were not represented. We could, however,expect the Americans to press for early action to establish such a, pact,and it would no doubt be necessary to discuss with them the different forms which this might take. Should it be a defence organisation onthe lines of the North Atlantic Alliance, N.A.T.O., or a pact of the open until the whole field of Anglo-American co-operation had beenexplored in the Washington talks.The Foreign Secretary said that he would consider whether hispurpose could be equally met by intimating to the Egyptian Govern-ment, before he left for Washington, that he had noted their efforts to maintain order in the Canal Zone and that he hoped that con-ditions there would continue to improve for, as they had alreadybeen informed, the defence negotiations could not be resumed whileconditions of disorder prevailed in the Zone.In further discussion of the presentation of the proposed defence agreement with Egypt, the point was made that our strategic needs in the Middle East had been radically changed by the developmentof thermo-nuclear weapons. This development would of itself have led us to review the expediency of maintaining so large a concentra-tion of stores, equipment and men within the narrow confines of the canal Zone. Our withdrawal from Egypt could be presented aspart of a redeployment of our forces in the Middle East based on areassessment of our essential strategic needs in that area.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals outlined in C. (54) 187 and 206 fora new approach to the conclusion of a defence agreementwith Egypt.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister and the Foreign secretary would adopt the draft Heads of Agreement circulated atthe meeting as a basis for their forthcoming discussions in washington on the resumption of the defence negotiationswith Egypt; and that they would seek to enlist american support, on the lines which the Foreign Secretary had indicated, for the new approach which we proposed tomake to the Egyptian Government.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion whether, before leaving for Washington, he should make any communication tothe Egyptian Government with reference to the defence negotiations, and would consult with the Prime minister on the terms of such a communication.
Atomic Energy.. 3. The Lord President recalled that when President EisenhowerAtomic Bank had put forward his plan for an international pool of uranium forPlan. the development of the civil use of atomic energy, we had expressedour readiness to join in it if it commanded the support of all thecountries concerned. The Soviet Government had now declined toco-operate in the scheme, and the question arose whether the othercountries should go forward without them. There seemed to be some divergence of view on this question between various agencies of the United States Government. We ourselves had supported theplan primarily as a means of bringing about an international atomicagreement which would include the Russians. It was therefore suggested that we should discourage the Americans from going for-ward with it but that, if they decided to do so, we should not withdrawpur support.The Foreign Secretary said that we had supported this planbecause we had felt that the international advantages which would accrue to us if the Russians also accepted it would outweigh thefinancial disadvantages of accepting membership of the pool.Politically it was important that it should remain open to Russia toaccept participation in the plan, but until Russia became a memberit seemed preferable that we should retain our freedom of action. Inpresent circumstances there seemed little point in losing a number of potential customers who, if we were not members of an internationalpool, might come to us for supplies of fissile material.Locarno type? This would turn on the question whether an agree-ment had been reached at Geneva. But the two types of pact werenot mutually exclusive. In Asia, as in Europe, there might still beneed of a collective defence organisation, even if a Locarno agreement were reached.It would also be necessary to consider with the Americans theproblems of partition in Indo-China. The Foreign Secretary hopedthat a solution might be found on the basis of excluding from Com-munist control the southern region of Viet Nam, including Saigon,as well as Laos and Cambodia. The French were, however, disposed to ask a high price for Haiphong before they would consider with-drawal to a region in the south. The Americans were specially con-cerned to secure the retention of Haiphong as a base from which further action might later be taken.The Prime Minister said that we should not underrate the sweep-ing effect which another military disaster in Indo-China was likely tohave on American public opinion.In discussion it was pointed out that, thanks to the foreign secretary&apos;s efforts, the Communists&apos; attempt to rally Eastern opinion to their cause under the slogan of &quot; Asia for the Asians &quot; had been checked. We should continue to foster the co-operation of the colombo powers in seeking a solution of the problems of Indo-Chinaand South-East Asia generally. Burma&apos;s co-operation and herinfluence on India were particularly important.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report of the Chiefs of Staff (D. (54) 26) onthe Five-Power Military Conference on the currentmilitary problems in South-East Asia.(2) Endorsed the proposals made by the Foreign Secretary inparagraph 4 of C. (54) 207, regarding the line to be takenin the Washington talks on the problems of Indo-Chinaand South-East Asia.
The Cabinet-Agreed that it would not be in our interests to participate in the Atomic Bank Plan unless Russia was also a member,and invited the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary,in their forthcoming talks in Washington, to urge the UnitedStates authorities not to proceed further With this planwithout Russian co-operation.East-West 4.   The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the inter-Trade, national discussions on the control over the export of strategic goods(Previous        to countries in the Soviet bloc, agreement had been reached that a reference:      number of items could be removed from the embargo list. Mr. StassenCC. (54) 22nd had now suggested, however, that this agreement should not be putConclusions,    into operation until the situation in Indo-China became clear.  the minute 3).      President said that these negotiations were not concerned with tradewith China, and he was most reluctant to agree that relaxation ofthe restrictions on trade with the Soviet bloc should be linked with developments in Indo-China or at the Geneva Conference. He hopedthat the Cabinet would authorise him to oppose this suggestion forindefinite postponement of the relaxations on which agreement hadbeen reached.The Foreign Secretary supported the view expressed by thePresident of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal that the agreed relaxations of therestrictions on trade with countries in the Soviet blocshould be brought into operation without reference to thesituation in Indo-China or to the course of the geneva conference.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to concert withthe Foreign Secretary the terms of the reply to be sentto the United States Government on this point.Residence of 5.   The Home Secretary said that he had now considered theForeigners in representations made to him on behalf of Dr. Joseph Cort by twothe United deputations of Labour Members of Parliament. He was satisfied that,Kingdom. for the reasons which he had explained to the Cabinet on 15th June,Dr. Joseph he must maintain his decision to refuse Dr. Corfs application forCort. permission to prolong his stay in the United Kingdom. He recognised(Previous        that this might be misinterpreted by liberal opinion in this country.Reference:      But he could not accept the argument that Dr. Cort was entitled to. (54) 40th claim political ayslum here without implying that the United StatesConclusions,    Administration were allowing their military service law to be usedMinute 6).      for the purpose of furthering a political persecution of Dr. Cort. Evenif that were true, it could hardly be made the basis of official action by the United Kingdom Government without serious damage toAnglo-American relations.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.Parliament. 6.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped it would be possible to conclude the Committee stage of the Finance Bill by 7 p.m. on29th June, which would be the eighth day spent in Committee on the
Bill. He suggested that, if necessary, recourse should be had to the closure for this purpose. So long as Members were satisfied thatthere was no possibility of the closure being applied, they had no incentive to restrict the length of their speeches.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had never used the closure in proceedings on Finance Bills and he doubted whetherits use would expedite the proceedings on this Bill. He was, however,ready to do all he could to meet the Lord Privy seal&apos;s request and hewould try to come to some arrangement with the Opposition whichwould enable the Committee stage of the Bill to be concluded by thetime suggested.The Lord Privy Seal said that it had seemed advisable to defer the promised debate on the Crichel Down Report until after thePrime Minister^ return from Washington. If, however, the Govern-ment should find it impossible to resist pressure for a debate on theReport in the following week, it would be necessary to use for thispurpose one of the days which would otherwise be given to the mines and Quarries Bill.7. The Cabinet considered a draft statement on Members&apos;expenses which had been prepared in pursuance of the decision reached at their meeting on 21st June.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to add to the draft statement the two paragraphs about the salaries of junior Ministers and pensions for Members which had been includedin the draft statement in Annex A to C (54) 201. It would, in his view, be right to show the draft statement to the Opposition Leaders,as an act of courtesy, a short time before it was made in the Houseof Commons.The Cabinet expressed general approval of the draft statement,subject to amendment of the last paragraph by the substitution of&quot; we should be prepared &quot; for &quot; we propose &quot; and the omission ofthe concluding words &quot; in the hope of achieving a wider measure ofagreement than at present seems possible.&quot; They also approved theaddition to the draft of the proposed paragraphs about junior ministers&apos; salaries and Members&apos; pensions.The Cabinet Approved the draft statement before them, subject to the amendments and additions recorded above, and took note that the statement would be made by the Prime Minister inthe House of Commons on 24th June.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:C.C.
