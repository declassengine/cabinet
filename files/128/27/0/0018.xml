1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 99 and 102) suggesting a new approach to a defence agreement with Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that in the middle of 1953 theEgyptian Government had rejected the proposal that the Base in the canal Zone should be made available in the event of a threat of aggression against Turkey or Persia. In the following October wehad suggested to them the United Nations formula, which they had also rejected. They had now indicated that they would be willingto agree that we should be free to re-enter upon the Base in the eventof a threat of aggression against Turkey. This was an important con-cession, not only because of the geographical position of Turkey, but because Turkey was herself a member of the North Atlantic treaty organisation. There was, therefore, now only one outstanding issueviz., the status of the British technicians in the Base and their rightto wear uniform and carry personal arms. The Egyptian Govern-ment might at any moment make it publicly known that they wereprepared to accept our views on the availability of the Base and thatthe sole remaining issue was the wearing of uniforms. This would put us in an embarrassing position; for to many sections of opinion,in this country and abroad, it would seem unreasonable that weshould decline on that ground alone to conclude an agreement. TheForeign Secretary said that in these circumstances he had once againreviewed the expediency of leaving in the Base 4,000 British soldiers,decreasing in numbers over a period of years. Whatever was agreedabout their status, these men would in fact be hostages to fortune.He had therefore put forward, for the Cabinefs consideration, thealternative that the essential Base installations might be maintained by civilian contract labour. If this were found to be a practicable alternative, he would first instruct Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in cairo to make it clear to General Neguib that he must take thenecessary steps to restore confidence before there could be anydefence agreement. The Egyptian Government must, in particular,undertake to observe the terms and the spirit of the Anglo-EgyptianAgreement on the Sudan and contribute to the orderly transfer of power in the Sudan by using their influence to ensure that the balance in the Governor-General&apos;s Commission was not upset. They must also refrain from unbridled attacks on Britain and on British public servants in the Sudan. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador would explain that, if General Neguib took the necessary action to secure this, we might be willing to conclude a defence agreement on the terms suggested, i.e., that key installations and airfields in the Base shouldbe maintained by civil contractors and that no British soldiers would remain there as technicians. In return for this concession, we should ask that the agreement should last for twenty years instead of seven,and that a rather longer time, probably two years, should be allowed for the withdrawal of all British troops.In discussion of this proposal the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Defence said that, from the military angle,there would be no practical objection to the employment of civil con-tractors for the maintenance of the Base installations and airfields.A similar system had been adopted with success in Libya. It would,however, be advisable to retain the right to send military inspectorsto the Base at intervals to ensure that all was in order: these need notnecessarily wear uniform.(b) Care would be needed in drawing up the terms of theproposed contracts so as to ensure that the Egyptians accepted dueresponsibility for the care and maintenance of the Base, and did not interfere unreasonably with the work of the contractors.(c) Under our original proposals the position of the british military technicians in the Base would have been anomalous and unsatisfactory. Though it would have been convenient, in presenting the plan to some sections of opinion in this country, to stress the factthat these would be soldiers, they would in fact have had no military-1 B 2
value; and, as their numbers declined under the terms of the proposed agreement, they would have become hostages to fortune. From thispoint of view we should perhaps be on surer ground if we couldabandon the pretence that these technicians were a military force.There was more realism in the new proposal that the Base should bemaintained by civilian contractors.(d) The view was expressed that men employed by civilcontractors in the Base might be treated with less respect than militarytechnicians and that, if no British troops remained there,the Egyptians would make less effort to maintain the Base in good order. Against this it was argued that it was in the Egyptian interest that the Base should remain efficient. In this connection thesuggestion was made that, if it could be arranged that American asweii as British civil contractors should take charge of installations,this would be a powerful guarantee that the Base would be properlycared for and would also have considerable political value.(e). The new proposal would enable us to remove all our troops from Egypt. This would reduce our overseas military expenditure,and would enable us to re-deploy our forces in the Middle East tobetter advantage. Moreover, on the new basis, we might hope tosecure an agreement valid for twenty years instead of seven. And theprovision for re-entry into the Base in the event of a threat of aggression against Turkey would be of particular value in linking theagreement with the North Atlantic Alliance.(/) On the other hand, Ministers recognised that it might not be easy to justify to their supporters an agreement on the lines now suggested. Involving, as it did, the withdrawal of all British troops from Egypt, this could easily be represented as a complete surrender to the more extreme demands of the Egyptian Government. If, there-fore, it were decided to go forward with this plan, its timing and presentation would need very careful consideration.(g) In particular, it would be necessary to satisfy public opinion in this country that adequate safeguards were being provided forthe right of international passage through the Suez Canal. Thesuggestion was made that appropriate provisions on this point mightbe included in the body of the new agreement. The Foreign Secretarypointed out that it would hardly be practicable to include bindingprovisions on this point in a bilateral agreement between ourselves and Egypt, since the subject was of close concern to a great numberof maritime Powers, all of whom were parties to the original suez canal Agreement. It was admitted that the declaration about the canal which the Egyptians had agreed to include in the preamblewould, as a matter of law, impose on them a binding obligation.(h) Whatever agreement was made with Egypt, we needed to re-deploy British forces in the Middle East in such a way as toenable us to maintain our prestige in that area and to exert effectivepower if Egypt failed to keep the agreement. Present planscontemplated the stationing of an armoured brigade in Libya, a brigade in Cyprus and, possibly, a brigade in Jordan. If a situationarose necessitating the re-entry into the Canal Zone by force,reinforcements would have to be sent from elsewhere.The Prime Minister said that he felt great anxiety about the new proposal now put forward, both on its merits and because of thepolitical criticism which it seemed likely to arouse. It was an essential part of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal that confidence should be restored before any new defence agreement was concluded, andGeneral Neguib was to be asked to give assurances of his goodintentions. He himself found it difficult to repose any confidence inany promises which General Neguib might be induced to make. TheEgyptian Government had in fact already undertaken, in the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement on the Sudan, to do the very things we should now be asking them to do as the price for a defence agreement.General Neguib himself was in no position to give satisfactoryguarantees about the Sudan. The main sources of his power inEgypt were (i) the fact that his mother was Sudanese and that the
141 CC. 18 (54)Egyptians expected him to bring the Sudan under Egyptian control,and (ii) the expectation that he would drive the British out of the canal Zone and bring the Sudan Under exclusively Egyptian influence.Although it was true that the question of uniform was not a goodissue on which to break off the negotiations, it was a point of practical importance. If British soldiers employed as technicians in the Basewere accorded the status of soldiers, that was some physical guarantee that the Base would not be neglected and an assurance that the egyptians could not ill-use them without affording us an amplejustification for intervening to protect them. If that physicalguarantee were removed, nothing would be left but verbal promiseson which it would be folly to rely. It would, no doubt, be easier and less costly to abandon both Egypt and the Sudan, but that would notbe the end of our troubles. If Egypt were free to do as she pleased inthe Sudan, there would almost certainly be a civil war from which wecould not stand aside. It would be small consolation to point to the longer duration of the new agreement, since it was only too likely thatthere would be continuing causes for friction and finally for therepudiation of the agreement by Egypt. He was anxious to startmoving some troops away from the Canal Zone as soon as possible,but we must first find some more solid and effective guarantees forthe independence of the Sudan.The Prime Minister therefore invited the Cabinet to consider,as an alternative policy, the possibility of launching a programme ofpositive action. Thus, we might break off the defence negotiations and embark on a definite plan of re-deployment. An armoured brigade could be sent at once from the Canal Zone to Libya. a brigade could be sent to Khartoum in order to demonstrate in apractical manner our determination to ensure the independence ofthe Sudanese and to protect them from Egyptian interference. Thetroops remaining in Egypt could be re-deployed in the manner best calculated to ensure their safety. Meanwhile we should do our utmost to promote effective multi-lateral action by the maritimePowers to assure the right of international passage through the Canal.He would like to examine a plan of this kind in greater detail withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he would be ready toconsider an alternative policy on these lines, he was not convincedthat the arrival of a British brigade in Khartoum would be welcomed by any of the political parties in the Sudan. There was at themoment no real justification for such a move, although there mightbe if the Governor-General found it necessary to declare a constitutional emergency.The Foreign Secretary added that he had been impressed by thesuggestion made in the discussion that we might associate Americancivil contractors in the care of the Base installations. He would liketo put this to the United States Ambassador in London and ascertainhis views. He would explain that, so long as the responsibility for safeguarding the Base rested on British troops, we should have to insist that their military status should be adequately safeguarded.We would, however, be prepared to consider the alternativeproposition that the maintenance of the Base in peace should beentrusted to a civilian organisation if the Americans were preparedto share that responsibility with us. In that event, all British military personnel could be withdrawn from Egypt, though some arrange-ment would need to be made for British military inspectors to visit the Base in plain clothes from time to time in order to verify thatthe installations and equipment were being maintained in good order.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a further meeting.(2) Took note that in the meantime the Foreign Secretary would consult informally with the United States ambassador in London on the suggestion that the maintenance of the
2. The Minister of State said that it was evident, from therecent demonstrations in Khartoum, that the Egyptians had pushedtoo far their intervention in the domestic affairs of the Sudan, andthe resulting situation was one which we might be able to turn toour advantage. We should continue to press the demands which wehad made on the Sudan Government about the balance of repre-sentation on the Governor-GeneraFs Commission, the support ofBritish officials and the curbing of Egyptian interference in theinternal affairs of the Sudan; and, if those demands were not adequately met, the Governor-General should declare a state of constitutional emergency. That being our policy, it was important that we should have our plans ready for the action which we shouldhave to take if a constitutional emergency was declared.In all this, much would depend on the British officials in theSudan. Their morale had been shaken by recent events; and it was urgently necessary that some further steps should be taken to allaytheir anxieties about their future. They were asking that a definitedate should now be fixed on which their existing contracts of service would be terminated and those who wished to leave would become entitled to pension and compensation, while those willing to remainwould enter into new contracts with the Sudan Government. TheTreasury had hitherto taken the view that this must await the out-come of negotiations with the Sudan Government, who would con-tinue to be responsible for the payment of compensation and pensions: they were naturally anxious that nothing should be said which might encourage the Sudan Government to default on its obligations. In present circumstances, however, it seemed to him that some risks must be taken; and it would be very valuable if itcould now be made known that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be ready to make interim payments under the scheme nowunder discussion pending the outcome of the necessary negotiationswith the Sudan Government.The Minister of Defence said that the Commanders-in-Chief,Middle East, had asked whether they still had authority to sendreinforcements to the Sudan at the request of the Governor-General.The Cabinet confirmed that this authority still held good.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider whether any further assurances could be givento British officials in the Sudan about the payment oftheir pensions and compensation.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to inform the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, that until they received instructionsto the contrary they were authorised to put into operation,at the request of the Governor-General, the approvedplans for sending reinforcements to the Sudan.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 96) outlining, as a basis forconsideration by the Cabinet, possible means of affording financialrelief to Members of Parliament alternative to those proposed in theReport of the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses.In the course of a preliminary discussion there was general agree-ment that the weight of Conservative opinion, in Parliament and inthe country, was Strongly against the Select Committee&apos;s proposalSudan.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 16thConclusions.)Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)Base installations in the Canal Zone might be undertaken in peace by; an Anglo-American civilian organisation;and that the Prime Minister would discuss further withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence thealternative policy of re-deployment which he had suggested in the discussion.
143 CX. 18 (54)that Members&apos; salaries should be raised from  1,000 to  1,500 a year.It was possible that there would be similar criticism of the alternative proposal, outlined in C. (54) 96, for reimbursing Members&apos; expensesup to a maximum of  400 a year a proposal which, however it was presented, would be seen to have the same practical, effect asincreasing the salary to  1,400 a year. The Cabinet were thereforedisposed to favour the alternative method of giving Members further help in subsistence or in kind, on the general lines indicated inparagraph 12 of C. (54) 96. Of the possibilities there indicated, theyfavoured the payment of subsistence allowances and the provision of free postal, telegraph and telephone facilities from the Palace of westminster; but some doubts were expressed about the expediency of providing a pool of secretaries at Westminster.On the tactics for handling Parliamentary discussion of thisquestion, the Cabinet recognised the importance of forcing theOpposition to take their fair share of responsibility for any changethat might be made. From this point of view it was desirable thatthe Government should decline to bring forward proposals of theirown until there had been an opportunity for Members to express theiropinions in debate. And it was desirable that this debate should notbe followed by a division. It could be held on the adjournment or in committee of Supply, and the Opposition should be left to take theinitiative in raising it.The Cabinet Agreed that Government policy on the Report of the SelectCommittee on Members&apos; Expenses could best be formulated in the light of the views expressed in a debate in the Houseof Commons; and that it should be suggested to theOpposition, through the usual channels, that they shouldinitiate such a debate on some occasion when it would not lead to a division.Farm Price 4.   The Minister of Agriculture said that discussions with repre-Review. sentatives of the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.Us.) on the annual(Previous        review of farm prices had now reached a stage at which agreementReference:      could be reached on a schedule of prices which would represent aC.C. (54) 12th   saving to the Exchequer of  23 - 75 millions in 1954 or, if account were conclusions,    taken of a further  7 millions accruing in the following financial year,Minute 3.)        30 - 75 millions. This fell short, by  2-4 millions, of the saving whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had hoped to secure in the coming financial year.  The farmers&apos; representatives claimed, however, thatit was equivalent to a reduction of  55 millions a year in farmers&apos;gross incomes; and, although their methods of calculation were opento argument, it would be politically difficult to challenge this claim in public discussion.   Experience had shown the great advantage ofsecuring an agreed solution which the N.F.Us. would be prepared todefend to the farmers; and in all the circumstances he recommended the Cabinet to authorise him to conclude an agreement on the basisof the total figure which he had mentioned.The Cabinet discussed in turn the prices proposed for thefollowing commodities: -(a) Milk. The N.F.Us. were unwilling to accept a reduction ofmore than Id. a gallon in milk. There was general agreement in theCabinet that a larger reduction would be justified. There was great danger that, at the price now proposed, there would be an embarrassing surplus of milk in the coming year. In view of the large stocks of condensed milk and dried milk already held by the Ministryof Food, manufacturers would be reluctant to accept any more of thesurplus not required for liquid consumption. And there was a real risk that the Government might be called upon to pay for surplus
The general conclusion of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion was that financial and economic considerations justified larger reductions infarm prices than the representatives of the N.F.Us. were prepared toaccept. Politically, however, there was much to be said for reaching agreement with the N.F.Us. on a schedule for farm prices. Fromthe point of view of encouraging home food production and avoidingcontroversy, an agreed solution would be more valuable than an exchequer saving of  2 or  3 millions. At the same time, the N.F.Us.should be given a clear warning that, if the farmers were to retain the confidence of the tax-payers, they must be ready in future years to co-operate with the Government in securing a more substantial reduction in the total of Government subsidies to food producers.They should also be warned of the serious consequences of surplusproduction of milk; and they should on that account be pressed most strongly to accept a reduction of \\d. a gallon in milk prices for 1954.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to make a determinedfurther effort to persuade the representatives of theN.F.Us. to accept a reduction of \\d. a gallon in milk,prices for 1954; but authorised him in the last resort toaccept a reduction of a la?, a gallon if it became clear thatinsistence on the additional id. would exclude allpossibility of reaching an agreed solution with theN.F.Us.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals outlined by the Minister of Agriculture for fixing the levels of guarantees on farm produce in the 1954 reviewof prices.Persia- 5.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the stage(Previous reached in the negotiations between the oil companies on the reference: constitution of the proposed consortium to undertake the productionC.C. (54) 10th   and marketing of Persian oil.Conclusions, The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) were aiming to minute 3.) obtain compensation for the loss of their undertaking through (i) thepayments made to them by the other companies for their share inthe consortium, and (ii) the receipt of free oil from the PersianGovernment. On the first point the Company had proposed paymentpartly in cash and partly in annual instalments over twenty years.The American companies, while ready to accept the instalmentsmilk which was not needed either for immediate consumption or for manufacturing. If this situation developed there would be an evenbigger scandal next year over milk than there had been this year over eggs.(b) Eggs. The existing support price for eggs had cost theExchequer over  30 millions in 1953. The N.F.Us. were insisting thatthe support price should continue unchanged at 45. a dozen, butthey were prepared to accept new methods of operating the schemeand a link with feeding-stuffs prices which, in the opinion of theMinister of Agriculture, would have the effect of reducing theExchequer cost of the support price by Id. a dozen. The Ministerestimated that, if these different methods had been in force in 1953,the cost to the Exchequer would have been less by about  5-3,- millions.(c) Pigs. Ministers had proposed a reduction of 45. 3d. perscore, but the N.F.Us. were unwilling to accept any larger reductionthan 35. They justified this mainly on the ground that the freemarketing of pigs would in future involve the farmers in paying trans-port costs which had hitherto been borne by the Ministry of Food.
145CC. 18 (54)proposed, were suggesting a cash payment one-fourth the size of that proposed by A.I.O.C. On the second point the Company had suggested that the Persian Government should over twenty years buy110 million tons of oil from the consortium at cost price and give itto A.I.O.C. in compensation. The other companies objected inprinciple to supplying oil to the Persians at cost price, for they thought that this would constitute a dangerous precedent in otheroil-producing countries.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his judgment, A.I.O.C.would have to make some concessions if they were to reach agreementwith other members of the proposed consortium. It was important that agreement should be reached with little further delay: the favourable opportunity for striking a bargain with the Persians mightwell be missed if negotiations were not opened in Tehran in the nearfuture. He proposed to impress this point strongly upon theChairman of A.I.O.C.The Foreign Secretary added that, when these negotiationsopened, the representatives of the various oil companies proposed totake their legal advisers with them to Tehran. A.I.O.C. had in mind that their legal adviser, Sir Hartley Shawcross, M.P., should accompany their representatives to Tehran. The Foreign secretary said that he feared that this might be misunderstood by the Persians,who might be unable to distinguish clearly between Sir hartley shawcross&apos;s private practice as a barrister and his public position asa leading member of the Opposition and a former Minister of theCrown. As it had been agreed that negotiations should at this stage be undertaken by the oil companies alone, without the intervention of Governments, it would probably be preferable that Sir hartley shawcross should not take part in them.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and approved the general line which he proposed to take in his forthcoming interview with the Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th March, 1954.
