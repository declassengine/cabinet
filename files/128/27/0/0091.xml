It was desirable that the White paper should be available to Members as soon as Parliament reassembledafter the forthcoming recess.The Cabinet-Invited the Attorney-General to prepare and submit to theCabinet the draft of a White Paper on the lines suggested.Foreign Service. ... . 2. The Foreign Secretary proposed, with the concurrence of theChancellor of the Exchequer, that the report which the SelectCommittee on Estimates had recently presented on the cost of theForeign Service should be examined during the recess by aCommittee of Junior Ministers representing the Treasury, theForeign Office and the Ministry of Works. It would be convenient if the Cabinet Office would provide secretarial services for thisCommittee.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Foreign  Secretary&apos;proposal.television development(previous reference:C.C. (54) 53rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Postmaster-General (C. (54) 369 and 398) on the composition of the fourth of thecompanies to be appointed as programme contractors by theIndependent Television Authority.The Postmaster-General said that the composition of three ofthe companies to be established for this purpose had already been determined, and in two of these substantial interests were to be heldby proprietors of Conservative newspapers. The promoter of thefourth company had originally intended that newspaper interestsfavouring the other two political Parties should be included in hisgroup but, when this plan miscarried, he had notified his intention tooffer a similar interest in the proposed company to two other news--papers which favoured the Conservative Party. The Chairman ofthe Independent Television Authority had taken the view that, having\ regard to the interests to be held by such newspapers in two of the. other companies, the Authority would not be justified in appointingas programme contractor a fourth company which included nationalnewspaper interests reflecting the same shade of political opinion.The Chairman had already made his view known to the promoter ofthe fourth company but, in view of the political nature of theproblem, he had asked to be assured that the Government were inagreement with the line which be was taking. The Postmaster-General asked for authority to inform him that he would have theGovernment^ support in maintaining the attitude which he had taken up on this point.In discussion it was suggested that it was unreasonable that a conservative Government should be asked to support the authority in excluding from this field newspapers which favoured theConservative cause. ..On the other hand the view was strongly expressed by some ministers that newspaper interests were likely to acquire too largean influence in the companies which were to carry out the functions
of programme contractors. Some of the Ministers who had acceptedwith reluctance the scheme for establishing a television serviceindependent of the B.B.C. said that they would never have supported the project if they had known that it would be dominated by thePress. It would have been preferable that newspapers should not be associated in any way with the independent television programmes.But, if newspaper interests were to be allowed to join the programme companies, it was surely essential to avoid a situation in which Pressrepresentation among the programme companies was confinedexclusively to newspapers supporting the Conservative Party. Thiswas a situation which the Government would find it impossible todefend, in the light of all that had been said in the parlimentary debates about the need for safeguards to secure impartial andobjective control over the independent television programmes.As against this it was argued that the Governmentsresponsibility in this regard was limited to ensuring the impartialityof the Independent Television Authority. It had not been seriouslysuggested that the Authority itself was not impartial. It was, indeed,evident that the Authority was now doing its utmost, in difficultcircumstances, to preserve the principle of impartiality by securing a proper balance of political opinion among the companies to beappointed as programme contractors. So long as it was clear thatthe Authority was endeavouring to preserve such a balance, therewas no occasion for the Government to intervene. Indeed, theappointment of the programme contractors was a matter whollywithin the discretion of the Authority, and it was arguable that theGovernment should not express any opinion on the composition ofthe fourth company.It was the general view of the Cabinet that in these circumstances the Postmaster-General should not offer any further advice orguidance to the Chairman of the Authority on this matter. It should suffice to inform him that this was a matter within the discretion ofthe Authority and that the Minister did not propose to give any direction on the point. In view of the possibility that political controversy would follow if certain newspapers were excluded from participation in this proposed company, it seemed desirable that thereshould be on record a letter to the Chairman of the Authority making it clear that the Government had not influenced his decision. some ministers still felt, however, that the Government should not hesitate to support the Chairman of the Authority in the attitude which hewas proposing to take.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd December, 1954.
