1. The Minister of Labour said that his hopes of a settlementof the dock strike had not so far been realised. The strikers&apos; leadershad demanded that the provisional agreement which he had reportedto the Cabinet on the previous day should apply, not only to London,but to the other ports where men were on strike. To this theemployers could not agree. There had been no dispute aboutovertime in ports other than London, and such local difficulties as there might have been should be discussed through the localnegotiating machinery. Moreover, if a national agreement had beenappropriate, it was important that it should be sought through thenational negotiating machinery, on which the Stevedores&apos; Union wasnot represented. It was not to be assumed, however, that the strike would continue for long. Differences were developing among the strikers&apos; leaders, and it was possible that a general movement backto work might start after the week-end. Meanwhile he recommendedthat no action should be taken with a view to using military labour in the docks.In discussion there was general agreement that no decision touse military labour in the docks should be taken before Monday,1st November. By then it should be possible to judge whether there was any general disposition among the strikers to return towork. If it then appeared that the strike was to, continue, theGovernment would be justified in using military labour to ensurethe maintenance of essential supplies.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour, and agreed that no steps should yet be taken to bring military labour into the docks for the purpose of maintainingessential supplies.(2) Agreed that, if the strike had not ended before then, theyshould meet at 12-30 p.m. on Monday, 1st November,to review the position.industrial disputes.Docks.(previous reference:CC.
