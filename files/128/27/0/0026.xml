Royal Tour. 1.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governors of KenyaUganda. and Uganda and the Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, had reviewed(Previous        the security arrangements for The Queen&apos;s visit to Uganda. &apos; TheyReference:      had concluded that there was some risk that Mau Mau terroristsC.C. (54) 10th   might pass across the frontier into certain areas in Uganda which conclusions,    The Queen was to visit, in view of this the Governor was likely to minute 6.)       recommend that The Queen should not make the visit to Kampalawhich was at present planned.  If this alteration were made in thearrangements now projected, the security risk would be reduced tonegligible proportions.   The Colonial Secretary said that, if theGovernor recommended this change, he would advise Her majesty o accept this modification in the programme of her visit to Uganda.The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to endorse this proposal.The risks attendant on The Queen&apos;s tour should be kept underconstantTeview, and any doubts about security should be immediatelyreported to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Endorsed the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposals for modifying the programme of The Queen&apos;s visit to Uganda.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter recess on15th April and would re-assemble on 27th April.Education.Teachers&apos;Superannuation(previous reference:C.C. (54) 13thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered whether the Second Reading of the teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill should be moved in the House ofCommons before the Easter recess.The Chief Whip said that a small number of government supporters were definitely unwilling to vote in favour of the SecondReading of this Bill and, in addition, there was a rather larger numberwhose attitude was uncertain. In view of the numbers absent throughsickness or other causes, it was doubtful whether the Second reading of the Bill could be carried if it were taken in the following week.The Minister of Education said that, if the Bill were againdeferred, the interests opposing it would renew their pressure,especially at the teachers&apos; conferences which were due to take place at Easter; and the majority of Government supporters who haddefended the Bill against criticism would be seriously discouraged.If the Second Reading could not be taken before Easter, the Govern-ment should at least make plain their intention to proceed with theBill when Parliament re-assembled. The Government would losecredit if they abandoned this measure altogether. For there was an overwhelming case for it on merits, which had been fully recognised in public discussion and in the Press; and it would be evident, ifthe Government abandoned it, that they had given way to pressure from the teachers and from a handful of their supporters in Parlia-ment. Local authorities would also be seriously embarrassed inrespect of other contributory pensions schemes for which they were responsible.In discussion there was general support for the view that theGovernment would find themselves in serious difficulties, bothpolitically and on the merits, if they abandoned the Bill altogether.Some Ministers also believed that, if the Government showeddetermination to go through with the Bill, there was a fair chance46035-2 b 2
that a majority of votes would be cast in favour of it. Any post-ponement might increase the opposition to the Bill: indefinitepostponement would increase it considerably.On the other hand it was argued that this was not a major matterof policy, and that a Government with a narrow majority was fully justified in bringing forward only such legislation as it had areasonable prospect of carrying through Parliament. This mightjustify the Government in abandoning the Bill, now that determined opposition to it had developed. Moreover, there was specialinconvenience in taking the Bill before the Easter recess, now thatthe time-table had been rearranged on account of the time affordedon 5th April for a debate on the hydrogen bomb. If this Bill were taken on 13th April, the Third Reading of the Housing Repairs andRents Bill would have to be taken on the day before the House rosefor the Easter recess. It was important that there should be a goodmajority for that Bill; and it would be dangerous to take it on theday before the House rose, especially if the Government had been defeated, or had narrowly escaped defeat, on the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill on the preceding day.The Cabinefs general conclusion was that the Second reading of the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill should not be taken in theHouse of Commons before the Easter recess, but that furtherconsideration should be given to the question whether the Govern-ment should make plain before the recess their intention to proceedwith the Bill soon after Parliament reassembled. Even if it were decided that this should not be announced formally in the Statementof Business on 15th April, it might be expedient that the Minister ofEducation should let it be known among Government supportersinterested in the Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Second Reading of the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill should not be taken in the House ofCommons before the Easter recess.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider, in consultation withthe Ministers directly concerned, whether any indication of the Government^ intentions regarding this Bill shouldbe given informally to Government supporters specially interested in it, and to report their. conclusions to thePrime Minister.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 134) reporting a proposal by the United StatesGovernment for the formation, of a coalition of interested countries to resist Communist encroachment in South-East Asia and for thepublication by them, before the Geneva Conference, of a declarationwarning China against continuing to aid the Vietminh rebels in indo-China.The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter which he hadreceived from President Eisenhower enlarging upon this proposal and suggesting that Mr. Dulles, the United States Secretary of State,should come to London forthwith to discuss it.The Foreign Secretary said that there would be some solidadvantages in the formation of a coalition of the United States,United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Siam, the philippines and the Associated States of Indo-China. It would remove the anomaly of our exclusion from the ANZUS pact andwould contribute directly to the security of Hong Kong and Malaya,and of the whole area of South-East Asia. He feared, however, thatthe United States Government were less interested in the creation of
7CC. 26 (54)this coalition as a permanent security system than in the declaration with they wished the coalition to make before the geneva conference. This was to take the form of a warning to China that,if she continued to aid the Vietminh rebels, the coalition powers would take naval and air action against the China coast in additionto direct intervention in Indo-China. He doubted whether such a threat would cause China to withdraw aid from the Vietminh. it seemed much more likely to lead to China&apos;s withdrawal from the geneva Conference, and that would be a serious shock to publicopinion in the United Kingdom and France. Moreover, if china were not intimidated by the threat, the coalition would be compelledeither to withdraw ignominiously or to embark on warlike actionagainst China. This would give China every excuse for invokingthe Sino-Soviet treaty, and might lead to a world war. He could not see that there was any military urgency for making a declaration ofthis kind. In three or four weeks&apos; time the rains would start in Indo-China and there could then be no military activity for some months.The French certainly could not lose the war in Indo-China beforethe rains began. He therefore believed that the best course was to try to persuade the Americans to re-shape their plan so that it couldbe made to give security in South-East Asia in the future without endangering the Geneva Conference. He would like Mr. Dulles to visit London early in the following week, and in the meantime hewould work out an alternative plan of action which was not opento the objections applicable to Mr. Dulles&apos; present proposal.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Mr. Dulles had already explained his proposals to theAustralian and New Zealand Ambassadors in Washington. TheAustralian Ambassador had drawn particular attention to Mr. Dulles&apos;insistence that the Americans would not be prepared to give directmilitary assistance in Indo-China unless the United Kingdom were also ready to make a contribution.(b) Careful thought should be given to the form which any military assistance to Indo-China should take. The American Chiefsof Staff were thinking primarily in terms of supporting action by naval and air forces; but, as the New Zealand Prime Minister had pointed out, past experience (e.g., in Korea) suggested that limitedaction of this kind would be only a prelude to intervention by land forces. There was no indication whether the Americans had it inmind that air action in Indo-China, or against China itself, would include the use of atomic or hydrogen bombs. That was a point which Mr. Dulles should be asked to clarify during his visit.(c) President Eisenhower had suggested that the preparations for the Geneva Conference would afford a convenient pretext for mr. Dulles&apos; visit to London. The British public would, however,connect it with the current American tests of the hydrogen bomb, andwould expect it to lead to some further pronouncement on that question.The Prime Minister said that he shared the Foreign Secretary&apos;sdoubts about the wisdom of making the proposed declaration beforethe Geneva Conference. On the other hand, any proposition which led to closer co-operation between the United Kingdom and theUnited States deserved very careful consideration. The best coursewould be for him to tell the President that we should be glad to see Mr. Dulles in London at the beginning of the following week, butthat we could not offer any opinion on the merits of the Americanplan until it had been further clarified and studied. Meanwhile, weshould tell the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and france of our invitation to Mr. Dulles, and promise to keep them informed of the results of our conversations with him. The Australian PrimeMinister had already sent a message putting forward very much theview taken by the Foreign Secretary, that we should use the periodof the rains in Indo-China for working out a coalition on the lines proposed by the Americans.
The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform president eisenhower that he would welcome a visit by Mr. Dullesearly in the following week, but did not wish to pronouncemeanwhile on the merits of the American proposaloutlined in C. (54) 134.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would work out meansof adapting the United States plan so as to further thesecurity of South-East Asia without endangering theprospects of a successful outcome from the geneva conference.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (54) 130) reporting the findings of the enquiry by Sir Reginald Sharpe, Q.C., into allegations of links between thePeople&apos;s United Party (P.U.P.) in British Honduras and the Govern-ment of Guatemala and seeking approval of the terms of a statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons that afternoonon future constitutional changes in the Colony.The Colonial Secretary said that he was satisfied that SirReginald Sharpe&apos;s findings would not justify the Government incancelling the elections for the new Legislative Assembly, now fixed for 28th April, or in proscribing the P.U.P. as a political party. Therewas a serious risk, however, that the P.U.P. might win eight out of nine seats in the Assembly, which would give them all the four seatswhich would be available for elected members in the ExecutiveCouncil, if that Council were reconstituted as was proposed. Theview was held in some quarters, on the other hand, that the P.U.P.had lost ground recently and might not win so many seats in theelection as had hitherto been expected. In the circumstances it seemed to him that the right course would be to allow the elections to proceed as planned and, when the results were known, to considerwhether to proceed with the reconstitution of the Executive council or, if that did not then seem desirable, to carry on, at least for a time,with the present form of Executive Council. If it should become clear that this could only be done by the constant use of the governors reserve powers, it would probably be necessary to arrangefor a Constitutional Commission to visit British Honduras and consider what would be the most appropriate constitution for theColony in all the circumstances. On further consideration hesuggested that at this stage as little indication as possible should begiven of the action which it might be found necessary to take afterthe elections and to this end hie proposed that paragraph 3 of thedraft statement in Annex B to his memorandum should be amended to read as follows:  &quot; After careful consideration Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave decided to proceed with the first stage of the scheme.Accordingly, elections on the basis of universal adult suffragefor the Legislative Assembly will take place on 28th April. her majesty&apos;s Government will thereafter have to consider, inconsultation with the Governor, whether to proceed to thesecond stage.&quot;He was anxious to avoid a repetition of events in British Guiana,where a new constitution had been brought fully into operation andhad then to be suspended.In discussion, the view was expressed that it might be preferable to defer the elections to the Legislative Assembly for a period insteadof risking a situation in which an Assembly had been brought into
Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 125) about the expenses of Members ofParliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Ministers were due todiscuss this matter later that day with representative government supporters from the 1922 Committee. He suggested that at thismeeting Ministers should disclose the general substance of the draft parliamentary statement set out in Annex A to his memorandum.The general effect of this was to make clear the Governments viewthat it would not be right to ease the financial difficulties of Membersby increasing the Parliamentary salary or by introducing a non-contributory pension scheme, but that the House would be justifiedin considering alternative methods; that the most convenient nextstep would be a general debate, which would give Members anopportunity to express their views and put forward constructivesuggestions; and that the particular possibilities which the Govern-ment had in mind were those indicated in Plan I and Plan II in annex B of C. (54) 125.Plan I provided for tax-free subsistence allowances, at the rateof 425. Od. per night, for Members who necessarily incurred extraliving expenses by reason of their Parliamentary duties. Logically,there would be no case for paying such an allowance to members for London constituencies, but it might be expedient to make thema modest subsistence allowance of not more than 255. Od. a day.Plan II provided for grants in respect of secretarial andcorrespondence expenses.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) It was suggested that, while there would be no objection torevealing to Government supporters at this stage the general sub-stance of the draft Parliamentary statement and of the proposalsembodied in Plans I and II, it would be undesirable to provide themwith a copy of the statement or of either Plan. Thus, the draft statement contained certain expressions of view which might require futher consideration (for example, the definite statement in para-graph 5 that the Government agreed that something was wrong withthe present position) and it seemed premature for the Governmentto commit themselves by paragraph 7 to the details of Plan II.(b) The Lord President said that he regretted the omission fromthe Chancellor^ proposals of any reference to the Parliamentaryexpenses of Peers. If subsistence allowances were made payable to members of the House of Commons, these would be in addition to asubstantial salary, whereas Peers at present received nothing sayereimbursement of railway fares, and the efficiency of proceedings jr)the House of Lords was undoubtedly already suffering from the inability of many Peers to attend the House regularly.   Enquiries.being composed predominantly of P.U.P. members who, although they might not be Communist in outlook, were violently opposed tothis country and to the Commonwealth connection.It was the general view of the Cabinet, however, that defermentof the elections would be likely to excite opposition from all elements in the Colony and that, on balance, the course recommended by theColonial Secretary was preferable.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement inthe House of Commons in the terms set out in Annex B toC. (54) 130, subject to the amendment of paragraph 3 whichhe had proposed in the Cabinefs discussion.
which he had made showed that a subsistence allowance of 42s. Od.a night would not by itself be enough to meet Peers&apos; reasonable out-goings. Owing to the restricted sittings of the House and the limited number of Peers who normally attended, the Exchequer cost of any concession to them would be very small.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the best way of helping Peers would probably be found to be by means of a sub-sistence allowance rather than grants of the kind provided for inPlan II. He did not rule out the possibility that a rather more generous subsistence allowance might be justifiable in their case,particularly if it were specifically linked with attendance in the Houseas their travel allowances already were.The Chief Whip said that Ministers would not find it easy to persuade Government supporters to consider favourably even pro-posals of the kind outlined in C. (54) 125, rind their extension tocover Peers would make their task still harder.The Prime Minister said that, at the meeting later that day with government supporters, it should not be necessary to go beyond ageneral statement that the grant of special allowances for Membersof the House of Commons would have to be matched by comparableconcessions to Members of the Upper House.The Lord President said that he would be content with a general statement on those lines.The Cabinet Subject to the points recorded in paragraphs (a) and (b)above, agreed that Ministers should discuss this matter with Government supporters on the basis of the draft parliamentary statement and Plans I and II contained in annexes A and B of C. (54) 125.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th April, 1954.
