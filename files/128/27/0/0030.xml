3 CC. 30 (54)Television Bill.        1.   The lord privy Seal invited the Cabinet to consider whether(Previous        the proceedings in the House of Commons on the remaining stagesReference:      of the Television Bill should be subject to a compulsory time-table.CC. (54) 22nd   The Opposition had indicated their intention to delay the passageConclusions,    of the Bill, and notice had already been given of a very large numberMinute 1.)       of amendments.  If all of these were discussed at length, the Com-mittee Stage would occupy a disproportionate time.   On the otherhand the Bill had not formed part of the Governmenfs original programme, and it might be thought that it was not the kind ofmeasure to which a compulsory time-table should be applied.In discussion it was argued that, if there were no time-table,the number of amendments would have to be reduced by askingGovernment supporters to withdraw some of theirs, and most of theCommittee Stage in the Commons would be spent in discussing Oppo-sition amendments. This would give the impression that there was less support for the principles of the Bill than in fact there was. Itwould also lead to difficulties at a later stage, since many of the amendments which were not moved in the Commons would find their way into the Bill in the Lords and would have to be discussedwhen the Lords&apos; amendments were reported to the Commons.On the other side attention was drawn to the danger of driftinginto a position in which most of the Governmenfs major measures were subjected to a compulsory time-table in the Commons. Thiswas a practice which was favoured by some Labour leaders but was contrary to the principles of the Conservative Party. Would there be any widespread disappointment throughout the country if in theend the Government found it impracticable to pass this measure?Further discussion showed that the balance of opinion in theCabinet lay in favour of applying a compulsory time-table to theremaining stages of this Bill in the House of Commons. It was,however, agreed that the Committee Stage of the Bill should be opened in the ordinary way, and that no motion for a compulsorytime-table should be brought forward until it had become evidentthat this was the only practical method of completing the Parlia-mentary proceedings on the Bill.The Cabinet Took note that the Committee Stage of the Television bill would be opened in the House of Commons on 4th and 5th May; and agreed that, if in the course of those two daysit became evident that a disproportionate time would be spent in completing the remaining stages of the Bill, theLord Privy Seal should then bring forward a motion fora compulsory time-table.Parliament. 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.It was proposed that on 17th May the Leaders of the three parties in the House of Commons should propose a motion for a humbleAddress of Welcome to Her Majesty The Queen and His royal highness the Duke of Edinburgh on their return from their visit toAustralia and New Zealand.indo-Chima. 3.   The Prime Minister said that on Sunday, 25th April, he had(Previous held two emergency meetings with the Ministers ^^rLlr^men!Reference: to consider a proposal, put forward by the United States government cc (54) 28th for Anglo-American military intervention in Indo-China A record otConclusions, those meetings had been circulated as C.

any immediate declaration of intention to check the expansion of communism in South-East Asia or to join in any precipitate military intervention in Indo-China. He thought it possible that the UnitedStates authorities might eventually be brought to share our view onthis matter.The Prime Minister said that the French Ambassador in london had on the previous day brought him a further message from theFrench Prime Minister urging reconsideration of this decision. Hehad felt obliged to reject this further appeal. Since 25th April theChiefs of Staff had also reviewed the position afresh in the light of representations made by a French military officer who had been sentover specially from Paris; but they adhered to their opinion that airintervention of the kind proposed would not be effective in saving thegarrison at Dien Bien Phu.The Commonwealth Secretary drew attention to a telegram fromthe Foreign Secretary (Geneva telegram No. 25) embodying the text of a message which he was proposing to send to the Prime ministers of India, Pakistan and Ceylon. This emphasised the importance ofsecuring the widest possible measure of support for any settlement onIndo-China which might be secured at the Geneva Conference. Itdisclosed our willingness to guarantee such a settlement, andenquired whether these Commonwealth countries could be associatedwith such a guarantee in any way. The three Prime Ministers were also to be asked whether there was any other action which they thought the Commonwealth countries might take, individually or collectively,to reinforce the settlement and to take advantage of the resultingrelaxation of tension.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he was in full agreementwith the terms of the message which the Foreign Secretary was pro-posing to send.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for a personal message from the Foreign Secretary on the linesof the draft embodied in Geneva telegram No. 25 to be despatched at once to the Prime Ministers of India,Pakistan and Ceylon.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Colonial Affairs (C. (54) 154) on the cost-of-living allow-ances payable to industrial workers in Gibraltar. There was read tothe Cabinet a note on this question by the First Lord, which was subsequently circulated as C. (54) .156.The Cabinet were informed that the basic industrial wage in gibraltar was supplemented by a cost-of-living allowance of 48,5&apos;. aweek for Gibraltarians, and 245. a week for Spaniards. More than8,000 Spaniards came into Gibraltar daily to work; and of these 2,400were employed by the Service Departments and 400 by the colonial government. The discrimination against Spanish workers, which hadbeen maintained since the cost-of-living allowance was introduced in1945, was originally based on differences between living costs in spain and Gibraltar; but a recent investigation of comparative costssuggested that these would not now justify a differential of more than14s. or 15.5&apos;. This discrimination had been given great prominence inthe Spanish agitation over Gibraltar, and was the subject of frequentrepresentations by the Spanish Consul-General there and by the TradeUnion organisation representing the interests of Spanish workers in gibraltar. The Gibraltar Government had recently reviewed theposition and came to the conclusion that the discrimination was notdefensible in principle, and they were supported in this view by the
City Council, the majority of private employers, and the TradeUnions. The Colonial Office urged that the differential should be wholly abolished, and that a decision in this sense should be announced before The Queen&apos;s visit to Gibraltar on 10th May.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Labour said that that at present the lower rate was paid even to Spaniards who lived in Gibraltar. As thingsnow stood therefore, the discrimination was based on nationality, noton living costs. This, he thought, would be very difficult to defend.The Cabinet were informed that the Service Department wouldbe willing that Spaniards living in Gibraltar should receive the samecost-of-living allowance as the Gibraltarians, but the Colonial office had not been content with this solution.(b) The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that the treasury would be ready to agree that the cost-of-living allowance payable to workers living in Spain should be raised by 9s. a week, so as to bring it into line with the latest estimate of the difference between livingcosts on the two sides of the frontier. The Colonial Office had,however, been unwilling to accept the figures on which these estimateshad been based.(c) The Minister of Defence said that he was unwilling to accept any further charge on Defence Estimates on this account. He hopedthat any increase in payments to Spanish workers in Gibraltar wouldbe offset by a reduction in the numbers employed.(d) The Minister of State said that the Foreign Secretary hadbeen concerned lest this discrimination should provide the SpanishGovernment with a pretext for directing that no Spaniards should accept employment in Gibraltar. It was, however, the general opinion of the Cabinet that no such development was likely, in viewof the prevalence of unemployment in southern Spain, and that, evenif it should occur, it could be remedied by the employment of Malteseor Mauritians or the transfer of Admiralty work to other dockyards.(e) The Prime Minister said that he was impressed by the argu-ments, in paragraph 5 of C. (54) 156, against associating any changeof policy in this matter with The Queen&apos;s visit to Gibraltar. the gibraltar Government were not, he presumed, suggesting that failure to remove this discrimination against Spanish workers before10th May would increase such risks as existed of acts of violenceduring The Queen&apos;s visit.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that he had no grounds for suggesting that the security risks to which The Queenmight be exposed during her forthcoming visit to Gibraltar wouldbe directly increased by a decision to postpone any change of policyin this matter until after her visit.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no decision should be taken on this question before the end of The Queen&apos;s forthcoming visit to gibraltar.(2) Agreed that, after The Queen had left Gibraltar, some change should be made in the existing discrimination, in cost-of -living allowances, between Spanish and Gibraltarianworkers in Gibraltar; and that the interested Depart-ments should arrange for a further enquiry to be held with a view to determining what change in the existing system should then be made.(3) Took note that the Minister of Labour would consider what form the enquiry under Conclusion (2) above should takeand would submit his recommendations on this to thePrime Minister.
5. The Cabinet had agreed to consider at their present meetingthe future course of Parliamentary proceedings on the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill, which had been introduced in the House ofCommons in January but had not yet been submitted for SecondReading.The Minister of Education said that two major issues were nowinvolved. First, it was clear that the teachers&apos; real objective was, notmerely to avoid an increase in the rate of their superannuation contri-butions, but to eliminate the contributory principle altogether fromthe scheme. Secondly, the Governments decision about the bill would largely determine whether any economies could be secured onthe Education Votes. The abandonment of the Bill would in itselfinvolve an increase of  2 millions in this year&apos;s Education Estimates,at a time when Ministers were being pressed to secure substantial economies in Government expenditure.The Burnham Committee had been aware of the prospective increase in the rate of teachers&apos; superannuation contributions whenthey had recommended the recent increases in teachers&apos; pay, but itwould have been dangerous to have encouraged the establishment ofa direct relation between rates of pay and rates of superannuationcontributions, as this would have created an expectation that any increase in the latter would always be offset by an increase in theformer. The question for consideration was whether teachers should or should not be required to bear a larger share of the cost of theincreased pension benefits to which they were now entitled.The Bill undoubtedly commanded the support of the greatmajority of Conservative Members, and a number of those who had at one time been critical of it had now been persuaded that it was justified. She hoped that, through discussion with individuals con-cerned, it would be possible to reduce still further the number of conservative Members who could not be relied upon to support theBill in the Division Lobby. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had expressed his readiness to wind up for the Government in the SecondReading debate, and she hoped that this could now be arranged fora suitable date in the week beginning 10th May.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he shared theMinisters view that the Bill was fully justified on its merits and thatthe Government ought to endeavour to pass it into law.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the remaining opposi-tion to the Bill among Government supporters was not based ongenuine objections but was due to the pressures to which they werebeing subjected. The Cabinet also recognised that the abandonment of the Bill in face of such pressures would seriously prejudice their prospects of securing substantial economies in public expenditure in1955 and, further, would embarrass those Government supporterswho had hitherto defended the Bill in public. The question which remained for consideration was whether the Bill could in fact becarried.The Chief Whip said that enquiries showed that, apart fromfifteen Government supporters who might be expected reluctantly to vote for the Bill, there were between nineteen and twenty-three others who could not be relied upon to vote for it, including a hard coreof eight of whom most would abstain but one might vote against theGovernment. In addition, a number of Government supporters wereabsent through sickness and the Liberals were expected to vote against the Bill. There was, therefore, a distinct risk that the Govern-ment might be defeated in a division on the Second Reading. Therewould be an even greater risk of a Government defeat on the relevantclause of the Bill at the Committee stage.The Prime Minister said that the view of the Cabinet was clearly in favour of proceeding with the Bill. If the Government should be defeated in a division, they would be obliged to accept the decisionof the&quot; House. This need not, however, lead to a Dissolution. Ifnecessary, they could seek a vote of confidence from the House.Education.Teachers&apos;Superannuation.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 28thConclusions,Minute 2.)

The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterOccupational of Labour (C. (54) 8 and 101), the Minister of Health (C. (54) 98)Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (54) 129) about theScheme. promotion of a National Occupational Health Scheme.The Minister of Labour said that pressure for the developmentof occupational health services was being brought to bear on himby the leaders of the Trades Union Congress, and he understoodthat the British Medical Association, were exerting similar pressure on the Minister of Health. The White Paper of 1944 (Command6502) on a National Health Service had contemplated a further extension of the social services into the sphere of working environ-ment, and a future Labour Government could be expected tointroduce elaborate arrangements on these lines. He himselffavoured a more empirical approach, and he was at this stagesuggesting no more than the establishment of an Occupational HealthAdvisory Council, to advise Ministers on all aspects of occupationalhealth services and their development, and of a supporting inter-departmental Committee of officials. The establishment of these bodies would involve little direct cost, though he recognised thattheir recommendations might in due course lead to further expendi-ture, of which part at least would fall on employers, some of whomtook the view that improved occupational health arrangements would assist productivity. He could not agree with the Secretary of Statefor Scotland that non-industrial forms of employment should be excluded from the scope of his proposals, as such employmentaccounted for no less than half the total employed population andco-ordination in these matters between industrial and non-industrial employment was clearly desirable. Nor did he favour the suggestion of the Minister of Health that the whole matter should be the subjectof a further Governmental enquiry before the Government tookovert action. He had considered that, as his Department now boreresponsibility for administration of the Factories Acts, it would be convenient that he should himself preside over the proposed AdvisoryCouncil, but he would be ready to agree that that body should havea neutral Chairman.The Minister of Health said that, if the Cabinet should approve the appointment of an Advisory Council, he would certainly prefer that its Chairman should not be drawn from one of the interested departments, since this would tend to prejudge the ultimate decisionon the question of Ministerial responsibility for the proposed new service. For himself, however, he would prefer that in the firstinstance the proposed scope of a National Occupational HealthScheme and the machinery for operating it should be fully investi-gated by a Governmental Committee.Several Ministers expressed the view that, while the developmentof occupational health services might be desirable in principle, thepresent was not an opportune time for what was to be described as&quot; a signal advance in our social services.&quot; If it were, in fact, intended that the appointment of the proposed two Committees should not lead to any striking developments in the immediate future, mightnot their appointment raise false hopes and lead to subsequent dis-illusionment? If, on the other hand, an immediate and significantdevelopment of occupational health services were contemplated,would this be in keeping with the Governments present efforts tostem the tide of expenditure occasioned by the existing social servicesand would it not run counter to the investigations which the Cabinet
had recently set on foot with the object of securing substantial economies in public expenditure, even at the cost of unwelcomechanges of policy? Proposals of the kind now before the cabinet ought at least to be considered in conjunction with any policy changes which might be under consideration for the purpose of securingeconomy.The Home Secretary said that he hoped that the Cabinet wouldnot take a final decision on these proposals until they could be viewedin conjunction with those put forward in a memorandum (C. (54) 122)by the Ministers concerned with the recommendations of the Gower&apos;s committee on Health, Welfare and Safety in Non-Industrial Employ-ment and Closing Hours of Shops. The time seemed ripe to consider what should be the main theme of Government action during what might prove to be their last year of office, and the Cabinet would wish to consider whether this should be confined to retrenchment orwhether it should include any measures of social progress and, if so,what form these should take. If the Cabinet should finally decidenot to proceed either with the proposals now before them or withthose contained in C. (54) 122, it would be necessary to consider carefully how this decision should be explained to responsible TradeUnion leaders.The Lord Privy Seal said that the theme of the governments policies during their last year of office would arise in connection withthe legislative programme for the 1954-55 Parliamentary Session onwhich he hoped soon to submit proposals to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Deferred until a later meeting a final decision on theproposals put forward by the Minister of Labour in C. (54) 8.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th April, 1954.
