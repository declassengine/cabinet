Indo-China. 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had received a message(Previous        from the Foreign Secretary (Geneva telegram No. 984) about the reference:      reluctance of the United States Government to join in a multilateralC.C. (54) 49th   declaration recognising any settlement on Indo-China which mightConclusions,     be reached at the Geneva Conference.   The United States repre-MinuteA)       sentative at Geneva had made it plain that, even if the settlement was one which they could respect, they would be unwilling to do more than make a unilateral declaration taking note of the agreement and undertaking not to disturb it. The Foreign Secretary feared thatthis might give rise to procedural difficulties in the concluding stages of the Conference. He would do his best to overcome these withoutdisclosing differences between the Western Powers.  If, however, he found himself faced with the choice between losing an agreementbecause of these procedural difficulties and securing an agreement at the cost of some procedural differences between the United Statesand other Western Governments, he would feel obliged to choose the latter alternative.In discussion there was general support for the view expressedby the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would at once informthe Foreign Secretary that he could count on the Cabinefsfull support in pursuing the course indicated in paragraph 3of Geneva telegram No. 984.Egypt. 2.   The Minister of State said that informal discussions wereDefence now proceeding in Cairo with a view to the conclusion of a defence negotiations. agreement on the lines approved by the Cabinet on 7th July. Though(Previous the attitude of the Egyptian representatives was not in general reference: unreasonable, they were offering firm opposition to our suggestionsC.C.

On bothMinute 2.)       these points they were adhering firmly to the earlier proposal for a7-year agreement and a withdrawal period of 15 months.   H.M.Ambassador was being instructed to make no concession on eitherpoint until the Cabinet had been able to review the position afterthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s return from Geneva.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded of an undertaking thatthe House of Commons would be given an opportunity to debate thisquestion when the heads of a defence agreement had been settled with the Egyptian Government. It was, however, estimated that about three months would elapse between the initialling of the headsof an agreement and the final conclusion of a formal agreement.Therefore, even though the heads of an agreement were settled duringthe recess, Parliament would have an opportunity to debate thematter in the autumn before the agreement was finally concluded.Meanwhile, however, the movement of troops and stores wouldhave begun.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cnchei Down. 3.   The Prime Minister said that the Minister of Agriculture had(Previous reached the conclusion that, in view of the strong feelings arousedReference: among Government supporters by the Report of the Crichel DownC.C.

be sorry that his successful handling of the Governmenfs agricultural policy should have to be brought to an end in this way, and wouldregret the loss of a loyal colleague. It would be appropriate that theMinister should himself announce his forthcoming resignation in his speech in the debate that afternoon. Thereafter, the letters to be exchanged between him and the Prime Minister would be published in the Press.The Cabinet expressed their respect for the Ministers decision and their regret at his resignation from the Government.In subsequent discussion The Attorney-General recalled that,at the Cabinefs meeting on 13th July, some doubt had been expressed about the justification for the Land Transactions Committee&apos;conclusion that it was impracticable to devise a special procedure forcases where land compulsorily acquired by one Department was tobe transferred to another, and that the Home Secretary had pointedout that the amendment to the draft statement of policy which he had suggested would not exclude further consideration of some special procedure to govern such transfers, if there should be strong pressure for this. In his view it was important that the statement of policywhich the Minister would be making that afternoon should include an explicit reference to the possibility that some special proceduremight be introduced for this purpose.Support was expressed for this point of view and there was some discussion about the form of words which should be inserted in thedraft statement to meet it.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, in paragraph 36 of the Ministers draft speech,words should be inserted to make it plain that theGovernment were ready to consider whether, except intime of emergency, provision ought not to be made forsome form of public enquiry before land compulsorily acquired by one Department was transferred to another department.The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretaryof the Cabinet (C. (54) 238), covering the report of the Committeeappointed to advise Ministers on the question whether any of the officials criticised in the Report of the Crichel Down Inquiry shouldbe transferred to other posts in the Civil Service, and a note by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (54) 239) covering the passage in his draft speech relating to this report.The Prime Minister suggested that the appointment of theCommittee and the substance of its recommendations should be announced by the Minister of Agriculture in opening the debate that afternoon, and that copies of the report should be made available to members in the Vote Office at the conclusion of his speech.There was general support for this suggestion. It was agreedthat no special steps need be taken to make the text of the reportavailable to Opposition spokesmen in advance of the debate.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the report attached to C. (54) 238 and agreedthat copies should be made available to Members in the vote Office at the conclusion of the Ministers speech that afternoon.(3) Approved the draft, C. (54) 239, of a passage relating to thisreport which was to be included in the Ministers speech.
Pensions for old Age and war Disability.(previous reference :CC. (54) 36thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet discussed the line to be taken by the Govern-rnent spokesmen in the debate on the following day on an opposition motion expressing concern at the Governmenfs failure to increasethe rates of old-age pensions and disability benefits.The Minister of Pensions said that a favourable reception hadbeen given to the Government amendment to the motion, pledgingsupport for further improvements in pensions and national insurance benefits as soon as the current review of all the financial and other problems involved had been concluded. It now seemed likely thatthe Government would receive the report of the Phillips committee before the end of November, and the Government Actuary&apos;s reporton the finances of the National Insurance scheme could be madeavailable by the same date. He therefore hoped that he might havethe Cabinefs authority to state in the debate that the Governmentexpected to be in a position to announce their plans for increases of benefits before the end of the year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentshould now be in a position to announce in the Queen&apos;s Speech their intention to legislate on rates of old-age and disability pensions in thenext session. It might, however, be prudent to avoid committing theGovernment at this stage to announcing their plans by a specifieddate.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Pensions and National insurance to state in the forthcoming debate that the governmenth oped to be in a position to announce their plans for improving the rates of old-age and disability pensions byabout the end of the present year.Civil 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure. Commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 232) setting out the recommenda-(Previous tions of the Committee on Civil Expenditure for securing reductionsReference: jn civil expenditure in the financial year 1955; and memoranda byCC (54) 24th the Minister of Health (C. (54) 240) and the Minister of FoodConclusions, (Q (54) 241) commenting on certain recommendations in the minute 5.) Committee&apos;s report.The Commonwealth Secretary said that his Committee had beenasked to submit proposals for securing a saving of  100 millions inthe forecast expenditure of Civil Departments in 1955. TheCommittee had, however, raised their target to  125 millions to matchincreases in the forecast of expenditure. The proposals now submitted would yield a total saving of  113 millions. Only three off them would require legislation. The Committee&apos;s review had not extended to expenditure on Civil Defence, strategic reserves, or thecivil programmes of the Ministry of Supply. Further studies of these subjects could be undertaken in the light of the recommendations to be submitted by the Defence Policy Committee. Further possi-bilities of economy might be disclosed by the forthcoming report ofthe Phillips Committee on National Insurance and by the review ofthe financial relations between local and central Government.In a general discussion of the Committee&apos;s recommendations thefollowing points were made:  (a) In the National Health Service, savings totalling  14 millionswere recommended. The Minister of Health said that he could accept the recommendation that capital expenditure on hospitals should be limited to  10 millions, but he was more doubtful whethermaintenance expenditure on hospitals could be reduced to  1 million.He would not receive the detailed estimates of the Regional Boardsuntil November, but he felt sure that they would exceed the
 4 millions which he had allowed and, because of commitmentsaccepted during the current year, he thought it unlikely that thereduction of  3 millions proposed by the Committtee could besecured in full. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that therewould be similar difficulties in limiting maintenance expenditure onhospitals in Scotland to the proposed level of  125,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be willingto consider this question further with the Ministers concerned whenthe recommendations of the Regional Boards had been received.The Minister of Health said that the proposal to alter theprescription charge from Is. per form to Is. per item would bearparticularly on those who suffered most from ill-health. There wouldbe no administrative difficulties in carrying out such a change: thedifficulties were wholly political.The Cabinet agreed that further consideration should be givento this recommendation at a later meeting.(b) On Education the Committee had recommended a totalsaving of  6 millions.The Minister of Education said that, even with radical changesin existing arrangements, it would be difficult to secure a saving of 4 millions by increasing the charges for school meals. When theGovernment had taken office, the charge for a school meal was Id.and the savings now proposed would involve raising this charge to Is.This increase would be contrasted with the Governments claim thatthere had been no substantial rise in the cost of living since they took office.The proposed saving of  2 millions on capital expenditure by the universities had been discussed with the University Grants Com-mittee, and there was no reason to expect that it would arouse anydetermined opposition. The saving proposed would not reduce thelevel of current expenditure on technological facilities at the universities and would merely slow down the pace of new capitalexpenditure.(c) On agricultural and food subsidies the Committee had recommended savings totalling  63 millions.The Minister of Labour said that he was strongly opposed to thesuggestion that the price of bread should be increased by Id. on the3^ lb. loaf. This would be ill-received by both sides of industry andwould confirm their feeling that the Government were not takingdetermined steps to stabilise the cost of living. The retail price indexhad recently moved up by one point and the proposed increase in theprice of bread would represent an addition of nearly one-third of apoint. This would have an unfortunate psychological effect on wage claims, particularly as the Trades Union Congress would be stressingin a forthcoming report the importance of stable prices in securingstable industrial relations.The Commonwealth Secretary said that his Committee had beenfully aware of the difficulties of increasing the price of bread; but,after a careful review of the various alternatives by which savings could be achieved, they had come to the conclusion that the soundestarrangement would be to introduce a levy on flour and an increase inthe price of bread, on the lines recommended in C. (54) 232.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it might be preferable to do more by increasing the price of sugar, and less by increasing the priceof bread.(d) The Minister of Transport said that it would not be possibleto secure the full economy of  1 million proposed in paragraph 7 (/-)of C. (54) 232 in respect of precautionary measures for the tuberailway tunnels under the Thames. Contracts had been let for mostof this work, and some of the measures were already completed.
(e) The Minister of State said that he hoped that no final decisions would be taken, in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s absence, on the Com-mittee&apos;s proposals for the reduction of expenditure on overseas information services and on technical assistance to foreign countries.In further discussion The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatthe review carried out by the Committee on Civil Expenditure pro-vided valuable information in the light of which he hoped it wouldbe possible to take early decisions with the object of reducingsubstantially the level of Government expenditure. Unless this couldbe done, he would face a difficult budgetary position in 1955. Apartfrom defence expenditure, which the Cabinet would shortly be considering in the light of the forthcoming report by the defence policy Committee, a very heavy burden was imposed on the national finances by the Exchequer contribution of over  200 millions a year in support of current agricultural policy. The tax-payer would not accept indefinitely the continuance of agricultural subsidies on theirpresent scale, and he was therefore in favour of the proposal for alevy on flour accompanied by an increase in the price of bread. the concept of a levy accorded with long-standing Conservative policy,and he doubted whether the addition of Id. to the present price ofIs. 3d. for a lb. loaf would impose any serious hardship on any section of the public. The estimates which he had made of theprobable trend in the retail price index over the next year showedsome variations, but no substantial tendency to increases. It was not,in his view, good social policy to continue to contribute  85 millions a year from the Exchequer as subsidies to keep down the price of bread and milk at a time of full employment and high wages.The President of the Board of Trade said that the current level oftaxation, direct and indirect, was a serious burden on industry, and unless this burden could be alleviated our export trade was likely to suffer. He strongly favoured an early reduction in public expenditure,in order to assist Britsh industry to hold its own against competition in world markets.The Prime Minister said that a buoyant mood had been created in the country by the Governmenfs success in restoring the solvencyof the national finances and raising production and employment totheir present high level. There was in consequence no popular sense of imminent crisis, or even of the need for economy. It would therefore be necessary to consider very carefully some of theproposals put forward in C. (54) 232. Some of them could doubtless be adopted without difficulty, but further thought was needed before decisions were taken on some of the recommendations, e.g., thoseinvolving increased charges for prescriptions and a rise in the priceof bread. Before coming to final decisions on this report the cabinet would wish to consider the report of the Defence Policy Committeeon possible savings in defence expenditure, and to have theopportunity of hearing the views of the Foreign Secretary on his return from Geneva.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary, he would circulate a further memorandum to the Cabinet indicating those proposals in C. (54) 232on which decisions should be taken by the Cabinet before the summer recess. He hoped that the Cabinet, in addition to taking firm decisions on those points, would also agree that in framing their estimates for the coming year Departments should be instructed totake account of the adjustments which had already been acceptedby the Ministers concerned in the course of the consultations carriedout by the Committee on Civil Expenditure.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume before the summer recess their considera-tion of the proposals in C. (54) 232 for securing economies incivil expenditure in the financial year 1955.
Civil Aviation.Developmentof gatwick airport.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofTransport and Civil Aviation (C. (54) 235 and 236) and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C. (54) 237) regarding the reportof the public inquiry into the proposed development of gatwick airport.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that the report was beingpresented to Parliament that day. He hoped that the Cabinet would feel able to approve his proposal that the development of gatwick airport should now proceed, so that he could make an announcement to that effect before Parliament rose for the summer recess.The Minister of Local Government said that he was doubtfulwhether it would be expedient to announce a decision so soon afterthe receipt of the report. The report was a lengthy document andhad been in his hands for less than a month: the announcement ofa decision so soon after its receipt might give the impression that theGovernment had given it less consideration than it deserved.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould take further time to reach a decision on this question. this need not mean that the decision should be postponed until afterParliament had re-assembled in the autumn: there was no reason why a decision should not be announced during the recess.The Cabinet Agreed that the report of the inquiry into the proposed extension of Gatwick Airport should be considered at anearly meeting during the recess, so that the Government^decision might be announced in the course of September.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th July, 1954.
