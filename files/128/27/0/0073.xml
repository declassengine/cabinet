Defence Policy.(previous reference:CC. (54) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C. (54) 329) covering the report of the Committee which had considered, in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 27th July,whether further adjustments could be made in defence programmesbeyond those proposed by the Defence Policy Committee in C. (54)250. They also had before them memoranda by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (C. (54) 332) and the Parliamentary and FinancialSecretary to the Admiralty (C. (54) 331) commenting on the proposals affecting the Fleet Air Arm and the construction of minesweepers.The following is a summary of the main points made in the cabinet&apos;s discussions:  Fleet Air Arm. (a) The First Sea Lord said that in the war at sea the naval forces which would be deployed on our trade routes and round our coaststo protect shipping would be vulnerable to attack by the powerfulsurface forces of the Russian Fleet unless they were covered by a strategic force fulfilling a role similar to that of the Home Fleet in thelast war. The Allied Striking Fleet would provide this covering forceand it must contain carriers capable of dealing with Russian cruisers.The United States Government had asked us to contribute threeheavy carriers to it; and, although we were proposing to contributeonly two, it was essential that these should be equipped for this role.We were also relying on these ships to counter the threat of Russianfleet activities in the early days of the war before United States naval forces were deployed in the eastern Atlantic. In the course ofhostilities it was possible that the Allied Striking Fleet would beemployed to counter amphibious operations of the kind which theRussians might be expected to launch against Norway, but such atask would only be incidental to the primary strategic role which hehad outlined.It was for these reasons that the Admiralty felt obliged to oppose the suggestion, put forward in paragraph 10 of C. (54) 329, that theheavy carriers should be equipped for the escort role only and thattheir complement of aircraft should be reduced to that of the lightcarriers.(b) The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Admiralty, saidthat the Admiralty had already revised the naval programme in a manner which would reduce expenditure during 1955 by  25 millions,and the major part of this economy would flow from reductions inthe strength of the Fleet Air Arm. Even so, they had been willingto undertake further reductions in the number of aircraft to be ordered for the Fleet Air Arm, which would lead to the additionalsaving of  3^ millions mentioned in paragraph 12 of C. (54) 329.(c) The Minister of Supply said that the proposals made by theAdmiralty for the purpose of securing this further economy of  3imillions would involve cancelling contracts for the supply of aircraft,production of which was in some cases well advanced. the manufacturers of the Seamew were already experiencing difficultyowing to the uncertain future of the Comet and the cessation of workon the Canberra. If these difficulties were now aggravated by thewithdrawal of orders for the Seamew, they might be compelled todisperse most of their labour force, and this would give rise to seriousunemployment in Northern Ireland. Similar difficulties might be caused by the cancellation of orders for other types of naval aircraft.If, therefore, the Cabinet approved the proposal to reduce the numberof aircraft ordered for the Fleet Air Arm, he would wish to examinewith the Minister of Defence how these modifications in theAdmiralty programme could be adjusted so as to reduce to aminimum the impact which they were likely to have on employmentin the aircraft industry.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he regarded 1,525 millions as the upper limit of the expenditure which wecould afford on defence in 1955, without allowing for the costs of47119-1 b 2
our forces in Germany. Even if it were possible to secure all the economies proposed in C. (54) 329, it would still be necessary to look for means of saving a further  10 millions in the coming year; andhe proposed to seek, jointly with the Minister of Defence, means ofmaking this further saving in his scrutiny of the detailed Estimates.To the extent that it was necessary to forgo or postpone theparticular economies proposed in C. (54) 329, it would be necessaryto seek other compensating economies elsewhere in the defence programme.(e) It would be helpful if our defence planning could be more closely co-ordinated with that of the United States. Some duplicationof effort might be avoided if we knew how far we could rely with certainty on the United States Strategic Air Force to deal with enemy targets which were of special importance to us. Even withinthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation defence plans were concernedmore with the allocation of forces from member countries than withthe allocation of strategic tasks. There was general agreement thatwe should at an early stage enter into fuller consultation with theUnited States Government on the strategic policy of the WesternAlliance.(/) The Minister of Defence suggested that, in view of the differences outstanding regarding the strategic use of heavy aircraft carriers in a future war, he might examine these questions in greater detail in consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty with theobject of formulating agreed proposals on the scale of the resources to be devoted to the Fleet Air Arm and the types of aircraft requiredfor it.The Prime Minister said that he was not convinced that the large and increasing resources which would be absorbed by the Fleet air arm were justified by the contribution which it would make to ourdefences. He believed that larger savings could be made in this sector of our plans. He would not, however, press for the immediateadoption of the particular proposals made in paragraph 10 ofC. (54) 329, if the Minister of Defence were ready to explore withthe Admiralty alternative means of securing savings in navalexpenditure.Minesweepers. (g) The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the developmentof nuclear weapons, it was less likely that mines would be used as a weapon for denying us the use of our major ports. Mines would,however, continue to be used against the smaller ports. The strengthof our minesweeping forces was declining, and some further ordersfor coastal minesweepers should be placed, both for this reason andin order to maintain the productive capacity of the small shipyardswhich specialised in this type of work. Total suspension of theminesweeper programme would aggravate the effect which the cancellation of other defence orders would have in Northern Ireland.There was general support for the view that, while further ordersfor the construction of minesweepers should be limited to 24 asproposed in C. (54) 329, these orders should be adjusted over a periodof four years in such a way as to mitigate the effects which this changeof programme would have on the small shipyards specialising in this type of work.Strategic (h) There was general agreement that plans for the withdrawalReserve. of forces from overseas stations to re-constitute the strategic army reserve in the United Kingdom should, wherever possible, be-expedited. In the present international situation, however, furtherwithdrawal of troops from Hong Kong should not proceed for thetime being. In considering whether the withdrawal from the canal zone could be accelerated, special consideration should be given tothe effect which such an alteration of existing plans might have onthe civilian contractors who had, reluctantly, undertaken to assume responsibility for the maintenance of the base installations there.
Austria. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment had expressed surprise that we had not consulted them before deciding in 1953 to reduce the strength of the British forces in Austriato one battalion. They had suggested that, as British and american troops had been withdrawn from Trieste, we might how send anadditional battalion to Austria. If we were willing to do this, theywould increase their forces in Austria by two battalions.The Foreign Secretary said that he was doubtful whether therewere sufficient military reasons for increasing our military strength un austria; and, from the political point of view, he deprecated thisproposal, which would not be welcomed by the Austrian Government.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it would bestrategically unsound for the Western Allies to station any largerforces&quot; in Austria. It &quot;would be specially unwise to &quot;send there asecond British battalion without logistic support.&quot;In discussion it was suggested that in our reply to the UnitedStates Government the point might be made that we could not increasethe commitment&quot; we had recently accepted to station four divisions on the Continent of Europe; and that the military authorities of theNorth Atlantic Alliance, if they wished to see alarger force in Austria,should consider whether this could be provided by transfer from theforces now in Germany.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should reject thesuggestion that a second British battalion be sent to austria; and invited him to settle in consultation with theMinister of Defence the terms of the reply to be;sent to theUnited States Government on this question.Colonial (/) There was general support for the proposal in paragraph 20Force): of G. (54) 329 that local Colonial forces and, in particular, Colonialpolice and security services, should be enlarged and improved.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with the FirstLord of the Admiralty, to consider further the strategicrole of the Fleet Air Arm and the manner in which heavyaircraft carriers could best be equipped to fulfil their partin this role.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theMinister of Supply and the Service Departments, to concert proposals for mitigating the impact on employ-ment in the aircraft industry of the reduction to be madein the number of aircraft ordered for the Fleet Air Arm.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to collaborate - with theChancellor of the Exchequer in scrutinising the defence estimates of the Service Departments, with a view to bringing expenditure on defence during 1955 within atotal of  1,525 millions, excluding the costs of our forcesin Germany.(4) Subject to the foregoing conclusions, agreed that defence policy and programmes should be revised in accordancewith the recommendations in C. (54) 250 as adjusted bythe further recommendations in C. (54) 329&apos;.
Formosa.(previous reference:CC. (54) 69thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that it was becoming increasinglydoubtful whether it would be practicable to proceed with the plan for discussing Quemoy in the Security Council. The United StatesGovernment were negotiating their proposed treaty of mutual defence with Nationalist China and, though he had not seen the text, he understood that it was unlikely to include any provision designed toprevent Formosa being used as a privileged sanctuary for harassingthe mainland. Disclosure of the terms of the proposed treaty mightwell have the effect of increasing international tension in the far east and creating a state of public opinion in which it would be evenmore difficult to promote a settlement of the Quemoy question.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.uganda protectorate.(previous reference:CC (54) 70thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Colonial Secretary said that the Chief Justice of Ugandahad delivered his verdict in the action challenging the grounds onwhich the United Kingdom Government had withdrawn theirrecognition of the Kabaka. The judgment was long and complicated,and it was difficult to judge its import from the summary published in the Press. He therefore wished to defer any advice to the Cabineton the course which should now be followed until he had been ableto study the full text of the judgment, which would be available tohim later in the day.The Cabinet Agreed to defer their consideration of future policy inrespect of the Buganda Province until the Colonial secretary had been able to study the full text of the judgment givenby the Chief Justice of Uganda.industrial 5.   The Minister of Labour said that he was seriously concernedDisputes. about the industrial situation. New difficulties were arising in theLondon docks, partly over the employment of tally-clerks notbelonging to a trade union and partly over the dockers&apos; claim thatlorry drivers who were not union members should not be allowed towork within the docks. It was possible that these difficulties might lead to further stoppages of work in the docks. There were alsopossibilities of strike action by employees of municipal &apos;bus under -takings and by footplate workers on the railways. All these disputesconcerned the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union. In addition,there was now some talk of strike action with a view to acceleratinga settlement of the wages claim in the engineering industry. A strikewas already in progress among steel workers on building sites inLondon.In all these disputes there was a common element of challenge to Right-wing leadership in the Trade Union movement, and thesituation was the more disquieting on this account.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
