3o^Colonial 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that he was proposing to publishService. later in the week a paper describing certain changes which were to bemade in the organisation of the Colonial Service, and he wasintending to give a brief description of these in a public speech on17th June. His plan for the reorganisation of the Service had beendiscussed with the Ministers directly concerned; but the PrimeMinister had considered that all members of the Cabinet should havean opportunity to comment on it before it was publicly announced.Copies of his paper were therefore being circulated to the Cabinet(C. (54) 200) and, if any of his colleagues wished to have an oppor-tunity of discussing this plan before it was announced, he would beglad if he could be so informed in the course of the following day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the commonwealth secretary said that they fully supported the proposed changes in theorganisation of the Colonial Service.The Cabinet Took note that the Colonial Secretary would circulate a. summary of his proposals for the reorganisation of the- Colonial Service, and that he should be informed&apos; in thecourse of the following day if any of his colleagues wishedto have an opportunity of discussing these proposals before they were made public.3. The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary washoping to be able to return from the Geneva Conference on 17th or18th June. Meanwhile, their projected visit to Washington had, atthe suggestion of President Eisenhower, been postponed for a week:it was not now intended that they should leave for Washington untilthe evening of 24th June. Thus, as events had turned out, it wouldbe possible for the Foreign Secretary to accompany him to washington without detriment to the work of the geneva conference.It was proposed that a statement on the results of the conference should be made by the Foreign Secretary in the House of commons on 22nd June. The Foreign Secretary had hoped that it might bepossible to avoid a debate on this subject. In discussion, however,it was pointed out that it was some considerable time since foreignaffairs had been debated in the House of Commons, and that therewould be strong pressure for such a debate on the foreign secretary&apos;s return, especially when it was known that he and thePrime Minister were about to visit Washington. It was the general view of the Cabinet that in these circumstances pressure for a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons could not reasonably be resisted. It might, however, be more convenient for the foreign secretary if his statement were made on 22nd June and debated onthe following day, for in that event it might be unnecessary for himto open the debate.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would make an announce-ment in the House of Commons that afternoon about the visit which he and the Foreign Secretary were to make to Washington.Foreign Affairs.(Previous   &apos;Reference:C.C. (54) 39thConclusions, .Minute 3.)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.

China.diplomatic relations.(previous reference:CC. (54) 39thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. At their meeting on 5th June the Cabinet had asked theForeign Secretary to seek some means of deferring, until after the geneva Conference, the appointment of a Chinese representative inLondon to discuss practical arrangements for establishing diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and China.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Secretary was nowdisposed to arrange this with the Chinese Foreign Minister while hewas in Geneva. As stated in Geneva telegram No. 658, he feared that the breakdown of the Geneva Conference was likely to place a renewed strain on our relations with China; and, if we were prepared in principle to accept a Chinese diplomatic representative in London,(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the foreign secretary of the Cabinefs view that it was unlikely to bepossible to deny the House of Commons an opportunityto debate foreign affairs before his departure forWashington.
there was much to be said for accepting the Chinese offer at once inorder to show that we intended to maintain a working relationship with them. There was admittedly some risk that this might give riseto misunderstanding in the United States; but General Bedell Smith,to whom the possibility had been mentioned in private conversation,had not thought that it was likely to have any serious effect on Anglo-American relations (Geneva telegram No. 693).The Minister of State said that the premature disclosure of this possibility in the Daily Express that morning was perhaps a furtherreason for taking a final decision and making an official announce-ment without delay.In discussion the point was made that the Labour government&apos;s decision to recognise the Chinese People&apos;s Government in 1950 had proved a continuing source of embarrassment in Anglo-american relations. Those relations were likely to be further damaged byanything which could be represented as a step towards still closercontacts between the United Kingdom and Communist China.Therefore, while we could not reasonably reject the Chinese offer tosend to London a representative with functions identical with thoseof our representative in Peking, nothing should be said which might give the impression that the functions of both these representatives would be progressively enlarged. In particular, it seemed inappropriate-priate that this representative should be described as Charged&apos;Affaires.The Minister of State explained that we had consistentlydescribed our representative in Peking as Charge d&apos;Affaires, though he had not in fact discharged that function. It therefore seemeddifficult to deny the same title to a Chinese representative who wasto occupy the same position in London. He would, however, ascer-tain whether the Foreign Secretary would be willing that the arrange-ments should be described, in any public announcement, as theappointment to London of &quot; a Chinese diplomatic representative-having the same position as our representative in Peking.&quot;Later in the meeting the Minister of State reported to the Cabinetthe views which the Foreign Secretary had expressed on this point,which he had put to him in a telephone conversation. The foreign secretary thought it inevitable that the Chinese representative inLondon should be described as Charge d&apos;Affaires, since we had alwaysinsisted on so describing our own representative in Peking. Hethought, however, that the point which the Cabinet had in mindcould be met by making it clear in the announcement that the Chineserepresentative would have the same position as the British Charged&apos;Affaires in Peking.In further discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinetthat the Foreign Secretary should be authorised to accept the Chineseoffer to send a representative to London with the function of dis-cussing practical arrangements for establishing diplomatic relationsbetween the United Kingdom and China. It was, however, suggestedthat it would be helpful, with a view to avoiding further misunder-standing in the United States, if the public announcement of thisarrangement included the statement (proposed in paragraph 8 ofGeneva telegram No. 658) that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations would remain a matter for negotiation between the twoGovernments.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to accept the Chinese offer to send a representative to London with the function of discussing practical arrangements for establishing diplo-matic relations between the United Kingdom and China.(2) Invited the Minister of State to put to the Foreign secretary the views which had been expressed in the Cabinefs dis-cussion regarding the form in which the announcementof this appointment should be made.
jo?Residence of foreigners inthe UnitedKingdom.Dr. JosephCort.6. The Prime Minister invited the Home Secretary to informthe Cabinet of the circumstances underlying his refusal to extend theperiod for which Dr. Joseph Cort and his wife had permission toremain in the United Kingdom.The Home Secretary said that Dr. Cort was a United Statescitizen who had arrived in this country in June 1951 and was employed as a lecturer in physiology at the University of Birmingham.He had been a member of the Communist Party in the United States,and had established and maintained Communist connections since his arrival in this country. It was now alleged against him by theAmerican authorities that he had left the United States for thepurpose of evading military service, and it was likely that on this account he would be deprived of his United States citizenship. Inthat event it would not be practicable to enforce his departure fromthis country if at some later date it was decided that his continuedpresence here was for any reason undesirable. It would thereforebe prudent to ensure that he left this country before he lost his UnitedStates citizenship.The Home Secretary said that he must reject the argument that dr. Cort was entitled to claim political asylum in this country. Hecould not admit that any person could properly claim political asylumhere unless his life or liberty was in danger in his own country.After weighing all the circumstances he was satisfied that his proper course was to maintain his refusal to extend the period for which Dr.. Cort and his wife had permission to remain in the UnitedKingdom.In discussion there was general support for the course whichthe Home Secretary was proposing to take, although it was recognisedthat this was likely to provoke some controversy.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Home Secretary&apos;s statementof his reasons for declining the application of Dr. JosephCort for permission to prolong his stay in the UnitedKingdom.Parliament. 7.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the CabinetExpenses of     had invited him on 5th June to submit for their consideration pro-Members,       posals for a system of cash allowances for Members. He had worked(Previous        out a scheme for cash reimbursement of Members&apos; expenses withinReference:      an annual limit of  250 or  300 under which payment would beCC. (54) 39th   made on request and without certification of detailed expenditure.Conclusions.    But the other Ministers with whom he had discussed this scheme had minute 4.)       taken the view that no form of lump sum allowance would be accept-able to Government supporters, and that the only practicable scheme would be one of subsistence allowances under which Members wouldbe enabled to draw an allowance of, say,  2 for each night spentaway from home in the discharge of their Parliamentary duties whileParliament was sitting. Members attending at Westminster on a fullsitting day but not absent from their homes at night would be entitledto draw a day subsistence allowance of, say, 12^. 6d. His first plan was undoubtedly the simpler one but there were precedents for ascheme of subsistence allowances in the case not only of members. of local councils in this country but of members of the AustralianParliament.  If the Cabinet should favour such a scheme of sub-sistence allowances, it might be announced in general terms and thedetails left for explanation in a White Paper.   The announcementought also, in his view, to give some indication that it was the Govern-menfs intention to improve the remuneration of Junior Ministersbefore the end of the year, and that the Government were in touchwith the trustees of the Members&apos; Fund about the special problemsof elderly Members.  As the Government had laid special emphasis
on the fact that this was a House of Commons matter, it wouldprobably be desirable to sound Opposition leaders informally about any scheme of subsistence allowances before any announcement wasmade. The Government ought also to consider, before deciding to go forward with such a scheme, what were the chances of its beingapproved by a majority in the House of Commons and what coursethey would adopt if it should fail to secure approval. They wouldcertainly be pressed to say when they contemplated that an increasein Members&apos; salaries, as recommended by the Select Committee,would be possible, and to this the reply must presumably be that anincrease was unlikely to prove practicable at least during the present parliament.In discussion the Cabinet recognised that among government supporters, alike in the House of Commons and in the country,opposition to any direct increase in the remuneration of members had hardened still further since before the Whitsun Recess and thatthis opposition was likely to extend to any scheme of lump sumallowances, which could be represented as being no different froma salary increase. Even a scheme of subsistence allowances was unlikely to be popular in the Conservative Party, but at least it wouldbe readily understandable and would offer the best chance of rallyingGovernment supporters both in the House of Commons and in thecountry.If such a scheme was to be proceeded with, the next steps mustbe to sound opinion upon it in the Executive Committee of the 1922Committee and, if that should prove to be generally favourable, toendeavour thereafter to obtain its acceptance by the opposition leaders. Their attitude might be not unfavourable if it were made clear to them, as it must be, that the Government would not be ableto do anything to improve Members&apos; remuneration at the presenttime if sufficient support for a scheme of subsistence allowances wasnot forthcoming. It would not be reasonable that the Government-should accept the sole responsibility for making an improvement inMembers&apos; emoluments for which the demand came principally fromOpposition Members.The Cabinet recalled that they had earlier inclined to the viewthat at the next stage the Government must assume responsibilityfor executive action and be prepared, if necessary, to carry their proposals with the support of the Government Whips. As matters had turned out, however, it might now be inevitable that any schemeof subsistence allowances should be submitted for approval by a free vote of the House. Government supporters had been led to believethat it was the Government^ intention to allow a free vote at eachstage in the determination of this matter, in accordance with certainearlier precedents.On the details of the proposed scheme of subsistence allowancesit was agreed that these should be made payable only in respect ofabsence from home in the discharge of Parliamentary duties at westminster and should not be payable in respect of nights spent intheir constituencies in the country by Members with homes inLondon. This would be in keeping with what would be required ifsubsistence allowances were later extended to members of the Houseof Lords. It was further agreed that no reference should be made inthe proposed announcement to the possible institution of a postageor stationery allowance as either an addition or an alternative to theproposed scheme of subsistence allowances.The Prime Minister said that it was clearly desirable that, ifpossible, a statement should be made on this matter in Parliament on21st June. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should thereforeprepare as soon as possible the drafts of a statement in general terms,to be made in the House of Commons by the Lord Privy Seal, and ofa detailed White Paper to be laid when the statement was made.When these documents were available, the necessary consultations should be held with Government supporters and thereafter with opposition leaders.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th June, 1954.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the Government should putforward a scheme of subsistence allowances for Membersof the House of Commons on the general basis outlined in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare drafts ofa Parliamentary announcement about such a scheme, ingeneral terms, and of a White Paper explaining the detailsof the scheme, to be published when the proposed statement was made.(3) Took note that steps would be taken to sound opinion among Government supporters on the proposed schemeof subsistence allowances and thereafter to ascertain whether the leaders of the Opposition would be ready toaccept it.
