Parliament.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Industrial 2.   The Minister of Labour said that he and the Minister of disputes.        Transport had considered the proposed Government announcementRailways.       on the railway wages dispute in the light of the points raised in the(Previous        Cabinefs discussion on the previous day.  Copies of a revised draftReference:      which they had prepared were handed round at the meeting.  TheyCC. (54) 87th   now proposed that the announcement should take the form of a conclusions,    letter to the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.), which would minute 3.)       be given to the Press immediately after it had been delivered.  Theyhad considered whether the statement by the Chairman of theTransport Commission should be incorporated in the letter orpublished separately; but they favoured the first course, since theonly indication that the railwaymen might secure some advantageby continuing the normal processes of negotiation was containedin the final paragraph of the Chairman&apos;s statement. That paragraphhad been further revised since the Cabinefs last discussion, and itwas now proposed that it should read as follows: &quot; If the railway staff National Tribunal should conclude that the N.U.R. claim shouldbe met in whole or in part, the Commission propose to consult withthe Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation on any consequences which acceptance of such a recommendation might entail in relationto their statutory duties under the Transport Act, 1947.&quot;The concluding portion of the draft had been modified, inaccordance with the Cabinefs request, so as to bring out more clearly the reasons why the Government considered that the railwaymenshould allow the processes of collective bargaining to take their normal course.The Minister said that he was satisfied that this was the right course to take at the present stage in the dispute, despite the risk that it might provoke the issue of strike notices.The Minister of Transport concurred in this view, though hethought it more likely than not that, on the receipt of such a letter,the Union would proceed to call a strike.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thecourse proposed by the Ministers of Labour and Transport. Onthe timing of the proposed reply, it was pointed out that, if the letterwere received by the Union before the week-end, mass meetings of protest might be held by railwaymen throughout the country on sunday, 19th December. It was therefore agreed that the letter should be delivered during the afternoon of 20th December and published in the morning newspapers on the following day.The Cabinet i(1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to send a written reply,in the terms of the draft approved by the Cabinet, to the representations made by the deputation from the NationalUnion of Railwaymen which he had received on13th December.(2) Agreed that this reply should be delivered during the afternoon of 20th December and published in the Presson the following day.
o ( 5CC. 88 (54)BritishEuropeanAirways.RenfrewMaintenanceBase.(previous reference:CC. (54) 78thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet again considered, in the light of memoranda by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (54) 374) andthe President of the Board of Trade and Minister of Supply(C. (54) 377), the proposal of British European Airways (B.E.A.) to close their maintenance base at Renfrew and transfer the remainingwork to London Airport.In discussion there was some support for the view that, although a strong case could be made for the proposed move on commercialgrounds, there were sound reasons which would justify theGovernment in pressing B.E.A. not to proceed with it at the presenttime. The withdrawal of their maintenance work from Renfrewwould arouse strong feelings in Scotland, which would be reflectedon both sides of the House of Commons. Moreover, if no alternativemaintenance work on aircraft could be provided at Renfrew, the resulting unemployment, in conjunction with the redundancy alreadyoccurring through reduction of the activities of Rolls Royce Ltd.at Larkhall, would create an awkward industrial situation in this area. B.E.A. might be urged to retain their maintenance work atRenfrew for strategic reasons, which might be held to weigh againsta proposal to concentrate additional skilled work on aircraftmaintenance in the London area. The sum of  160,000 a year whichB.E.A. expected to save by the proposed move would be a smallprice to pay for avoiding increased vulnerability.Other Ministers thought it more important that the Governmentshould refrain from urging an uneconomic course upon a nationalisedundertaking which was already operating at a loss. If B.E.A. were pressed to take this course on grounds of national policy, they would expect the Government to bear the additional cost involved; but theGovernment could not accept such a charge without graveembarrassment in their efforts to persuade private firms to move to development areas, without Government assistance, in the interestsof a sound distribution of industry. It would, in fact, be difficult tojustify prevention of the proposed move on strategic grounds.Renfrew airport was to be retained and, indeed, developed; and itwas the Governmenfs intention, if B.E.A.&apos;s move took place, to try to ensure the continuance of a comparable volume of work on aircraftmaintenance at Renfrew. In the event of war B.E.A.&apos;s normalservices would be suspended and the Corporation^ aircraft and baseswould be taken over for Government purposes. In any case Renfrewwas situated in a highly industrialised area, which must be regardedas scarcely less vulnerable than London.There was reason to believe that, if it were known that thepremises now occupied by B.E.A. at Renfrew would become availablefor early occupation by an alternative tenant, air work Ltd. would enter into a contract for repair work on Canadian military aircraft which they desired to carry out at Renfrew. The case for allowingB.E.A. to remove their maintenance work to London would be greatly strengthened if there were a firm assurance that continuingemployment would be provided at Renfrew for the majority of theworkers now employed there by B.E.A. The Government might reasonably encourage B.E.A. to accept the additional loss involvedin postponing their move until arrangements could be made to ensurethat there was no interruption of employment for the majority oftheir present employees. It was, however, important that the moveshould begin at a fairly early date as it would take three months tocomplete and could not conveniently be carried out during the summer months when B.E.A.&apos;s flying operations were at their height.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Supply to inform air work Ltd.privately that there was no reason to doubt that, if theyshould obtain a contract with Canadair Ltd. for the repair of Royal Canadian Air Force Sabre aircraft, they
would be able to secure a lease of the premises at Renfrewat present occupied by B.E.A., and to try to obtain from them a firm assurance that on this basis they were confident of obtaining such a contract and would, in theevent of their doing so, take a lease of Renfrewmaintenance base.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to report to the Cabinet theresults of his discussions with air work Ltd., and agreedto resume their consideration of this question when his report was available.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th December, 1954.
