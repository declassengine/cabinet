High 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Com-Conunission commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 216) covering the text of three territories. communications recently exchanged with the South African Govern-(Previous ment and the draft of a fuller statement which he had promised to reference: send to Dr. Malan setting out the reasons for which the UnitedC.C. (54) 34th Kingdom Government were unwilling to enter into negotiations at conclusions. the present time for the transfer of the High Commission TerritoriesMinute 5.) to South Africa.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, while the messagereproduced in Annex III of his paper had served to prevent Dr. Malanfrom taking precipitate action, there was ground for believing thatthe South African Government intended to exploit for domesticpolitical purposes our refusal to discuss the transfer of the Territories.It was therefore desirable that we should place on record a full state-ment of our case, correcting the misrepresentations in Dr. Malan&apos;message and explaining how the present situation differed from thatobtaining at the time of the negotiations with the South african government before the war. If our attitude were publicly mis-represented by the South African Government, it might becomedesirable that this statement should be published. A draft of the communication which he now proposed to send to the South african government was set out in Annex IV of C. (54) 216.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) We were pledged to ascertain and consider the wishes of theinhabitants of the High Commission Territories before any transfer took place. We had, however, avoided giving any undertaking about the manner in which their wisheswould be ascertained. It seemed important that the termsof any further message to Dr. Malan should not imply thattransfer could take place only with the express consentof the inhabitants.(b) In the first sentence of paragraph .12 of the draft it was stated that it had been common ground between the twoGovernments that transfer would not take place unless,in the words of General Hertzog, the inhabitants &quot; areprepared and desire to come in.&quot; This phrase datedfrom discussions in 1925 and went rather further than the pledge to consult, recorded in paragraph 6 of the draft,which had followed discussions with General Hertzog in1935. It might be better that these two statements should^ be brought together in any revised version of the draft.(c) There might be advantage in re-drafting paragraphs 11 and12 so as to soften some of the references to the effect which the current native policy of the South african government would have on the wishes of the inhabitants of the Territories. It was necessary to make the point that this policy had produced a change in the situation,but the point might perhaps be made less directly by stating the current attitude of the inhabitants and the consequent unwillingness of the United Kingdom Parlia-ment to assent to transfer at the present time. It wouldthen be possible to omit the second sentence of paragraph11 of the draft and to simplify the form of the third andfourth sentences of paragraph 12.(d) There was some risk that the references in paragraphs 11 and12 would be construed in South Africa as criticisms bythe United Kingdom Government of the apartheid policyof the South African Government. In the earliermessages which we had sent to South Africa, as also in theearlier paragraphs of the draft, the emphasis had been as much on the attitude of the United Kingdom Parlia-ment as on that of the inhabitants of the Territories. Itmight on this account be desirable to alter the emphasisin paragraphs 11 and 12 of the draft.46481 b 2
The Cabinet-Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to revise, in the lightof their discussion, the draft of his proposed communication to the South African Government regarding the transfer ofthe High Commission Territories to the Union, and tosubmit a revised draft for consideration by the Cabinet at alater meetina.Parliament. 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet of expenses of the outcome of discussions which had been held with representativesMembers. of the Opposition on the question of Members&apos; expenses. He had(Previous first seen Mr. Attlee alone and thereafter, in company with the LordReference: Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, had had a further discussion with c.C. (54) 45th Mr. Attlee, Mr. Morrison and the Opposition Chief Whip. He had conclusions, made it clear to them that, although the Government were anxiousMinute 5.) to secure the widest possible measure of support in the House for any settlement which might be arrived at, the matter was one on whichthe final decision must rest with the Government. The Oppositionrepresentatives had put forward two main criticisms of the proposed scheme of subsistence allowances first, the differentiation which itwould involve between Members who lived in and outside Londonand, secondly, the direct linking of the allowance with attendance atthe House. Thus, they had represented that the total expenditure ofMembers living in London was certainly not less than that ofMembers living outside, and that the linking of the proposedallowance to actual attendance would lead in practice to abuses whichwould bring the scheme into disrepute. Ministers had put the case for these particular features of the scheme as forcibly as they could,but Mr. Attlee and his colleagues had remained unconvinced. It was clear that they keenly desired some amelioration of the position oftheir less well-to-do Members and they would almost certainlyaccept, if somewhat grudgingly, a scheme for payment of a sessionalallowance for all Members alike at a flat rate of  2 a day for four days a week while the House was in session. Such an allowancecould be made payable monthly on application, and Members shouldbe required to deduct the sum which they received in such allowancesduring any one year from the total figure of their expenses on whichthey claimed tax relief on their existing Parliamentary salary, there seemed to be a fair prospect that an agreed settlement of the problem could now be brought about on these lines.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that the Opposition leaders were clearly anxious to reach a settlement on this issue.The Chief Whip said that he thought it likely that government supporters in the House generally would accept a scheme on thelines suggested, which would represent a compromise between sub-sistence allowances in the strict sense and cash re-imbursement of expenses. He thought it important, however, that the proposedallowance should retain a subsistence flavour by being expressedin terms of so much per sitting day and being related to periods when parliament was in session.While there was general agreement that a settlement of theproblem should be sought on the lines now contemplated, there wassupport for the view that in the presentation of the modified schemeto the public it would be important to preserve, so far as possible,the description of the proposed allowance as a subsistence allowance,and to make it clear that it would not in practice amount to a nettax-free addition to Members&apos; emoluments owing to the correspond-ing reduction in the figure for expenses in respect of which members were entitled to claim tax relief on their existing Parliamentaryallowances. Emphasis should also be laid on the fact that theproposed allowance would not be paid automatically but on applica-tion by Members, who must be relied on not to claim more by wayof the new allowance than could be justified by the record of their activities during the Parliamentary session.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the exact terms inwhich the proposed arrangement was to be expressed were clearly ofgreat importance and he would prepare a draft of a parliamentary statement for the Cabinefs consideration.The Cabinet-CD Agreed in principle that discussions with Opposition leadersshould be continued on the basis of a modified scheme of subsistence allowances of the kind outlined in the cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would circulate for their consideration a draft of the statementexplaining the proposed scheme which might be made inthe House of Commons at the appropriate time.Housing 3.   The Minister of Housing said that he had announced to the subsidies.       House of Commons his intention to reduce the general standard rate(Previous        of housing subsidy from  26 145. Od. to  22 Is. Od.  The necessaryReference:      affirmative resolution need not be obtained until shortly beforeC.C. (54) 39th   1st April, 1955, when the reduction of the subsidy was due to takeConclusions,    effect.   If, however, the laying of the draft Order were delayed,Minute 5.)       pressure would develop for modification of the proposed reductionof subsidy.   Under the Housing (Financial and miscellaneous provisions) Act, 1946, the affirmative resolution had to be passedwithin forty days of the laying of the draft Order (excluding periods of prorogation longer than four days).  If, therefore, the draft Orderwere laid at an early date, as he desired, time for a debate upon itwould have to be made available before the end of the present session.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was important notto jeopardise the satisfactory settlement of this matter for which theMinister was working.The Lord Privy Seal said that he could agree to the laying of thenecessary Order on the understanding that no Government time couldbe made available for a debate upon it before the summer recess. Ifthe Opposition should wish for an earlier debate, they would them-selves have to make a Supply Day available for the purpose.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Housing to lay before Parlia-ment the draft of an Order under the Housing (Financialand Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946, to reduce thegeneral standard rate of housing subsidy.Civil Aviation. 4. The Minister of Housing said that he had now received theDevelopment of report of the public enquiry into the proposed extension of GatwickGatwick Airport; and he was about to be asked, by Parliamentary Question,Airport. when the report would be published. The Government could either(Previous        publish the report at once, or defer its publication until they were in reference:      a position to announce their final decision on the development ofC.C. (53) 44th   the Airport.  Several months might elapse, however, before a final conclusions,    decision was reached; and long delay in the publication of the reportMinute 3.)       might arouse suspicion that it contained some recommendations ofspecial significance.   He was therefore disposed to favour early publication of the report, and the Minister of Civil Aviation was ofthe same opinion.
The Cabinet Agreed that the report of the public enquiry into the pro-posed extension of Gatwick Airport should be publishedwithout delay, and authorised the Minister of Housing to reply accordingly to the Parliamentary Question which hewas due to answer that afternoon.Road Traffic. 5.   The Lord President said that the Press seemed to haveUnderground obtained the impression that the Government were favourably dis-Car Parks. posed towards the project for providing underground car parks in central London. It was true that the Home Affairs Committee had authorised the Minister of Transport to appoint consultants to draw up plans and estimates for three such car parks, but they had done sosolely in order that the Government might be in a better position to judge what merit there was in this project. It had not been intended that the Government should be committed in any way to a policy ofproviding underground car parks in London; and the majority of theHome Affairs Committee had not in fact been favourably disposed towards such a policy.The Cabinet Took note of the Lord Presidents statement.FJmance Bill. 6.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer sought the Cabinefs adviceEstate Duty.     on the attitude which he should adopt towards a new clause which mr. Dalton, M.P., was proposing to move during the Report Stage, of the Finance Bill.  This would remove all liability to estate dutyon estates below  3,000 and would reduce the duty payable onestates up to  4,000. It would cost  400,000 in the current year and about  1 million in a full year. This would be a popular change, andno very strong arguments could be developed against it. TheChancellor said that, subject to his colleagues&apos; views, he was disposed to. accept the substance of the proposal and to bring forward aGovernment clause which would express it more accurately than thattabled by Mr. Dalton.In discussion it was suggested that acceptance of this Oppositionproposal might not be popular with those Government supporters whoadvocated on economic grounds a more general reduction in the ratesof estate duty. It was also pointed out that the proposal was in line with the general Socialist doctrine that the poorer sections of thecommunity should be entirely exempt from direct taxation.It was, however, the preponderant view in the Cabinet that theChancellor of the Exchequer might accept the substance of this amendment if he were satisfied, by the discreet enquiries which hewas proposing to make, that this course would be acceptable to amajority of interested Government supporters.The Cabinet-Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would take steps to ascertain whether there was any substantial bodyof opinion among Government supporters which would behostile to the acceptance of Mr. Dalton&apos;s proposal for reducing the amount of estate duty payable on the smallestestates; and authorised the Chancellor to accept thesubstance of this proposal, during the Report Stage of theFinance Bill, if he were satisfied that this course would be acceptable to Government supporters generally.
Ceylon. 7.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that a motion had beenAppointment tabled in the Ceylon Parliament proposing that the appointment ofof Governor- Sir Oliver Goonetilleke as Governor-General of Ceylon should be general. deferred pending the outcome of investigations into allegationsagainst Mr. N. U. Jayawardena, Governor of the Central Bank of ceylon. It had been alleged that Mr. Jayawardena had been guilty of irregularities in the conduct of his office, and he had respondedby alleging that Sir Oliver Goonetilleke had been guilty of mis-conduct while holding office as Minister of Finance. It was to beassumed that the Commission of Enquiry which had now beenappointed to investigate the charges against Mr. Jayawardena wouldalso examine the allegations made against Sir Oliver Goonetilleke.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the commonwealth secretary.Government 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following the loans. success of the conversion loan issued on 1st May, a new operation(Previous        was now being launched to deal with the  535 millions of 1J per cent.Reference:      Serial Funding Stock maturing in November, 1954, by offering con-C.C. (54) 37th   version into either a ten-year security (2\ per cent. Exchequer StockConclusions,     1963-64) or a fifty-year security (3  per cent. Funding Stock 1999-minute.)       2004).   This would be the first Government loan in the marketmaturing in the 21st century; and our ability to issue such a long-termGovernment loan should enhance Government credit at home andabroad.  It should also go some way to meet the argument that atleast some of the money required by the State to finance long-terminvestment should be raised by long-term borrowing.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th July, 1954.
