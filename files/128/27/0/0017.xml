Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet considered forthcoming business in the HouseBusiness in the  of Commons.House ofCommons. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Opposition mightmove the adjournment of the House that afternoon in order to debate the new constitutional arrangements in Kenya which were outlined inthe Governors telegram No. 224 of 9th March. These had been announced to the Press in Nairobi that morning. The proposals,which included provision for the establishment of a Council ofMinisters comprising, apart from official and nominated members,three European, two Asian and one African unofficial members, hadnot proved acceptable to the African and Arab representatives, or to a minority of the European representatives. He was advised that these changes could be brought into operation by amendment of preroga-tive instruments and without recourse to Parliament; and the Speakermight therefore be ready to agree to an immediate adjournment ofthe House on the ground that Parliament would otherwise be deniedan effective opportunity of debating them. The necessary arrange-ments for handling a debate, if it were to take place, were already in train.The Cabinet next considered how best to handle the debate onthe following motion to be moved by Mrs. Castle, M.P. on the army estimates:  &quot; To call attention to the living conditions of the troops inthe Canal Zone in Egypt; and to move, That this House, notingthe deterioration since 1951 in the living conditions of our troopsin the Canal Zone due to the uncertainty as to the future of the base, deplores the Governments handling of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations which has prolonged this uncertainty, andurges that the withdrawal of our troops and equipment should begin forthwith.&quot; &apos;The Cabinet were informed that it was now understood to beMrs. Castle&apos;s intention to delete from her motion the words &quot; andurges that the withdrawal of our troops and equipment should beginforthwith,&quot; presumably with the intention of making it easier fordissident Government supporters to make speeches critical of theGovernments handling of the situation in the Canal Zone.The Foreign Secretary said that, if the debate were to concentrate on the wider issues raised by the motion, it would be for considera-tion whether he should intervene in support of the government&apos;s policy on negotiations with Egypt.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Governmentshould do nothing to encourage the conversion of what should be theannual review of the affairs of the Army into a debate on foreignaffairs. The principal Government spokesman in the debate should therefore be the Secretary of State for War, who should confine his speech to military matters and should decline to be drawn into widerproblems of foreign policy. An indication might be given to the speaker that it was not the Foreign Secretary&apos;s intention to be present during the debate, as he assumed that it would be directed tothe affairs of the Army.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theweek beginning 15th March.The Cabinet were also informed that it was at present intended that the Second Reading of the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill should betaken on 23rd March.
Persian Gulf.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)Sharjah.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (D. (54) 13) seeking authority for the withdrawalof a squadron of the R.A.F. Regiment from Sharjah on the Trucialcoast of the Persian Gulf by 31st March, 1954.The Foreign Secretary said that it was of the first importance atthe present time that British troops should continue to be stationed at Sharjah. This limited demonstration of strength was an important factor in the current negotiations with the Saudi Arabian Govern-ment on the current frontier dispute in the area. It was also crucialto our interest in oil development in the Persian Gulf.The Minister of Defence said that, so long as new commitmentswere added and none of the existing commitments were reduced, hecould not hope to meet the requests of the Chancellor of theExchequer for a reduction in overseas military expenditure. the climate at Sharjah was such that, if a British force was to remain thereafter 31st March, much better accommodation than that at present available would have to be urgently provided for it.The Secretary of State for Air confirmed that the climate wasthat, if British troops were to remain there indefinitely, permanent accommodation must be provided for them. He hoped, however,that the R.A.F. Regiment, whose reserves were at full stretch, wouldnot be required to provide the force required after 31st March.The Prime Minister said that this was clearly a commitment which must be accepted and the troops to be stationed at Sharjahmust be prepared to accept, if necessary, a considerable degree ofdiscomfort and inconvenience in carrying out their duty.The Minister of Defence said that in the circumstances he would arrange for the most suitable force which could be made available tobe stationed in Sharjah until further notice.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he was naturally reluctant to agree to any new overseas military commitment,he recognised the strength of the case for the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal and would be ready to co-operate with the Minister ofDefence in making the necessary arrangements. It must not beassumed, however, that a high standard of accommodation could beprovided for the troops in the immediate future.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for a suitableBritish force to remain in Sharjah after 31st March next.Road Safety. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (54) 87) suggestingmeasures for reducing road accidents; and a memorandum by theLord President (C. (54) 95) describing the help given in this by theRoad Research Organisation of the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research.The Minister of Transport said that 226,500 people had been killed and injured on the roads in 1953. That represented an increaseof 28 per cent, on 1949, and there was a danger that the figure wouldbe even higher in 1954. It was true that the number of vehicles onthe roads; had increased by 50 per cent, since 1934, and the popula-tion by 10 per cent.; but even so the public were justifiably critical of the failure to arrest the increase in road accidents. government action was necessarily limited in scope, but the precautions introduced in 1934, and the institution of zebra crossings in 1952, had checkedfor a time the rising accident trend. In his view the time had now come for further imaginative action by the Government. He didnot ask that the Cabinet should consider his proposals in detail, but
he hoped they would give general, approval to his method of approach to the problem. He was particularly anxious to make a full trial ofall the most promising road-safety measures in a medium-sized townand in a representative county. He would discuss the details andthe cost of this experiment with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand other Ministers concerned.The Lord President said that the Road Research organisation had done a considerable amount of work on the problem of reducingroad accidents and would be ready to assist the Minister of transport in any way possible in his Road Safety Campaign. Some localauthorities were reluctant to put into operation measures whichresearch had shown to be valuable aids to safety and it might become necessary for the Government to consider means of making some ofthese obligatory.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the approach to the problem of road safety proposed by the Minister of Transport in C. (54) 87.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to discuss the details ofthe various schemes with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand other Ministers concerned.european defence community.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 93) on the form of United Kingdom association with the European Defence Community (E.D.C.).The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet were now aware ofthe text of the statement (Washington telegram No. 405) whichPresident Eisenhower proposed to make at the appropriate time onthe attitude of the United States to the E.D.C. This statement was generally helpful, but he felt that the United Kingdom would haveto give more precise undertakings if the French were to be persuaded to ratify the E.D.C. Treaty. He therefore proposed that we should offer two assurances of major importance. We should express our readiness to maintain, for the next few years, the present fightingcapacity of the United Kingdom forces on the Continent and should add that, although the introduction of new weapons might call forsome variation in the size and shape of our forces, we had no inten-tion of withdrawing from the Continent so long as the threat existedto the security of Western Europe and to the E.D.C. The second and more precise assurance was to offer to put a British armoured division under command of an E.D.C. corps, if the Supreme allied commander, Europe, agreed on operational grounds, and to keep it there so long as he wanted. There was reason to think that this undertaking, though militarily inconvenient, would have a decisiveinfluence in persuading the French to proceed to ratification.The Foreign Secretary said that, apart from these major assur-ances, he would like to add that we welcomed the suggestion thatthe German Service Organisation should be converted into an E.D.C.unit, and that we were ready to discuss it in detail with the germans and other E.D.C. Governments; that we would help to sponsor inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) the proposal thatE.D.C. and NATO; should be co-terminous; and finally that weshould not regard France&apos;s entry to the E.D.C. as detracting in anyway from her status as a great Power. We should expect France toremain a member of the Standing Group: we would continue tomaintain the closest consultation with her on international problems and we would, if desired, set up formal machinery for this.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) An assurance that we would maintain the present fightingcapacity of United Kingdom forces on the, Continent for the nextfew years did not commit us to maintain there any specified number
of divisions and squadrons, and therefore left open the possibilityof some reduction in numbers if in the course of time developmentof new weapons made it possible to maintain the present fightingcapacity of our forces on the Continent with fewer men. This assur-ance was limited in time by the phrase &quot; the next few years &quot; which,though vague, was unlikely to prove a stumbling-block to the French.(b) There were considerable practical difficulties in placing aBritish armoured division under command of an E.D.C. corps for an indefinite period of time, and the attachment of this division to aforeign command would deprive the United Kingdom of some flexibility in the disposition of its own forces. Nevertheless thissacrifice would be worth while, if thereby we secured the ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that, once theE.D.C. came into being and the Germans were responsible for theirown defence budget, we should have to maintain our forces on theContinent at our own expense. This might eventually meanadditional defence expenditure of the order of  80 millions in foreign exchange. As it was impossible to increase the burden of defence expenditure, the result of the assurances which we were proposing to offer the French must be that British forces on the Continent,including the division under command of E.D.C., would have to beconsidered as a first charge on the defence budget, and that reduc-tions to offset the increased cost of maintaining those forces wouldhave to be found elsewhere.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to give the furtherassurances on United Kingdom association with theEuropean Defence Community set out in C. (54) 93.Government 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the offices. Minister of Works (C. (54) 88) seeking their views on the questionCarlton House whether he should proceed with the project, approved by the previousTerrace. Government, for re-building Carlton House Terrace as new offices for the Foreign Office.The Cabinet were informed that, if the Terrace were not re-builtlarge sums would have to be spent within the next ten years in orderto keep it from falling down. The Commissioners of Crown Lands,who owned the site, had decided on the advice of the Royal FineArt Commission that the Nash facade should be retained. This. . condition substantially increased the cost of re-construction, and itwas very doubtful whether any private developer would be willingto develop the site on that basis. Re-construction as government offices had in these circumstances seemed to be the most practicaluse of the site; and the question now raised was whether the Ministerof Works should proceed with this project when expenditure on thethree large Government office buildings already under construction in Westminster had passed its peak in 1956.in discussion doubts were expressed about the expediency of proceeding with this project at the present time. It was likely to provoke some controversy, and the cost would be large. ministers had not abandoned their policy of reducing Civil Service numbers;and it might seem inconsistent with that policy to embark on thebuilding of yet another large Government office in London.Further thought might also be given to the order of priority of thevarious projects now under discussion. Thus, might it not be better to complete the proposed Science Centre on the South Bank, and there-building of Whitehall Gardens and Richmond Terrace, beforebeginning the re-building of Carlton House Terrace?
135 C.C. 17 (54).The Cabinet Agreed that a Cabinet Committee should be appointed laterm the year to review this project for the re-building ofCarlton House Terrace in the light of other plans for theconstruction of large Government offices in central London.ColouredWorkers.(previous reference:CC. (54) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 94) discussing what answer should be given to aQuestion by Mr. T. Reid, M.P., suggesting that a committee ofenquiry should be appointed to report on the problems arising fromthe increased immigration of coloured people into this country.They also had before them memoranda by the commonwealth secretary (C. (54) 54 and 85) reporting on the present powers of other commonwealth and Colonial Governments to restrict the entry of, and to deport, British subjects from other parts of theCommonwealth.The Home Secretary said that the main argument in favour ofan enquiry was that it would focus public opinion on the problem.On the other hand, it would arouse suspicion that the Governmentwere contemplating action which would involve discrimination on grounds of colour and might disrupt the unity of the Commonwealth.His own view was that the situation was not yet so acute that these difficulties must be faced; and he therefore recommended that therequest for an enquiry should be rejected. This need not prevent theGovernment from continuing to consider the possibility of intro-ducing legislation taking power to deport from this country a british subject from overseas who had been convicted of a criminal offenceor had become a charge on public funds.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, in the first instance at any rate, the request for an enquiry should be refused. When this answer had been given, it would be easier to judge the general state of feeling on this question in theHouse of Commons and to assess the prospects of passing legislationlimiting the rights of British subjects from other parts of theCommonwealth to reside in the United Kingdom.On the question of legislation, however, some Ministers weredoubtful whether it would suffice merely to take powers of deportation-tion. The coloured population in this country was increasingrapidly, and in ten or fifteen years&quot; time it might have reachedunmanageable proportions. It was not clear that the possibility ofdeportation would in itself be enough to check the increasing tideof immigration. Serious thought might have to be given to thepossibility of taking power to control the entry into this country ofBritish subjects belonging to other parts of the Commonwealth. this might perhaps be made the subject of discussion at a commonwealth conference called with the object of securing greater uniformity inthe immigration laws in force in the various parts of the Common-wealth. Attention was, however, drawn to the risk that any initiative in this direction by the United Kingdom might have the result of bringing into force in India and Pakistan stricter immigration controls which would work to the disadvantage of the European business community in those countries.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister, in replying to a Question byMr. T. Reid, M.P., on 18th March, to decline to appoint a committee of enquiry to report on the problems arisingfrom the increased immigration of coloured people intothis country.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, the Commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary to consider further whether
legislation restricting the right of British subjects fromother parts of the Commonwealth to enter and remain inthe United Kingdom should be confined to a power to deport individuals who had been convicted of a criminal offence or had become a charge on public funds, orwhether powers should also be taken to control the entry of British subjects into this country; and asked them alsoto consider what steps could usefully be taken, by way of consultation with other Commonwealth Governments, in preparation for the introduction of such legislation.HighCommissionTerritories.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 59thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Com-commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 91) on the question of the transfer of theHigh Commission Territories to the Union of South Africa.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had discussed thisquestion with Mr. Havenga at the time of the Coronation. He had then pointed out that there could not be a worse moment for theSouth African Government to demand the transfer of the territories.Since then the South African Government had made no such demand,but he had now received secret information that the Prime Ministerof South Africa was likely to propose a resolution on this subject inthe Union Parliament before the end of March. He could not act onthis information alone, however, and there was at present no basis onwhich the United Kingdom High Commissioner could make a formalcommunication to the South African Government warning them that,if the question of transfer was publicly raised, nothing could stop animmediate debate in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster anda definite statement by the United Kingdom Government that theycould not consider transfer at this time. He would, however, like to instruct the High Commissioner to seize the earliest opportunity thatoffered for making such an approach but to add that, while transferwas impossible, we should wish to continue the closest economic co-operation between the High Commission Territories and theUnion. He would not reject out of hand the possibility of conversa-tions, even though transfer was impossible at present. The high commission Territories were extremely vulnerable to economicblockade by the Union and it was important not to give the south africans any excuse to use this weapon. He suggested that, whenthe moment came for the approach to be made by the High Commis-sioner, the Chancellor of the Exchequer might support it by a personal message to Mr. Havenga.The Cabinet-Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to instruct theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa to speak to the South African Government on the question ofthe transfer of the High Commission Territories to theUnion in the terms proposed by the Commonwealth Secre-tary as soon as he had official knowledge that Dr. Malanintended to raise the matter in the Union Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th March, 1954.
