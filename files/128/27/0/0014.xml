Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken mthe House of Commons in the following week.   .It would be announced during the week that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would open his Budget on 6th April.It was hoped that the Second Reading of the Judges&apos; Remunera-tion Bill might be taken in the House of Commons in the week beginning 15th March.Kenya.General China.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Commonwealth Secretary drew attention to a telegramfrom the Colonial Secretary (Kenya Telegram No. 189) giving theterms of a statement issued in Nairobi that morning, indicating thatGeneral China was being allowed to make contacts with Mau Mauleaders which might result in widespread surrenders. It had not beenfound necessary to include in this statement any reference to thefact that those who surrendered would not be prosecuted for offences committed previously, though an undertaking to this effect would begiven privately to the rebel leaders when contact was made withthem. It had been separately announced that General China&apos;s death sentence had been commuted.The Commonwealth Secretary suggested that a correspondingstatement should be made that afternoon in each House ofParliament.It was the view of the Cabinet that the Government spokesmenshould at this stage decline to answer any supplementary questionsasking whether rebels who surrendered would be immune fromprosecution.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for state-ments to be made that afternoon in both Houses ofParliament repeating the substance of the announcementalready made in Nairobi regarding General China&apos;s attemptto arrange widespread surrenders of Mau Mau rebels in kenya.Sudan. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said  that, since the Cabinefs(Previous        discussion on 1st March he had verified that responsibility for reference:      preserving law and order in the Sudan now rested with the SudanC.C. (54) 13th   Government and the Governor-General had no power to interveneConclusions,    unless circumstances arose which justified him in proclaiming a con-Minute 1.)       stitutional emergency by reason of imminent financial collapse orbreakdown in law and order.  This situation had not arisen.  TheForeign Secretary had, however, informed the Governor-general that British troops could be sent to Khartoum at short notice if required.It seemed clear that no positive action could be taken at themoment.  The situation must be allowed to develop.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Germany. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCivil Aviation. Foreign Secretary (C. (54) 79) on the manufacture of civil aircraft(Previous in Germany.Reference: The Foreign Secretary, said that when the European DefenceC.C. (52) 17th Community (E.D.C.) came into force the Germans would be allowedConclusions, to manufacture military aircraft if they obtained the unanimousMinute 5.) consent of the other members of the E.D.C. At this point they wouldalso be free to start a civil airline and there was no real safeguard
disability pensions.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 12thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions (C. (54) 82) recommending increases in rates of benefitpayable to seriously disabled men.The Minister of Pensions said that there could be no increasein the standard rates of pension under the National Insurance schemeuntil the findings of Sir Thomas Phillips&apos;s Committee were availabletowards the end of the year. Meanwhile, there were strong grounds for making immediate increases in the rates of benefit payable to disabled pensioners whose disabilities were such that they were unableto undertake regular employment. There were some 20,000 war pensioners in this category. About two-thirds of these enjoyed,apart from casual earnings, from 62s. 6d. to 905. a week, comprisingbasic pension of 21s. 6d. to 55s. plus an &quot; unemployability supple-ment&quot; of 35s. There were some 17,000 industrially disabled menwho were also unfit to work regularly and received, apart from dis-ability pension, an allowance at the rate of 32^. 6d. a week. he recommonded that the &quot; unemployability supplement&quot; of these war pensioners and the allowances of those with severe industrial injuriesshould alike be increased by 10s. a week. The total cost of the increases would be about  1 million in a full year, of which halfwould be payable from the Industrial Injuries Insurance Fund.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that there were stronggrounds for making the increases which the Minister recommended.The timing of this award should, however, be carefully considered in relation to other concessions in pay and pensions payable from public funds which were already in train or in prospect.The Home Secretary said that there was a small number of police and firemen pensioners in like case for whom corresponding increases would be justified.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposed increase of \0s. a week in the rate of &quot; unemployability supplement &quot; payable towar pensioners and in the rate of allowance payable tomen whose industrial injuries rendered them permanentlyincapable of work.MMNNNMiagainst their reviving a civil aircraft industry. There were indeedalready signs that the Germans were planning to revive this industry,and the Americans were encouraging them in this in the hope that theywould capture this market for their civil aircraft. British manu-facturers, on the other hand, had been forbidden to enter into any discussions with these potential German manufacturers. the americans and the French could not be persuaded to support us in opposing the revival of this industry, and our present policy would therefore have the result of denying us the benefit of a Germanmarket in aircraft and aircraft components and leaving the way opento our American competitors. In these circumstances he hoped theCabinet would agree that British manufacturers should now beallowed sufficient latitude in their contacts with potential Germanmanufacturers to safeguard their position if, as seemed inevitable,the German aircraft industry was eventually revived.The Minister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviationsupported the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recommendation.The Cabinet-Agreed that United Kingdom manufacturers should now begiven sufficient latitude in their contacts with potentialGerman aircraft manufacturers to safeguard their position if the German civil aircraft industry was eventually revived.
\2) Authorised the preparation, in due course, of the necessary legislation to amend the Industrial Injuries Acts.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Pensions to decide when these increases should be announced.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Pensions whethercorresponding concessions should be made at the sametime to police and firemen pensioners whose circum-stances were comparable.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C. (54) 78) recommending defermentof the date for the coming into force of new valuation lists for ratingpurposes.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, as hehad warned the Cabinet on 29th December, it would be necessary,before the new valuation lists were brought into force, to pass further legislation to improve the existing law and statutory procedure and provide a new method of assessing gas undertakings. Such legisla-tion could not now be undertaken before the 1954-55 Session and, asit was necessary for rating authorities to receive the new lists by theend of the December preceding the April in which they were to take effect, it seemed that the date for bringing the new lists into force must be deferred from 1st April, 1955, to 1st April, 1956. He there-fore sought the authority of the Cabinet to make the necessary Order,which would not be subject to affirmative or negative resolution,under the New Valuation Lists (Postponement) Act, 1953.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported this proposal.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing to make an Order underthe New Valuation Lists (Postponement) Act, 1953, deferringfrom 1st April, 1955, to 1st April, 1956, the date for thecoming into force of new valuation lists for rating purposes.7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (C. (54) 22) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (54) 83) on the level of taxation and on the possibility of financingsome part of current public expenditure by borrowing.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it should bea main object of Government policy to reduce the current level oftaxation. This would bring political and social, as well as economic,advantages. National prosperity depended on a comparatively small number of people who could exploit inventions, open up new markets and devise means to increase production. The present level oftaxation was curbing their initiative and their willingness to takerisks. It was also denying industry the opportunity to accumulatereserves for new ventures. And, by the pressures which it exercisedtowards tax evasion of various forms, it was tending to underminebusiness morality. If the present level of taxation were to continue indefinitely, the prospects for our commercial and industrial pros-perity would be bleak. He therefore suggested that the Governmentshould set themselves the aim of reducing taxation to a point at which no one would be required to pay more than \5s. in the  . he recognised that this aim could not be achieved immediately; but he believed that steady progress in reducing taxation was more likelyto be achieved if a definite target were set.The particular suggestions which he had made in the second partof his paper for financing some public services by borrowing were putforward because the Chancellor of the Exchequer had, in an earlier
/discussion, invited practical suggestions for reducing the volume of current public expenditure. He recognised that they might be opento some of the objections advanced by the Chancellor of theExchequer in C. (54) 83; but he doubted whether those were asufficient reason for rejecting altogether the device of spreading overa number of years the cost of public projects which created valuablecapital assets for the nation.In discussion the following points were made on the particularsuggestion that some part of current public expenditure might be financed by borrowing.(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the principlewere adopted of financing by loan those services whose benefitaccrued over a period of years, the same principle should in logic beapplied to the revenue side of the Budget. Thus, if the Exchequerfinanced by loan the creation of a strategic reserve of materials, itcould not properly credit to current revenue its receipts from the saleof food stocks on the termination of controls or, for that matter, the proceeds of death duties. But, if the principle were applied to revenue as well as to expenditure, the net result would be to make theposition look worse rather than better in the Budget.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although he hadnot closed his mind to the possibility of financing certain services by borrowing, the present would not be an appropriate moment at which to resort to this device. There was no economic advantage in havingrecourse to it in a period of relative prosperity: indeed, it would then have the positive disadvantage of encouraging inflationary tendencies.This method of financing public expenditure would be more appropriate in a time of trade recession.(c) The Lord President said that he was concerned at the con-sequences of applying the principle that borrowing was justified only for those services which earned a cash revenue. That principle hadbeen held to justify financing by loan the large capital developmentsundertaken by gas and electricity undertakings. But it would presumably preclude borrowing for road development. It was likelytherefore that the improvement of our road system would be delayedbecause of the heavy burden which it would impose on currentrevenue. This, he believed would give rise to increasing publicdissatisfaction.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to give further con-sideration to this point.On the wider question of the level of taxation the followingpoints were made in discussion: -(d) The Cabinet were informed that the cost to the Exchequer of imposing an upper limit of taxation of 15s. in the   would not bemore than  30 millions. There was no doubt that such a limitationwould have the effect of increasing national prosperity; and a strong case could be made on economic grounds for imposing an upper limit of this order. But no Government could introduce such a limitationwithout encountering the gravest political difficulties.(e) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the level of public expenditure would shortly become a major political problem for theGovernment. The combined cost of current policies on defence,social services, agriculture and housing was more than the national economy could bear. If these policies continued unchanged, hewould be faced, when framing the 1955 Budget, with a choice betweenreducing expenditure or. increasing taxation. Of these alternatives hewould wish to choose the first, and he would welcome opportunities for a dramatic reduction in public expenditure. If, however, he wasto avoid increasing the level of taxation in 1955, early consideration would have to be given to policy changes designed to securesubstantial reductions in public expenditure, particularly on theservices which he had mentioned.
(/) Significant savings in defence expenditure could only besecured by reducing the size of the armed forces and this, in turn,would involve reduction of our overseas commitments. The foreign secretary said that the Middle East was the only theatre in which he saw any early prospect of reducing commitments.(g) British industry was likely to find it increasingly difficult tomaintain current earnings from exports, and the high level of taxationwas one of the main obstacles in the way of an expansion of our exports.(h) The Chancellor of the Exchequer had asked his colleagues toadopt all practicable economies in framing their Estimates for 1954.This appeal had met with a disappointing response. It was suggestedthat Ministers would find.it easier to co-operate in securing a sub-stantial reduction in public expenditure if they were required toreduce their Estimates by a specified percentage or to show cause why this could not be done. It was also suggested that the same procedure of a percentage cut could with advantage be applied for the purposeof securing a reduction in the size of the Civil Service.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the course of 1954 means must be found ofsecuring a drastic reduction in public expenditure in 1955.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit tothe Prime Minister proposals on the procedure to befollowed in discussing policy changes designed to securethe necessary reduction in public expenditure.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd March, 1954.
