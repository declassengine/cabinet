Indo-China.(previous reference:CC. (54) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary, subsequently circulated as C. (54) 177, outlining the objectives which he was pursuing in the discussions on Indo-Chinaat the Geneva Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that he believed there was a fairchance of securing agreement at Geneva on the terms for a cease-firein Indo-China. He would continue to work for such a settlement;for he was gravely concerned about the dangers of the alternative courses of action which the United States Government were likelyto favour if a settlement were not now secured by negotiation. he therefore proposed to pursue the double objective of securing acease-fire in Indo-China while at the same time keeping open thepossibility of establishing at the appropriate moment an effective system of collective defence for South-East Asia as a whole. In thishis main difficulty was to avoid lasting damage to Anglo-american relations. The Americans had not been wise in their handling ofthis situation. Though Mr. Bedell Smith was personally most friendly and co-operative, he was acting under close directions from washington, where opinion was divided. Some American authoritiesevidently thought that this was the moment to challenge the ambitious-tions of Communist China, if necessary by force, and believed thatthis could be done without provoking Russian intervention. Someof them were probably influenced by the consideration that the riskof such intervention would be greater in a few years&apos; time, whenRussia had the power to deliver an atomic attack on North America.The American representatives at Geneva were therefore inclined toadopt an uncompromising attitude towards the Chinese. TheChinese, on the other hand, although they were not anxious for any fresh military adventure, were certainly not in a mood to be brow-beaten. Mr. Chou En-lai, though courteous, was hard. He did not regard Korea as a failure and was not ready to accept dictation bythe Western Powers. The Russians plainly wanted to secure a settle-ment: in the conduct of negotiations M. Molotov had been skilfuland constructive. But it was evident that the Chinese were not wholly under the control of the Russians. Nor, for that matter, werethe Viet-minh representatives completely responsive to Chinesecontrol. The French delegation were distracted and handicapped by the instability of their Government. There was no doubt thattheir true interest lay in reaching a quick settlement on the best termsthey could get, but it was hard for them to embrace such a policyand to risk its political consequences.The Foreign Secretary said that he had little doubt that theproper course for him in this difficult situation was to persevere fora time in the attempt to secure a reasonable settlement. He wasalive to the risk that the discussions might be unduly protracted,but it was only one week since, the holding of the first restrictedsession and he was sure that it would be right for him to devote atleast another week to the search for an agreement. He recognisedthat, as things stood, the United Kingdom would be open to specialcriticism if the Communists improved their military position in Indo-China while discussions were proceeding at Geneva. But, short ofmilitary intervention in Indo-China, which the United KingdomGovernment were not at present prepared to contemplate, there wasno practical action which was being delayed by the continuance ofthe Conference at Geneva. We had already agreed that militaryplans should be discussed through the medium of the Five-PowerStaff Agency. And, even if we had been willing to enter at onceinto international discussions of the proposal for collective defence arrangements for South-East Asia, such discussions could not havehad any immediate effect on the military situation in Indo-China.In the Cabinefs discussion the following particular points weremade:  (a) The Foreign Secretary said that there was evidently muchtalk in Washington about a rift in Anglo-American understanding.46236 b 2
This was based partly on our refusal to support the American pro-posal for an.air attack on the besiegers of Dien Bien Phu, and partly on our unwillingness to join in international discussions on a defencepact for South-East Asia before the end of the Geneva Conference.On the first point Anglo-American differences might not have becomepublicly known if the Americans had not disclosed them to the Press.On the second there should have been no room for misunderstanding.It was difficult to see why Mr. Dulles should have thought that hecould proceed at once to international discussion of the proposeddefence pact, immediately after the end of the London talks, in spiteof the fact that it had not then been decided which countries shouldbe parties to the proposed pact. The prospects of concluding sucha pact would in fact have been seriously jeopardised if Mr. Dulleshad proceeded with his proposal to discuss it in Washington withrepresentatives of ten countries including no Asiatic countries saveSiam and the Philippines.(b) The Foreign Secretary said that, in this as in the particular problem of Indo-China, it was most important that the western powers should retain the goodwill of the leading countries of Asia.Precipitate action for the establishment of a system of collective defence for South-East Asia would certainly have alienated India;and, without India&apos;s goodwill, few of the other countries of South-east asia would have been willing to participate in it. Their participationwas essential to its success; and, with time and patience, they mightbe brought to see its advantages. There was now some reason tobelieve that, if agreement were reached on a cease-fire in Indo-China,India would be ready to play a part, jointly with Norway, in super-vising its observance.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment were likely to press their suggestion that Siam should invitethe United Nations to send an Observation Commission to the frontiers of Siam and Indo-China. He doubted whether this wouldbe a wise move. First, the appeal would have to be considered bya special meeting of the United Nations Assembly and the Assembly,once convened, could not be prevented from discussing other aspectsof the problems now under negotiation at Geneva. Secondly, theRussians were likely to represent it as a manoeuvre devised by the americans to justify their proposed intervention in Siam. Thirdly,it would seem inconsistent with the arguments developed by theWestern Powers at Geneva for declining to negotiate a single settle-ment covering Laos and Cambodia as well as Viet Nam, namely,that military operations in the former were not on a scale comparable with those taking place in the latter. The Foreign Secretary saidthat on his return to Geneva he would put to the Americans thearguments against proceeding with this project at the present timeand would do his utmost to dissuade them from going forward with it. But, if he failed to dissuade them by these arguments, he proposed that, with a view to avoiding further damage to Anglo-American friendship, he should assure them that they could rely onour support in the United Nations if such an appeal were made.The Cabinet agreed that this plan of inducing Siam to make an appeal to the United Nations was ill-judged and ill-timed. Thematter was not, however, of such importance that it need be addedto the list of subjects on which we were publicly seen to be at variance with the United States. If, therefore, the Foreign Secretary failed to dissuade the Americans from proceeding with it, he should assurethem that they could in the last resort rely on us to support them inthe United Nations.(d) The Foreign Secretary said that it was too early to say what line the Americans would take if all attempts to arrange a cease-firein Indo-China were unsuccessful. This would depend on the out-come of the military talks now proceeding between the americans and the French.  It seemed unlikely that the French would accept
5 C.C. 35 (54)the American conditions for sending land forces into Indo-China;but the Americans might be ready to give support with naval and airforces, and even this might lead to a state of general hostilities between the United States and China.The Prime Minister said that, even if the United States decidedto engage in military operations in Indo-China, it would notnecessarily follow that the United Kingdom would have to dissociatethemselves politically from such a policy. Though we might not be willing to join them in sending troops into Indo-China itself, wewere already in Malaya playing an important military part in thedefence of South-East Asia. And we might be able to offer to sendfurther troops into Malaya from the Canal Zone if the americans would help us to reach a satisfactory settlement of our differenceswith Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that it was difficult to foresee to what extent we should be able to lend political support to an american military intervention in Indo-China. Much would depend on thecircumstances at the time. But, as things stood now, he saw little prospect that a Western military intervention there would commandsympathy or support, either in the other countries of South-East Asiaor in the United Nations or from any substantial body of opinion inthis country.(e) The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious that good progress should be made by the Five-Power Staff Agency in dis-cussing military plans for safeguarding any political settlement whichmight be reached on Indo-China. It had been agreed that these discussions should be held in Washington. We should make a goodimpression with the Americans if we could be represented at themby someone of the standing and experience of General Sir GeraldTempler.The Colonial Secretary said that General Templer was due toleave Malaya on 31 st May. He would take steps to ascertain whether he would be willing to undertake this new duty.The Prime Minister said that it was clear from the Cabinefs dis-cussion that the Foreign Secretary had the full support of hiscolleagues in his conduct of the negotiations at the Geneva Con-ference. It was also evident that he had won the support and goodwill of other Commonwealth Governments. It was right thathe should persevere for a week or so longer in his efforts to secure a settlement on Indo-China. He would, however, continue to be aware of the risks of becoming involved in protracted negotiations with offered little prospect of a successful outcome.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to pursue, in his negotia-tions at the Geneva Conference, the objectives set outin C. (54) 177.Atomic Energy. 2. The Prime Minister drew attention to a private Membefs(Previous motion tabled by Sir Charles Taylor, M.P., for discussion in the reference: House of Commons on 28th May, inviting him to seek the agreementC.C. (54) 23rd of the United States and Canadian Governments to the publicationConclusions, of a document setting out the history of Anglo-American co-Minute .1.) operation in atomic energy development under agreements madeAnglo- during and since the war.American Tne Prime Minister recalled the exchanges which had takenCo-operation. P*ace in the House of Commons since his disclosure on 5th April ofthe agreement on these matters which he had reached with president roosevelt at Quebec on 19th August, 1943 (Command 9123). some government supporters wished to press the political advantage whichthis disclosure appeared to have given them, and the present motion
reflected the view that the Opposition would not object to the publi-cation of further documents if they thought it was likely to furthertheir cause. The Prime Minister said that he still considered thatthe publication of the Quebec Agreement had been fully justified forthe purposes both of defending the Government against accusationsof undue subservience to the United States and of inducing theUnited States to be more co-operative in sharing information on atomic energy development. Nevertheless, he did not consider thata debate on this private Member&apos;s motion would serve a useful purpose at this stage and, if his colleagues agreed, he proposed totake advantage of Sir Charles Taylors willingness to withdraw hismotion.There was general support in the Cabinet for the view that further public controversy on this matter should, if possible, be avoided.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would invite Sir CharlesTaylor, M.P., to withdraw his motion tabled for debate inthe House of Commons on 28th May.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet again considered the handling of the debate onExpenses of the Report of the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses which members.       was to be held in the House of Commons that afternoon.(Previous The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was now clear that reference:      a substantial number of Government supporters were concernedC.C. (54) 34th   at the way in which this matter had developed and that the amend-Conclusions,    ment tabled in the names of Mr. Deedes, M.P., and others would notMinute 3.)       receive the degree of Conservative support which had hitherto been expected.  He had been considering what the Government could do to rally their supporters.  One possibility would be to take the line that, while the issue of principle was one for the House of commons to decide, the timing of subsequent action was a matter for theGovernment.   While he did not favour delaying action until afterthe next General Election, the postponement of any increase untilthe autumn,, when it might be put into effect simultaneously with an improvement in Ministers&apos; salaries, would do something to demonstrate to their supporters that the Government were notlightly falling in with the wishes of the Labour Party.In discussion there was support for the view that, if the house should that day decide in principle in favour of some increase inMembers&apos; remuneration, it would be better that such an increase should be put into effect forthwith and that the Government, byclaiming responsibility for the timing of the consequential action,would thereby incur an increased share of the responsibility for thedecision of principle.On the question of principle, several Ministers recalled the cabinet&apos;s earlier opposition to increasing Members&apos; salaries at atime when other claims were being resisted. There was strong feeling in the country on this issue and, whatever the circumstances in which an increase might be decided Upon by the House ofCommons, the Government of the day could not avoid some measure of responsibility for it in the public mind. . From this pointof view the arrangements envisaged by Mr. Deedes&apos; amendment were clearly to be preferred to those recommended in the all-Party motionand, if a substantial vote could be obtained in favour of the amend-ment, the Government might well feel justified in pursuing further the possibility of meeting an admitted need by means other than adirect increase of Members&apos; salaries.
The Cabinet were informed that it was the Speaker&apos;s intentionto call Mr. Deedes&apos; amendment during the course of the debate, andit was agreed that in these circumstances the Chancellor of theExchequer should speak on behalf of the Government immediatelyafter the proposer and seconder of the amendment and that he shouldmake a strong case in support of it.The Cabinet recognised that, as the first vote would take placeon the motion &quot; That the words proposed to be left out stand part,&quot;the outcome of the debate was somewhat uncertain since it waspossible that this first motion might be defeated but that thereafterMr. Deedes&apos; amendment might fail to obtain a majority. TheGovernments subsequent course would clearly have to depend onthe size of any majority which might be obtained for the all-Partymotion. In view of these uncertainties the Government spokesman should retain a free hand for the Government by making it clear thatthey would have to consider carefully what action they should take in the light of the voting of the House.It was the view of the Cabinet that, while the spirit of a free votemust be preserved, it was undesirable that Ministers should vote indifferent lobbies. This situation could be avoided if Ministers wereto vote in support of Mr. Deedes&apos; amendment and vote against, or atleast abstain from voting on, the all-Party motion.In further discussion attention was again drawn to thedesirability of enabling those Government supporters who werefirmly opposed to any improvement in Members&apos; remuneration todissociate themselves by their votes, not only from the decision inprinciple to make such an improvement, but also from the Supple-mentary Estimate which would be required in due course to put any improvement into effect.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when speaking onbehalf of the Government in that afternoon&apos;s debate, to urge support for Mr. Deedes&apos; amendment and to indicatethat the Government must remain free to decide what action they should take as a result of the debate in thelight of the voting of the House.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to take discreet steps to make itknown to other members of the Government how themembers of the Cabinet proposed to vote in the divisions on this subject.industrial disputes.Railway Strike.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 34thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Minister of Labour reported the latest developments inthe unofficial strike started by engine crews employed by british railways in protest against the introduction of changes in the opera-tion of lodging turns. The strike was still confined to the WesternRegion of British Railways. Even there a number of depots had decided not to take part in it and, at those depots which were affected, a proportion of crews were continuing to report for duty.There was no public sympathy for the strikers. It should become clear within the next few days whether the strike would spreadfurther or collapse.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th May, 1954.
