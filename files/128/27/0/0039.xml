Indo-China. 1.   The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet his impressions of(Previous the state of the negotiations on Indo-China at the Geneva Conference.Reference: The chances of securing a successful outcome were not, in hisC.C. (54) 35th opinion, favourable. The main difficulty arose from the uncertaintiesConclusions, and hesitations of the French. It seemed doubtful whether the minute l.) French Government would survive for long, and no administration which succeeded it was likely to be willing to continue the strugglein Indo-China. The Chinese were genuinely apprehensive that the americans had aggressive intentions in South-East Asia. TheAmerican representatives were operating under close directions from washington, where there now seemed to be no desire to see a success-ful outcome from the negotiations at Geneva. It was evident thatinfluential sections of opinion in Washington were now interestedonly in the question of military intervention in South-East Asia;and it seemed likely that, if the Geneva Conference failed, the UnitedStates Government would seek authority from the United nations for some form of intervention, not only in Siam, but in Laos andCambodia also.From the political point of view it might be practicable to safe-guard the independence of Laos and Cambodia on the basis that they received no military assistance from East or West. But some militaryauthorities were inclined to the view that, for the effective defence of siam, it would be necessary to hold the line of the plateau runningthrough Laos. The United States Government were unlikely to favour a political solution which left Laos and Cambodia independent of help from either side. On the other hand, any American attemptto take up a military line of defence beyond the eastern frontier of siam was likely to provoke a strong reaction by the Chinese.The Foreign Secretary drew the Cabinefs attention to telegrams from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington (Washington tele-grams Nos. 1109, 1110 and 1111) reporting a conversation which hehad had with the United States Secretary of State on the previous day. Mr. Dulles had then given the Ambassador a paper outlining the action which the United States Government were prepared totake in the event of an overt, unprovoked military aggression by theChinese in South-East Asia or the Western Pacific. Mr. Dulles had said that the United States Government would consider the Chineseto have committed such an aggression if they operated air forcesover Viet Nam territory or sent troops into Viet Nam. In those circumstances the United States Government would at once seek theapproval of Congress for the use of United States forces againstCommunist China to repel the aggression and would make an imme-diate appeal to the United Nations. They would at the same timeinvite the United Kingdom to take parallel action. Copies of this paper had been given to the Australian and New Zealand repre-sentatives in Washington, but not to the French. The Ambassadorregarded this paper as a reflection of the inability of the United states administration to reach an agreed decision on intervention in Indo-China. He believed that it also reflected their view that Frenchfortunes in Indo-China could not be restored without intervention by land forces, and that this was not at the moment favoured by theUnited States Administration as a whole.The Foreign Secretary said that he was encouraged by this com-munication. For there was no likelihood that the Chinese wouldin fact send forces into Viet Nam at this stage, when the greater partof the country was already under the control of the Viet Minh. Itwas therefore reassuring that the United States Government should now be seeking to relate the political pressures for military inter-vention in Indo-China to a situation which was most unlikely to arise in practice. So far as concerned the progress of the negotiations at Geneva, it was significant that this paper had not been communi-cated to the French. The French uncertainties which were impedingprogress at Geneva were largely due to French hopes that the americans would eventually come to their aid in Indo-China. Ifthe French could be persuaded that they could not rely on American
intervention in any circumstances which were likely to arise, theymight be more willing to accept the best settlement they could get.On the other hand, a declaration of the kind outlined in Mr. Dulles&apos;s paper might well be made when the Geneva Conference was over,as part of the arrangements for a system of collective defence inSouth-East Asia and the Western Pacific; and at the appropriate time we might well be able to support a declaration of this kind.Finally, the Foreign Secretary said that circumstances at Genevahad forced him to adopt the role of intermediary between the western powers and the Communists. Neither the Americans nor the french had established any contact with the Communist representatives.He himself was bound to maintain contact with M. Molotov, as theywere Joint Chairmen, and he also thought it desirable to keep intouch with Mr. Chou En-lai so as to avoid a situation in which theviews of the Western Powers were always explained to him throughM. Molotov. He recognised, however, that his activities in this rolewere open to misrepresentation, particularly in the United States,and he was somewhat concerned lest this should damage Anglo-American relations.The Prime Minister said that the chance of preserving world peace should not be prejudiced by irrational American inhibitionsagainst making any contact with Communist representatives. TheForeign Secretary should not, in his opinion, be deterred by fear ofsuch misrepresentations from continuing to follow the methods whichhe had adopted in the hope of securing a successful outcome fromthe Conference. He should, however, be on his guard against thegreater danger that the negotiations might be fruitlessly prolongedwhile the Communists improved their military position in Indo-China.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement on the stateof the negotiations at the Geneva Conference.Cmna- 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that improvement in ourDiplomatic      relations with the Chinese might give rise to misunderstanding in theRelations.       United States, where our recognition of the Chinese People&apos;s Govern-ment was still the subject of unfavourable comment.   From thispoint of view he thought it right to inform the Cabinet of threedevelopments which had occurred while he was at Geneva.First, the Cabinet would recall that some years previously arepresentative of the United Kingdom Government had been sent toPeking to discuss practical arrangements for establishing diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Communist China. in peking his mission had achieved no practical results. At Geneva,however, the Chinese representatives had shown themselves willingto discuss various outstanding issues with him, and substantial progress had been made in the arrangement of such matters as therelease of British subjects now under detention in China. In com-menting on this to Mr. Chou En-lai the Foreign Secretary hadalluded to the fact that the Chinese had sent no correspondingrepresentative to London. Somewhat to his embarrassment Mr.Chou En-lai had now offered to do so. In view of the current stateof feeling in the United States about Communist China, this was nota very opportune moment at which to receive a Chinese representa-tive in London. At the same time it would be both discourteousand illogical to reject this offer entirely. It might perhaps be acceptedon the basis that the Chinese representative in London would also be described, as was our representative in Peking, as responsible for discussing the practical arrangements for establishing diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Communist China.
prime 3.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he hadMinisters suggested to President Eisenhower, towards the end of April, that heVisit to might pay a short visit to Washington early in the summer forWashington.    informal talks on matters of current concern to the two Governments.The President, in assenting to this proposal, had suggested that the visit might be postponed until June, when he would expect to be fully informed of the results of the latest series of atomic tests in the pacific. The President had also suggested that the Foreign secretary should accompany the Prime Minister and take that opportunity offurther conversations with Mr. Dulles. In the result it had beenarranged that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary should arrive in Washington on Friday, 18th June, for a series of informal conversations over that week-end.The Prime Minister said that he thought it important that this opportunity for personal discussions with the President should notbe missed. He was specially concerned to take advantage of the presidents willingness to discuss the problems created by thedevelopment of the hydrogen bomb, and for that purpose he pro-posed that Lord Cherwell should accompany him to Washington.The other matter which he was specially anxious to pursue with thePresident was the possibility of securing some fresh Americaninitiative which would enable us to reduce our military commitment in Egypt.When these arrangements had been made it had seemed reason-able to assume that the Geneva Conference would be over by18th June. This now seemed less likely; but it would be unfortunate if this opportunity for personal talks with the President had to beforegone because of the prolongation of the Geneva Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be difficult for him togo to Washington on 18th June if the negotiations at Geneva had not then been concluded. It would create a bad impression if heappeared to abandon the Conference for the sake of two or three days&apos; discussions in Washington. He would, however, be reluctant to suggest that the Prime Minister should on this account postponehis proposed visit; for personal talks between the Prime Minister and secondly, the Chinese representatives at Geneva had acceptedour proposal that we should now reopen the British Consulate-General in Shanghai. This was unlikely to occasion any un-favourable comment in the United States.Thirdly, Mr. Chou En-lai had suggested that the Chinese Vice-Minister for Trade might pay an official visit to the United Kingdom.This might well be misinterpreted in the United States, in view of thestrength of public opinion there on the question of trade with china. Arrangements had already been made for a Chinese trademission to visit this country at the invitation of the Federation ofBritish Industries, and it might be best to suggest that any visit bya Chinese Minister could more profitably be made after this trademission had returned.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no objection was likely to be taken to there opening of the British Consulate-General in Shanghai.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek some means of deferring, until after the Geneva Conference, the appoint-ment of a Chinese representative in London to discusspractical arrangements for establishing diplomatic rela-tions between the United Kingdom and communist china.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek means of deferringfor the time being any visit to this country by the ChineseVice-Minister for Trade.
the President at this juncture might yield valuable results. On theother hand, he recognised that an embarrassing situation might arise if, while the Prime Minister was in Washington, the geneva conference broke down and strong political pressures developed inthe United States in favour of military intervention in Indo-China.In discussion several Ministers expressed the view that it wouldbe unfortunate if the Foreign Secretary were prevented, by the con-tinuance of the Geneva Conference, from accompanying the PrimeMinister to Washington.The Prime Minister said that he would be reluctant to postpone the proposed visit, as the President might be unable to find time for itat a later date. For the present therefore he would prefer to suggestno change in the existing arrangements, under which he and theForeign Secretary were due to go to Washington on 18th June. those arrangements could be reviewed in a week&apos;s time, in the lightof progress made meanwhile at the Geneva Conference.The Cabinet-Agreed that a final decision on the proposed visit of thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to Washingtoncould be deferred until their next meeting on 15th June.Persian Gulf. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that, with the encouragementTrucial of the Government of Saudi Arabia, the United States oil companySheikhdoms.    Aramco had sent a prospecting party over the Saudi Arabian border(Previous        into territory where the Trucial Sheikhs claimed jurisdiction.  ThereReference:      was good reason to believe that very substantial amounts of oil mightCC. (53) 44th   be found in this area, and it was vital to British interests that theConclusions,    American company should not establish a claim to work it.  TheyMinute 5.)      had no rights in the area, and it was known that their action inprospecting there would not be supported by the United StatesGovernment. He had therefore proposed that this prospecting party should be removed from the area, if necessary by force.The Prime Minister said that, while he agreed that this party should be removed from the area, he had been reluctant to authorisethe use of fire-arms especially as the British force immediately available seemed to be much smaller in numbers than the intruders.He would have preferred to wait until the prospecting party couldbe confronted with overwhelming forces, so that recourse to violencemight be avoided.The Foreign Secretary said that, so long as there was no delay in removing this party from the area, he would be quite ready toconsider how his proposed instructions could be modified so as toreduce the risk of personal injury to United States citizens. It mightbe helpful if the Prime Minister could also send a personal message to President Eisenhower asking him to use his authority to recallthis prospecting party.The Cabinet Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange forthe Minister of State to submit for the Prime Minister^approval (i) revised instructions for the removal of the pros-pecting party sent across the Saudi Arabian border by theAmerican oil company Aramco, and (ii) the draft of a message on this subject which the Prime Minister might send to President Eisenhower.
Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 38thConclusions.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 192) and the Lord Privy Seal (C. (54) 191),outlining possible alternative means of improving the financialposition of Members otherwise than by a direct increase in salary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he adhered to theview that the Government would stand to gain in the long run fromputting into effect without further question the decision of themajority of the House in favour of a direct salary increase. But, in deference to the views of his colleagues, he had put forward in his memorandum a possible alternative scheme by which the remunera-tion of Members would be improved in two ways by a modest salaryincrease and by a monthly reimbursement of expenses. Under thereimbursement arrangement, which might be brought into operation at once, every Member would be entitled to draw monthly in casha reimbursement of expenses at the rate of  250 a year on the basisof a simple certificate that his expenses had not been less than this amount. The salary increase, which should in his view be one of  250a year, could be put into force in the next financial year.The Lord Privy Seal said that there was a growing feeling on this issue among Government supporters, both in the House and in thecountry, which in his view ruled out the possibility of any directsalary increase for Members at the present time. There seemed tobe a reasonable prospect, however, of rallying a sufficient body of support for a scheme of subsistence allowances of the kind outlined in his memorandum. Such an allowance would be at a specifiedrate per day for four days in any week in which Parliament was in session, and any Member who wished to receive it could arrange tohave it credited monthly to his account. A good case could be made out for paying a corresponding allowance, but at a lower rate, toLondon Members, who were already recognised by the InlandRevenue as a special category for certain tax purposes. One advan-tage of such a scheme would be that it would provide direct benefit for the poorer Members which those Members who were better offcould readily forgo; and, in his view, Members could be relied uponto refrain from drawing the allowance during any prolongedabsence from the House. Such enquiries as he had made suggestedthat such a scheme might prove acceptable to some at least of thoseGovernment supporters who had hitherto favoured the proposal fora direct salary increase, and there seemed to be some likelihood thata substantial body of Opposition Members would acquiesce in it once they were satisfied that the Government were not prepared to proposea direct salary increase.The Chief Whip said that his information fully confirmed theviews expressed by the Lord Privy Seal.In discussion there was a wide measure of support for the viewthat insistence upon a direct salary increase at the present time wouldbe likely to deprive the Government of a reliable majority in theHouse of Commons and the Conservative Party of the active help ofmany of their most loyal supporters in the country. It seemed probable, however, that Conservative opinion could be brought toaccept the necessity of making some immediate improvement inMembers&apos; remuneration in the interests, particularly, of poorerMembers; and a scheme of subsistence allowances was the one which seemed most likely to be understood and accepted by ordinary people.I Such a scheme would, moreover, have the advantage that it would bein keeping with the line which the Government had consistently takensince the publication of the Select Committee&apos;s Report, namely, thatsome means should be found of alleviating the difficulties of lesswell-to-do Members, but that it would not be right in present circum-stances to proceed in the particular manner which the SelectI Committee had favoured.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the Cabinet werej&quot; v, convinced, as they appeared to be, that any direct salary increase wasI
out of the question at present, there was no alternative but to attemptto secure sufficient support for some scheme of cash allowances, andhe would give careful thought to the exact form which such a scheme might take. For technical reasons he would prefer to avoid, ifpossible, using the term &quot; subsistence allowance.&quot; The cabinet should also realise that the great majority of Members would notderive full financial advantage from any cash allowance, as its pay-ment in most cases would reduce the scope for claiming tax relief inrespect of expenses incurred. If the Cabinet should finally decide toadopt such a scheme, he hoped that, when it was announced, theGovernment would at least say that they accepted in principle thedecision of the House as expressed in the free vote, although they didnot feel able to implement it at the present time. At the same time he very much hoped that the issue would not be allowed to remain open until the next General Election.In discussion there was support for the view that it would be undesirable that Member&apos;s remuneration should become an issue atan election and that, if the Government should find it necessary tomake any public statement about their acceptance of the decision ofthe House on 24th May, care should be taken to avoid saying any-thing which implied that they would regard themselves as under an obligation to increase salaries of Members within any specified period.The Prime Minister said that, while he shared the Chancellorsview that the least objectionable course in the long run would be tocarry out the decision of the House in favour of a direct salaryincrease, he was ready to consider any alternative scheme whichmight command a sufficient body of support in the House to enable it to be put into effect. The Cabinet must reach a decision on thismatter at their next meeting and he hoped that in the meantime all his colleagues would continue to give it their earnest consideration.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would submit, for consideration at their next meeting, proposalsfor a system of cash allowances for Members, framed in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (C. (54) 180) seeking authority to secure areduction in the present rate of housing subsidy.The Minister of Housing said that the recent reduction in bank rate and in the rate of interest on loans to local authorities from thePublic Works Loan Board justified some reduction in the rate of housing subsidy, and he sought authority to approach local authori-ties with this end in view. He would hope to be in a position to announce the proposed reduction on 30th June, when he was requiredby statute to announce the subsidy rate which was to operate duringthe succeeding year; and the new rate could subsequently beauthorised by affirmative resolution of the House of Commons totake effect from 1st April, 1955. The annual saving to the exchequer would be of the order of  1 million a year for 60 years. It would be helpful to him if some reduction in the rate of subsidy could be madein Scotland at the same time but, if this was not possible, any announcement might perhaps be in terms which did not imply thatthe possibility of some reduction in Scotland at a later date wasaltogether excluded.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he would greatlyprefer that no change should be made in the rate of housing subsidy in Scotland until he had received the recommendations of the SornCommittee on valuation and rating and had considered what action the Government should take upon them.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he fully supported theproposal made by the Minister of Housing in respect of England andWales. The Scottish rate of subsidy was already substantially higherthan the English rate, but he would not press the Secretary of state to commit himself at this stage to making a reduction corresponding to that proposed for England and Wales.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing to proceed with areduction of the rate of housing subsidy in England andWales on the lines proposed in C.
