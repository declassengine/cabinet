ill *rMalta.(previous reference:CC. (54) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet considered a report by the Colonial Secretary(C. (54) 243) on his discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta on future constitutional development in Malta.The Colonial Secretary said that the Cabinet should nowconsider what action should be taken if, as now seemed likely,Dr. OHvier&apos;s reply to the offer to transfer responsibility in london for Maltese affairs to the Home Office was indefinitely delayed. on further reflection he did not now favour the appointment of a RoyalCommission on the constitutional and financial problems of Malta;and he recommended that no public mention should be made of this possibility without further reference to the Cabinet. The better course, in his view, was to seek to promote a conference ofrepresentatives of all the chief political Parties in Malta, togetherpossibly with Certain other local personages, to consider these problems. Such a conference would be presided over by a ColonialOffice Minister, who would steer it towards sound conclusions. If,however, such a conference were to fail in its purpose, the Govern-ment would be free to adopt whatever course might then seemappropriate. The root of the problem lay in the facts that Malta&apos;sproblems were basically economic and financial, and that the maltese government aimed at combining constitutional and political independence with continued financial support from the UnitedKingdom Government. He did not, however, exclude the possibility that further discussions might lead to some financial arrangement which would satisfy Malta&apos;s needs without involving the UnitedKingdom Government in additional financial commitments.The Commonwealth Secretary agreed that it would be inexpedient to appoint a Royal Commission on Malta&apos;s constitutional problems.Such a Commission might well recommend that, responsibility formaltality&apos;s affairs should be transferred to the Commonwealth relations office, a solution which should certainly be avoided.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to explore the possibilityof arranging a conference of representatives of Maltesepolitical Parties on the future constitutional status of malta.(2) Agreed that, without further reference to the Cabinet, noencouragement should be given to the idea that a RoyalCommission might be appointed to consider Malta&apos;constitutional and financial problems.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 258) submitting the recommendation of an ad hoc committee which had reviewed the plans for the future use ofTarrant Rushton airfield in Dorset.The Home Secretary explained that this airfield had been held under requisition since the war and was about to be bought by theAir Ministry under the Defence Acts as a reserve airfield for use inwar. Since 1947 it had been occupied under licence by Sir AlanCobham5s firm, Flight Refuelling Ltd. Two main questions had now to be decided: -(i) should the Government allow the activities of FlightRefuelling Ltd. at Tarrant Rushton to continue?(ii) before making known their decision under (i) above, shouldthe Government arrange for the holding of any further enquiry?His Committee were satisfied that the Air Ministry should beauthorised, When they had bought the airfield, to grant a twenty-oneMilitaryAirfields.TarrantRushton.(previous reference:C.C.(54)37thConclusions,Minute 5.)
year lease to Flight Refuelling Ltd., provided that the terms of the lease would ensure observance of the conditions which had been laiddown by the Dorset County Planning Committee after an informalmeeting held at the airfield on 21st June and were set out inparagraph 7 of C. (54) 258. On the question of an enquiry theCommittee had been advised by the Minister of Housing that itwould be a misuse of the statutory procedure to reopen the public enquiry into the County Development Plan for the limited purpose in view. They had also satisfied themselves that the circumstance were not appropriate for an enquiry under section 26 of the Townand Country Planning Act, 1947, or under paragraph 50 of theWhite Paper &quot; Needs of the Armed Forces for Land for training and Other Purposes &quot; (Cmd. 7278). The Committee had thereforeconcluded that any further pressure for an enquiry should be resisted.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Tarrant Rushtonairfield would be required by the R.A.F. in war and that nearly allthe peace-time activities of Flight Refuelling Ltd., which wereindicated in paragraph 4 of C (54) 258, were also of importance for defence purposes. He believed that much of the local anxiety couldbe allayed if it could be demonstrated that the use of the airfieldwould be limited to what was necessary for defence purposes. TheConservative Agricultural Committee, with whom he had discussed the matter, were not likely to raise serious objection if the terms ofthe lease granted to Sir Alan Cobham were suitably restrictive.The Minister of Housing said that the Government were likelyto be exposed to some public criticism over this matter, whatevercourse they adopted. If they declined to hold an enquiry they wouldbe open to the criticism that Tarrant Rushton had been shown in theCounty Development Plan as a civilian airfield, &quot; primarily used for commercial purposes,&quot; which was clearly not an accurate description of the true position there. If they held the enquiry, it would be saidthat an enquiry conducted by one of the Minister&apos;s inspectors, whosereport would be made to the Minister and would not be published,could not have been expected to affect the Governmenfs decision.On balance, therefore, he had agreed with the Home Secretary&apos;sCommittee in favouring an attempt to promote an agreed settlementof this dispute without holding any further enquiry. The CountyPlanning Authority would be satisfied if their conditions were met,and they were opposed to any further enquiry. There seemed to bea reasonable prospect of securing an agreement acceptable to all the interested parties save Commander Marten.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that the problem should be handled on these lines.The Lord President said that he did not dissent from this conclusion, but it must be recognised that continuance of the activitiesof Flight Refuelling Ltd. in what had hitherto been pre-eminentlya rural area would be bound to change the character of theneighbourhood and to do some damage to local agricultural interests.The Prime Minister said that the vital importance to the R.A.F.of development of flight refuelling went a long way towards justifyingan attempt to promote a settlement of this dispute by agreement andwithout incurring the risks which any public enquiry was bound to involve. If, however, the attempt to promote such a settlement should fail, the Cabinet ought clearly to reconsider whether, in thecircumstances which then obtained, some further form of public enquiry ought not to be conceded.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to seek to promote the widest possible measure of agreement on the grant toFlight Refuelling Ltd. of a twenty-one year lease ofTarrant Rushton airfield, the terms of which should fully
capital punishment.Report of theRoyalCommission.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (54) 166) on therecommendations made in the Report of the Royal Commissionon Capital Punishment (Cmd. 8932).The Home Secretary said that all the three majorrecommendations of the Commission, set out in paragraph 3 ofC. (54) 166, were in his judgment unacceptable. Of the Commission^minor recommendations, reproduced in the appendix to his memorandum, some could be put into effect by administrative action.The remainder were useful suggestions for amendment of the existing law, but he did not favour early introduction. of the necessary legislation. Before the end of the next Parliamentary session, time would have to be provided for a debate on the Commission^ Report.He suggested that the Government spokesman in such a debate should say that the Government felt grave doubts about the wisdom of the Commission^ main recommendations but, in coming to afinal conclusion, would wish to take account of the views expressedin the debate. Although the Commission had been precluded bytheir terms of reference from considering whether or not capital punishment should be retained, the sole result of their labours mightwell have been to establish the fact that there was no scope for substantial modification of the present law and administrationrelating to capital punishment, and that the issue which remainedwas whether capital punishment should be retained or abolished. he himself was convinced that it should be retained.The Secretary of State for Scotland expressed his agreementwith the Home Secretary, whose views proved generally acceptable to the Cabinet.The Attorney-General suggested that, when the time came forthe Government to announce their views on the matter, they mightwell go beyond saying that they felt grave doubts about accepting the Royal Commission^ recommendations. The Cabinet agreedthat the Government would be justified in stating that they were disposed to reject the Royal Commission^ main recommendations,but that they were naturally ready to give due consideration to any fresh arguments which might be advanced in support of them in thecourse of Parliamentary debate.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed generally the conclusions of the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, as set out inparagraphs 13-14 of C. (54) 166.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to announce, when thisquestion came to be debated in the House of Commons,that the Government were not disposed to accept the main recommendations of the Royal Commission.safeguard the conditions which had been laid down by theDorset County Planning Committee and were summarised in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 258.(2) Agreed that, if the Secretary of State failed to secure asubstantial measure of agreement on the future use ofthe airfield, the Cabinet should consider further the expediency of holding some form of public enquiry before such a lease was granted to Flight Refuelling Ltd.

Gibraltar.Pay ofindustrialworkers.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 30thConclusions.Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Labour (C. (54) 253) and by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the First Lord of the Admiralty (C. (54) 259) on the remuneration of industrial workers in Gibraltar.The Minister of Labour said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s request, he had examined the scale of the remunerationpaid by the Service Departments to the Spanish workers whom theyemployed in Gibraltar. At present, workers of Spanish nationalityreceived only half of the cost-of-living allowance which was paid to
Admission of 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeForeigners to Secretary (C. (54) 256) on the abolition of the visa requirement forthe United       German and Austrian visitors to this country.ffrevtous&quot; The Home Secretary said that the Foreign Secretary had askedReference: him to waive the requirement that the passports of German andC.C. (52) 70th Austrian visitors to the United Kingdom should bear a British visa.Conclusions, While recognising the force of the political considerations which had minute 2.) &apos; prompted the Foreign Secretary&apos;s request, he had felt it necessaryAbolition of t0 inform the Cabinet of the objections to which this proposal wasVisas for 0Pen on security grounds. The Federal Government in WesternGerman and Germany were willing to issue a passport to any refugee from EasternAustrian Germany who could show that he was a German; and, if GermansNationals. visiting this country were no longer required to obtain a British visa,undesirable Germans from Eastern Germany would have lessdifficulty in making their way into this country.The Foreign Secretary said that this requirement had now beenwaived by all European countries except the United Kingdom, theIrish Republic and Portugal. It was undesirable that we should appear less friendly to Western Germany than were other european countries and less forward in promoting free communications withinEurope. He recognised that there would be a certain security risk in adopting his proposal but he believed that this was outweighed bythe wider considerations of foreign policy which he had mentioned.nationals of Gibraltar irrespective of whether the workers concerned were resident in Gibraltar or in Spain. The Cabinet had agreed thatsome change in this discrimination should be made and he had cometo the conclusion that it would be preferable to solve this difficultyby adopting the same rate of wages and cost-of-living allowances forGibraltarians and Spanish workers alike. This solution was favoured by the Government of Gibraltar and would accord with the practicegenerally followed by private employers. His proposal was basedon applying the principle of the rate for the job without differentiationaccording to nationality or domicile. An alternative solution wouldbe to assess the cost-of-living allowance payable to Spanish workersresident in Spain on the basis of a comparison of the cost of living in spain and in Gibraltar respectively.The Foreign Secretary said that the present discrimination against Spanish nationals provided the Spanish Government with anopportunity for damaging propaganda against us. He would prefer that this ground of complaint against us should be removed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Treasury andthe Service Departments were reluctant to agree to the abolition of the differential in the cost-of-living allowances for the reasons setout in C. (54) 259. If the remuneration of Spaniards employedin Gibraltar were increased, agitation might develop amongGibraltarians for an increase in their remuneration to preserve theadvantage which they had enjoyed for some years. He would prefer a more gradual approach to the problem; and he suggestedthat no more should be done for the moment than to reduce theexisting differential from 24s. to 14s. a week by adding 10s. to thecurrent rate of allowance for the cost of living in Spain.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to seek the views of theGovernor of Gibraltar on the question whether the position could not be held for the time being by increasing from24s. to 34s. a week the cost-of-living allowance for Spaniardsemployed by the Service Departments in Gibraltar.
The Prime Minister said that, before this step was taken, theCabinet should know what numbers would be involved.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate for their informationa statement indicating the number of Germans and austrians who had come to the United Kingdom in recentyears for visits of less than three months.(2) Agreed that, subject to any points which members of theCabinet might wish to raise in the light of this statement,German and Austrian nationals visiting the UnitedKingdom for less than three months should no longer berequired to obtain a British visa.Persia. 7.   The Foreign Secretary said that he wished to ascertain the(Previous        views of his colleagues on the desirability of offering a loan of upReference:      to  5 million to Persia.

It wouldalso be necessary to consider its relation to any loan which the UnitedStates Government might be intending to offer to Persia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in principle he supported the suggestion outlined by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet-Agreed in principle that a loan of  5 million should be offered to Persia in the form of an export credit guarantee;and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider the timing of this offer in consultation with the foreign secretary.The Cabinet 8.   The Prime Minister said that Mr. Oliver Lyttelton hadresigned his office as Colonial Secretary and this would be the last meeting of the Cabinet which he would attend. He knew that theCabinet would wish him to express their deep regret at the loss of acolleague whose untiring service had been of such value both to thepresent Government and to the Coalition Government, duringthe war.The Cabinet.(previous reference:CC. (54) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Prime Minister said that meetings of the Cabinet wouldbe kept to a minimum during the first part of the summer recess. InAugust, meetings would be held only when there was urgent business to be transacted, and these meetings need be attended only by ministers who were in London or within easy reach of it.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th July, 1954.
