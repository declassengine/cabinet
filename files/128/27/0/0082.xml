Railwaymen had broken off their current wages negotiation withRailways. the British Transport Commission and were likely to ask the Minister(Previous of Transport to intervene in the matter.  The Minister of LabourReference: and the Minister of Transport were preparing a memorandum on this c.C. (54) 73rd question as a basis for Cabinet discussion later in the week.Conclusions,Minute 5.)House of 2.   The Cabinet were informed that doubts had arisen on the commons question whether Mr. Peter Baker&apos;s seat in the House of CommonsDisqualified- had been automatically vacated by his conviction on charges utilisation. forgery.  When a similar case had occurred in 1903, the Attorney-Mr. Peter General of the day had advised that the seat was vacated auto-Baker, M.P.     matically by reason of the provisions of the Forfeiture Act, 1870;but it had now been questioned whether this advice was soundlybased. The Government would be expected to express a view onthis point early in the following week, when the time would haveexpired within which Mr. Baker might have applied for leave to appeal against his conviction.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers to advisethem on the question whether Mr. Peter Baker&apos;s seat in theHouse of Commons had been vacated by reason of his conviction of forgery.Horror 3.  The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeComics. Secretary and the Attorney-General (C. (54) 359 and 372) on thequestion whether legislation should be introduced to prohibit thepublication and sale of sensational newspapers and magazines for children of the kind commonly described as &quot; horror comics.&quot;The Home Secretary said that there was a growing body of publicopinion which favoured early Government action to restrict the circulation of this type of literature. No such action could be takenby the Government without legislation on the lines indicated inC. (54) 359. It would not be easy to frame such legislation: inparticular, it would be difficult to define in statutory language the type of literature which was to fall within the prohibition. On theother hand, if the Government failed to take an initiative in this, therewas a risk that legislation might be brought forward in the form of aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill, which would involve the Government in even greater embarrassment. The Home Secretary therefore sought authority to prepare a Bill for consideration by the Cabinet and, inorder to forestall action by a Private Member, to make an early statement in the House of Commons that the Government were considering the possibility of legislation.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the proposals putforward by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for thepreparation of a draft Bill, for consideration by theCabinet, to prevent the publication and sale of horrorcomics.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to make an early statement in Parliament to the effect that the Government were considering the possibility of introducing legislation onthis subject.
House of 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeCommons. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C.

Boundary Commissions.(Previous This analysis showed that some of the Commissions&apos; recom-Reference:      mendations had been put forward solely on account of their statutoryCC. (54) 77th   obligation to recommend changes designed to produce numericalConclusions,     equality between  constituencies.   The  Ministers  proposed that minute 1.)       Parliament   should   not   be   pressed   to   give   effect   to   any recommendations in this category in respect of which it became evident that no political Party desired any change of the existingboundaries.   For the rest, the Ministers proposed that the Govern-ment should support the Commissions&apos; recommendations and inviteParliament to give effect to them.   As regards the future, it wassuggested that the Government should indicate their readiness toconsider the introduction of legislation to amend the existing lawin such a way as to relieve the Commissions of their obligation torecommend changes merely for the sake of producing numericalequality and to provide that these reviews of constituencies should becarried out at longer intervals.In discussion there was general agreement with the Ministers&apos;proposals for handling the immediate changes in constituency boundaries which were recommended in the reports of the boundary commissions.As regards the future, there was support for the view that theexisting law should be amended on the lines suggested in paragraph 5of C. (54) 352. In particular, it was suggested that the interval between general reviews of constituency boundaries might with advantage be extended from 7 years to a period of 10-15 years. Onthe other hand, the point was made that the Government should not show too great a willingness to contemplate amending legislationlest this should be turned by the Opposition into an argument for amending the existing law before effect was given to the latest reportsof the Boundary Commissions. Though some general statement would have to be made before Parliament was asked to deal with the specific changes recommended by the Commissions, it would be inexpedient that the impression should be created that amending legislation could be passed without difficulty or delay.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (54) 352, subject to the point raised in the discussion about the reference in Parliamentto the possibility of amending legislation.Price of Sugar. 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of(Previous Food (C. (54) 363) inviting the Cabinet to decide whether the priceReference: at which sugar was sold by his Department to refiners should beCC. (54) 55th increased by an amount likely to raise the retail price of sugar by conclusions,     i^. per lb.Minute 8.) In favour of this proposal the following arguments were putforward. The prospective loss on Government trading in sugar was partly due to the special purchase of Cuban sugar which had beenmade as a safeguard against the development of shortages after sugarceased to be rationed. This additional purchase, had been made forthe protection of consumers, and it was reasonable that they should bear some part of the loss incurred on it. An increase in the retail price of sugar had been one of the measures recommended by theCabinet Committee on Civil Expenditure. Ministers now sawdifficulties in proceeding with several of the other measures recommended by that Committee, e.g., the proposals for savings onthe bread subsidy and on teachers&apos; superannuation; and, if still more of the economy measures then envisaged had to be abandoned, the
prospects for the 1955 Budget would be seriously jeopardised. Atpresent levels of employment the public could support an increase of\d. per lb. in the price of sugar. It would involve a rise of not morethan -08 of a point in the cost of living index.On the other hand it was recognised that this price increase would be exploited by the Opposition, who were already seekingpolitical advantage from increases in food prices which had occurred since the Government took office. It should be remembered, in thisconnection, that the prices of tea and meat were also likely to riseduring the coming months. It would be preferable that any increasein sugar prices should be deferred until after the winter, when theincreased benefits to pensioners would be coming into operation.There seemed also to be special difficulty in raising the price of sugarin this country at a time when the world price was falling. And itwould be a new departure to require the consumer, in such circumstances, to bear the cost of liquidating Government stocks : inrelation to other materials, the Government had hitherto followed the opposite policy of selling Government stocks at the current market price. Finally, it would be particularly difficult to justify anincrease in the retail price of sugar so soon after the leading sugarrefiners in this country had declared greatly increased profits and larger dividends.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, in all thecircumstances, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should first considerthe possibility of reducing the apparent loss on Government trading in sugar by transferring supplies to the strategic stockpile, in thecurrent year&apos;s accounts, at the original purchase price. If the losscould not be fully covered by this means and some increase must bemade in the wholesale price at which Government sugar was sold inthis country, the refiners should be pressed to bear at any rate some part of the increased cost out of their profits instead of passing all ofit on to the consumer in an increase in the retail price.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Food, the suggestions which had been put forward in the Cabinefs discussion andto submit his recommendations to the Cabinet for considera-tion at a later meeting.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (54) 378) about the retired pay of public servants.The memorandum explained that prospective increases in ratesof National Insurance and War Disability pensions were giving riseto pressure for improved pension rates for retired public servants,including former officers in the Armed Forces, civil servants and teachers. It was recommended that this demand, although it mightbe strongly pressed, should be resisted both on grounds of principle and because there would be serious practical difficulty in doing anything reasonable to meet it.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that public pressure for such increases must be resisted. The Treasury should assistMinisters by suggesting the lines on which representations onthe subject could best be answered.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C. (54) 378.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for guidance to be given to Ministers on the lines along whichrepresentations made to them on this subject could best be answered.The public services.Rates of retired Pay.^previous reference:C.C.

colonial immigrants.(previous reference:CC. (54) 78thConclusions,Minute 4.)^7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (54) 375 and 379) about a departmental Committee which it was proposed to appoint toconsider what restrictions should be imposed, if any, on the immigration of coloured workers into the United Kingdom.On the proposed membership and terms of reference of theDepartmental Committee the following points were made:  (a) It might be preferable not to include any Members ofParliament among the members of the Committee but to encourage the political Parties to give evidence before the Committee instead.(b) Any impression that the Government favoured actioninvolving racial discrimination could be avoided if the terms ofreference suggested in C. (54) 354 were amended to read as follows :  &quot; To consider and report whether any and, if so, what changes in the law relating to the admission to the UnitedKingdom of British subjects from overseas, and to theirsubsequent stay in the United Kingdom, are necessary or desirable in the national interest and in the interest of the immigrants themselves.&quot;In further discussion, however, serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of proceeding with the appointment of such aCommittee. It was bound to include some members who would be opposed in principle to any action which might appear to bediscriminatory in character. At the best, therefore, the Governmentwould be likely to find themselves obliged to act in disregard of a minority report, while at the worst the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations might make it impracticable for the Government to take any action in the matter.The Cabinet were reminded that those Ministers who had hitherto favoured the appointment of a Committee had been influenced by the belief that no legislation on this subject could be passed during the current session and that, if the problem wereremitted meanwhile for study by a Committee, it would be easier forthe Government to hold the position until legislation becamepracticable. In fact, however, there appeared to be a surprisinglywide body of Opinion in favour of immediate action, and it was arguable that some of those who might acquiesce in such action might find it less easy to give public evidence in support of it before a Committee. As a next step the draft of a Bill might be prepared inorder that Ministers might be better able to judge whether early legislation on the subject could be attempted. The point was made that a decision to proceed with such legislation during the current session would almost certainly mean the abandonment of some othermeasure already included in the legislative programme.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary and the Colonial Secretary toarrange for the preparation of draft legislation designed toplace suitable restrictions upon the admission of Britishsubjects from overseas to the United Kingdom and upon their subsequent stay there, and to submit such draftlegislation for consideration by the Cabinet.Pensions for 8.  The Cabinet held a brief discussion about the line to be takenOld Age and by the Government spokesman in the forthcoming debate on theWar Disability. Second Reading of the National Insurance Bill on the recommenda-(Previous tion in the report of the Phillips Committee that the age at which the reference: National Insurance retirement pension became payable should beCC (54) 78th raised over a period of years from sixty-five to sixty-eight.Conclusions, On the one hand, the view was expressed that the GovernmentMinute 3.) should as soon as possible make it clear that they were not disposed
to accept this recommendation. This was desirable in order to counter rumours to the effect that it was the Government^ intentionto offset the prospective increase in pension rates by raising the ageof retirement. The Cabinet were informed that it had already beenfound desirable to issue a statement, on the authority of the Treasury,to the effect that this particular recommendation of the PhillipsCommittee would need to be considered by the Government in common with the Committee&apos;s other recommendations.On the other hand it was argued that, although this particularrecommendation was open to obvious objections, it would be right that the Government should be seen to have had an opportunity toconsider the Committee&apos;s report as a whole and that such considera-tion should not seem to be prejudiced by public statements aboutparticular recommendations of a kind which might make it difficult for the Government to take action, if they so desired, at a later date.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance toconsider with the Chancellor of the Exchequer what shouldbe said in the forthcoming debate on the recommendationof the Phillips Committee about the minimum age at whichretirement pension might be payable in the future.European Coal        9.   The Minister of Housing said that, in his further negotiations and Steely       for the conclusion of an agreement for the closer association of theCommunity.     United Kingdom with the European Coal and Steel Community, he(Previous       was finding it unavoidable to accept certain minor modifications ofReference:      the draft form of agreement which the Cabinet had approved onC.C. (54) 70th   25th October. These modifications of the draft agreement involvedConclusions,    some shift of emphasis, from the High Authority of the CommunityMinute 7.)       to the Council of Ministers, in the arrangements for futureconsultation between the Community and the United Kingdom.  Inthese negotiations he was proceeding in agreement with the foreign secretary and the other Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.6th December, 1954.
