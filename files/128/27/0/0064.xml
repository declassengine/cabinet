Formosa.(previous reference:CC. (54) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before thern a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 308) describing the stage now reached in the preparations for bringing the question of Quemoy before the security council of the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that the New Zealand Governmenthad finally agreed to take the initiative, and agreement had subsequently been reached between the Governments of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom and New Zealand on the texts of:  (i) a letter from the New Zealand Government placing the matter before the Security Council; (ii) a draft resolution to be tabled in theSecurity Council; and (iii) an agreed minute defining the scope ofthe operation. These three documents were reproduced in annexes 1-3 to C. (54) 308. The Americans were now engaged in informing the Chinese Nationalists about the plan and seeking toensure their co-operation in it. If these discussions went smoothly,we should then inform the Governments in Peking and Moscow ofwhat was proposed, and seek their co-operation. The foreign secretary read to the Cabinet the draft of the telegram which it was proposed to send for this purpose to Her Majesty&apos;s Representative in peking. Similar instructions would be sent to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Moscow, who would urge the Soviet Government todo all in their power to persuade the Peking Government to send representatives to the United Nations to discuss the question. Thewhole plan was fraught with serious dangers, but the alternatives wereeven more alarming.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the course of action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed with the actionrecommended in C. (54) 308.industrial disputes.NewspaperIndustry.(previous reference :CC. (54) 50thConclusions,Minute 7.)london transport.Docks.(previous reference:CC. (54) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in current industrial disputes.The national newspapers had been compelled to suspendpublication on 11th October owing to a demarcation dispute between two Unions over the manning of the machines used for printing the daily Sketch. This dispute had been going on for more than eighteen months; and, although the immediate difficulty had been got overas a result of pressure by the Trades Union Congress on the twoUnions concerned, no final settlement had yet been reached.An unofficial ban on overtime was now in force at 97 out of 111omnibus depots in London. Emergency schedules were to beintroduced on the following day on nine of the routes most affected;and it was possible that, as a result of this, the men at some of thedepots might come out on strike. The London Transport executive and the Unions were ready to negotiate on all outstanding grievancesas soon as the unofficial ban on overtime was lifted and the menresumed normal working.In discussion it was suggested that further steps should be takento ensure that the public understood the reasons for this dislocation of London &apos;bus services, which was causing substantial inconvenience.The Minister of Labour and The Minister of Transport undertook to give suitable guidance on this point to the Press.The Minister of Labour said that he still thought it would beinopportune for him to intervene in the dispute in the ship-repairingindustry in the London docks.The Minister said, however, that he was increasingly concerned about the probable extension of the dockers&apos; strike initiated by thestevedores. In this dispute conciliation was complicated by thecurrent dispute between the Stevedores Union and the Transport and
General Workers Union, which was likely to prevent the holding of joint discussions with official representatives of all the men concerned.If, however, the lightermen decided to come out on strike, the stoppage would soon begin to produce serious dislocation, not onlyin the export trade, but in the maintenance of essential services inLondon; and the Government would before long be compelled to intervene. The Minister had explained this to Mr. Deakin, theSecretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, and had made it clear that, if the dispute continued, he would feel obligedto consider appointing a Court of Enquiry. When he had taken this initiative to promote a settlement, he would be willing that troops should be brought in to handle perishable cargoes and to maintain essential services. It must be recognised, however, that this use ofmilitary labour in London would probably have the effect ofspreading the strike to other ports. There was no question of usingtroops for the purpose of maintaining law and order.In discussion it was agreed that the Service Departments should now prepare plans for using troops to handle essential cargoes inthe London docks, but that care should be taken to avoid anydisclosure that these plans were being made, at any rate until afterthe meeting of strikers which Mr. Deakin was to address on13th October.The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Minister ofLabour.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,13th October, 1954.
