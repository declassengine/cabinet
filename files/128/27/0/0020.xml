Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that the Second Reading of the Television Bill,on 25th March, should be moved by the Home Secretary and thatthe Assistant Postmaster-General should reply to the debate.Military 2.   The Prime Minister drew the attention of the Cabinet toAirfields.        the proposal to develop Scampton airfield, near Lincoln.  The mainScampton.       arguments for and against this development were summarised ina note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (54) 84).The Lord Privy Seal said that, although this matter concernedhis own constituency, he had thought it right to bring it to the noticeof the Prime Minister because he believed that it raised questions ofwider interest. The proposed extension of this airfield would entailcutting Ermine Street and building a by-pass road of about three miles. This was likely to arouse criticism on grounds of historicalsentiment. Moreover, the airfield was very close to the city ofLincoln, whose inhabitants would doubtless resent the disturbanceand risk which the development of the airfield for long-range medium bombers would cause.The Secretary of State for Air said that he greatly regretted the disturbance caused to various interests by the development oflarge airfields, but this was an inevitable consequence of the RoyalAir Force programme. The choice of locality for these bomberbases was limited by a number of considerations. They had to benear the fuel pipe-line and the bomb stores. They must not be within 30 miles of the coast because of the danger of tip-and-runraiders. They must be constructed as economically as possible andthey must make the least possible encroachment on agricultural land.On these criteria development at Scampton was less objectionable,and much less expensive, than development at any alternative site.He did not think that the use of this airfield by jet bombers would cause as much disturbance to Lincoln as had been caused by the older types of bombers, which were more numerous and operatedat lower altitudes. The full procedure for consultation with interested parties had not yet been completed. Unless the Cabinet decidedthat the project should be abandoned without further consideration,he would proceed in the ordinary course to initiate the routine con-consultations with the Ministry of Housing and other Departmentsconcerned and with the local authorities and interests affected.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the normal procedure for consultation on thedevelopment of Scampton airfield should go forward.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this project when these consultations had been completed.IndustrialOrganisationand Develop-ment Bill.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 7th.Conclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (54) 89) discussing the Parlia-mentary tactics for handling the Industrial Organisation andDevelopment Bill.The President of the Board of Trade said that the original purpose of the Bill had been to enable the Joint Clothing Council to finance its work by a statutory levy on the clothing industry. TheBill had, however, encountered severe opposition from some government :supporters, and the Joint Clothing Council itself had now formally suggested that further proceedings on it should be deferred. It was clear that the Government could not proceed with-1 b 2
Sexual Offences.(previous reference:CC. (54) 1.1thConclusions,Minute 12.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the HomeSecretary&apos;s proposal that a Royal Commission should be appointedto review the existing law relating to prostitution and homosexuality.The Home Secretary re-stated the case for an enquiry which wasoutlined in his memorandum C. (54) 60 and had been developed inthe Cabinefs earlier discussion on 24th February. His conclusion was that the prevalence of prostitution, particularly in London, andthe unexplained increase in homosexual offences, constituted a serioussocial problem which the Government could not ignore; that, withoutsupport from the findings of an independent and authoritativeenquiry the Government would not be in a position to promotelegislation, or to take other measures, to deal with this problem; andthat in these circumstances the only course open to them was toappoint a Royal Commission or other appropriate form of enquiry to examine the problem and to suggest appropriate remedies.Discussion showed that some Ministers were still reluctant toagree to this proposal for the appointment of a Royal Commission.The Prime Minister said that^ in his view, the prudent coursewould be to take no action save to encourage a Private Member tointroduce in the House of Commons, under the ten-minute rule, a Billdesigned to prohibit the publication of detailed information of criminalprosecutions for homosexual offences. The Home Secretary said thathe would be ready to submit to the Cabinet a memorandumexamining the arguments for and against such restrictive legislation.But he pointed out that such legislation, even if it had the effect ofallaying public anxiety about homosexuality, would make no contribution whatever towards a solution of the problem of prostitu-tion. This, in his view, was the more urgent and obvious problem.He had no doubt that the proper remedy for it was to increase the penalty for soliciting and to dispense with the necessity of proving&quot; annoyance &quot;; but he was satisfied and in this he had the supportof the majority of his Cabinet colleagues that there was no prospectof passing legislation to make these changes in the existing lawwithout the support of an independent enquiry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to submit a memorandumsummarising the arguments for and against legislationdesigned to restrict publication of the details of criminalprosecutions for homosexual offences.(2) Agreed to resume, when this memorandum was available,their discussion of the proposal to hold a formal enquiry into the law relating to prostitution and to homosexual,offences.the Bill. It could either be withdrawn, or it could be allowed to fallwith any other uncompleted business at the end of the Session.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Joint ClothingCouncil should be pressed to form a firm opinion at an early date sothat the President of the Board of Trade could make a definite state-ment to Parliament on the future of the Bill.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade to press theJoint Clothing Council for a firm decision on their attitudetowards the Industrial Organisation and Development Billso that he could make a definite statement to Parliament onthe Governments intentions with regard to this Bill.
Leeds City 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomePoKce. Secretary (C. (54) 97) seeking authority to appoint a tribunal underProposed the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to enquire into theTribunal of     administration of the Leeds City police force.Inquiry. The Home Secretary said that there was mounting evidence ofthe unsatisfactory disciplinary state of the Leeds Police. During athree-year period ending in September 1952, the number of disciplinary cases in the force expressed as a percentage of its establishment had been no less than 16 per cent, compared with 6 percent, in Sheffield and only 2 per cent, and\\ per cent, in birmingham and Bristol. Mr. Diplock, Q.C., who had re-heard the cases of twopolice sergeants who had recently been sentenced to reduction inrank, had been Unfavourably impressed with the credibility of anumber of officers in the plain clothes branch of the force; and theChief Constable of Leeds had himself admitted, in his evidence tothe Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming, that tolicense ready-money betting offices would be to regularise what was already existing in fact in Leeds. The Watch Committee of the city council had been clearly shown to be an unsatisfactory disciplinarybody. He recognised that the course of action which he proposed would single out the Leeds Police for severe condemnation and would expose the Government to the criticism that the trouble was reallydue to their own failure to amend the betting laws. He was findingit increasingly difficult, however, to refrain from strong action whichwas being urged upon him by two Members for Leeds constituencies one a supporter of the Government and one of the Opposition.Appointment of a Tribunal of Inquiry would require approval by aresolution of each House of Parliament.The Prime Minister said that he was by no means convinced of the need to take this action, which would reflect gravely upon theLeeds City Council. Individual offenders in the City&apos;s police force had been duly brought to judgment and the wiser course, in his view,would be to ensure that this process continued and that all possibleadministrative measures were taken to improve the state of discipline in the Force.In discussion attention was drawn to the limited scope for adminsitrative action by the central Government in a matter whichwas primarily the responsibility of the local authority concerned.At the same time ultimate responsibility remained with the HomeSecretary and his position in Parliament would be vulnerable if hefailed to take any measure open to him to improve the situation.On the other hand, it was recognised that the Governments position was seriously weakened by the fact that the unsatisfactory state of discipline in the Leeds Police could be said to be due largely, if not entirely, to the present state of the betting laws which the Govern-ment had so far shown no disposition to remedy on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission. It could be argued thatthe first step for the Government to take was to promote legislation to amend the betting laws.The Cabinet (1) Withheld their approval of the proposal to appoint a tribunalunder the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to enquire into the administration of the Leeds City police force.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to take all administrative measures open to him to secure an improvement in thestate of discipline of the Leeds City police force.
Food Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 4thConclusions,Minute 8.)Milk.Persia. 7.   The Foreign Secretary reported that since the Cabinefs(Previous        discussion on 15th March he had had a personal interview withReference:      Sir William Fraser, the Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil CompanyC.C. (54) 18th   (A.I.O.C.). A critical stage had now been reached in the negotiationsConclusions,    for the formation of a consortium of oil companies to market PersianMinute 5.)       oil. The issues which divided the various parties to the negotiations were extremely complex and were further complicated by differences of opinion about the probable financial results of various alternativebases for a settlement.The first question in the negotiations was the amount whichA.I.O.C. should receive from the other companies in return forsurrendering 60 per cent, of their previous 100 per cent, interest in persia&apos;s oil. On this point he had told Sir William Fraser that, inhis view, the gap between the figure suggested by the Company andthat proposed by the American companies was not so large thatit could not be bridged in further negotiation.The second question was the amount of compensation whichA.I.O.C. should receive from the Persian Government and the means by which it should be secured. On this the American companiesconsidered that the amount for which A.I.O.C. were asking wasexcessive and they were strongly opposed in principle to the methodproposed, under which the Persians would buy oil from the consortium at cost price and give it to A.I.O.C. On this point also he felt some sympathy with the point of view advanced by the americans. Mr. Hoover, who was representing the United StatesGovernment in this matter, had expressed the view that A.I.O.C.could legitimately ask for a net sum of  100 millions from the PersianGovernment. This seemed to him to be a not unreasonable figure,and he intended to ascertain how Mr. Hoover would propose thatit should be secured if the project of selling oil at cost price to the persians was rejected in principle by the other companies whichwould be joining the consortium.The Foreign Secretary added that, from his personal talks withthe United States Ambassador, Mr. Hoover and Sir William Fraser,he was satisfied that there was a real risk that, unless A.I.O.C. were6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (C. (54) 100) seeking authority to announce forthwith that the retail price of milk would remain at 6\d. a pint until 30th April,and would be 6d. a. pint from May to July inclusive and Id. a pintfrom 1st August until the end of March, 1955.The Minister of Food explained that under this proposal only two changes would be made in the price of milk during the year, ascompared with five changes made in 1953. The proposal would save  6f millions on the liquid milk subsidy and would reduce therisk of waste of milk during the main flush period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would have pre-ferred to secure an even greater saving on the liquid milk subsidy.While he recognised that this was not practicable, it would be neces-sary for him to ask his colleagues to consider at an early datealternative means of reducing the total cost of Exchequer subsidies to food production.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce the retail prices for milk proposed in C. (54) 100 for the year from April,1954, to March, 1955, inclusive.(2) Agreed to consider, at their meeting on 24th March, other proposals by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for reducingthe total cost of the subsidies to food production.
prepared to make further concessions, the American companies would break off negotiations. This would have the effect of post-postponing indefinitely the possibility of securing a settlement of thePersian oil problem. He had represented most strongly to Sir WilliamFraser that he must consider, not only the commercial interests ofA.I.O.C., but the wider interests of the United Kingdom in theMiddle East. Sir William Fraser had said that A.I.O.C. wouldrequire a little time in which to consider and reply to the latest proposals put forward by the American companies and he (theForeign Secretary) was doing all in his power to prevent the american companies from breaking off negotiations in the meantime.He would continue to keep in the closest possible touch withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer in the handling of this matter, buthe would also value the direct assistance of one or two of his cabinet colleagues in his further discussions with Sir William Fraser. Hewould circulate to his colleagues as soon as possible a memorandum explaining in greater detail the exact stage which the negotiations had reached.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theMinister of Housing to assist the Foreign Secretary in handling the present phase of the negotiations for asettlement of the Persian oil problem.Currency. 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the recentGold Market, meeting in Sydney he had discussed with the Commonwealth finance ministers in confidence a proposal to re-open the London GoldMarket on a restricted basis. This proposal had been welcomed bythem, and he had since been able to enlist the support of the UnitedStates Government for it. The Gold Market would be re-openedon 22nd March, and an announcement to this effect would be madeby the Bank of England within two or three days.The re-opening of the London Gold Market would not prejudgedecisions on the convertibility of sterling. It would enhance the prestige of the City of London and would increase world confidence in sterling.Transferable The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had also decidedSterling. to relax the restrictions on the use of transferable sterling.   Anyholder would be able to transfer it to any other, so that there wouldbe a single rate for all transferable sterling. This single rate would facilitate trading and would give some slight advantage to our exports.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17 th March, 1954.
