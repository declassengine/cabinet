The Prime Minister welcomed the Colonial Secretary on his(Previous       return from Kenya and, on behalf of the Cabinet,; congratulated himReference:     on the success of his mission.CC(54)17thConclusions.Minute 1.)Egypt 2.  The Foreign Secretary said that the United States SecretaryDefence        of State had made an encouraging response to the suggestion that negotiations,    the maintenance of the Canal Zone Base in peace might be entrusted(Previous       to a civilian organisation in which the Americans would take some reference:      share of responsibility.  Mr. Dulles had said that the United StatesCC (54) 18th   Government were in principle prepared to co-operate in working outConclusions.    a solution along these lines, provided that this would not involveMinute l.)      them in any new military commitment and that they would not beasked to participate in negotiations with the Egyptians unless theywere asked to do so by the Egyptian Government.  Mr. Dulles had added that there were many technical and other aspects of the proposition which would have to be considered before a final decision was reached.The Foreign Secretary said that, as he had made clear in his statement in the House of Commons that day, the defence negotia-tions with Egypt must be suspended until there was positive evidencethat the Egyptians intended to take active and co-operative measuresto improve the situation in the Canal Zone. Meanwhile, he proposedthat he should explore, in consultation with the Americans, the possi-bility of handing over the maintenance of the Base to an Anglo-American civilian organisation.The Prime Minister agreed that the details of an Anglo-Americancivilian organisation to maintain the Base might now be worked outfurther, in consultation with the Americans and without any finalcommitment. He would have preferred a definite rupture of thenegotiations with the Egyptian Government, which would have enabled us to take our stand on the 1936 Treaty and to announce that we intended to re-deploy the forces now located in the canal zone in accordance with our own interests. This re-deploymentcould continue for about two years, at the end of which we should still have 15.000 troops in the Canal Zone in the region betweenIsmailia and Port Said. These troops, who would be able to ensuretheir own security, could remain until we had reason to place com-plete confidence in the promises of the Egyptian Government.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Transport emphasised the importance of including in any agreement with the Egyptians an article about thefreedom of navigation through the Suez Canal. The foreign secretary said that he doubted if it was possible at this stage toconsider the inclusion of an article to this effect. There was alreadyagreement on the inclusion of a statement in the preamble and this had sufficient legal validity.(b) The re-deployment of British troops in the Canal Zone would entail the gradual abandonment of parts of the Base, and if this wereto start before the conclusion of an agreement it might invalidatethe argument that the proper maintenance of the Base was one ofthe main reasons for seeking agreement with the Egyptian Govern-ment. It was pointed out, on the other hand, that some initialre-deployment of forces might help to create those conditions ofconfidence without which no agreement was possible. This initialre-deployment could be accompanied by a corresponding contractionand concentration of the Base.:&apos;v&apos;: (c) As the prospects declined of securing continuing payment ofour occupation costs in Germany,1 it became increasingly important to obtain some relief in our overseas military expenditure in Egypt.4593a-2 &quot; 8 2

Atomic Energy.(previous reference:C,C.(54)9thConclusions.Minute 5.) -HydrogenBomb.4. The Prime Minister said that he was due to answer, in theHouse of Commons on the following day, a number of Questionsdesigned to elicit the assurance that the United States Governmentwould not use atomic weapons without prior consultation with theUnited Kingdom Government especially in circumstances in which such action, might provoke a retaliatory atomic attack on thiscountry. He had been advised to reply, in effect, that he was satisfied with the existing arrangements for consultation between the twoGovernments on this and related matters. But, in view of the dis-closures recently made by responsible United States authorities aboutthe power of the hydrogen bomb, he was not sure that an answer on those lines would satisfy Parliament. He had therefore been con-sidering whether he should preface this reply with a general state-ment on the strategic implications of the hydrogen bomb disclosingno more information than had already been made public by the responsible authorities in the United States.In discussion it was argued that the disclosures made about theeffects of the hydrogen bomb had not as yet excited great public anxiety in this country. The public had probably assumed that, in theevent of Russian aggression in Europe leading to general war, the americans would use atomic weapons in retaliation; and they mightnot have paused to consider in detail the effects whie&quot;action maswould have on this country. They were more concerned with the risk that the Americans might use atomic weapons in limited operations,e.g., in Korea or in Indo-China, and might thus precipitate a general war in which the Russians would retaliate by launching an atomicattack on this country. Parliament might therefore be more interested to know what assurances the United States Government
165 CC. 21 (54)had given that, if hostilities were resumed in Korea, they would not use atomic weapons without prior consultation with us. On this,although informal assurances had been given orally at the time of theBermuda Meeting, it could not be publicly stated that the UnitedStates Government were firmly committed to consult with us before taking action. On the other hand, the United States Secretary ofState, in a recent Press conference, had stated in effect that hisGovernment would not authorise the use of atomic weapons, without consultation with interested Allies, except for the purpose of self-preservation;- and it would be reasonable for the Prime Minister tosay, without being more specific, that he was satisfied with the under-standings which had been reached with the United States Governmenton this point.In further discussion the following points were made:  - (a) A general statement on the strategic importance of thehydrogen bomb would certainly provoke a demand for a full debate.In this; questions would be raised both on the detailed machineryfor consultation between Governments, and on the preparationswhich we were making to meet the new risks involved which theGovernment were not at present in a position to answer in detail.(b) It was desirable that, at the appropriate moment, the public should be made aware of the full implications of the development ofthe hydrogen bomb. But the timing of this disclosure should be carefully judged. It would not in any event be easy to deal with amatter of this gravity within the limits of replies to parliamentary questions. It seemed preferable that the subject should be developedat greater length, at the appropriate moment, in a speech.(c) Great care would be needed to check the development of a movement in favour of international agreement to prohibit the useof the hydrogen bomb or other atomic weapons. There could be no certainty that such an agreement could be effectively enforced. And,for some years at any rate, it would deprive the Western Powers oftheir main deterrent against Russian aggression in Europe.(d) So far as concerned the use of atomic weapons in Europe,the United States Government had given a written undertaking thatthey would not launch an atomic attack from their air bases in thiscountry without our agreement. This point should be givenprominence in the reply to the Questions in the House of Commons.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it seemed better that the reply to the Questions for answer in the Houseof Commons on the following day should deal only with the extentto which the United States Government had undertaken to consult with us and other Allies before using atomic weapons, and need notbe prefaced by any general statement on the effects of the hydrogenbomb. It would, however, be desirable that the answer should be designed to allay public anxiety and that it should, in particular, dealwith the American use of East Anglian bases for an atomic attack.The question of a Government statement on the effects of thehydrogen bomb could be reserved for later consideration.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would answer, in thelight of their discussion, the Questions to be addressed tohim in the House of Commons on the following day aboutthe extent to which the United States Government had undertaken to consult the United Kingdom government before using atomic weapons.Cabinet Office, SWA,24th March, 19.
