)    AFormosa. 2.  The Cabinet had before them the draft of a telegram,(Previous circulated at the meeting, which the Foreign Secretary proposed to reference: send to the United Kingdom Delegation to the United Nations,C.C. (54) 60th conveying to Mr. Dulles his views on the proposal, which the latterConclusions. had put forward in discussion with him on 17th September, to minute 2.)       recommend that the question of Quemoy should be brought beforethe Security Council under Articles 39 and 40 of the United nations charter.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentwere in a dilemma. To decide not to commit United States forces tohelp the Chinese Nationalists to hold Quemoy and other coastalislands would have a damaging effect on morale in Formosa andwould encourage the Communists, but to decide to commit UnitedStates forces would involve grave risk of a major war with China.The object of the course which Mr. Dulles had discussed with him was to obtain a resolution calling on the parties^concerned to complywith provisional measures designed to reduce the risk of violence andto lead to the neutralisation of the coastal islands. It was courageousof Mr. Dulles to consider this course, which would not be popularwith extremist opinion in the United States, and he deserved our support.European 1.   The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the latestDefence. developments in the situation arising from the French rejection of(Previous        the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) Treaty.Reference: Arrangements for the proposed nine-Power conference inC.C. (54) 60th London were going ahead and there appeared to be reasonableConclusions. prospects that it would result in agreement. Acceptances had alreadyMinute l.) &apos; been received from most of the countries invited, and he hoped thatthe conference would begin work on 28th September. In his speech at Strasbourg on the previous day, M. Mendes-France had, perhapsdeliberately, avoided clarity on two points in his proposals. He hadnot stated explicitly to which countries the international control ofarms and armament industries would apply; but it was clear fromthe memorandum embodying the French proposals (Paris telegramNo. 658) that international supervision would apply only to continental countries and would not extend to the United Kingdom.Nor had M. Mendes-France made it clear whether he agreed thatGermany should join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.) at the same time as she was brought into the brussels treaty. In both instances, however, it was possible that this lack ofprecision was designed to make the presentation of the proposals more acceptable in France at this stage.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The Government had given an undertaking in the House ofLords on 29th July, 1954, that, before an agreement to separate theBonn Conventions from the E.D.C. Treaty was ratified, parliament would be given an opportunity to debate the matter. this undertaking would have to be borne in mind if the nine-Power meeting was likely to reach an agreement which would lead to a declarationrecognising German sovereignty.(b) The negotiations about the termination of the occupationregime in Germany would involve important financial caonsiderations and there seemed some risk that we might not enjoy the full co-operation of the United States Government in trying to reach asettlement which would be financially acceptable to us.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints made in discussion.
The Foreign Secretary said he proposed to inform Mr. Dullesthat the United Kingdom Government considered that, if this coursewere pursued, it would be essential to invite the Chinese Communiststo present their case themselves before the Security Council. it seemed unlikely that the United States would oppose this, but it was by no means certain that the Chinese Communists would accept an invitation to attend in New York. He proposed also, in the messagehe would send to Mr. Dulles, to go into the procedural questionswhich the proposed course of action would raise.The Cabinet Approved the course of action proposed by the foreign secretary and the draft telegram before them.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 293) recommending that Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Manila should now be instructed to sign the Pacific Charter, thefinal text of which was attached to his memorandum.The Colonial Secretary said that the declaration that the partiesto the Charter would uphold the principle of self-determination might prove embarrassing to us in respect of Cyprus, particularly if the charter were signed before the Cyprus question had come beforethe United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that the declaration in the Charter infavour of self-government and independence was limited to countries whose peoples desired independence and were able to undertake its responsibilities. He would, however, arrange that, if possible,signature of the Charter should be delayed until after the Cyprus issuehad come before the United Nations.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Manila to sign the Pacific Charter on behalfof the United Kingdom.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (C. (54) 292) recommending that thedevelopment of Scampton as a Class I airfield should go forward.The Secretary of State for Air said that the requirements fortwelve Class I airfields, which current defence policy demanded,were such that there was no alternative to Scampton which could be developed without substantially more expenditure. He had given careful consideration to the objections raised by local interests andto the representations made by the Lord Privy Seal but there wasno alternative which he could recommend.The Lord Privy Seal said that he still deplored this proposal.The development of Scampton would cut the historic Ermine Streetand entail the construction of a by-pass road. It would also mean that there would be two major airfields near the cathedral city ofLincoln, which would disturb its amenities in peace and threatenimportant industry in war. It would be preferable to developHemswell, which was further north, and the deputation of local interests which had discussed this question with the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Air had not been convinced that thiscourse would involve as high an extra cost as had been suggested.
Retirement of 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the vice--Admiral Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 290) about the recent retirementJ. Hughes of Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett from the Royal Navy to become aHallett. Parliamentary candidate.  The memorandum explained that, whenVice-Admiral Hughes Hallett decided to retire, he was erroneouslyinformed that he would get retired pay at the rate of  1,200 a year,which was the rate appropriate to compulsory retirement, whereas in fact he was only entitled to  873 a year. Although he had laterbeen informed of this mistake, he had considered that he was morallycommitted to his candidature, as his selection had by then beenpublicly announced, and he had in consequence decided not towithdraw. The Admiralty had accordingly asked the Treasury toagree to the payment to Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett of retired pay of  1,200 a year. The Treasury Solicitor, whose opinion had beensought as to whether Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett could bring an action against the Admiralty, had advised that he would not only beable to make out a case, but would probably succeed in satisfying the Courts that he had suffered damage.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that he understood thatthe development of any alternative to Scampton would involve an extra cost of about  1^ millions, and in his view additional expenditure of this order would not be justified.In discussion it was suggested that it might not be necessaryto develop all twelve Class I airfields in this country if some partof the Medium Bomber Force could be stationed elsewhere, forexample in Cyprus where the work and investment involved in thedevelopment of a suitable airfield would provide additional meansof countering the campaign for Enosis. It was pointed out, on theother hand, that, although it was intended to develop an airfield in cyprus for such use as might prove necessary, it would be a far more costly undertaking to establish there a permanent station formedium bombers. Moreover, it was an accepted feature of our general defence policy that the development of all twelve Class Iairfields should be carried out in this country in order to enable the medium Bomber Force to fulfil its role as a vital element in the deterrent against aggression.The following points were also made in discussion:  (a) Development of Scampton appeared to be preferable toany alternative from the point of view of use of agricultural land.(b) Apart from the additional expense, there were other objections to the development of Hemswell. Thus, the circuit thereoverlapped that of a nearby American base.(c) There had, in fact, been two airfields in operation nearLincoln for some time, but there had been no recent complaints about disturbance.The general view of the Cabinet was that the development ofScampton should go forward, but some Ministers considered thatthis should be conditional on the estimate of the extra cost for developing any alternative airfield being conclusively shown to beas large as had been stated. The Lord Privy Seal expressed hisdissent in principle from any decision to develop Scampton.The Cabinet Agreed that development of Scampton as a Class I airfieldshould go forward, unless within a fortnight it could be shown, to the satisfaction of the Home Secretary, theMinister of Labour and the President of the Board of Trade,that the estimate that the development of any suitablealternative airfield would involve an additional cost of 1^ millions was incorrect, in which event the matter shouldbe considered again by the Cabinet.
The Prime Minister said that he did not favour making an extra-statutory award of  1,200 a year to Vice-Admiral HughesHallett at the present stage. Although he had been told of the error,the Vice-Admiral had decided, not without justification, to proceedwith his candidature, and he had reserved his position so far as apossible claim against the Admiralty had been concerned. it remained open to him to bring an action, as he might well decide to do after the election had been held, and the Government could then decide whether to contest his claim, or, if his case were thought to be a strong one, to concede the additional payment.There was support for the view that it was neither necessary nordesirable for the Government to reach a decision on this issue at thepresent time.The Attorney-General said that, in his opinion, althoughVice-Admiral Hughes Hallett might have a strong moral claim, itwas by no means certain that he would succeed in law in satisfying theCourts that he had suffered damage.The Cabinet Agreed that no decision should be taken at this stage toincrease Vice-Admiral Hughes Halletfs retired pay to 1,200 a year.Roman Temple 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thein the City of Minister of Works (C. (54) 294) about the discovery of the foundationsLondon. of a Temple of Mithras, dating from a.d. 150, on the BucklesburyHouse site, Walbrook, on which building construction was about to begin.The Minister of Works said that the discovery had been madeby the Roman and Medieval London Excavation Council with theassistance of grants made by his Department. At the PrimeMinisters suggestion, he had visited the site and had arranged thatbuilding construction should be postponed for a further week or twoin order to enable the archaeologists, if possible, to unearth and recordfully the ground plan of the Temple. The owners of the site and thebuilding contractors had co-operated with the archaeologists and agreed to this further delay, in spite of the financial loss it would entail. It would not, however, be reasonable, or justifiable onarchaeological grounds, to postpone the new building constructionindefinitely. Indeed, if further investigation showed that the groundplan of the Temple was considerably more extensive, it would notbe possible to unearth it completely without undermining Walbrookthoroughfare.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement.Commonwealth 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePrime Commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 289) covering a minute to theMinisters&apos; Prime Minister suggesting that a meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMeeting.        Ministers should be held in London in the latter part of January 1955,and a draft telegram of invitation from the Prime Minister to commonwealth Prime Ministers.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) It would be preferable to avoid giving the impression in theproposed telegram that the sole purpose of the meeting would be todiscuss foreign affairs and defence; other matters, such as economic
affairs, might well arise. It was agreed that the last four sentences of paragraph 1 of the draft telegram of invitation should be omitted.(b) If the proposed meeting v/ere to be held in January, it wouldbe convenient if it could take place in the latter part of the month.(c) It was by no means unlikely that the delicate issue of thefuture status of the Gold Coast, and its relationship to other commonwealth countries, would need to be discussed during thecourse of the proposed conference. This might well be doneinformally but it would be necessary, nevertheless, for theGovernment to be prepared to indicate their attitude on this issue.(d) It was pointed out that the issue of an invitation toSir Godfrey Huggins to attend the conference, as on previous occasions, might well lead to a formal request by the Gold Coastthat its Prime Minister should also be invited. Such a request would clearly have to be refused, but this would be likely to be expected and should not give rise to serious difficulty.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to communicate with other commonwealth Prime Ministers in the terms of the draft telegram attached to C. (54) 289, subject to the amendmentagreed upon in discussion.Industrial 8.   The Minister of Labour reported to the Cabinet on the stateDisputes. of labour relations.Docks. The Electrical Trades Union had started strike action affecting(Previous maintenance men in certain London docks, and there were indicationsreference: of other Communist activity to cause trouble in the docks, such asCC.
