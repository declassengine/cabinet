Formosa. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that Mr. W. Teelmg, M.P.,(Previous intended to visit the Far East during the Christmas recess and was reference: proposing to stay in Formosa as the guest of General ChiangC.C. (54) 80th Kai-shek. In deference to representations from the Foreign OfficeConclusions. he had offered to curtail the length of his proposed stay in FormosaMinute 7.)       but was unwilling to cancel his visit.The Cabinet agreed that it was undesirable that one of the government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons should pay sucha visit to Formosa at the present time. The Prime Minister said thatthe Chief Whip should represent this view forcibly to Mr. Teehng.If necessary he would be prepared to send him a letter to this effect.Soviet Union. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government hadDeserters. asked for the return of a Soviet soldier named Kuptsov who had sought asylum in the British Zone of Germany after killing one of hisnon-commissioned officers who had at first planned to desert withhim but had at the last moment tried to prevent his escape. In theordinary course we should decline to return a Soviet deserter whohad sought political asylum with us. On this occasion, however,our course was not so clear partly because Kuptsov had murderedone of his non-commissioned officers, and partly because the russians had recently returned to us a number of British subjects who had for various reasons come into their custody in the Soviet Zone ofGermany.In discussion it was suggested that the weight to be attachedto the first of these considerations might depend on the extent towhich the murder had been an inevitable part of Kuptsov&apos;s attemptto seek political asylum. The Court of Appeal would shortly bedelivering judgment on the case of seven Polish seamen who had committed acts of violence in making their escape from the Sovietregime in Poland. This judgment might have some bearing on thedecision to be taken on the Soviet application in respect of Kuptsov,The Cabinet-Took note that the Foreign Secretary would seek the advice of the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General on thelegal issues involved before he decided whether the deserterKuptsov should be returned to the Soviet authorities.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was proposed that, if satisfactory progress were made withthe Pensions Bill and the Orders in Council adjusting the boundaries of Parliamentary constituencies, Parliament would be adjourned forthe Christmas recess from 22nd December to 25th January.House ofCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous reference:C.C.(54)82ndConclusions,Minute 4.)4735.4. The Lord Privy Seal said that since the Cabinefs discussion on 6th December he had been giving further thought to the proposal that Parliament should not be pressed to accept some of the changesin the boundaries of Parliamentary constituencies which had been recommended by the Boundary Commissions if it became evidentthat these changes were not desired by any political Party. Govern-ment supporters in the House of Commons would probably be readyto accept the Commissions&apos; recommendations as a whole; but, if theGovernment showed that they were ready to drop some of theparticular recommendations, protests were likely to be made by  b 2
Members affected by other recommendations to which effect wasto be given. If the Government differentiated, as had been proposedin C. (54) 352, between the various recommendations in the reports,they would thereby endanger their main argument that they had no alternative but to ask Parliament to give effect to reports submittedby impartial bodies in discharge of the statutory duty laid upon themby Parliament.In discussion there was support for the view expressed by theLord Privy Seal. The Cabinet agreed, however, that they could not reach a final decision on this point in the absence of the HomeSecretary.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consult with the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the chief whip and to submit for decision at a later meeting of theCabinet their considered recommendations on the Parlia-mentary handling of those of the recommendations whichhad been put forward by the Boundary Commissions solely on account of their statutory obligation to recommendchanges designed to produce numerical equality betweenconstituencies.House ofCommonsDisqualifica-tion.Mr. PeterBaker, M.P.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Lord Chancellor reported that he and the Law officers had considered whether Mr. Peter Baker&apos;s seat in the House ofCommons had been automatically vacated by his conviction offorgery. They had reached the conclusion that, despite the advicegiven on a similar case in 1903 by the Attorney-General of the day,the seat was not vacated automatically by reason of this conviction.It would therefore be necessary for the House of Commons to resolvethat Mr. Baker should be expelled from the House.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, the Attorney-General and theChief Whip to consult with the Speaker on the procedure to be followed in order to secure Mr. Peter Baker&apos;s expulsionfrom the House of Commons, and authorised them to takethe necessary steps to bring the matter before the House.East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 80thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (54) 373), the Minister of Supply(C. (54) 376) and the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Ministerof Transport (C. (54) 381) about the possible lines of a settlementof all outstanding matters concerning strategic controls over tradewith countries in the Soviet blocThe President of the Board of Trade said that the further discussions which he had now held with the other ministers concerned had confirmed him in the view that the only effectivealternative to leaving things very much as they were was to seek topromote a comprehensive settlement covering all the issues nowoutstanding. On balance he favoured an attempt to promote ageneral settlement on the basis, broadly, of acceptance of theAmerican proposals about shipping, the compromise proposal onrolling mills suggested in C. (54) 376, and the offer of an initial ceiling of 50,000 tons on exports of copper wire. He recognised that certain features of a solution on these lines would be difficult to defend inthis country, but a settlement covering all outstanding issues could,no doubt, be broadly justified in the interests of Anglo-american relations.
The Foreign Secretary supported the proposals made by thePresident of the Board of Trade.In discussion considerable anxiety was expressed about theprobable repercussions of our accepting the American proposals inregard to shipping as they stood. It was true that, in order to meetAdmiralty requirements, we were already preventing exports of newfast ships from this country to countries of the Soviet bloc and thatthere was, in fact, little prospect of the early placing of Russian ordersfor new ships in British shipyards and little likelihood that orders for early delivery could be accepted, if offered. Nevertheless, it wouldbe difficult to justify our acceptance of a quota for exports ofshipping to the Soviet bloc no greater than the quotas to be accorded to such countries as Belgium and Italy, whose share of worldshipbuilding was insignificant compared with our own, particularly at a time when cancellations of orders placed here earlier werearousing anxiety about the future prospects for employment in the shipyards. The proposed quota would, moreover, be likely to haveimmediate effect on sales of second-hand shipping, as we had alreadysold 26,000 tons of such shipping to Russia during the last five to sixmonths. Apart from its direct benefits, the sale of such shippingindirectly benefited the shipyards through orders for replacements.So far as shipping was concerned, therefore, it could be contended that the existing situation, although hardly satisfactory to us, was tobe preferred to that which would result from adoption of theAmerican proposals.On the other hand, attention was drawn to the substantialadvantages which we should gain, on balance, from the conclusionof a comprehensive settlement on the lines proposed in C. (54) 373.Thus, we should find ourselves in a position to accept orders forrolling mills valued at over  20 millions which we were at presentprecluded from selling to countries of the Soviet bloc, and we might also secure agreement to continued exports of copper wire, subject only to a ceiling of 50,000 tons. So far as shipping was concerned,it might be possible to secure some detailed modification of theAmerican proposals relating to second-hand ships on the lines of thethird alternative mentioned in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 373. a comprehensive settlement would be more defensible againstParliamentary and public criticism in this country if greater latitudecould be obtained for the export of second-hand ships, and if wewere to make it quite clear that we had agreed to a system of equalquotas as a temporary measure only, and were not committed even inprinciple to the retention of such quotas for more than one year. Itwould also be helpful if it could be stated that British shipping companies had given an assurance that British shipyards would begiven the opportunity to build any new tonnage required in replacement of old ships sold second-hand to countries in the soviet bloc.The Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusions (2) and (3) below, agreed in principlethat a settlement of all outstanding matters concernedwith strategic controls should be sought on the general lines proposed in C. (54) 373 and 376.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to work out, inconsultation with other Ministers concerned, suggestedmodifications of the American proposals in regard to shipping designed to increase the scope for exports of second-hand shipping to countries of the Soviet bloc.(3) Agreed that, in putting forward comprehensive proposals fora settlement on the lines proposed, we should make itclear that we were not committing ourselves even inprinciple to a system of equal quotas for exports of ships
industrial 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the disputes. Minister of Labour and the Minister of Transport (C. (54) 382)Railways. describing the course of the recent wage negotiations between the(Previous National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) and the British TransportReference:      Commission (B.T.C.).C.C. (54) 82nd The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in theConclusions, situation. The B.T.C. had made it plain to the N.U.R., in the minute l.) negotiations, that their financial position was such that they werenot in a position to grant anything like the full claim put forward by the Union; and the representatives of the N.U.R., when they saw the Minister of Transport on 13th December, would ask in effectthat the Government should put the Commission in a financialposition in which they could afford to pay what the men regardedas reasonable rates of wages. The Ministers of Labour and Transportwere both agreed that it would be a grave mistake for the Governmentto offer a subsidy in order to avert a strike. Not only would thisundermine the authority and bargaining position of the B.T.C.: itwould also be an invitation to workers in other nationalised industries to bring similar pressure to bear on the Government in order tosecure higher wages. On the other hand, Ministers recognised theserious political and economic consequences which would follow from a railway strike. Therefore, although the conduct of thenegotiations should be left in the hands of the B.T.C., it was important that Ministers should have some knowledge of the general line which the Commission were proposing to take^ so that, if theywere forced to intervene at a later stage, they could do so withoutdelay and with some prospect of success. It would be helpful in securing a resumption of the negotiations if the Commission couldindicate that there was some possibility of their improving on theterms which they had so far felt able to offer to the men.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The level of coal production had fallen in recent weeks.Special steps had already been taken to offset the effects of this.But, if there were a railway strike, coal output would soon fall byabout 31 million tons a week and this would make it impossible toget through the winter without a fuel crisis.and that, after the expiry of a year from the conclusionof any agreement, we should resume complete freedom inthe matter.(4) Invited the Minister of Transport and the First Lord of theAdmiralty to consider whether British shipping companiescould be asked to give an assurance, which could be quoted in any Parliamentary discussion, that shipyardsin the United Kingdom would be given an opportunityto build new tonnage in replacement of old ships soldsecond-hand to countries in the Soviet bloc.(5) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to submit for the cabinet&apos;s approval the final draft of a communication tothe United States Government containing our proposalsfor a comprehensive settlement.(6) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade, at theforthcoming meeting of the Paris Consultative Group on security Controls, to explore the possibility of reaching agreement in regard to copper wire on the lines proposedin paragraph 9 pf C. (54) 373.(7) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to review the case for continuing to prevent the export of fast vessels fromthis country to countries of the Soviet bloc on strategic .grounds.
(b) There were strong reasons why the Government should notgrant a subsidy designed to offset the operating losses of the railways.There would, however, be less objection to a government contribution towards capital expenditure on a programme formodernising the railways. The Commission^ plans for modernisingwould shortly be completed. If they were assured of financial support for those plans, they might perhaps feel justified in increasingfor a time their deficit on operating costs.(c) The two essential facts of the situation were that the railways were not in a sound position financially and that railway wages werelow in relation to the current level of wage rates generally. On theother hand, it was generally recognised that there was extravagancein the use of manpower on the railways. In these circumstances theTransport Commission would gain the sympathy of the public ifthey sought to make a definite bargain with the railwaymen, offeringthem a reasonable level of wages in return for a promise of their co-operation in reducing manpower and improving efficiency. If a railway strike became inevitable, the Commission would be in amuch stronger position if such an offer had been made and rejected.The Cabinet Took note of the statements which had been made in thediscussion; and invited the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Transport to keep them informed of developments in the situation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1954.
