The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in the dockstrike.Essential supplies were being maintained, and it would not become necessary to use military labour for this purpose until aboutthe middle of the following week. Damage to the general economy was, however, increasing. Exports were now being delayed at therate of about  5 millions a day, and the interruption of imports would soon begin to cause difficulties. Shortage of raw materials was likelyto lead to unemployment or short-time working in some industries;and the size of the newspapers would shortly have to be reduced for lack of newsprint. Port employers would not, however, welcome theuse of military labour for purposes other than the maintenance of essential supplies; and there was no doubt that, if troops were usedfor those wider purposes, the first result would be to extend the strike and increase the difficulties of maintaining essential supplies.Reports from the Assistance Board suggested that the families ofsome of the strikers were beginning to feel the pinch of hardship.There were some other signs that the men might be beginning to contemplate the possibility of a return to work. It was possiblethat some of them might be ready to resume work after the publicdemonstration which they were holding on 24th October.The Cabinet Took note of the position, and agreed that no decision needyet be taken to use military labour in the docks.2. The Cabinet considered a telegram from the foreign secretary (Paris telegram No. 5 of 20th October) reporting a conversation which he had held in Paris with the United states secretary of State on the suggestion that a treaty of mutual defencemight be concluded between the United States and Nationalist China.Mr. Dulles had explained that this project might offer anopportunity of separating Formosa from the Chinese mainland, if itcould be made clear that Formosa would no longer be used as aprivileged sanctuary for harassing the mainland and if a separatesolution could be found for the problem of the coastal islands. Itmight facilitate relaxation of the embargo on trade with China andlead eventually to the acceptance of two Chinas as members of theUnited Nations. Mr. Dulles recognised the difficulty of proceeding with the earlier plan for bringing the question of Quemoy before theSecurity Council without disclosing the treaty project to the russians and to the Chinese Nationalists. In view of this difficulty he was nowdisposed to think that the plan for discussing Quemoy in the security council should be postponed until the United States Governmentcould make a public statement of the conditions on which they were proposing to conclude a treaty with the Chinese Nationalists. Hethought that such a statement might be issued within the next fewweeks.In discussion there was general agreement that the foreign secretary should be authorised to concur in the course now envisaged by Mr. Dulles. This would not commit us to proceedingautomatically with the plan for bringing the question of Quemoybefore the Security Council as soon as the United States Governmenthad disclosed their intentions about the treaty. We should have anopportunity to judge whether the effect of that disclosure on theRussians and the Chinese Communists was such as to make itimpossible to secure their agreement to the discussion of Quemoy bythe Security Council.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should be authorised to concur in the suggestion of the United States Secretary ofState that the United States Government should make a
public declaration of their intention to conclude a mutualdefence treaty with Nationalist China before steps were:taken to bring the question of Quemoy before the security council; and invited the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs to inform the Foreign Secretary accordingly.;3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (54) 319) commenting on the propaganda whichthe Archbishop of Cyprus and the Greek Government wereconducting against the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in respectof Cyprus and suggesting that a public statement reaffirming that policy should be made without delay.The Cabinet were informed of the circumstances in which the archbishop had been invited to broadcast soon after his arrival inLondon. They took note, with approval, of the terms of a letter which the Prime Minister was proposing to send to the Chairman ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation expressing his displeasure at theCorporation^ action in this matter.Arrangements had been made for the Governor of Cyprus, whowas also in London, to give a broadcast talk on 22nd October, and itwas thought that this might help to correct some of themisapprehensions caused by the Archbishop&apos;s activities. in discussion, however, doubts were expressed about the propriety of allowing a Colonial Governor to make a broadcast from London ona matter which was already the subject of political controversy in the parliament at Westminster. Was it not undesirable that theGovernor should appear to be usurping the functions- of the;ColoniahSecretary? And was it not likely that such a speech wouldcontravene the rule which precluded the B.B.C. from broadcastingcomment on matters which were about to be discussed in eithefHouse of Parliament? It was the general view of the Cabinet thatthe Governor of Cyprus should be advised;to refrain from touchingon controversial topics in his forthcoming broadcast.As regards the suggestion that a further statement should bemade to reaffirm the Government^ policy in respect of Cyprus, TheColonial Secretary said that, while no alteration was to be made inthe law of sedition in Cyprus, steps were being taken to amend thelaw relating to the Press so as to bring it into line with that in forcein the United Kingdom; and he Was proposing to make an early announcement tbthis effect in the House of Commons. He suggestedthat he should! add to this announcement a&apos; further statementreasserting the Governmenfs policy in respect of the sovereignty of cyprus and its future constitutional development. There was general agreement with this suggestion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary, to advise the Governor of cyprus to refrain from touching on subjects of political controversy in his broadcast talk on. 22hd October.(2) Took note that the Colonial Secretary would shortly beannouncing in Parliament certain amendments of the law relating to the press in Cyprus, and that he would take that opportunity of reaffirming the Governmenfs policyin, respect of the sovereignty of Cyprus and its future constitutional development.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consult with the foreign secretary and the Prime Minister on the terms of theannouncement mentioned:in Conclusion (2) above.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (54) 317) on future policy in respect ofBuganda,The Colonial Secretary recalled that, in his memorandum c. (54) 287 of 9th September, he had indicated that he would then have been disposed to allow the Kabaka to return to Buganda subjectto the fulfilment of two main conditions, viz. (i) that the constitutional proposals resulting from Professor Hancock&apos;s mission were accepted in full by the Great Lukiko; and (ii) that the Kabaka entered into asolemn engagement to accept the new constitution and to co-operate with the Protectorate Government. Since then, however, he had visited Uganda and had found that local opinion was much dividedon the question whether the Kabaka should be allowed to return.Although the Governor continued to be in favour of allowing himto return subject to the conditions mentioned above, he had himselfbeen impressed by the strength of feeling among those who opposedthis course; and, if the Governments hands had been entirely free,he would have recommended unreservedly that the Kabaka shouldbe permanently excluded from the Protectorate. The issue was complicated, however, by the current action in the Uganda HighCourt challenging the grounds on which the Government had withdrawn their recognition of the Kabaka. If the Courts verdictwere favourable to our case, no difficulty should arise. If, on theother hand, it were unfavourable, the Kabaka might well takeadvantage of the fact that there would no longer be any legal basis for preventing his return to Buganda.The Colonial Secretary said that, if the Courfs verdict wereadverse, he would not be in favour of taking the issue to appeal;indeed, there was general agreement amongst those directly concerned that in those circumstances we should have no option butto allow the Kabaka to return, and that we should be considered in uganda as having bowed to the majesty of English law and not to pressure by the Uganda National Congress. But in the situationwhich would follow the announcement of the Courts verdict he might find it necessary to take prompt action to end the state of uncertainty and to prevent the Kabaka embarking upon courses which would be embarrassing to us. It was for this reason that hewas seeking, in advance, the approval of the Cabinet to his takingthe action outlined in (a), lb) or (c) of paragraph 9 of his memorandum, according to the nature of the Courts verdict.The following were the main points made in discussion:  (a) It could not be accepted as axiomatic that, without afavourable verdict by the Uganda High Court, we could not adhere to the policy of excluding the Kabaka from Buganda. While it was true that we had withdrawn recognition on the ground of the kabaka&apos;s failure to abide loyally by the terms of the Agreementregulating relations between the State of Buganda and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, his expulsion from the Protectorate had been based onthe different ground that his presence there involved a threat to peace and order, and it could be argued that this second objection to his return remained valid even if the Court found that there had been no sufficient ground for withdrawing recognition. It was also possiblethat the Chief Justice of Uganda would disclaim any jurisdiction todetermine the issue of the Kabaka&apos;s loyalty, and that his findingswould constitute no more than an expression of his own personal views. In that event Her Majesty&apos;s Government need not regard them as necessarily binding upon them in all circumstances.(b) It was difficult to reach even provisional conclusions uponthe course to be followed until the Courts verdict was known. even then the matter would continue to be sub judice until the unsuccessfulparty had decided whether or not to lodge an appeal. It was arguable that, if the verdict were favourable, no statement need bemade unless the Government were questioned in Parliament about
their attitude, in which event they could point out that the Courfsdecision supported the action which the Government had taken against the Kabaka. If, on the other hand, the Courfs verdict wer^unfavourable or inconclusive, the next step would need to bpcarefully considered. To allow the Kabaka to return to Buganda insuch circumstances might put Her Majesty&apos;s Government at a gravedisadvantage in their future relations with the Kabaka and his people.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to bring this matter beforethe Cabinet again as soon as the verdict of the Uganda HighCourt had been announced.Canada. 5.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that theHurricane       Foreign  Secretary had  heard  in  Paris  that  the  Netherlandsin Ontario.     Government were offering assistance towards the relief of sufferersfrom the recent hurricane in Ontario.   He had suggested that theCabinet might consider making a similar offer of assistance.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that we, as well as theDutch, had received valuable help from Canada at the time of theEast coast floods in 1952, and that we had ourselves given the GreekGovernment generous assistance towards the relief of distress causedby earthquakes. On the other hand, it was argued that it was notcustomary for us to give financial assistance to other commonwealth governments towards the relief of victims of natural disasters which occurred not infrequently, particularly in India and Pakistan.Furthermore, the Commonwealth Secretary had been in Toronto atthe time of the recent hurricane but had not so far recommended! that any offer of assistance should be made to the canadian government.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to send an immediate telegram to the Commonwealth Secretary in Canada seeking his advice on the question whether we should offer assistanceto the Canadian Government in the relief of distressoccasioned by the recent hurricane in Ontario.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,22nd October, 1954.
