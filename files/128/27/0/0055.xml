Soviet Union. 1.   The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet that he and the visit of Speaker of the House of Commons had received, through the SovietParliamentary Ambassador in London, a formal invitation to arrange for a Parlia-delegation to mentary delegation to visit Moscow.  The Foreign Office had beenMoscow. asked to advise what reply should be sent to this invitation.Egypt. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary of State for defence War had concluded his negotiations with the Egyptians, and theNegotiations, heads Of a defence agreement had now been initialled on behalf of(Previous the two Governments. The terms of the agreement would be reference: officially announced in a statement which he was making in theCC. (54) 54th   House of Commons that afternoon.Conclusions, The Cabinet proceeded to discuss the handling of the Parlia-minute.) mentary debate on this subject, which would now take place beforethe summer recess. The debate was to be held on 29th July on aGovernment motion. There had been indications that the labour opposition might seek to embarrass the Government by allyingthemselves with those Conservative Members who were critical ofthe agreement; but it was thought that the Labour leaders would find difficulty in framing an amendment to the Government motion whichwould be welcomed both by their followers and by those Govern-ment supporters who were critical of the agreement. It remainedpossible, however, that the Government might be defeated if theOpposition amendment were so phrased that those government supporters were able to abstain from voting against it.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement on thedefence negotiations with Egypt, and of the arrangements proposed for handling the debate on this subject in theHouse of Commons on 29th July.Germany. 3.   The Lord Privy Seal reminded the Cabinet that the LeaderBonn of the Opposition had twice asked for an assurance that ParliamentConventions. would be re-convened if it became necessary during the recess to(Previous give effect to the proposal that the Bonn Conventions should be reference: brought into operation independently of the establishment of aCC. (54) 49th European Defence Community (E.D.C.). After consulting theConclusions, Foreign Secretary, he proposed to give an undertaking before theMinuteS.) recess that Parliament would have an opportunity to discuss thismatter before any agreement separating the Bonn Conventions fromthe E.D.C. Treaty was ratified and brought into operation.The Prime Minister said that a decision to recall Parliamentduring a recess should be taken only if this unusual course was clearlyseen to be justified by the circumstances at the time. He thoughtit wrong in principle that a Government should accept in advancea definite commitment to adopt this course in circumstances whichhad not arisen.The Foreign Secretary said that it was unlikely that we should reach, before Parliament re-assembled in October, a situation in whichwe should wish to bring the Bonn Conventions into operation inde-pendently of the E.D.C. Treaty. But the statement which the lord privy Seal Was proposing to make would not, in fact, commit theGovernment to recalling Parliament during the recess, even if that stage was reached. For it would still be open to the Governmentto postpone bringing the agreement into operation until after Parlia-ment had had an opportunity to discuss the matter in October.
The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to announce in the Houseof Commons that, before any agreement separating the BonnConvention from the European Defence Community treaty was ratified and brought into operation, Parliament wouldbe given an opportunity to debate the matter.Parliament. 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the re-assembly ofParliament after the summer recess.legislative programme :1954 55Session(previous reference:C.C. (54) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (54) 246) submitting the recommendations of an ad hoc committee which had examined Departments&apos; proposals for legisla-tion in the forthcoming session, and a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 247) describing the legislation which would berequired to complete the dismantling of the Defence Regulations.The Lord Privy Seal said that the time available for legislation in the House of Commons in the next session would be severelylimited, partly because the session was likely to be shorter than usual,and partly because of the need to meet the desire of government supporters for some relaxation of Parliamentary pressure in what might be the last session of the present Parliament. Essential Bills,shown in List A attached to his memorandum, represented by them-selves a substantial body of legislation, particularly in view of the likelihood that several measures would be required to implement therecommendations of the Select Committee on the Army Act and theAir Force Act. In addition, a proportion of the Bills contained in list B would doubtless prove to be unavoidable when the time came.For the rest, the main issue for consideration was whether it wouldbe practicable to pass next session all the Bills required for the dismantling of the whole structure of emergency powers. Thedecision reached on this issue would determine whether or not time would be available for any of the measures included in List D. Onany hypothesis time could not be found, broadly speaking, for any ofthe Bills included in Lists E and F. The Scottish Bills in Sections(a)-(f) of List G should be considered pan passu with the UnitedKingdom Bills in the corresponding Lists A-F. Finally, a number ofsuggested subjects for Private Members&apos; Bills were set out in List H.The Home Secretary said that the Ministers concerned had madeevery effort to restrict to a minimum the scope of the legislationoutlined in his memorandum (C. (54) 247) in order that an attemptmight be made in the next session to put the Government in a positionto dispense with all remaining emergency powers before the end ofthe present Parliament. By so doing the Government would notonly redeem one of their election promises, but would ensure thatno future Government would find ready to hand an easy means of exercising wide control over the national economy. If it should bedecided that time could only be made available for either the proposedland and water legislation (Appendix I to C. (54) 247) or the proposedtemporary Bill to continue Defence Regulation 55 and associatedregulations for certain specified purposes (Appendix II), his preferencewould be for proceeding with the latter. This would, however,produce the result that almost the only emergency regulationsremaining would be those relating to land; and he could not feelthat this would be a happy result, in view of the public anxiety whichthe Crichel Down Inquiry had aroused about the use of departmental powers in relation to land.
Some Ministers urged, in support of the Home Secretary&apos;proposal to aim at abandoning all remaining emergency powers, thatsuch action would be welcomed alike by Government supporters inParliament and by the public in general.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he sympathisedwith the Home Secretary&apos;s aim, he doubted whether room could befound in the programme for the legislation outlined in bothAppendix I and Appendix II to C. (54) 247. The proposed land and water legislation would by itself constitute a formidable Parliamentaryundertaking; and the temporary Bill to continue Defence Regula-tion 55 would provide opportunities for debating a wide range of highly controversial matters on which discussion might otherwise be avoided.The President of the Board of Trade expressed support for thisview. Legislation bearing on such subjects as supplies of newsprintand jute was bound to provoke acute controversy.The general view of the Cabinet was that, if a choice had to bemade between the legislation outlined in Appendix I to C. (54) 247and that outlined in Appendix II, the latter had the stronger claim.It would be open to the Government to emphasise how much progressthey had already made in dispensing with emergency powers and toindicate that, if they were returned at the next election, they would hope to proceed with legislation designed to terminate the power ofrequisitioning by 1958.The Minister of Housing said that it would be necessary toproceed in the next session with a Requisitioned Houses Bill on thelines suggested in Appendix I to C. (54) 247 even if time could notbe found for the remainder of the proposed land and water legislation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the drafting of atemporary Bill to continue Defence Regulation 55 andassociated regulations for certain specified purposes onthe lines proposed in Appendix II to C. (54) 247.(2) Authorised the Minister of Housing to arrange for the drafting of a Requisitioned Houses Bill on the lines proposed in Appendix 1 to C. (54) 247.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2) above, agreed that separate legis-lation on land and water on the lines suggested inAppendix I to C. (54) 247 should not be included in thelegislative programme for the following session.The following were the principal points made in discussion ofthe other Bills listed in C. (54) 246: -(a) The Minister of Transport recalled that The Queen&apos;s speech at the opening of the present session had mentioned the governments intention to promote further legislation &quot; to improve road safety and promote the orderly use of the roads.&quot; Preparations for a Bill onthis subject were well advanced and, although it would undoubtedly be controversial, it should command a substantial measure of public support and demonstrate the Governments determination to tackle the problem of road safety. Even if there was little prospect ofcarrying the Bill through Parliament, its introduction would serve a useful purpose in eliciting the comments of interested parties.(b) The Minister of Labour hoped that room would be found for a one-clause Bill to amend the National Service Acts for thepurpose of preventing continued evasion of national service by youngmen who went abroad. His proposals to this end had already beenapproved by the Home Affairs Committee and were likely to be supported by the official Opposition.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that this Bill might be added toList D.
(c) The Lord Chancellor said that the Bill on County CourtsJurisdiction in List E had been prepared by the Labour Governmenton the basis of recommendations contained in the interim report madeby the Evershed Committee in 1949. The Bill was likely to commandwide support and would be suitable for introduction in the Houseof Lords. He hoped that room could be found for it.(d) The Minister of Labour said that there now appeared to beno prospect of legislation in the next session to give effect to therecommendations in the Gowers&apos; Report (Command 7664) on health,welfare and safety in non-industrial and certain industrial forms ofemployment. In these circumstances he thought it would be desirablethat some administrative action should be taken to meet pressure from the Trades Union Congress for the establishment of a nationaloccupational health scheme, on which the Cabinet had in Aprildeferred a decision (CC. (54) 30th Conclusions, Minute 6).The Minister of Health said that it should be possible to satisfy the Trades Union Congress on this matter for the time being, partly by some modest administrative action and partly by referring to theneed for awaiting the report of the Guillebaud Committee on theNational Health Service.(e) The Secretary of State for Scotland expressed the hope thatroom could be found in the programme for an essential minimum of Scottish legislation.(/) The Home Secretary said that it was important, from thepoint of view of Welsh opinion, to find room, if possible, for the legis-lation to authorise Exchequer contributions to the cost of upkeepof unclassified and unadopted roads which was at present included in list D.The Cabinet (4) Approved the inclusion in the programme of the Billsincluded in List A of C. (54) 246 and such of those in list B as might in due course prove to be necessary.(5) Authorised the Minister of Transport to arrange for thepreparation of a Road Traffic Bill to be completed, on theunderstanding that the Government would not thereby be committed to carrying the Bill through all its stages in both Houses in the next session.(6) Took note of the views recorded in paragraph (b) to (/) above.(7) Agreed that, broadly speaking, time could not be found forany of the Bills included in Lists E and F.(8) Agreed that the Scottish Bills in Sections (a)-(f) of List Gshould be handled pari passu with the United KingdomBills in the corresponding Lists A to F.(9) Took note of the suggested Private Members&apos; Bills in List H.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 260) reporting progress in the negotiations withthe Persian Government on the future operation of the Persian oil industry.The Foreign Secretary said that under the agreement nowproposed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) would have a40 per cent, share in the consortium of oil companies which was to operate the industry, and the other members of the consortiumwould pay the Company, for their share, a sum of  214 millions over20 years. In addition, the Persians had offered to make a net pay-ment of  25 millions in compensation for the other losses incurred by the Company. The Company now sought the Governmenfsagreement that, if this offer was accepted, they should pay to Persiaa sum of about  50 millions which the Persians would have receivedPersia.(previous reference:CC. (54) 20thConclusions,Minute 7.)
Parliament.LegislativeBusiness in theHouse ofLords.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (54) 204) on the difficulties experienced in handlingGovernment legislation in the House of Lords.The Lord President said that these difficulties were twofold.First, the difficulty of carrying Government Bills through the Houseof Commons with a narrow Government majority made Departmentsreluctant to accept Lords&apos; amendments in view of the further inroadon the time of the House of Commons which their considerationinvolved. In consequence interested Peers were becoming increasingly unwilling to take a serious part in the discussion ofGovernment Bills,, and the value of the House of Lords as a revisingchamber was being impaired. Secondly, there was increasingreluctance to agree that any major Government Bill should beintroduced first in the House of Lords, with the result that the Peersfound themselves, confronted each July with more business thanthey could transact with efficiency. The introduction of a higher proportion of Government Bills in the House of Lords would ease the carrying through of the legislative programme and would enablethe Peers to play a more constructive part in the business oflegislation generally.The Lord Privy Seal said that there were certain practical limits to the scope both for introducing Government Bills in the House ofLords and for accepting Lords&apos; amendments but, subject to these,he was, very ready to. act, so far as possible, upon the Lord President^suggestions.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (54) 204.(2) Invited all Ministers, to co-operate&apos; in enabling a higher proportion of Government Bills to be introduced in theHouse of Lords and in accepting an essential minimum ofLords&apos; amendments to Government Bills..if they had ratified the 1949 Agreement. By this means the Companyhoped to be able to present the compensation payment as one of 75 millions and also to escape payment of United Kingdom incometax on the  50 millions which they had set aside against the possibility that the 1949 Agreement would be ratified.The Foreign Secretary proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Teheran should make a final attempt to persuade the Persians toincrease, their compensation offer to  30 millions, but should be givendiscretion to accept a net payment of  25 millions. He also proposed that the Company should be authorised to couple this withthe payment of  50 millions to the Persian Government, on theconditions specified in paragraph 4 (b) of C. (54) 260, if the other parties concerned could be persuaded to accept this plan before theend of the present week.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposals put forward by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals outlined in C. (54) 260 for compensating the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for the losses which they had incurred in Persia; and authorised theForeign Secretary to advise the Company and Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Teheran as proposed in paragraph 4 of that memorandum.
civil expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 51stConclusions.Minute 5.)New ColonialOffice Building(previous reference:C.C. (54) 49thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the report ofthe Committee on Civil Expenditure, in the light of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 252) indicating the datesby which decisions should be taken on the various recommendations in the report.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The proposals for a levy on flour accompanied by anincrease in the price of bread, required further thought. their adoption, besides arousing political controversy, would make itnecessary to employ several hundred officials on the administrationof the flour levy. Moreover, the existing temptation to bakers tomisrepresent the proportion of flour which they used for bread asagainst biscuits and cakes would be increased.(b) A larger increase in the price of sugar should be considered.A rise in price of a Id. a lb. would yield between  8 and  10 millions,according to its effect on the level of consumption. This saving couldbe obtained in the form of an increased trading profit or by increasing the rate of the customs duty.(c) Economies in expenditure by local education authorities could more satisfactorily be secured by selective pressure on specific points than by a general appeal for economy.(d) A decision on the proposal to increase the charge for school meals could be deferred until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had an opportunity to consider what adjustments might be made in family allowances.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 8 of the reportby the Committee on Civil Expenditure (C. (54) 232) ongrants for rural water and sewerage schemes and ontemporary houses; and agreed that the necessary legislation should be prepared in readiness for the next session of Parliament.(2* Decided to defer for the time being decisions on the proposals in C. (54) 232 for introducing a levy on flour, increasingthe price of bread, raising the charge for school meals and increasing the charge for health prescriptions.(3) Invited the Minister of Food, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to submit proposals for increasing the price of sugar.(4) Agreed that the remaining recommendations in C. (54) 232which had been, or might subsequently be, accepted bythe Ministers concerned should be adopted as a basis forthe preparation of Departmental Estimates for 1955.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Works (C. (54) 203) on the construction of a new building to house the Colonial Office.The Minister of Works said that about  850,000 out of a totalestimate of  3^ millions had already been spent on acquiring and developing the site for this building. The Home Affairs Committeehad since agreed that work ought to be resumed; and if the cabinet agreed, he proposed to complete the scheme at the most economicalrate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the resumption of work at this site, but wished to discuss with theMinister of Works the expenditure to be incurred on it in 1955.The Cabinet (5) Approved the resumption of work on the new building to house the Colonial Office.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th July, 1954.
