Armed Forces.New Type ofRifle.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 74thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Opposition had asked that time should be found, after 7 p.m. on 1st February, for a debate in the House of Commons on the Governments decision to adoptthe Belgian F.N. rifle as the standard rifle for use by British forces.The Cabinet agreed that this request should be met. The Secre-tary of State for War would make the opening statement on theGovernments behalf; and the Prime Minister would consider whether he should intervene later in the debate.Egypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C-C. (54) 5thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State (C. (54) 29) summarising the possible courses of action opento the United Kingdom in regard to the defence negotiations with egypt.The Minister of State said that since his memorandum was written the United States Ambassador in Cairo had officially urged the Egyptian Government to accept the terms which we had offered in October, and had said that until an agreement was reached no economic aid would be forthcoming from the United States (Cairotelegram No. 117). This was very satisfactory, though it was by nomeans certain that the Egyptian Government would heed this advice,and there were indications that they were unlikely to accept the clauses about the availability of the Base and the wearing of uniforms.The Foreign Secretary&apos; still felt that the best solution would be theconclusion of an agreement on the terms we had offered. If thatproved impossible, the next best course would probably be to decide to liquidate the Base and re-deploy our forces in our own time, butto maintain our rights under the 1936 Treaty and offer to submit to international arbitration any matters of disagreement about itsrevision.The Prime Minister said that, if the Egyptian government accepted our terms, we should be obliged to conclude an agreement.We must, however, decide on a positive alternative course in casethe Egyptians refused the terms and broke off the negotiations, ordelayed unduly a definite reply to our final offer. He thought thatthe best course of action in those circumstances would be that out-lined by the Minister of State. We should have many valuableadvantages if we took our stand on the 1936 Treaty. But, if thiscourse were adopted, we should be obliged unless the Egyptiansattacked us to begin to reduce our forces to the 10,000 which theTreaty allowed. Could we, for example, assume that a force of this size could hold both ends of the Canal so that we could safeguard the rights of free navigation and also preserve our power to control the supply of oil to the Delta?The Minister of Defence said that with this small number oftroops we could not hope to defend the whole Base area or securerights of navigation through the Canal against open hostilities bythe Egyptian army. Against intensified guerrilla activity we mightbe able successfully to remove some of the less heavy stores in the base. And if the Egyptians gave us some co-operation, we couldmove more of these stores and in less time. The Egyptian army was believed to be short of ammunition and therefore unable to sustain hostilities for any length of time. On the other hand, hatredand bitterness were powerful factors in sustaining the morale of anarmy and it could not be assumed that the Egyptians would notfight well. In these circumstances the best military course would beto hold a perimeter round Suez, including one airfield. This couldbe done with the 10,000 troops organised as a small division lessone brigade. The rest of the forces now in the Canal Zone wouldbe redisposed in the Eastern Mediterranean area. In the event of difficulties at Suez a brigade could be flown in from cyprus and an armoured brigade could enter Egypt from Libya. Rein-forcements from the United Kingdom could use the port of Tobruk.
7aSuez Canal. 3.   In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding(Previous Minute the Minister of Transport said&apos;that&apos;we should be on the watchReference: for a suitable opportunity to revive our proposal that the maritimeC.C. (53) 48th Powers should jointly seek from the Egyptian Government firmerConclusions, guarantees regarding the freedom of navigation through the SuezMinute 3.) Canal.   We had hitherto been unable to proceed with this proposalbecause the United States Government had been unwilling to join the retention of Suez would enable us to control the supply of oil tothe Delta and to secure the southern entrance to the Canal.It was the general view of the Cabinet that this course of actionoffered considerable attractions. It would satisfy Government sup-porters. It might placate public feeling in Egypt, where it would beseen that the majority of British forces were being withdrawn fromthe Canal Zone. It was not, however, free from legal difficulty. for we had no rights under the 1936 Treaty to station this number oftroops in. Suez. If, therefore, we announced that we were taking ourstand on the 1936 Treaty, how could we justify moving our troops into positions which, under that Treaty, we had no right to occupy?In the discussion which followed, the following arguments were putforward on this point&apos;:  (a) It was contemplated in the 1936 Treaty that British troops would be stationed in the Canal Zone for the purpose of ensuring freenavigation through the Canal. We might argue that, without Egypfsco-operation, the small number of troops allowed us was insufficient to fulfil this object and that we had been obliged to move those troops into positions where they could at least accomplish a part of thispurpose by securing the southern entrance to the Canal.(b) The Egyptians had unilaterally denounced the 1936 treaty and it could be argued that in these circumstances the other party tothe Treaty must be free to make dispositions to protect its rights.We could argue that&apos; the creation of a defensive position at Suez was our only means of doing this. If, on the other hand, the egyptian government went back on their denunciation of the Treaty and saidthat they wished to revive it, we could offer to go to arbitration forits revision, and during this period we should re-deploy our forcesin the Middle East with the minimum loss of prestige.The Prime Minister said that the problem was to reconcile theminimum military security of the 10,000 troops allowed by the 1936Treaty with the other provisions of that Treaty. If we could solvethis problem, we should be in a position to adopt a positive alter-native course of action if the defence negotiations with Egypt werebroken off for one reason or another. He suggested that a specialCommittee of Ministers should examine this problem and report back to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Appointed a Committee consisting of Lord Chancellor (in the Chair).Home Secretary.Minister of Defence.Secretary of State for War.Secretary of State for Air.Minister of Transport.Minister of State.to give jurgent study to the problem outlined by the PrimeMinister, taking account of the points made in the discussion,and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet as soon aspossible.
in a multilateral approach to the Egyptian Government on this subjectwhile we were negotiating for a new defence agreement with Egypt.If those negotiations failed, - this proposal might with advantage be revived.The Cabinet-... Invited the Minister of State to keep under review, in con-sultation with the Minister of Transport, the timing offurther representations to the United States government regarding the proposal that the maritime Powers shouldjointly seek from the Egyptian Government firmerguarantees regarding the freedom of navigation through the suez Canal.Certificationand detention of MentalPatients.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 60thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the proposedmembership of the Royal Commission on the certification anddetention of mental patients.In discussion there was general approval of the membershipproposed. Ministers considered that, if all those suggested were willing to serve, the Royal Commission would be a strong and well-balanced body.The Cabinet-Approved the proposed membership of the Royal Corn-mission, and took note that the Prime Minister would proceed to invite those whom he had named to serve on it.Industrial 5.   The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thatDisputes. the representatives of the private bus companies had now agreed to(Previous discuss the men&apos;s claim in accordance with their normal machineryReference: for wage negotiation, and a meeting for this purpose would be heldC.C. (54) 5th on the following day. If no progress was then made towards a settle-Conclusions, ment, there would be no alternative but to appoint a court of enquiryMinute 8.)      to establish the facts of the dispute.Provincial In the light castings industry the men had now agreed to deferBus-workers. the proposed ban on piecework and overtime until after they had beenLight Castings, able to consider the report of the courts of enquiry which were considering the wages disputes in the engineering and shipbuilding industries.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Labour.Japan. 6   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTrade with the President of the Board of Trade (C. (54) 30) recommending that, forSterling Area,   the purpose of securing a trade and payments agreement with Japan,(Previous       we should increase from  2 millions to  3 millions the amount ofReference:      Japanese grey cloth to be imported into the United Kingdom duringCC. (53) 81st   the period of the agreement.   The limit of  2 millions which theConclusions,    Cabinet had approved on 29th December had been based on the minute 7.)       assumption that the East African Colonies would take  5 millions ofimports from Japan; but, in the concluding stages of the negotiations,they had reduced this amount by  2-5 millions on account of large orders for textiles which their traders had placed with Lancashirefirms.   It was to offset this, in part, that it was now proposed to
7BritishIndustries Fair.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 5thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (C. (54) 24) on the questionwhether Chinese representatives should be invited to visit the BritishIndustries Fair in 1954.The President of the Board of Trade said that he fullyagreed that we should derive no commercial advantage fromthe attendance of Chinese visitors at the Fair. His difficulty, however,was to find a convincing reason which he could give publicly forsingling out the Chinese as the one country which would not receiveinvitations especially as Foreign Office spokesmen had publiclystated that it was our policy to encourage trade with China in goods which were not of strategic importance.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that Chinese repre-sentatives had not been invited to the Fair in 1953 or 1952 and thatthe invitations extended to them in 1951 had been issued beforeChina intervened in Korea. In these circumstances failure to invitethem in 1954 could be defended on the basis that this was not an appropriate moment at which to renew invitations which had been suspended in the two previous years.The Cabinet-Agreed that Chinese representatives should not be invited to visit the British Industries Fair in 1954.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.,28th January,1954.increase by  1 million the amount of Japanese grey cloth to be imported into this country.In discussion it was -recognised that this proposal would not be popular with the cotton interests in Lancashire. It was pointed out,however, that it would benefit some sections of the Lancashire trade,for the cloth would be finished in Lancashire and re-exported. this consideration, together with the increased exports from Lancashireto East Africa, justified the further concession to the Japanese whichwas now proposed.The Cabinet-Agreed that the proposed trade and payments agreementwith Japan might include provision for the import of 3 millions worth of Japanese grey cloth into the UnitedKingdom during the period of the agreement; and authorised the President of the Board of Trade to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation accordingly.
