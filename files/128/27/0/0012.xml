Television 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDevelopment Postmaster-General (C. (54) 71) covering a draft Television Bill,(Previous which he had prepared with the assistance of the Committee on reference:      Television Development.C.C.(54)llth In discussion of the draft Bill the main points covered were conclusions,     the following:  minute&quot;) Clause 1 (/). The public corporation to be established by the television Bill. Bill should be called the &quot;Independent Television Authority.&quot;The concluding words of this sub-section should be amended to read &quot; and of high quality, both as to the transmission and asto the matter transmitted.&quot;Clause 2 (2) (a). The reference to &quot; comprehensiveness &quot; shouldbe omitted and the sub-section should refer to &quot; a proper balance &quot;only.  A similar amendment would be required in Clause 3 (1) (b).Clause 3 (1). A new sub-paragraph (a) should be added, placingan obligation on the Authority to ensure &quot; that the tone and styleof the programmes are predominantly British.&quot; The existing sub-paragraph (a) would be retained as sub-paragraph (b).Clause 3 (1) (d). The Cabinet considered a memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade and the Postmaster-General(C. (54) 2) and a further memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (C. (54) 75) on the method of controlling the volume offoreign films used by competitive television stations.The President of the Board of Trade said that the competitiveprogrammes would be in danger of being swamped by foreign (mostlyAmerican) films, for which there would be a keen demand becausethey would be both cheap, having already covered their heavy pro-duction costs, and popular. At first sight the method of controlling the use of such films which was proposed in Clause 3 (1) (d) of theBill, namely, an obligation on the Authority to secure &quot; that a properproportion of the films and other recorded matter included in theprogramme is of British origin,&quot; was attractively simple but it was likely to break down in practice owing to the complexity of theproblem. It would also be criticised by the producers and the tradeunions as being inadequate to carry out the Governments publicundertakings to introduce effective safeguards for this purpose. Hehad therefore come reluctantly to the conclusion that it would benecessary to apply statutory quota arrangements, including provisionfor penalties for breaches of the quota. This might, however, bemade the subject of a separate Bill, which could be deferred until alater Session.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Television bill would be seriously distorted by the inclusion of the additional Clausesand Schedule which would be required to impose a film quota system.Furthermore, the pace of television development was such that any detailed provisions which might be incorporated in legislation at thepresent time would rapidly become out of date and would requireearly amendment.It was the general view of the Cabinet that at the outset relianceshould be placed upon a broad provision on the lines of Clause3(1) (^0 of the draft Bill. In view of the difficulty of determiningwhat would be a &quot; proper proportion &quot; for the purpose of the sub-paragraph, consideration might perhaps be given to re-wording this phrase to read &quot; that, of the films and other recorded matter includedin the programmes, such proportion as the Authority may decideshould be of British origin.&quot; The provision would receive some reinforcement from the new sub-paragraph (a) which theCabinet had already agreed to insert in Clause 3(1) of the Bill. If,however, the Government should find themselves under strong pressure on this point in Parliament, or if experience should showthat the matter could not be satisfactorily regulated in practice with-out a statutory quota system, further consideration could then begiven to the introduction of a separate Bill for this purpose.
Clause 5(1). It was pointed out that, if Clause 5 (1) (i) were retained, it would be difficult to avoid extending it to cover (i) citizens of the Irish Republic and (ii) citizens of other commonwealth countries not ordinarily resident in this country.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped the Cabinet would agree that this discrimination in favour of British subjects should be omitted altogether. It would embarrass us in our relations withfriendly foreign countries. And it seemed the less necessary in viewof the new sub-paragraph (a) which the Cabinet had now decidedto add to Clause 3 (1).The President of the Board of Trade supported this view. Adiscriminatory provision of this kind would provide other countries with a pretext for discriminating against British subjects in suchmatters as shipping and insurance.The Cabinefs conclusion was that Clause 5 (1) should be limitedto providing that programme contractors should be either companiesregistered in, or persons ordinarily resident in, the United Kingdom,the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.Clause 5 (2). The Lord Chancellor questioned the wisdom of imposing a statutory obligation on the Authority to secure adequatecompetition to supply programmes.The Cabinet were informed that the Committee on television development had regarded this as an essential safeguard against thepossibility that, if there should prove in practice to be no more than,say, two or three programme companies, they might come to arrangements between themselves which would have the effect ofmaking competitive television a private enterprise monopoly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there appeared to bea real danger that the wide scope of the powers to be conferred bythe Bill on the new Authority would seriously discourage potentialprogramme companies from entering the business.The Postmaster-General informed the Cabinet that there were now several promising potential programme companies in the field.Clause 5 (4). The Cabinet had before them a memorandum bythe Solicitor-General (C. (54) 76) explaining the purpose of the pro-vision in sub-paragraph (b) of this sub-section empowering theAuthority to impose fines on the programme companies.The Solicitor-General said that the Bill imposed on theAuthority a number of obligations in respect of the programme com-panies, and it would be unreasonable to leave the Authority with no effective sanction to enforce these except the power to terminate a programme company&apos;s contract altogether under Clause 5 (5). Thepurpose of sub-paragraph (b) was to make it clear in the statute thatthe Authority would have power to include penalty provisions inthe contracts into which they entered with programme companies.The details of such penalty provisions, including any provision for arbitration in cases of dispute, could be worked out later.&quot; The Postmaster-General doubted the need to provide theAuthority with such additional means of coercing programme com-panies. It could issue appropriate warnings; and, if these wereignored, it could require the company to submit particulars of its programmes in advance. In the background there would always bethe possibility that the company&apos;s contract would not be renewed or,in the extreme case, that it might be terminated under Clause 5 (5).This sub-section might well have to be amended during the passageof the Bill to give a programme company which had offended theAuthority a right of appeal to the Postmaster-General.The Colonial Secretary supported the proposal for monetarypenalties on the ground that programme companies might wellhesitate to enter the business if the Bill provided for no sanction
against an offending company short of termination of its contract.He further suggested that exercise of the power under Clause 5 (5)to terminate a company&apos;s contract should be made conditional uponthe company having previously been fined on three separateoccasions.The Lord Chancellor thought it would be preferable that theClause in the Bill providing for the imposition of monetary penaltiesshould include specific provision for arbitration.The Cabinet agreed that the provision for monetary penaltiesshould be retained in the Bill, on the understanding that furtherconsideration would be given to the possibility of adding specificprovisions for arbitration and providing that a programme com-pany&apos;s contract should not be terminated under Clause 5 (5) unlessthat company had previously incurred three fines.Clause 6. The Postmaster-General drew the Cabinet&apos;s attentionto the fact that, despite the undertaking which he had given in theHouse of Lords on 25th November (Official Report, col. 529), thisClause did not require that the terms, conditions and periods of the contracts to be concluded between the Authority and programme companies should be approved by the Postmaster-General.Other Clauses. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hewould communicate to the Postmaster-General some suggestions forminor amendment of Clauses 7 and 12.The Home Secretary said that he would also communicate tothe Postmaster-General some minor amendments to meet theposition of Northern Ireland.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the modifications agreed in discussion andrecorded above,  approved the draft Television Billannexed to C. (54) 71.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to arrange for the Bill to be presented in the House of Commons in time to bepublished on 5th March.Broadcast The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Postmaster-Receiving General (C. (54) 65) proposing an increase in the television licenceLicence Fee.     fee and a revised allocation of its proceeds.The Postmaster-General said that the public were alreadylargely prepared for the proposed increase of the television licence fee from  2 to  3. This increase would enable him to make availableto the new Authority, under Clause 8 of the Television Bill, an income of  750,000 a year not derived ultimately from advertise-ments. The Committee on Television Development had agreed withhis view that the Authority should be provided with some indepen-dent income as a means of strengthening it against undue influenceby the programme companies and advertisers and enabling it to fillup gaps in programmes, to provide material to ensure a reasonable balance in the programmes or to cover the change-over when a programme company had for any reason to cease operations. when allowance had also been made for the  4-75 millions needed over three years by the Post Office to meet its own outgoings and for the 6 millions which the Chancellor of the Exchequer required for theTreasury, the amount left for the B.B.C. would be  55-65 millionstogether with any additional revenue resulting from a further increase in the number of licences issued. Although this figure wasbelow what the B.B.C. had hoped to receive, he had reason to believethat they would accept it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could agree to the fee and allocation recommended by the Postmaster-General although he would have preferred a fee of three guineas which would have enabled the B.B.C. to receive a sum of  60 millions during the three-year period.
The view was expressed that the proposed increase in the amountof the television licence fee should be announced in advance of thepublication of the Television Bill. Otherwise, the increase would be attributed to the introduction of competitive programmes which many viewers would not be able, and some would not wish, toreceive.The Cabinet (3) Approved the increase of the television licence fee from  2to  3, to take effect from 1st June, 1954, and allocation ofthe proceeds on the lines proposed in C. (54) 65.(4) Authorised the Postmaster-General to announce the prospective increase of the fee in Parliament on 2ndMarch.Town and 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCountry Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Housing (C. (54) 77)Planning Act, reporting the results of further discussions, which had taken place1947. since the Cabinets meeting on 22nd February, regarding the method(Previous of financing compensation under the Bill to amend the Town and reference:      Country Planning Act, 1947.C.C. (54) 10th The two Ministers had agreed that, while payments for decisionsConclusions, made before the Bill came into operation would be made out of the minute 8.) Consolidated Fund, payments made for subsequent decisions wouldbe made from monies voted in the annual Estimates. But, in orderto forestall the criticism that short-term financial considerations would have undue weight in the future administration of planning,the Bill would provide that after five years, or when the totalexpenditure under Parts II and IV of the Act reached  30 millions,whichever was the earlier, the Minister would report to parliament on the disbursements and recoveries made in the administration ofthose Parts of the Act. This would make it clear that it was theGovernments intention to provide adequate funds to pay for any decisions likely to arise.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals outlined in C. (54) 77 for financingcompensation payments under the Town and country planning Bill.Farm price review.Fatstock Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 10thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Ministerial Committee on Food and Agriculture had considered on 23rd February whether the new system of guaranteed prices for fatstock should extend to fat cows from dairy herds. TheCommittee had considered that, on the merits, fat cows should notbe so included, but they had agreed to consider the point again ifthe farmers&apos; representatives pressed strongly for their inclusion.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Food, said that it had since been discovered that, for technical reasons, the matter couldnot be kept open in this way. For, if the new system was to be inoperation by July, printing of the necessary returns and cards mustbe undertaken at once and the form of these could not be finally settled until it was known whether or not fat cows were to be includedin the scheme.The Minister of Agriculture said that on the merits fat cowsshould be excluded from the system of guaranteed prices for fatstock.It would, however, take some time to persuade farmers to accept this.There would be serious political trouble if fat cows were excludedbefore there had been any opportunity for consultation with the
farmers&apos; representatives. It need not be assumed that, if they were included at the outset of the new scheme, they could not be excludedthereafter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied that,for reasons of political expediency, it was necessary to follow thecourse proposed by the Minister of Agriculture. He hoped, however,that the guaranteed price for fat cows would be fixed as low aspossible.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Food, reminded theCabinet that this course would involve heavy Exchequer expenditureif the market price of this inferior meat fell much below the guaranteed price, as it might when meat of better quality wasplentiful.The Cabinet Agreed that fat cows should be included in the new system of guaranteed prices for fatstock; but invited the agriculture Ministers to see that the guaranteed prices forfat cows were fixed as low as possible.Armed Forces.Officers&apos; retired pay.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 1.1thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 69) on the proposal togrant a 10 per cent, increase to certain Service officers and civilservants whose pensions had been stabilised in 1935.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that hehad hoped to avoid making any concessions on pensions until he had made a comprehensive review of pensions generally in the light of the findings of Sir Thomas Phillips&apos; Committee, whose report would notbe available until the end of the year. If, however, these concessionsmust now be made to Service officers and civil servants, he would wish to propose some adjustments in.the supplementary allowancespayable to war pensioners suffering from special disability. Hewould, however, prefer that these should not be announced simul-taneously with the concessions discussed in C. (54) 69. He would submit his specific proposals to the Cabinet in the following week.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the increases proposed in C. (54) 69 in the pensions of certain Service officers and civil servants; and took note that the Prime Minister would announce these con-cessions in his speech in the Defence Debate on 2nd March.(2) Approved the terms of the draft White Paper explaining these concessions, which was annexed to C. (54) 69; and authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to present this to Parliament on 2nd March.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance tosubmit to the Cabinet his proposals for adjustments inthe supplementary allowances payable to war pensionerssuffering from special disability.
Judges&apos;RemunerationBill.(previous reference:CC. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the decisionsrecorded in the preceding Minute, it should now be possible to pro-ceed with the Judges&apos;1 Remuneration Bill. He hoped that an earlydate would be fixed for the Second Reading of this Bill in the Houseof Commons.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement, and asked theLord Privy Seal to consider when the House of Commonsmight be invited to give a Second Reading to the Judges&apos;Remuneration Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th February, 1954.
