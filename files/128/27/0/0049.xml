washington talks.Anglo-SovietMeeting.(Previous-Reference :CC. (54) 48thConclusions,Minute 3.)Indo-China.(previous reference :CC (54) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)h The Cabinet continued their discussion of the possibility ofan iAnglo-Soviet meeting.;    The Cabinefs discussion on this question is recorded separately.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary ;(C. (54) 227) setting out the main objectives which he proposed to pursue in the concluding phases of the discussions onIndo-China at the Geneva Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed doubtful whetherthe United States Government would be represented by Ministerswhen the discussions were resumed in Geneva. They had informed the French that, while they would have wished the Western Powersto present a united front at Geneva, they would find it difficult tojoin in this unless it had been agreed in advance what was the leastfavourable settlement that could be accepted; and, as it was uncertainwhat settlement the French might be willing to accept, it might be wiser that United States Ministers should not put themselves in aposition in which they might have to dissociate themselves from their allies at the Conference. American opinion also seemed to havebeen hardening in the Anglo-American discussions at Washington onthe possible means of guaranteeing a settlement in Indo-China.Though they had at first indicated that they might be willing toparticipate in a joint declaration guaranteeing such a settlement, theywere now suggesting that it would not be possible for them to do more than make, a separate declaration of their own. The foreign secretary said that, despite these developments, he was continuinghis efforts to persuade United States Ministers to participate in the resumed discussions at Geneva; but, whether he succeeded or not, itwas evident that the next phase of the negotiations would be criticaland difficult.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s proposal that his first aim in the discussions should be toensure that any agreement that might be reached would be one thatthe United States could respect. If that aim could not be secured,a difficult situation would arise in which it would be most important that, whatever attitude we ourselves adopted, it should have thesupport of other Commonwealth Governments. In this connection it was pointed out that the Governments of Australia and NewZealand might well be specially reluctant to dissociate themselves from the United States; and it would be important that the foreign secretary should keep in the closest touch with their representatives at Geneva.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the resumed negotiations on Indo-China atthe Geneva Conference, the Foreign Secretary should be guided by the general principles outlined in C. (54) 227.Germany.(previous reference:CC. (54) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)bonn conventions.470363. The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the long delay inratifying the treaty for the establishment of a European defence community, feeling was growing in Western Germany that thecontractual arrangements for which provision was made in the bonn conventions should be brought into effect in advance of theestablishment of the Community. In the recent discussions in washington the United Kingdom and United States governments had agreed that the time had come to dissociate the two treaties, andthat action should be taken to bring the contractual arrangements-3      &apos; B 2

United States, it was important that the United Kingdom Govern-(Previous        ment should take an early opportunity of clarifying their attitudeReference:      towards the representation of China in the United Nations.   AC.C. (53) 52nd  statement on this point could appropriately be included in the speechConclusions.    which the Prime Minister would be&apos;making in the debate on foreignMinute 6.)      affairs in the House of Commons on 14th July. It was proposed thatthis statement should begin by making it clear that the UnitedKingdom had followed a consistent policy on this question since1951, when it had been stated by the then Foreign Secretary that theGovernment believed that tho Central People&apos;s Government shouldrepresent China in the United Nations but, in view of that governments persistence in behaviour inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the United KingdomGovernment believed that consideration of this question should be postponed.   At the Geneva Conference no agreement had beenreached on the re-unification of Korea and although the armisticeremained in force, the arrangements for its supervision had provedfar from satisfactory.   Since the date of the Korean armistice theproblem of Indo-China had assumed serious proportions, and no agreement had yet been reached at the Geneva Conference on that matter.   In these circumstances; although the United KingdomGovernment still believed that the Central People&apos;s Governmentshould represent China hi the United Nations, they did not considerthat the time had yet been reached for the matter to be re-considered.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in his forthcoming speech in the House ofCommons on 14th July, the Prime Minister should makea statement On the representation of China in the united nations in the terms proposed by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to communicate toother Commonwealth Governments the text of thestatement which the Prime Minister was proposing tomake on this subject in his speech on 14th July,into operation if an agreement could be reached with the- german federal Government that German rearmament would be deferred forthe time being. In the United States it was necessary that aresolution should be passed by the Senate in order to enable thePresident to dissociate the two treaties and to put the contractualarrangements into effect; and for this reason a statement of theAdministration^ intentions was to be made in Congress on 14th July.In this country no formal Parliamentary authority would be required;but it was desirable that Parliament should be informed in advance that the Government might find it necessary to bring into effect,during the recess, some part of the agreements which Parliament hadratified. It would be convenient if this could be announced in thecourse of the speech which the Prime Minister would be making inthe debate on foreign affairs on 14th July.The Cabinet Took note that, in his speech in the House of Commons on14th July, the Prime Minister would indicate that in certaincircumstances the Government would be prepared to bring into operation, before the establishment of the european defence Community, the contractual arrangements for western Germany for which provision had been made inthe Bonn Conventions.

In his reply the Prime Minister proposed to press for a more definite expression of the Presidents views on some of-the practical aspects of his proposal for a meeting with M. Malenkov.    He intended to make itclear that he would not accept an invitation to meet in Moscow and .that, although a meeting in Stockholm or Vienna would be.acceptable,the best plan would be to meet at,Berne after the Geneva Conference.-.. He also proposed to make more plain his intention to ask.the russians to give some definite) proof of their uincorlty, confidential a prolLmtivtry to u -&quot;wider meeting - e.g, an undertaking to ratify the Austrian treaty and, perhaps, a promise to co-operate in the Atomic Bank Plan.He would urge the President to give him his views on these specific proposals before the Cabinet were asked to decide whether a formalproposal for a two-Power meeting should be submitted to the SovietGovernment.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he wished tomake it clear that he was opposed in principle to the idea of holding high-level meeting with the Russians without.the. participation ofthe United States.    He had explained this to -the Pr ime Minister ina private letter which he had, sent to him after his speech in theHouse of Commons on 11th May, 1953, and nothing which had sinceoccurred had changed his opinion on tliis point.    The projectedmeeting, if it took place, would be an important act of foreign policy;and, if he remained in the Government, it would fall to him, as leader of the House of Lords and spokesman for the Foreign Office. in that House, to defend it publicly.    This he would be unable to do.- Therefore, as at present advised, he feared that he would have to, resign from the Government if it were in the event decided that thePrime Minister should go forward with this project for a bilateralmeeting with M, Malenkov.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in their further discussions on this question, the Cabinet would wish to keep&apos;in mind; the view which the Lord President had expressed.    For the moment,,however, he preferred to await a further expression of president eisenhower !s views;  and he was not proposing to ask the&apos;Cabinet that-day to take a final decision on the matter.
In further discussion Ministers recognised thatthey could not take a final decision on the expediency of proposingsuch a meeting until they knew the outcome of the negotiations onIndo-China which were now to be resumed at the Geneva Conference.If those negotiations resulted in an agreement from which the UnitedStates Government expressly dissociated themselves, it was arguable that a bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and M. Malenkovwould at that moment give the impression that&apos;an even wider breachwas being created between the United Kingdom and the United States.On the other hand it was arguable that in those circumstances - and,perhaps even more, if no agreement of any kind were reached atGeneva - it would be re-assuring to public opinion throughout theworld that a further opportunity was being created for discussions with the Soviet Government which might yet avert the danger of world war.    In eithex- event it seemed clear that a final decision must await the outcome of the resumed negotiations at Geneva,THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that theForeign Secretary should take the opportunity, while at Geneva, tomake it clear to M. Molotov that this project could not proceed further until the outcome of the Geneva Conference was known.He might also put to him the advantages of Berne as a possiblemeeting-place.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that somethought should also be given to the questions which the Russians were likely to raise, if such a meeting were held.    How would they react,for example, to the suggestion that they should give an undertaking to ratify the Austrian Treaty?    Were they not likely to counter thisby pressing the suggestion for a European security guarantee whichthey had put forward at the Berlin Meeting - a suggestion which, as ministers would remember, was designed to prevent the establish-ment of a European Defence Community.    As an alternative to thecreation of that Community, they would probably suggest that a united Germany should be admitted to the North Atlantic treaty organisation, and that the Organisation should thereafter be widenedto include the Soviet Union.    As regards the project for a broadermeeting, we must be prepared for them to press the suggestion thatthis should be on a five-Power basis, including Communist China. -The Foreign Secretary suggested that further thought should be givento all these questions while he was in Geneva,The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion ofthese matters at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.10th July, 1954.
inOverseasInformationServices.(previous reference:CC. (54) 7thConclusions,Minute 5.)Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th July, 1954.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 185) and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 228)regarding the future level of expenditure on overseas information services.The Foreign Secretary said that he understood that the CabinetCommittee on Civil Expenditure were about to recommend that expenditure on these services in the financial year 1955 should bereduced to  9^ millions. He had taken this opportunity of raising the matter since he had to return to the Geneva Conference and was unlikely to be present when the Cabinet discussed the report of theCommittee on Civil Expenditure. Without pre-judging that discussion, he wished his colleagues to be aware of the greatimportance which he attached to those information services whichsupported the conduct of the Governmenfs foreign policy. those services were in his view essential to the prosecution of the cold warand to the maintenance of our influence in international affairs. Hehad hoped that the Cabinet might have been able to accept therecommendation of the Home Secretary&apos;s Committee, put forward in C. (54) 185, that the proposals made in the Drogheda report should be carried out over a period of seven years. If, however, theCabinet thought it necessary to defer a decision until therecommendations of the Committee on Civil Expenditure could beconsidered as a whole, he hoped that, when those recommendationscame to be considered, his colleagues would bear in mind the special importance which he attached to overseas information services as an instrument of foreign policy.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
