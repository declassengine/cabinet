Economic 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during May the affairs. gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area had increased by morethan 165 million dollars, and the total reserves were now nearing thefigure of 3,000 million dollars. This improvement was the moreremarkable as receipts of defence aid from the United States had remained small.The success of the new conversion loan was further evidence ofthe strength and stability of the economy.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Iraq. 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence State (C. (54) 181) suggesting that discussions should be opened with arrangements, the Government of Iraq with a view to the conclusion of alternative arrangements for mutual defence in place of the Anglo-Iraqi Treatyof 1930.The Minister of State said that this Treaty was due to expire in1957. There was no prospect that we should then be able to secure a renewal of our existing military facilities in Iraq. No Governmentin Iraq could be expected to resist the insistent political demand thatour air bases at Habbaniya and Shaiba should be transferred to Iraqiownership and that we should abandon our right to station opera-tional units permanently in Iraq. Our essential strategic needs could,however, be met if we could be assured that these bases would be adequately maintained in peace and made available for our imme-diate use in war, if we continued to enjoy transit and staging facilities in Iraq in peace and if R.A.F. squadrons could make regular visits to these bases so that one squadron would normally be available inIraq for defence or training purposes. It was therefore proposed thatsecret discussions should be initiated between military representa-tives of the two Governments with a view to working out arrange-ments for mutual defence which would secure our essential strategicneeds. The first step would be to indicate privately to the crown prince of Iraq that we were prepared to consider alternative arrange-ments on these lines so that, before the forthcoming elections on 9th June, he would be aware of the importance of choosing a PrimeMinister strong enough to carry the resulting agreement through the iraqi Parliament.The Minister of Defence said that he believed that our essentialstrategic needs in this part of the Middle East could be met byalternative defence arrangements on the lines suggested in C. (54) 181.The Secretary of State for Air said that Habbaniya would be animportant asset in the proposed re-deployment of the British troops now in Egypt. The base had been constructed at considerable expense and was capable of accommodating about 4,000 men. three or four squadrons could be stationed there. He thought it wouldbe premature to give any indication at this stage, in a private com-munication to the Crown Prince, that we might be willing to surrender our right to station squadrons permanently at Habbaniyaor Shaiba in peacetime.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Whitsun recess.
2, z$ ^The Chief of the Air Staff said that our defence problem in theMiddle East had been changed by the development of the hydrogenbomb. In view of the weight of atomic attack to which they wouldbe subjected in the opening stages of a major war, the Russians were now less likely to be able to develop a substantial offensive throughthe Caucasus and we had a better chance of holding them to thenorth-east of Iraq, possibly in the passes leading from Persia. this new strategic concept increased the importance of our air bases inIraq, but gave us an opportunity for taking a more constructive line in proposing mutual defence arrangements with the Iraqis. TheChiefs of Staff therefore favoured the conclusion of a new defence agreement with Iraq, but they would prefer to see what progress couldbe made in the military talks before any offer was made to abandonour rights under the existing Treaty.In further discussion it was suggested that we had little prospectof persuading the Iraqis to accept the alternative arrangementsoutlined in paragraph 6 of C. (54) 181 unless we indicated, at anearly stage in the discussions, our readiness to transfer the owner-ship of the bases to Iraq. Unless we did so we should seriouslyweaken the influence, in Iraqi political circles, of those who favouredcontinued association with the United Kingdom. For this purposeall that was needed in the immediate future was to give some secretindication to the Crown Prince that, if we could obtain satisfactory alternative arrangements, we should be ready to consider transferring the ownership of the bases to Iraq.The Prime Minister said that, before taking any final decision onthis question he would wish to see (i) a report by the Chiefs of Staffon, our minimum strategic requirements in Iraq and (ii) a precisestatement of the communication which it was proposed to make tothe Crown Prince.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to submit to the Prime Minister areport on our minimum strategic requirements in Iraq.(2) Invited the Minister of State to submit for the PrimeMinisters approval a draft of the communication whichit was proposed to make to the Crown Prince of Iraq onour intentions regarding the revision of the Anglo-IraqiTreaty of 1930.Crichel Down. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Agriculture (C. (54) 183) on the Report of the CrichelReference: Down Inquiry and a memorandum by the  Home SecretaryC.C. (54) 3rd (C. (54) 182) reporting the conclusions of a Ministerial CommitteeConclusions, which had reviewed the policy to be followed by the Government in minute 7.) disposing of land which had been compulsorily purchased but wasno longer needed for public purposes.Disposal of land      The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had invited hiscompulsorily    Committee to give further thought to the practical possibilities ofbought for      according to former owners some form of pre-emptive opportunity,public purposes. The majority of the Committee had reached the conclusion thatGovernment policy should recognise the moral claim of former owners and their successors to recover their land when the Govern-ment no longer required it and that, where such a claim was admitted,the land should be offered to the claimant at the price assessed bythe District Valuer as the current market price.The Lord Chancellor said that he remained unconvinced thatthe Government would be justified in bringing into operation by
administrative means, and to meet an alleged moral claim, a systemof pre-emption in respect of State-owned land of a kind for whichover a period of many years it had proved impracticable to provideby statute. If such a system had been in operation at the time whenthe disposal of Crichel Down had been under consideration, theMinister of Agriculture would have been obliged to allow the landconcerned to revert to its former owners in the face of consideredadvice that in the national interest it should be equipped and farmedas a single unit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he shared the LordChancellor^ doubts about the justification for the policy proposed.He believed that the reasonable expectations of former owners wouldbe adequately met by a system under which they were made aware that land formerly in their ownership was to be disposed of and given  an opportunity to bid for it at auction. If, nevertheless, the cabinet should support the view of the Home Secretary&apos;s Committee, he hoped that the announcement of the proposed new policy would be framed in more general terms than those used in the draft statement annexed to C. (54) 182 and, in particular, that no attempt wouldbe made to define with precision the categories of land to which thenew procedure would not apply.The Minister of Labour said that he also shared the LordChancellor^ doubts about the wisdom of the course proposed.The Lord President said that the recommendation of the majorityof the Committee had been based on the view that former ownersshould be accorded a genuine opportunity to recover their land, thatthis could not be fully ensured by enabling them to bid for it atauction, and that the Government could not reasonably take the viewthat the sale of such land at a price assessed by the District Valueras the current market price was unwarranted when that had been thebasis on which the land had been compulsorily acquired.The general view of the Cabinet was in favour of according toformer owners a pre-emptive opportunity on the lines proposed inC. (54) 182. It was, however, agreed that the terms of any announce-ment to this effect should be as general as possible, and that thedraft statement attached to C. (54) 182 should be reconsidered fromthis point of view.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle an announcement of policy on thegeneral lines of the draft statement annexed to C. (54) 182but invited the Minister of Agriculture to reconsider its terms in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.Disposal of The Minister of Agriculture said that Commander Marten couldCrichel Down, not be enabled to recover the land formerly in his ownership unlessthe present tenant, who had been in occupation for some months and had a legal right to remain, was willing to surrender his tenancyin return for reasonable compensation. There was no prospect thathe would be so willing, and the Ministerial Committee had concluded that in these circumstances the existing arrangements should be leftundisturbed.The Home Secretary said that, even if the present tenant were willing to give up his tenancy, it would be difficult to justify the pay-ment of the substantial sum of compensation for which he was likelyto ask.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the sale of Crichel Down to the commissioners of Crown Lands should be allowed to proceed to completion.
Crichel Down The Minister of Agriculture said that two main questions aroseInquiry. on the Report of the Public Inquiry how the Government shouldhandle discussion of the Report in Parliament and whether theyshould reimburse Commander Marten&apos;s legal costs. The Committeehad taken the view that publication of the Report as a White paper should be deferred until the day when Parliament reassembled afterWhitsun and he would welcome the Cabinefs authority to announce this in the House of Commons on the following day and to state at the same time that facilities would be given to debate the report at the earliest convenient opportunity after its publication. It was proposed that, when the Report was published, he should make astatement in the House of Commons on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (54) 183, the fourth paragraph of which he would now like tosee amended to read as follows :  &quot; I have naturally given to those who are criticised an oppor-tunity of making to me such observations as they wished on those parts of the Report which referred to them. Havingconsidered the observations and- explanations I have received,I must in fairness say that I have formed a more favourable viewof many of the actions taken by the officers concerned thanappears in the Report. Mistakes and errors of judgment weremade which those concerned regret as much as I do; and steps have been taken, so far as possible, to see that these do nothappen again. In view of the nature of the errors themselves and of the public way in which they have been exposed, I am satisfied that no further action by me in relation to them is. necessary. I continue to have full confidence in the agricultural land Commission.&quot;In discussion of this draft statement the following amendments were approved: (a) The words &quot; less unfavourable &quot; should be substituted for&quot; more favourable &quot; in line 6 of the proposed new fourth paragraph.(b) For the last sentence of the fourth paragraph there shouldbe substituted: &quot; I consider that the Agricultural Land Commissioncontinues to fulfil a useful function.&quot;(c) In the penultimate paragraph no promise should be made ofan early statement on the disposal of the land at Crichel Down, since this might create expectations that Commander Marten was to been abled to recover his land.On the question of Commander Marten&apos;s costs, discussionshowed that the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour ofreimbursing these from public funds. This view was supported bySir Andrew Clark&apos;s conclusion that Commander Marten had beenfully justified in pressing for a Public Inquiry.The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to announce in theHouse of Commons on the following day that Sir AndrewClark&apos;s Report on the Crichel Down Inquiry would bepublished on 15th June and that facilities would be givenfor it to be debated at the earliest convenient opportunitythereafter.(4) Agreed that, when the Report was published, the Minister ofAgriculture should make a statement in the terms of thedraft annexed to C. (54) 183, subject to the amendmentsapproved in the Cabinefs discussion.(5) Agreed that the legal costs incurred by Commander Martenin connection with the Public Inquiry should be reimbursed from public funds.
z-g 7MilitaryAirfields.(previous reference:CC. (54) 20thConclusions,Minute 2.)TarrantRushton.5. The Prime Minister said that public anxiety was beingexpressed about the Air Ministry&apos;s plans for the use of the airfield at Tarrant Rushton. The Ministers concerned should review theposition and submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee comprising Home Secretary (Chairman),Minister of Housing and Local Government,Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,Secretary of State for Air,Financial Secretary, Treasury,Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Trade,Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply,to review the plans for the future use of Tarrant Rushtonairfield and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.Fuel Policy. 6.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memoranda(Previous on fuel policy by the Minister of fuel and Power (C. (54) 163) and reference: the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (54) 170). They also had beforeCC. (54) 36th them a memorandum by the Agriculture Ministers (C. (54) 171) on conclusions, open-cast working and a further note by the Minister of Fuel and minute 10.)     Power (C. (54) 186) on the dangers of atmospheric pollution inSouthampton as a result of the proposed conversion to oil-firingof the power station at Marchwood.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that since these memo-randa were circulated there had been some further developments which had reduced the extent of the differences between him and theother Ministers concerned. It had now been established that fuel oilcould be made available at Marchwood and certain other power stations at prices so favourable that the British Electricity Authoritywere prepared to entertain the possibility of installing alternativeoil-firing as a sound commercial proposition. They were preparedto go forward at once with the installation of oil-firing at Marchwoodand to consider the introduction of dual-firing at other power stationssituated on the banks of estuaries. This development, by reducingthe power stations&apos; requirements for small coal, would in turn makeit easier for the Coal Board to increase their production of briquettesfor use by the railways as a substitute for large coal. The ministers aid that there was now a reasonable prospect that he would be ableto go forward with his policy of increasing the use of fuel oil, as acompetitor with coal, without the need to direct the British electricity authority or the National Coal Board to undertake in the national interest developments which from their limited angle they might have regarded as commercially unjustifiable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these developmentsmade it possible for him to withdraw the objections which he had previously urged against a policy of developing the use of fuel oil in competition with coal.In discussion the following particular points were made:  (a) The Minister of Housing, and Local Government said that hewas still concerned about the danger of atmospheric pollution inSouthampton which would arise from the conversion of the March-wood power station to oil-firing. At a time when the Governmentwere anxiously seeking means of reducing&apos; atmospheric pollutiongenerally, it seemed anomalous that they should take this positive action which would directly increase the risk of atmospheric pollutionin Southampton.
The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it should be possibleto allay public anxiety on this score if, as he proposed, instrumentswere installed for measuring the degree of atmospheric pollution inSouthampton and arrangements were made to turn the power stationover to coal-burning at any time when a dangerous degree of pollution was likely to be caused by oil-burning.(b) As regards open-cast mining, The Minister of Fuel and power said that in view of the economies in coal consumption whichhe hoped to secure by the other methods outlined in his memo-randum he was now prepared to forgo, in the interests of agriculture,a total of 2 million tons of open-cast coal over the next three years.He would discuss with the Agriculture Ministers means of applyingthis statistical limit to the choice of sites for open-cast working.(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in addition to his proposal to increase the production of briquettes for use by the rail-ways, he intended to discuss with the Minister of Transport and theChairman of British Railways the prospects for additional economies in coal consumption by further electrification and by the use of dieselengines for railway locomotives.(d) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was alive to theneed for increasing the labour force in the mines. This, however, was more a regional than a national problem. The greatest need was inSouth Yorkshire and the Midlands; and, in these and other difficultareas, recruitment was most likely to be assisted by pursuingand extending the scheme previously approved by the Cabinet for providing additional houses in mining villages.The Minister of Labour said that he would be readyto co-operate in further recruiting campaigns for the mining industry.It would be helpful if he could be authorised to spend about  50,000on special publicity for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the general policy outlined by theMinister of Fuel and Power for developing the use of fuel oil in competition with coal.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Ministerof Housing and the Minister of Fuel and Power, toprepare and submit to the Cabinet a statement of themeasures to be taken to reduce the dangers ofatmospheric pollution in Southampton as a result of the conversion of the Marchwood power station to oil-firing.(3) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer any outstanding differences in relation to his general policy for developing the use of fuel oil as a competitor with coal, and to his proposals for increasing the production of briquettes for use by the rail-ways in substitution for large coal.(4) Took note that the Minister of Fuel and Power would pursuewith the appropriate railway authorities the prospects ofsecuring further economies in coal consumption byelectrification and by the use of diesel engines on therailways.(5) Took note that the Minister of Fuel and Power would discuss with the Agriculture Ministers such adjustments in theprogramme of open-cast coal mining as were needed togive effect to his offer to forgo, in the interests ofagriculture, a total of 2 million tons of open-cast coal overthe next three years.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.2nd June, 1954.
