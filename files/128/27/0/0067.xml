industrial The Minister of Labour made a full report on the meetingsDisputes. which he had held on the previous day with representatives of the docks. three parties to the dispute in the London docks.   It had become(Previous clear, from the stubborn attitude adopted by the Stevedores Union,Reference: that there was at present no scope for negotiation between the partiesC.C. (54) 66th or for conciliation. He had appealed to the stevedores&apos; leaders to conclusions, get their men back to work on the same basis as they had workedMinute 2.)       for months before the strike began, viz., without working overtime.They had admitted that overtime was the only issue between themand the employers and he had made it plain that, if they returnedto work while maintaining their ban on overtime, their positionwould not be prejudiced. The leaders had, however, rejected this appeal and had said that they would advise the men not to returnto work on that basis. The Minister had then made it plain that inthese circumstances he had no alternative but to appoint a Courtof Enquiry to investigate the causes and circumstances of the dispute.The composition of the Court would be announced during the courseof the day.LAOIn discussion the following points were made:  (a) As a result of action taken after the Cabinefs last discussion,the Press were laying greater emphasis on the damage to the national economy which was resulting from the continuance of this dispute.Steps were now being taken to make it clear to the public that thestevedores would not prejudice their position if they returned towork but maintained their ban on overtime.(b) The continuance of the strike was a threat to the authorityof trade union leadership, particularly in the Transport and general works Union. This was well understood both by the Secretaryof that Union and by the leaders of the Trades Union Congress.(c) There was no doubt that Communist influences were atwork in the continuance of the strike. The Stevedores Union wasled by Communists, and the Communist Party were openlysupporting the strikers, both in the docks and in the &apos;bus services.At the same time it must be recognised that among the transportworkers Left-wing sympathisers generally were dissatisfied, on political grounds, with the leadership of the Transport and general works Union.(d) The leaders of the strike were already making efforts to spread the stoppage to other ports, and these efforts would beincreased if military labour were used in the London docks. Forthis reason it was desirable that the use of military labour should be confined in the first instance to the maintenance of services essentialto the life of the community. Under the Defence Regulations,however, it would be open to the Government to use military labour for handling general cargoes; and the possibility should be kept openof using the troops for this purpose at a later stage, so as to reducethe damage to the national economy.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points raised in discussion.(2) Authorised the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies, attheir meeting on 18th October, to decide whether theService Departments should be instructed to put intooperation their plans for bringing military labour intothe London docks on 21st October.(3) Took note that further meetings of the Cabinet mightthereafter be summoned at short notice to consider further developments in the dock strike.
The Cabinet were informed that, although some additionaldepots had now decided to join in the strike, about 50 per cent,of London omnibuses were still in operation. A meeting of delegates from all depots was to be held on 18th October, and it was possiblethat some progress might then be made towards a settlement.The Cabinet (4) Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th October, 1954.london transport.(previous reference:CC (54) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)
