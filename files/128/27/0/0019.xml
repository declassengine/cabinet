ft-149CC. 19 (54)Royal Tour. 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had thought it necessary(Previous that the Cabinet should consider urgently the problems raised by the reference: epidemic of poliomyelitis in Western Australia, where The QueenCC. (54) lith was due to arrive on 26th March for a visit lasting five days. TheConclusions, Queen&apos;s principal medical adviser, Sir Horace Evans, had recentlyMinute 8.) been informed by the doctor accompanying Her Majesty on her tourWestern that this epidemic was definitely increasing and was on a larger scaleAustralia. than had been experienced in Western Australia for some time. sir horace Evans himself considered that The Queen would incur only aslight risk, and that this could be reduced by taking sensible pre-cautions about feeding and avoiding close contact with crowds. Hehad put forward a number of practical suggestions and had advised that The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should receive a secondinoculation with gamma globulin, which might give immunity for afew weeks, when they arrived in Adelaide on their way to Perth.The Prime Minister said that there seemed to be two main questions for consideration. First, what was the degree of risk toThe Queen? Secondly, ought the visit to Western Australia to go forward, subject to the taking of all possible precautions, or would it be better abandoned? In his view The Queen would be reassuredby the knowledge that the matter had been considered by theCabinet and that their advice upon it was at her disposal if she should wish for it.The Commonwealth Secretary said that such expert medical advice as was available to him was to the effect that the risk to the queen&apos;s safety from poliomyelitis was very small-much less, indeed,than that which she was regularly running by air travel. N o specialprecautions for the health of the Royal t arniiy had been considered necessary in this country in 1947 or 1951, when there had been out-breaks of poliomyelitis of an intensity comparable with that of thepresent outbreak in Western Australia. According to this view the queen could safely proceed with her tour as planned, provided thatshe observed such precautions as had been recommended by hermedical advisers. One of Sir Horace Evans&apos;s suggestions was that itmight be advisable for The Queen to live on the Gothic during hervisit to Western Australia. This would be practicable if the Gothiccould be stationed at Fremantle, which was a relatively short distance from Perth; but it was arguable that The Queen would runno greater risk if she were to stay in Government House at Perth, as arranged. Apart from the risk to The Queen&apos;s health, account should be taken of the increased danger which the population of western Australia would incur through assembling in large numbers to celebrate The Queen&apos;s visit. On the other hand, the cabinet should bear it in mind that, although they were entitled to concern themselves with any measures necessary to preserve The Queen&apos;shealth or safety, the arrangements for her tour of Australia were amatter on which constitutionally she must look for advice primarily to Australian Ministers. He had, however, felt justified in sending a private telegram to the Governor of Western Australia asking forinformation on a number of detailed aspects of the problem. Hehad also repeated this telegram to our High Commissioner in Can-berra, asking him for his views but making it clear that he did not wish him to consult Mr. Menzies at this stage.In discussion the view was expressed that the fact that specialprecautions for the health of the Royal Family had not been con-sidered necessary in this country in 1947 and 1951 was hardlyrelevant. The risks attendant upon a Royal Tour were of a quitespecial nature and called for special precautions, even in a country where the population was less densely concentrated than in theBritish Isles.The general view of the Cabinet was that, while the risk to the queen from her forthcoming visit to Western Australia was probably not serious, it was desirable that the Australian Government should
Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to a tele-gram from the Governor-General of the Sudan (Khartoum telegramNo. 103) about the timing of the declaration of a constitutional emer-gency in the Sudan if that became necessary.The Foreign Secretary said that the Governor-General now sug-gested that it would be wiser to defer the declaration of a constitu-tional emergency until after the vote had been taken in the SudaneseParliament for the removal of Ibrahim Ahmed from the Governor-GeneraFs Commissison. He felt that action beforehand would be criticised as an interference with the rights of Parliament. If actionfollowed the vote in Parliament, it would no doubt be said that theGovernor-General was ignoring the wishes of Parliament, but this hehad a right to do if it was his conviction that a declaration of consti-tutional emergency had become a necessity. The telegram wasbeing considered in the Foreign Office, with special reference to the timing of the declaration, so as to ensure that the Governor-Generalretained for as long as possible the support of the Pakistani Chair-man of his Commission. The Foreign Secretary said that he would submit the answer to the Prime Minister before despatch.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Civil Aviation.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 2ndConclusions,Minute 8.)HermesAircraft.3. The Prime Minister drew attention to Press reports of a dispute over the sale of Hermes aircraft by British Overseas airways corporation (B.O.A.C.).The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said that these reports were inaccurate and misleading. Nineteen of these aircraft had been put into service by B.O.A.C. in 1950, but had later been withdrawn as they had been replaced by Comets and Argonauts.Three had since been sold to Silver City Airways and negotiations were in progress for the sale of a further two to another chartercompany. There were grounds for believing that certain labour members of Parliament, having failed to achieve their object in therecent debate on the subject in the House of Commons, were endeavouring to obstruct the carrying out of the Governments policy by encouraging industrial resistance to it. So far, however, dis-cussion had been confined to the workers&apos; panel of the national joint Council for Civil Air Transport and there had been no failure on the part of B.O.A.C.&apos;s employees to carry out the Corporation^instructions to them. The Corporation were, moreover, reasonablyconfident that, when the matter came before the National Jointbe made aware of the anxiety felt on this score by United kingdom ministers and of the support which they would give to any decision by the Australian Government either to cancel the visit or to imposesuch restrictions on it as might be considered wise in the interests ofThe Queen&apos;s safety or of the health of the inhabitants of the State.The Commonwealth Secretary prepared a draft of such a message, to be sent by the Prime Minister to Mr. Menzies. This was read to the Cabinet and was approved subject to amendments.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to telegraph to the PrimeMinister of Australia about The Queen&apos;s forthcoming visit to Western Australia on the lines approved by the Cabinetin their discussion.
Council itself on 19th March, they would be able to obtain the council&apos;s acquiescence in the course of action which they wished tofollow.The Minister of Labour confirmed that there was evidencethat a genuine fear of redundancy resulting from the with-drawal of Hermes aircraft was being exploited for politicalends. The Trade Unions concerned were somewhat lacking inresponsible leadership, but he had reasonable grounds for hoping that, when the matter came before the full National Joint Council,they would recognise and observe the normal limits of industrial action.The Prime Minister said that he had brought this matter to thenotice of the Cabinet because serious constitutional issues would arise if industrial action were successful in obstructing the executionof decisions taken by Parliament. The matter should continue tobe closely watched.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th March, 1954.
