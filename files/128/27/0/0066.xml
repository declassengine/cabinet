1. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been disconcertingdevelopments in the plan for bringing the question of Quemoy beforethe Security Council of the United Nations. As a result of theirpreliminary approach to the Chinese Nationalists, the United StatesGovernment had now informed us that they were disposed to concedeGeneral Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s request for a mutual defence securitytreaty between Nationalist China and the United States. They had explained that such a treaty would not cover the islands near the china coast which were in Nationalist hands and would not beallowed to be used as a &quot; protective shield &quot; for offensive operations by the Nationalists from Formosa and the Pescadores. They had also expressed the view that the negotiation of such a treaty shouldbe kept quite separate from the proposed resolution in the security council.The Foreign Secretary said that it was unfortunate that theUnited States Government had not warned us earlier of this possibility particularly if, as now appeared, it had been in mr. Dulles&apos; mind for some time. It was surprising that they shouldsuppose that this development need not affect the plan for bringing the question of Quemoy before the Security Council: in his view,it entirely altered the basis of this plan. He had at once informedWashington that he must have a delay of at least twenty-four hours in which to consider the resulting position with his cabinet colleagues, and he had asked for full details of the nature and scopeof the proposed treaty. He was, however, satisfied that we should put ourselves into a false position if we were to make the representations in Peking and Moscow for which the plan provided,without disclosing that the United States Government had it in mind to conclude a treaty with the Chinese Nationalists; and he feared that this disclosure would extinguish such chances as the plan had previously had of reducing tension in the area of Formosa.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreement withthe views expressed by the Foreign Secretary. It should be made clear to the United States Government that we could not proceedwith our part in the plan for bringing the question of Quemoy beforethe Security Council until we were aware of the details of theproposed treaty between the United States and Chinese NationalistGovernments. It should also be made clear to them that we shouldnot feel able to make our planned approaches to the Peking and moscow Governments without telling them of the projected treaty and that in our view disclosure of this information was likely to deprive the plan of any chance of success which it might have had.The Cabinet ;Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and invited him to send a further communication to H.M. ambassador in Washington on the lines suggested in discussion.2. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, reportedthat from the discussions which the Minister had already held it was clear that the port employers and the Transport and general works Union would both be willing to enter into negotiations on all outstanding questions as soon as work was resumed in the docks, but that the employers would not admit the strikers&apos;. claim that overtime should be recognised as voluntary. Tt was just possiblethat the Minister might.. extract from the Stevedores Union, in discussions with them which were still in progress,,.a promise to returnto work while maintaining the ban on overtime pending the reportof the Court of Enquiry which the Minister proposed to appoint.This, however, seemed unlikely; for the decision of the lightermen
to cease work on Sunday evening would probably stiffen the attitudeof the Stevedores Union. At the end of his talks the minister would be issuing a statement which would bring out clearly theterms on which the strikers were being urged to return to workwhile the Court of Enquiry was sitting.The Cabinet were informed that the Ministers concerned withthe maintenance of essential services had decided that no overtaction to introduce military labour into the docks should be taken before 18th October. This would enable the troops to be in action by 21st October. About 5,000 troops would be needed at the outset;and the War Office could provide 4,000 at three days&apos; notice and increase the numbers thereafter by 1,200 a day.In discussion the view was strongly expressed that it was time that energetic measures were taken to bring home to the public the gravity of the situation to which the standstill in the docks wasgiving rise and the seriousness of thejosses which were being inflictedupon our export trade. The facts of the situation had not yet beengiven enough publicity in the Press, and it might become necessarythat an authoritative statement should be issued on behalf of theGovernment as a whole emphasising the gravity of the situationwhich faced the country. On the other hand it was pointed out that most of the relevant facts had already appeared in the Press, though they might not have been given the prominence they deserved. TheGovernment should at this stage avoid any action which mightinflame feeling among the strikers and make it more difficult tosecure a resumption of work in the docks. The statement whichthe Minister of Labour was to issue that evening on the outcome of his discussions with the parties to the dispute would be followedby an announcement of his intention to appoint a Court of enquiry and, if there were no improvement in the situation during the weekend, by the decision to use military labour to maintain essential services. The avenues for conciliation should be kept open at least until that decision became necessary.The Prime Minister said that much would depend on the outcome of the Minister^ present discussions with the StevedoresUnion. The views which had been expressed in the cabinets discussion should be brought to the attention of the Minister, whowould take them into account when considering the next steps tobe taken in handling the situation.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour, and invited him to bring to theattention of the Minister the views which had been expressed in the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th October, 1954.
