House ofCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous reference:CC. (54) 76thConclusions,Minute 5.)uganda protectorate.(previous reference:CC. (54) 74thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Colonial Secretary said that the Governmenfs proposalsfor further constitutional development in the Buganda Province,which he had announced on the previous day in pursuance of the cabinet&apos;s decision of 10th November, had met with a favourable reception in this country. In Uganda the initial reception of theproposals had been less favourable. But this might have been due partly to a misunderstanding of the Governmenfs intentions inrespect of Kabaka Mutesa; and it was possible that the Bagandamight make a more satisfactory response to the plan as a whole whenthose intentions were more clearly explained. Mutesa&apos;s ownstatement on the proposals had been restrained and helpful.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theProrogationof Parliament.3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.

The. Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinefs discussion on the previous day, it had been brought to his notice that more thanforty Orders in Council would be required to give effect to therecommendations of the Boundary Commissions. If each of these could be debated separately, the Opposition would be presented withopportunities for Parliamentary obstruction which would seriouslyhamper the conduct of Government business in the House ofCommons.The Cabinet were informed that steps had already been takento obtain the Speakefs ruling on the question whether the orders should be debated separately or as a whole. It was hoped that theSpeakefs views on this point would be available later in the day.The Cabinet agreed that, if it transpired that no more than asingle debate would be required in each House, the responsible ministers should proceed to present the reports and draft Orders inaccordance with the time-table already approved by the Cabinet. Inthat event the Prime Minister would see the Leader of the Oppositionon the following day, before notice of the presentation of these documents was given. If, on the other hand, it appeared that the presentation of these Orders would afford substantial opportunities for Parliamentary obstruction, the Cabinet should have anopportunity to reconsider the time-table originally proposed.The Cabinet-Took note that, in the light of the Speakefs ruling on thepoint of procedure, the Prime Minister would review theposition later that day in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Lord Privy Seal, the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
