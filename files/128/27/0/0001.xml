Middle east defence Policy.(previous reference:C.C.(53)73rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (54) 4) regarding a suggestion of the United StatesGovernment that their offer of military aid to Pakistan should be linked with the initiation of some liiiiitary collaboration betweenPakistan and Turkey, which might eventually be developed into asystem of collective defence in the Middle East. The memorandumset out certain objections to this project and proposed that the UnitedStates Government should be discouraged from pursuing it in itspresent form.The Prime Minister said that he was not opposed to this projecton its merits. Indeed, if some military association were eventuallybuilt up between Turkey and Pakistan, this might turn out to our advantage. If we failed to reach a defence agreement with egypt and disengaged our forces from the Canal Zone, the general directionof our re-deployment in the Middle East would be to the northward.The creation of a new defence grouping in the northern part of this area would fit in with that movement. None the less, he thought ithighly undesirable that this project should be announced immediately before the Four-Power Meeting in Berlin. It could do nothing forthe moment to increase the military strength of the West, and it was bound to be regarded by the Soviet Government as a provocativegesture. Its announcement at this moment was likely to increaseSoviet suspicions of American intentions and might even be taken to imply that the Americans were not anxious to reach any agreement at the Four-Power Meeting. Public Opinion, in this country andabroad, had high hopes of that Meeting; and, if it led to nothing, theresponsibility for the breakdown should be clearly seen to rest withthe Soviet Government. We at any rate should have no part in any action or announcement in advance of the Meeting which seemedcalculated to impair what chances it had of producing satisfactory results. These arguments should be forcibly presented to the UnitedStates Government.In discussion attention was drawn to the fact that, although no official announcement had yet been made, much information about this project had already been published in the United States Press.This was bound to create an unfavourable impression on the Soviet45487 B 2Four-Power 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States SecretaryMeeting.        of State had proposed that the Foreign Ministers of the United States,(Previous       United Kingdom and,France should meet alone, immediately beforeReference:      the opening of the Four-Power Meeting in Berlin on 25 th January,C.C. (53) 77th   for the purpose of reaching agreement between themselves on certain conclusions,    matters still outstanding and of discussing the tactics to be followedMinute 4.)       at the Meeting.  He had suggested that this preliminary discussionmight be held in Paris on 23rd and 24th January, and that the german federal Chancellor might be invited to come to Paris so that he mightbe informed of its results.The Foreign Secretary said that a preliminary meeting of thiskind, though it would be valuable, should be held as unobtrusivelyas possible. He thought it would be a mistake for him and Mr. Dullesto go specially to Paris for this purpose. And it would certainly be wrong to invite Dr. Adenauer to attend: there was no occasion to consult him further on policy and he was not concerned with tactics.The French Government shared these views. He had therefore suggested to Mr. Dulles that the preliminary meeting should be heidin Berlin, the Foreign Ministers of the Western Powers going therefor this purpose a little earlier than they would otherwise have done.It could also be arranged that the three High Commissioners wouldbe available hi Berlin for consultations.The Cabinet endorsed the action taken by the Foreign secretary in this matter.
Government. It would also alarm the Indian Government, who hadobjected to the proposed grant of military aid to Pakistan and hadbeen reassured on the basis that no military pact was in contemplation.It was the general view of the Cabinet that every effort shouldbe made to dissuade the United States Government from making anyearly announcement of this project. Our representations should,however, be based not on any objection to the project in itself, but onthe disadvantages of making, immediately before the Four-power meeting in Berlin, a gesture which the Soviet Government were boundto regard as provocative.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to represent strongly to theUnited States Government that it would be most untimelyto make, before the Four-Power Meeting, any announce-ment regarding a projected military association between turkey and Pakistan.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make similar representations to the Turkish Government through Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Ankara.Egypt.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 8.1stConclusions,Minute 1.)defence negotiations.sterling balances.3. The Foreign Secretary said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision or. 29th December, he had prepared a memorandumoutlining the courses open to us if the defence negotiations with Egyptcould not be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. In this memo-randum, which would be circulated later in the day, he was suggesting that, if we reached no agreement, we should take our stand on the1936 Treaty and should state our readiness to go to arbitration onthe revision of the Treaty, according to its terms. If the Egyptiansrefused arbitration, we should find it easier to justify our positionin the eyes of the world. If they accepted it, the award might wellgive us some of the advantages which we were now trying to obtainby negotiation. Meanwhile, we should continue to re-deploy our forces in the Middle East in accordance with our own interests. he still thought, however, that those interests would be better served by the conclusion of an agreement with Egypt on the terms we had offered.The. Foreign Secretary added that, from military Staff talks held between representatives of the Middle East Land Forces and theTurkish Staff, it seemed likely that the Turks would be willing tooffer us facilities for the pre-stocking of military equipment atMardin, near the Iraq and Persian frontiers. In return for this theywould expect us to disclose to them our plans for the defence of north-East Iraq. This was an important development, which might ultimately fit into a general pattern for a northern line of defence for the Middle East. It was not inconsistent with the Americansuggestion (noted in the preceding Minute) for a military association between Turkey and Pakistan. It would, however, be necessary to choose cautiously the right moment for pursuing these projects.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and agreedto resume their; discussion of it at their next meeting.The President of the Board of Trade said that the cabinets decision to defer the release of the  10 millions of Egypfs blockedsterling balances had produced a salutary effect in Egypt: it now appeared that the Egyptian Government were ready to relax theirrestrictions on sterling imports. when the  10 millions had been released.The Prime Minister said that, as the defence negotiations with egypt were coming to a head, uncertainty about the release of the
 10 millions was a valuable card in our hands which should not be thrown away. There was, however, no reason why Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Cairo should not ask for further details of Egyptianintentions regarding their discrimination against sterling imports.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade and the Financial Secretary,Treasury, to advise Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairowhat further steps he should take to ascertain the inten-tions of the Egyptian Government in regard to the relaxation of existing restrictions on sterling imports intoEgypt.Sale of ArmsAbroad.(previous reference:C.C.(52)79thConclusions,Minute 6.)India.Argentinaand Chile.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (54) 5) on the proposal of the indian government to buy Centurion tanks and Hunter fighters, and memoranda by the Commonwealth Secretary and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (D. (53) 62 and 60) proposing that a cruiser, H.M.S.Nigeria, should be sold to the Indian Government.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it could now be assumed that the United States Government would give military aid, in one form or another, to Pakistan. If we refused to sell to India the armsshe wanted, she would be affronted and would buy them elsewhere.Her requirements were reasonable in themselves, and it was in our interests that both India and Pakistan should use British equipment.If we declined to supply India with arms, she would thereby be encouraged to buy her civilian, as well as her military, supplies else-where and this would damage the interests of British firms in India.Finally, the supply of these arms to India would make it more difficult for her to object to our earning United States dollars by supplyingBritish equipment to Pakistan under the programme of United state said to Pakistan.The Minister of Supply said that the acceptance of these Indianorders would help to maintain our industrial war potential. It wouldalso avert the unemployment which was now threatening in our tankfactories.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, if it was decided that.M.S. Nigeria should be sold to India, he would be willing to offer to sell a cruiser to Pakistan, in order to maintain the principle ofbroad parity of treatment between India and Pakistan.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theIndian Government to be informed that we were readyto meet their stated, requirements for tanks and aircraft.(2) Agreed that we should offer to sell H.M.S. Nigeria to theIndian Government on the terms proposed in the memo-randum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (D. (53) 60).(3) Agreed that the Government of Pakistan should be told that,if they wished to buy a cruiser from us, we should be willing to offer one.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (C: (53) 336) covering a report by the Chiefs of Staff on thequestion whether Argentina would derive any military, advantage fromthe possession of helicopters supplied from the United Kingdom.The Minister of Defence said that, as the Chiefs of Staff had cometo the conclusion that the supply of helicopters to Argentina and Chilehad no strategic significance, he raised no objection to the supply of twenty helicopters to Argentina and a few to Chile.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although it was true that Argentina and Chile could obtainhelicopters of the same type from the United States, that would notprotect the Government from criticism if in fact helicopters sold byus were used in any form of hostile action against our forces orpossessions in the Antarctic.(&amp;) The value of the order f Or the helicopters amounted to about 1 million and was in itself of no great economic significance. But, ifthe order were refused, Argentina and Chile might be more reluctant to buy from us other types of aircraft which we were anxious to sellto them; and these other aircraft contracts were of substantialimportance to our export trade.(c) It was suggested that, in return for the supply of these helicopters-copters, we might extract some form of guarantee that Argentinawould not commit any acts of violence against&apos; our possessions in the antarctic. As against this it was argued that Argentina was unlikely to be willing to give such a general guarantee in return for a fewhelicopters, and that it would in any event be difficult to define any satisfactory form of guarantee, as our claim to much of this territorywas open to dispute., The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed doubtful whetherArgentina still wanted to buy these helicopters. He would considerwhether there was any form of guarantee which Argentina might reasonably be expected to give if she still wished to purchase them. Ifhe could frame any practicable proposition, he would submit it to the. Cabinet.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed to defer a decision on the sale of helicopters toArgentina and Chile.Brazil. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty (C. (53) 366) proposing that a light fleet carrier,H.M.S. Leviathan, should be offered to Brazil.. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Royal Navy had no present or prospective requirement for H.M.S. Leviathan. If Brazilagreed to buy her, she would be completed in this country and thiswould provide useful employment in the shipbuilding and ancillarytrades. If an emergency arose before she was completed, she could, be taken up for our own purposes. The selling-price of the ship aslying would be put at  2 - 9 millions, but this might have to be reduced in negotiation. The cost of completion could not be precisely esti-mated without fuller knowledge of Brazilian requirements, but it was hardly likely to be less than  7 millions spread over a period of some three years.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that H.MJS. Leviathan should be offered to Brazil onthe terms proposed in the memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty (C. (53) 366).     -Persia.(previous reference:C.C.(53) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C (54) 3) outlining the basis on which a solution of thePersian oil dispute might be sought if, as seemed likely, the newPersian Government were unwilling to agree that the Anglo-iranian oil Company (A.I.O.C.) should resume its operations in Persia.The Foreign Secretary said that, since his memorandum was cir-culated, the Persian Prime Minister had made it&apos; clear, in an interview with Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Tehran^ that Persian publicopinion would not tolerate the return of A.I.O.C.   He was, however,
willing that a survey should be carried out at Abadan by a party oftechnicians including some employees of A.I.O.C. He had alsoshown readiness to consider the proposition that the production and marketing of Persian oil might be undertaken in future by a consortium of oil companies including A.I.O.C. In these circum-stances the Foreign Secretary thought it would be necessary to proceedwith negotiations on the general lines indicated in paragraph 9 ofC. (54) 3; and he proposed to put this proposition to the Chairman ofA.I.O.C. early in the following week. It was hoped that the A.LO.C.would secure a 50 per cent, share in the proposed consortium and thatthe other companies would buy their interest in it, paying A.I.O.C.either in capital,, in revenue or in free oil.The Foreign Secretary said that there were strong arguments forgiving the big American oil companies a share in the future marketing of Persian oil. When it came back into the world market, therewould have to be a corresponding reduction in oil production, mainly by American companies, in other parts of the Middle East. More-over, it would be advantageous if similar arrangements could be madefor exploiting the new oilfield which had been discovered nearBuraimi. This find had been made by a consortium in which british companies had a 45 per cent, share; ancL, as the area was one to whichthe Saudi Arabians laid claim and all the oil concessions in SaudiArabia were held by American companies, many difficulties would be avoided if it could be exploited by a consortium including Americanas well as British companies. It would be to the general advantage if matters could be so arranged that both British and american companies were interested in the exploitation of oil in each of the oil-producing countries of the Middle East.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed towards asettlement of the Persian oil dispute on the general lines indicated in C. (54) 3.Industrial 6.   The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thatDisputes. the appointment&apos; of a Court of Inquiry had now been accepted by bothShipbuilding parties to the wages dispute in the shipbuilding and engineering and Engineering industries. The Trade Unions concerned had undertaken to giveIndustries. evidence to the Court, and had agreed to postpone the proposed ban(Previous on piecework and overtime until after the findings of the Court had reference: been published. This was a satisfactory development, and representedC.C. (53) 81st a victory for the more moderate of the Trade Union leaders in these conclusions, industries.Minute 5.)Electrical In the electrical contracting industry the position was less satis-Contracting factory. Negotiations between the two sides had broken down, andIndustry. the employers had reported the dispute to the Minister of Labourunder the Industrial Disputes Order. Attempts at conciliation had so far proved unavailing, and it seemed unlikely that a solution wouldbe found. A strike in this industry would not, however, have serious effects on the national economy.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Labour.

The Chief Whip said that it had been intended that the judges&apos; Second Reading of the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill should be taken in remuneration the House of Commons in the second week after ParliamentBill. reassembled.   At that time, however, the Government majority(Previous would be unusually low since, in addition to the various by-electionsReferences: now pending, several Ministers would be abroad.

In these circumstances it seemedMinute 3.) likely that the Second Reading of that Bill would have to be postponed.The Prime Minister said that, while it might be inexpedient totake the Second Reading of this Bill while the Government majoritywas exceptionally low, he would be disinclined to yield to pressure from Government supporters who wished to link this issue with thequestion of Service officers&apos; retired pay.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of the timing  of  Parliamentary  proceedings   on  the  Judges&apos;Remuneration Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th January, 1954.
