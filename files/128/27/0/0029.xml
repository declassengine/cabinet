3CC. 29 (54)Hong Kong.Reduction ofGarrison.(previous reference:CC. (53) 54thConclusions,Minute 1.)Egypt.(previous reference:CC. (54) 21stConclusions,Minute 2.)Protection ofthe BritishCommunity.1. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the decision takenby the Defence Committee, at their meeting on the previous day, thatafter the end of the Geneva Conference the Hong Kong garrisonshould be reduced by gradual and unobtrusive stages to the levelrequired for internal security purposes. If this decision became known to the United States authorities, it would prejudice the pros-pects of establishing a system of collective defence in South-East asia and the Western Pacific. And if the Chinese got to know of it,negotiation at Geneva would be made even more difficult. He hoped,therefore, that nothing would be said to indicate to the Governor of hong Kong, or to the military commanders in the Far East, that adecision had already been taken to reduce the garrison after the geneva Conference.The Prime Minister agreed that the decision taken by the DefenceCommittee must be kept most secret. For the time being theGovernor of Hong Kong should be told that no action was beingtaken on the proposal to reduce the garrison and that the matter would be reviewed after the Geneva Conference. In the meantime,no hint of any kind should be given that a reduction of the garrisonwas contemplated.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary to inform the Governor of hong Kong that no immediate action would be taken toreduce the garrison, that the matter would be reviewed afterthe Geneva Conference, and that in the meantime no hintshould be given that any reduction was contemplated.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chiefs ofStaff (D. (54) 19) and the Foreign Secretary (C. (54) 148) on themilitary arrangements for safeguarding British civilians in Egypt inan emergency.The Foreign Secretary said that the Chiefs of Staff were nowsuggesting that we should be content with plans for (i) sending astrong flying column to bring out from Cairo such British subjects as could assemble within the Embassy precincts in an emergency, and(ii) sending warships into Alexandria. He could not think that these plans were adequate. Provisions ought also to be made for a more powerful follow-up operation, which would preserve British andforeign lives and property in Cairo and Alexandria by restoring orderin these cities. If a situation arose which called for intervention byus, we might have an opportunity to set up an alternative Govern-ment and we should be ill-advised to miss such an opportunity. the egyptians already knew that we had plans for occupying the Delta,and this knowledge was a powerful guarantee of their good behaviour.If we now restricted our plans in the way proposed by the Chiefs ofStaff, we should be abandoning this useful negotiating card. He feltthat, so long as we retained forces in the Canal Zone, we ought tobe ready to intervene effectively in the Delta if the situation demandedit.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the object ofthe modified plan was to enable a start to be made with the re-deployment of the fighting troops in the Canal Zone. So long as we accepted a firm commitment to occupy the Delta in an emergency,no reduction could be made in the garrison of the Canal Zone. More-over, if we had to restore order in Cairo and Alexandria and supportan alternative Government, it was likely that reinforcements would be needed from the United Kingdom.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was impossible to forecast the scope and nature of theoperations Which might be required if we had to intervene in the Delta.46149-1b 2
It would therefore be wise to have a number of alternative plans tomeet the various contingencies that might arise. The choice of anyparticular plan could not be made in advance.(b) If plans had -to be based on the assumption that all troops now in the Canal Zone would be available for these operations there could be no preliminary reductions and no contraction of the Base,since the reduction of forces and the contraction of the Base werecomplementary moves which had to proceed simultaneously.(c) On the other hand, it was suggested that plans for intervention in the Delta should be related to the troops available in the canal zone at any given time in accordance with the plans for contractingthe Base.The Prime Minister said that at all stages we must be ready to intervene in the Delta as effectively as we could with the forces available in the Canal Zone. This did not mean that plans for thecontraction of the Base should not be made, although no forces shouldbe withdrawn from the Canal Zone without further reference to theCabinet. The Chiefs of Staff should prepare plans for intervention inthe Delta on varying assumptions regarding the local situation and theforces available in the Canal Zone at the various stages of re-deployment.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to prepare plans for intervention in the Delta with the forces at any time available in the canal Zone, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2). Agreed that plans for the contraction of the Canal ZoneBase and the reduction of forces should continue to bemade, but should not be put into effect without further reference to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that the readiness of the United StatesGovernment to join in an Anglo-American initiative for theestablishment of a system of collective defence for South-East asia and the Western Pacific had encouraged him to hope that they might now be ready to join with us in similar assurances about the securityof the Middle East and the Suez Canal. If the Egyptians wereconfronted with a firm Anglo-American declaration on therequirements for security in that area, we should have a good prospect of reaching a satisfactory agreement which would enable usto reduce our forces without loss of prestige. We should not need to ask the Americans to provide either forces or money. Aninternational agreement, in which the British and the Americans took the lead, would be a sufficient guarantee of the security of the area and of the right of international passage through the Suez Canal, andno great show of force should be required. He thought that themoment was opportune for suggesting a scheme of this kind to the americans.The Foreign Secretary said that it was not easy to create a system of collective defence in the Middle East. In South-east asia there were a number of large and small Powers directly involved by territorial and other interests. The countries of the Middle Eastwere less willing to be drawn into a collective defence pact. Moreover,the Americans had so far taken the line that they would take no partin defence negotiations or arrangements with Egypt unless the egyptians invited them to do so. He would, however, examine thepossibility of devising some workable scheme which he might havean opportunity of discussing with the United States Secretary of Stateduring the Geneva Conference.The Cabinet (3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would examine thepossibility of putting forward practical proposals for asystem of collective defence in the Middle East.defence negotiations..
Ivmu    ****CC. 29 (54)Civil Defence.(previous reference:CC. (53) 48thConclusions,Minute 7.)Re-statementof policy.Shelter Policy.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (54) 149) covering an outline of a speech on civil defence which he was proposing to make at Bristol On 23rd April.The Home Secretary said that this was an opportune moment tore-state the need for civil defence measures. There was widespreadpublic anxiety about the effects of the hydrogen bomb. TheCoventry City Council had declared their intention to abandon their civil defence preparations. Some newspapers were suggesting thatthe Governmenfs policy and plans were inadequate to the newdangers threatened by the development of the hydrogen bomb.There was&apos; clear need therefore for an authoritative statement that,though the role of the civil defence services might be altered by thedevelopment of the hydrogen bomb, the need for them remained.The outline of his proposed statement had been considered by theCivil Defence Committee, but in view of its importance he had thought it right to give the Cabinet an opportunity to comment on what he proposed to say.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general agreement on the importance of checkingany tendency to assume that no civil defence measures would be ofany value against attack by hydrogen bombs. While no structuralprecautions could provide protection against a direct hit by ahydrogen bomb, civil defence measures would still be important atthe periphery of such an explosion.(b) Dispersal would now become more important than shelter,and further thought should be given to means of improving the roadoutlets from target areas.(c) The reference in paragraph 16 of the draft to the employmentof 100,000 R.A.F. reservists in civil defence might be misunderstoodunless it were made clear that they would be employed on these duties only until they were needed in the Air Force.(d) Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the draft might give the impression that the Governmenfs first objective was to prevent the use of thehydrogen bomb in war. There was, however, an earlier stage in thedevelopment of this argument, viz., the Governmenfs primary aim off preserving world peace by removing the causes of war.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the general lines of the draft annexed toC. (54) 149; and took note that the Home Secretary, in preparing the final version of his speech, would take intoaccount the points raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofWorks (C. (54) 150) pointing out that, in view of the recent disclosure of the explosive power of the hydrogen bomb, he would have muchgreater difficulty in carrying out the existing policy that personserecting buildings of four or more storeys should be persuaded toinclude in them a strengthened basement adequate for use as an air-raid shelter.The Minister of Works said that, although he had hitherto had some success in persuading developers to include strengthened base-ments in such buildings, there would clearly be much greaterreluctance to incur this additional expenditure now that the explosivepower of the hydrogen bomb was known. If any substantialprovision of strengthened basements was to be made, it would benecessary to use compulsory powers and to provide a government grant in respect of the additional expenditure incurred.In discussion it was agreed that this policy should not been forced by compulsory powers. It need not, however, be whollyabandoned-for strengthened basements would still afford valuableprotection.outside the immediate area of a hydrogen bomb explosion.
The Minister should therefore continue to try to persuade developersvoluntarily to include strengthened basements in such buildings; but,when persuasion failed, he should not on that account refuse a building licence. He should, if possible, avoid any public indication that there had been any change of Government policy in this matter.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the Minister of Works should continue to try to persuade developers to include strengthened basementsin buildings of four storeys or more, but should not press this policy to the point of refusing a building licence todevelopers who were unwilling to incur the additionalexpense of providing a strengthened basement in such a building.commercial policy.Review of.A.T.T.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 61stConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (54) 144) proposing the appoint-ment of a Ministerial Committee and an inter-departmental Com-mittee of officials to consider the line to be taken on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government in the forthcoming review of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.). &apos;The President of the Board of Trade said that the internationalreview of the G.A.T.T. was likely to start in November. At theMeeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers at Sydney it had beenagreed that this should be preceded by discussions between officials of Commonwealth countries, and this Commonwealth meeting was likely to be held early in October. It was important that at thismeeting the United Kingdom Delegation should be in a position togive a clear lead to the other Commonwealth countries. The issues involved were complex and far-reaching, and it would take some timeto reach agreement on the line to be taken on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government. He therefore proposed that inter-depart-mental discussion should begin without delay.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal, in paragraph 8 of C. (54) 144, forthe appointment of a Ministerial Committee and an inter-departmental Committee of officials to consider the line to be taken on behalf of the United Kingdom Govern-ment in the forthcoming review of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would settle the corn-position of the Ministerial Committee to be appointed under Conclusion (1) above.Sexual Offences. 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home(Previous Secretary (C. (54) 121) summarising the arguments for and againstReference: the suggestion, made in the Cabinefs earlier discussions onC.C.(54)20th 24th February and 17th March, that legislation might be passed to conclusions, restrict publication of the details of criminal prosecutions for homo-Minute 4.)       sexual offences.The Home Secretary said that in his judgment the objectionsto such legislation outweighed any advantage it might have. Hewas specially impressed with the difficulty of drawing a distinction,as regards publication, between homosexual offences and other sexualoffences or, for that matter, crimes of violence, which were oftenassociated with sexual irregularity or misconduct. There was alsoforce in the argument that, if the Government supported this legisla-tion and at the same time declined to hold an enquiry, they would
7CC. 29 (54)be open to the criticism that they were trying to suppress the publica-tidn of evidence showing the need for an enquiry.The Home Secretary said that in these circumstances he felt obliged to press his earlier proposal for the holding of an independent enquiry into the law relating to prostitution and homosexual offences.As, however, the Cabinet were reluctant to add to the number of royal Commissions now sitting, he was ready to agree that this enquiry should be made by a Departmental Committee rather thana Royal Commission.The Prime Minister said that, if the Home Secretary was prepared to take the responsibility for appointing a DepartmentalCommittee to enquire into these matters, the Cabinet need not raise objection to this modified proposal.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Departmental Committee should be appointedto enquire into the law relating to prostitution and homo-sexual offences.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would consult with thePrime Minister on the membership of the proposed committee.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (54) 141) seeking guidance on the line they should take in forthcoming discussions with Dr. BorgOlivier, the Prime Minister of Malta, about Malta&apos;s future status.The Colonial Secretary said that the offer was still open thatMalta should be brought under the authority of the Queen inCouncil, on the analogy of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,with the Home Secretary as the responsible Minister. It seemed likely, however, that the Maltese would be unwilling to accept this offer.   The possible alternatives appeared to be:  (i) to accede to Dr. Borg Ohvier&apos;s desire that Malta should be accorded a status comparable with that enjoyed by SouthernRhodesia before Central African federation;(ii) to develop a closer relation between Malta and the UnitedKingdom on the lines favoured by the Labour Party in Malta;(iii) to appoint a Royal Commission to examine the working of malta&apos;s present constitution, her financial problems and the questionof some change in her present status.As regards (i), a request that responsibility for handling the affairs of Malta in London should be transferred to the Common-wealth Secretary had already been rejected. The idea of closerintegration of Malta with the United Kingdom, implicit in (ii) above,must depend very largely on whether Parliamentary representation of malta at Westminster could be seriously considered. He himselfdid not consider that it could and he understood that his view wasshared by the Labour Opposition in the House of Commons. TheOpposition were also doubtful about the wisdom of any arrangement which might make this country^ social services available to thepopulation of Malta, which the island&apos;s economy could not whollysupport. There were risks in the appointment of a Royal Com-mission, which might submit recommendations which the Govern-ment could not accept. It seemed possible, however, that ministers might find themselves in a position in which the appointment of aCommission was unavoidable.In discussion there was general agreement that representationof Malta in the Parliament at Westminster could not be contemplated.
The Commonwealth Secretary said that further reflection had confirmed him in the view that the Cabinet had been right to reject the request that responsibility for handling Malta&apos;s affairs should betransferred to him. JHe was, however, apprehensive about thepossible consequences of the appointment of a Royal Commissionand he hoped that the two Secretaries of State would find it possible,in their discussions with Dr. Borg Olivier, to explore the positionand report further to the Cabinet before a decision was taken toappoint a Royal Commission.The Prime Minister said that it did not seem necessary at thisstage to rule out the possibility that it would eventually be necessaryto adopt a negative attitude towards Malta&apos;s present attempts toobtain some change in her constitutional status.The Colonial Secretary pointed out that Malta&apos;s claims tended to evoke special sympathy and support in this country on account ofher unique position in having been awarded the George Cross.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (54) 141 and of the views expressed in discussion.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary and the Colonial Secretaryto initiate discussions with the Prime Minister of malta and invited them to refer the matter again to the cabinet before bringing these discussions to a conclusion.Malaya.constitutional change in singapore.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (54) 142) on the proposed constitutional changes in singapore.The Colonial Secretary said that, in pursuance of the recom-mendations of a Constitutional Commission, he proposed to transfer responsibility in Singapore in all matters except defence, external affairs and internal security from the Governor to elected ministers responsible to a legislative assembly with a large elected majority. Infuture the franchise would be restricted, broadly speaking, to&quot; citizens of the United Kingdom and the Colonies &quot; as distinct from&quot; British subjects.&quot; One effect of this restriction would be to with-draw the vote from the majority of the nationals of commonwealth countries other than the United Kingdom and, in particular, from theIndian community. It would, however, be open to individual Indianresidents to register as citizens of the United Kingdom and theColonies and thereby to recover the right to vote, while at the sametime incurring all the obligations of citizenship, including liability to military service.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he recognised theimportance of stimulating a sense of local loyalty in Singapore andhe would raise no objection in principle to the Colonial Secretary&apos;proposal. The Indian Government would have no valid ground forobjecting as they did not at present accord reciprocal rights in Indiato citizens of the United Kingdom and the Colonies from Singapore.He would, however, welcome an opportunity to consider further the exact effect which the proposed modification of the franchisearrangements would have on the Australian community in Singapore.The Cabinet Approved in principle the proposals for constitutional change in Singapore outlined in C. (54) 142.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th April, 1954
