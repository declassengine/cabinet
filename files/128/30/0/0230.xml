3CM. 6 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Lord Privy Seal said that he was concerned at thenumber, and length, of the statements which Ministers wereproposing to make after Questions in the House of Commons in thecourse of the next few days. He was submitting to the Ministersconcerned suggestions designed to reduce the amount of Parliamen-tary time which these statements would occupy. He was alsoconsidering what general advice could be given to Ministers on thissubject for their future guidance.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 8.)Credit Policy.*2. The Cabinet considered the proposals put forward by theChancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (56) 17 for reducing theinflationary pressure in the national economy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the disinflationarymeasures which had been taken in the autumn were not provingadequate to control the inflationary pressure in the economy. Thegold and dollar reserves had fallen from a peak level of 1,078 millions in June 1954 to  757 millions and the excess of importsover exports in some ways a truer indication of the relative weaknessof our position than periodical variations in the strength of sterling had risen from a monthly figure of  50 millions in September andOctober to  69 millions in November and  73 millions in December.The position was so grave that, if the trade figures for January wereto disclose an even larger deficit, there was a real risk that confidencein sterling would be undermined. Prompt and drastic acdon wasurgently needed to right the position.The proposals set out in CP. (56) 17 were mainly addressed to theproblem of reducing capital expenditure by central and localgovernment. It was essential, if the private sector was to do its part,that the Government should be seen to be doing all it could. Withoutfurther retrenchment the Estimates for 1956-57 would show anincrease of  280 millions over those for the current year and anincrease of  300 millions in relation to the probable out-turn ofexpenditure for the current year. The Government must show theirdetermination to reverse this trend and to secure a significantreduction in public expenditure.The measures which he proposed should be considered andapplied as a concerted programme. If such a programme ofretrenchment were adopted, any balancing measures which might bethought desirable could be included in the Budget in April. If theCabinet approved the broad lines of his proposals, he would preparein consultation with his colleagues a more definitive programme forthe Cabinet&apos;s consideration on the Prime Minister&apos;s return from theUnited States with a view to its being announced in the House ofCommons in mid-February soon after the publication of the Voteon Account for 1956-57.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider seriatim the specificproposals put forward in CP. (56) 17.The view was expressed that, as the private sector of the economystill accounted for half of the total annual investment in this country,now running at an annual level of  3,000 millions, furtherconsideration might be given to the possibility of intensifying thecredit squeeze.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the effectiveness ofcredit restriction was limited to some extent by the fact that, as aresult of dividend restraint, many business firms possessed unusuallylarge liquid resources. But those companies which normally financedthemselves to the maximum extent by bank borrowings before goingto the capital market would now have to go to the capital marketOriginally recorded in a Confidential Annex.49597 3b 2
earlier. On investment generally the percentage increase in prospectfor the coming year was more than the economy could stand.Investment in the nationalised industries, at present running at 500 millions a year and financed before nationalisation out of theprofits earned by those industries, contributed to the investment boom.It was for consideration whether, in order to avoid the inflationaryeffect of investment in this field, it should not be the practice toprovide for the capital needs of the nationalised industries out oftaxation through a Budget surplus rather than by the issue ofTreasury Bills. The Banks would not be able to continue to playtheir part in restricting credit in the private sector if the Governmentdid not make a comparable contribution in reducing investment bythe nationalised industries.The President of the Board of Trade said that, although hirepurchase credit represented only a small proportion of the totalamount of credit in circulation and the application of furtherrestrictions would cause more political trouble than economic effect,he recognised that further restrictions were now desirable as part ofthe broader programme. He would discuss with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer what restriction should be applied to each industry.Further restrictions on hire purchase would be specially unwelcometo the furniture and motor car industries.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that further restrictions should beimposed on hire purchase trade, related to the circum-stances of the industry concerned; and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade to work out detailed proposals for thispurpose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was desirable thatthe novel means of attracting small savings which he was anxious tointroduce should have the support, or at least the acquiescence, ofthe National Savings Movement. He undertook to investigate furthera suggestion made in discussion that the principal insurancecompanies might be prepared to investigate the possibility ofintroducing new forms of life insurance which would be speciallyattractive to the small investor.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to pursue further inconsultation with the Chairman of the National SavingsMovement and, if necessary, the principal insurancecompanies, the possibility of introducing new means ofsaving which would be especially attractive to the smallinvestor.The Minister of Transport said that he readily accepted theproposal for a cut of  7 millions in expenditure by the TransportCommission on road vehicles. It would not be appropriate, whilehe had so many lorries to dispose of, for the Transport Commissionto buy new vehicles on the scale which they now envisaged. TheTransport Commission had, however, only recently embarked upona new programme of railway modernisation and, although there mightbe scope for economy through more prudent investment, it would bedesirable for the proposed reduction of  20 millions to be spread overtwo or three years. He undertook to put forward proposals for theconsideration of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (3) Approved a reduction of  7 millions in the proposed invest-ment during 1956 of the British Transport Commission inroad vehicles.Hire Purchase.Savings.Investment.Railways.
5CM. 6 (56)(4) Took note that the Minister of Transport would prepare forthe consideration of the Chancellor of the Exchequerproposals for postponing some part of the proposedexpenditure of the Transport Commission on railwayre-equipment so as to achieve a reduction in the level ofinvestment during 1956.Coal, Gas and The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he could accept aElectricity. reduction of  5 millions in the proposed investment programme of 110 millions of the National Coal Board. He was also prepared tcdefer the building of new electricity generating stations and to offera reduction of  5 millions in investment by gas undertakings. Thesereductions would make an aggregate contribution of the order whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had asked of him. There was,however, a connection between the level of investment in the coalindustry and the confidence of the miners in the long-term future ofthe industry. Bearing in mind that three-quarters of the coalproduced came from pits sunk before 1913, it would be dangerousnot to maintain a satisfactory continuing level of investment in thisindustry. He recognised that a total of  400 millions had beeninvested in the industry since the war and he undertook to circulatea memorandum relating this volume of investment to the recom-mendations in the Reid Report on the re-equipment of the miningindustry.In discussion of the investment programme for electricity it wasagreed that every effort should be made to maintain tne ruralelectrification programme at a satisfactory minimum rate. TheMinister of Agriculture said that he hoped it would be possible in1956 to bring electricity to a minimum of 10,000 farms. TheSecretary of State for Scotland, supporting this view, undertook toexamine the proposed investment of the North of Scotland HydroElectricity Board in rural electrification in the North of Scotland.The Cabinet (5) Approved the proposals of the Minister of Fuel and Powerwith regard to the investment programmes of the NationalCoal Board, the Central Electricity Authority and theGas Council.(6) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to circulate amemorandum on investment in the coal industry since thewar.(7) Agreed that every effort should be made to continue therural electrification programme at a satisfactory minimumrate.(8) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consult withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer on rural electrificationin the North of Scotland and on the investment proposalsof the North of Scotland Hydro Electricity BoardCivil Aviation. The Minister of Transport undertook to consider whatreductions might be made in the proposed investment expenditure ofthe Air Corporations ( 20i millions), including expenditure on theconstruction of airports. He also intended to review the proposedexpenditure of British Overseas Airways Corporation on Americanaircraft.The Cabinet (9) Took note that the Minister of Transport would considerfurther what reduction might be made in the investmentexpenditure of the Air Corporations.49597 3 B 3
6Hospitals. The Minister of Health said that the Report of the GuillebaudCommittee, which would be published on the following day, wouldcomment unfavourably on the fact that capital investment in hospitalshad declined since the war to one-third of the pre-war level, andwould recommend strongly that the pre-war rate of investment shouldbe restored. The Government had given an explicit undertakingthat the current programme, which was the first of its kind since thewar and was confined in effect to a &quot; slum clearance &quot; operation,would be maintained. In any event, if the projects which had alreadybeen begun were to be completed, there would be no opportunity tosave more than  400,000 in the current year.In discussion it was pointed out that capital investment inhospitals had lagged behind investment in other services. It wasagreed that there was an exceptional case for maintaining the existingprogramme to which the Government were pledged, especially as itwould be necessary to announce that, in the present economicsituation, there was no prospect of giving early effect to the largerrecommendations made in the Guillebaud Report.The Cabinet (10) Agreed that there should be no reduction in the currentinvestment programme for the hospitals.Atomic Energy. The Cabinet were informed that the Chairman of the UnitedKingdom Atomic Energy Authority was already reviewing theAuthority&apos;s programme of investment expenditure. It was arguedthat military demands for atomic energy resources and atomicweapons might be imposing a more serious strain on the economythan the development of atomic energy for civilian purposes. It wasagreed that the civil and military programmes should be consideredtogether.The Cabinet (11) Took note that the Chairman of the United KingdomAtomic Energy Authority was reviewing the currentprogramme of expenditure on atomic energy develop-ment; and invited the Minister of Defence to examine,in consultation with him, the relative impact on oureconomic resources of military and civil demands foratomic energy development.Post Office. The Postmaster-General said that, because of some delay instarting projects, prospective investment expenditure for the currentyear would be  92^ millions and not  99 millions. The saving of 8 millions which had been requested could be achieved by keepinginvestment expenditure over the next two years within a total of 182 millions. Although 95 per cent, of this investment would bein telephone services, an expenditure of  5 millions on Post Officebuildings was contemplated in the current year and it would bepossible to postpone a proportion of this. He would examine thisfurther. Meanwhile, he could agree in principle that there shouldbe no increase in investment in 1957 as compared with 1956.The Cabinet (12) Took note that the Postmaster-General would (i) restrainPost Office investment expenditure in 1957 to the level ofexpenditure for 1956, and (ii) would examine further thepossibility of reducing in the current year expenditure onnew Post Office building.Development The President of the Board of Trade said that he fully acceptedAreas the principle that no new commitment should be undertaken for
7CM. 6 (56)GovernmentBuilding.Local AuthorityExpenditure.Housing.factory building in the development areas. But, in order to promotegreater diversification of industry in these areas in the longer term,he would need some freedom of manoeuvre in applying any generalmoratorium. The case for reducing expenditure on factory con-struction in these areas would now be reinforced by the criticalcomments contained in the recent report of the Select Committee onEstimates.In support of the views expressed by the President of the Boardof Trade, it was argued that special local problems of unemploymentin North Wales and in Lanarkshire, and the need to ensure that theNorthern Ireland Development Commission did not pursue a moreexpansionist policy, would make it necessary to exercise somediscretion in applying any standstill arrangements.The Cabinet (13) Agreed in principle that, subject to the points made in theirdiscussion, new commitments for factory building indevelopment areas should not be undertaken for the timebeing.The Minister of Works said that discussions were alreadyproceeding on the means of limiting new building for GovernmentDepartments.The Cabinet (14) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Works.The Minister of Housing said that he accepted in principle theproposal that for a period of six months loan sanction should berefused except for projects which were either in progress or wereexceptionally urgent. But this step, which would bring virtually toa halt the expansion of rural water and sewerage services and wouldentail a reduction in expenditure on water services alone from 60 millions to  38 millions, would be resented by the local authoritiesand it would be necessary to show that a corresponding economy wasbeing enforced in all other fields of local government investment,including such things as allotments, police courts, remand homes,minor roads, &amp;c. Provided he had discretion to admit exceptionalcases it would be possible to refuse loan sanction for six months fornew commitments in miscellaneous services, coast protection anddrainage.The Cabinet (15) Agreed that loan sanction to local authorities should bewithheld for six months for new capital commitments inconnection with general and miscellaneous services.The Minister of Housing said that the local authorities might beprepared to continue their housing programmes even without theassistance of a subsidy. He must enter a reservation, however, onthe proposal foreshadowed in paragraph 33 of CP. (56) 17 thatthere might be some reduction in the subsidies for existing as distinctfrom newly-constructed houses. He welcomed the proposal that aMinisterial Committee should be set up to consider how the RentRestriction Acts might be modified.The Cabinet (16) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the appointmentof a Ministerial Committee to consider the modificationof the Rent Restriction Acts.
8New Towns.Education.Roads.Defence.The view was expressed that investment expenditure in newtowns, particularly in factory building, might well be reduced. TheMinister of Housing said that, although much of this building wasbeing carried out by private enterprise and was not therefore withinthe direct control of the Government, he would consider whatprospects there were of reducing investment expenditure in thedevelopment of new towns.The Cabinet (17) Invited the Minister of Housing to examine the possibilityof reducing or postponing capital investment on thedevelopment of new towns.The Minister of Education said that he could not, consistentlywith the proposals in the forthcoming White Paper on technicaleducation, make any significant reduction in the proposedexpenditure of  9 millions on &quot; further education.&quot; Similarly, itwould not be possible to defer all new rural reorganisation projectswithout seriously disturbing the basis on which the Government&apos;splans for technical education rested. Because of delay in startingprojects it would not be difficult to achieve the proposed reductionof  10 millions in the total programme of education building. Butthis would not in itself reduce the demands on real resources if thereduction were made in such a way as to push the programmeforward into the later part of the financial year. If the reductionwas to make a real contribution towards curbing inflation, he wouldhave to impose a moratorium until 1st April on all new buildingprojects. This he would be ready to do if other Ministers wereprepared to impose a similar delay on their programmes. In hisopinion such a moratorium, applied to the investment programmegenerally, would be the most effective way of yielding immediateresults. A minor reduction might be possible in the expenditureon &quot; Other Education Services.&quot;The Cabinet (18) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Education.The Minister of Transport said that he would be able to effectsome reduction in the proposed expenditure of  6 millions on roads;but, if major projects were to be postponed, it would be necessarythat public opinion, concerned at the death-toll on the roads, shouldbe satisfied by visible evidence that the Government had notabandoned the road programme altogether. He therefore plannedto continue with a programme of minor improvements in roads,particularly at the approaches to the larger towns, and he would putforward proposals which might cover a period of two or three years.He was prepared to postpone as much maintenance and surfacingwork as possible.The Cabinet (19) Invited the Minister of Transport to submit to theChancellor of the Exchequer proposals for reducingexpenditure on roads.The Cabinet considered the proposals relating to home defence(paragraph 29 of CP. (56) 17) and those relating to expenditure onthe Armed Services and defence generally (paragraphs 45-49 ofCP. (56) 17). They agreed that these proposals should be furtherconsidered in relation to each other in order to achieve a balancein the economies to be secured in military and civil expenditurerespectively.   Subject to this the following points were made.As regards home defence, it was agreed in principle that theproposed economies could be effected subject to further consideration
9CM. 6 (56)of the expenditure required in connection with the Observer Corpsand to a further review of the proposed reduction of  4 millionsin expenditure on Post Office constructional work for defencepurposes. The Postmaster-General said that the saving of 2^ millions, for which he had already budgeted, would involve somepayments to contractors in respect of commitments which wouldhave to be abandoned. The Minister of Agriculture said that,provided he could be authorised to incur some relatively smallexpenditure on the stockpiling of emergency food packs, expenditureof-  4| millions on a stockpile of food need not be incurred in thecurrent year.On defence expenditure generally, The Prime Minister said thatthe pressure of defence expenditure on the metal-using andengineering industries had already been examined. It seemed likelythat, because of delay in deliveries, the Air Ministry would not beable to spend the total included in the Estimates for 1956-57, and itwas probable that the actual expenditure of the other Services wouldbe subject to a similar limitation. He therefore suggested that theEstimates for 1956-57 could safely be adjusted to make a largerallowance for under-spending, on the understanding that supple-mentary estimates could be introduced later if it were found that,contrary to expectation, the pace of delivery of weapons andequipment had quickened.The Cabinet (20) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to review, inconsultation with the Minister of Defence and the otherMinisters concerned, the total prospective expenditure ondefence with a view to securing a balance in the economiesto be achieved in military and civil expenditurerespectively.(21) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider what reductionsmight be made in the Service Estimates for 1956-57 inview of the likelihood that some of the weapons andequipment for which provision had been made wouldnot be delivered during the financial year.(22) Approved in principle, subject to the points made in theirdiscussion and to Conclusion (20) above, the proposedreductions in expenditure on home defence.Building. The Cabinet considered the case for reintroducing control overprivate building. The Minister of Works said that fresh legislationwould be necessary for this purpose and there would be keenopposition to the revival of penal powers to enforce a control whoseeffectiveness in present circumstances would be doubtful. Controllimited to individual building projects costing more than  25,000would result in no significant saving in men and materials for sometime to come. If the control, which would in any event take timeto organise, was to be effective, it would have to apply to all contractsexceeding  5,000. The immediate effect of this would be to createserious dislocation in the building industry. Some 15,000 licenceswould be required annually and a staff of 600 would be neededto administer the control. For all these reasons he hoped that itwould not prove necessary to reintroduce control over privatebuilding.The Cabinet (23) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Works.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,24th January, 1956.
