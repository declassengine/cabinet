3CM. 10 (56)Visit of PrimeMinister andForeignSecretary toNorth America.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 8thConclusions,Minute 13.)Washington.1. The Lord Privy Seal welcomed the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary, on behalf of the Cabinet, on their return from theirsuccessful mission to Washington and Ottawa.The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet a summary report of themain points which had emerged in the discussions which he and theForeign Secretary had held with President Eisenhower.On the main questions of policy in Europe there was a completeidentity of view between the two Governments. They were, inparticular, at one in their approach to the German problem; and theUnited States Government would give full support to the claim thatGermany should continue to make a contribution towards the costof British forces in Germany. The discussions had, however, revealedsome difference in the attitude of the two Governments towards thenew projects for economic integration in Europe the proposalsresulting from the Messina Conference and the project for aEuropean Atomic Authority. The United States Governmententertained for these projects an enthusiasm similar to that which theyhad shown towards the European Defence Community: the CanadianGovernment, on the other hand, were much more alive to the risk thatthese associations would lead to the creation of a high-tariff group inEurope.In the Middle East the most urgent need was to compose thedifferences between Israel and the Arab States; and it had been agreedthat the three Governments concerned should reaffirm their intentionto carry out the terms of the Tripartite Declaration. On this pointthe wording of the communique was less forceful that might have beenwished, because of the constitutional limitations on the President&apos;sability to engage United States forces without the prior approval ofCongress. But American warships were in fact proceedingunobtrusively to take up position in the Eastern Mediterranean andthe Red Sea, and British naval forces were conforming with thatmovement. Agreement had also been reached on means of increasingthe effectiveness of General Burns&apos; organisation for detecting breachesof the Armistice conditions.The United States Government had agreed to give their full moralsupport to the Bagdad Pact, though they were not yet able to join it.They had discussed practical means of giving assistance to theindividual members of the Pact e.g., increased facilities for the exportof oil from Persia, further consignments of Centurion tanks for Iraq,more financial aid for Turkey and support for Pakistan&apos;s stand againstencroachment from Afghanistan.As regards Saudi Arabia, the Americans had accepted our viewthat further efforts should be made to divert the excessive oil revenuesto more profitable purposes, and were considering what could be doneto promote investment in roads, hospitals and other aspects of socialdevelopment. They were also considering the sale of obsolete arms tothe Saudis. As regards the dispute over Buraimi they had beenbrought to accept our view that there should be no renewal ofarbitration and that progress could best be made by resumption ofdirect discussions between ourselves and the Saudis. They wouldsupport our efforts to prevent this matter from being brought beforethe Security Council.On policy in the Far East, the differences between the twoGovernments had not been fully bridged. President Eisenhower had,however, shown signs of impatience at the intransigence of ChiangKai-Shek who, despite United States advice, had reinforced his troopsin Quemoy and Matsu. There was, however, no sign of any build-upof the Communist forces arrayed against these off-shore islands andthere seemed to be no immediate reason to fear that a critical situationwould arise in this area. As regards trade with China, PresidentEisenhower had been willing to contemplate some relaxation in thestrategic controls; and there was now some prospect of a change ofpolicy which would benefit the commercial interests of our Colonialterritories in South-East Asia.49599 1b 2
4In the discussion of our common interests in atomic energydevelopment satisfactory progress had been made. PresidentEisenhower had again undertaken to do his utmost to increaseAmerican co-operation in the exchange of atomic intelligence; andhe had made most generous offers of assistance over weapondevelopment and over technical information in respect of our civilprogrammes. These offers were likely to save us large sums of moneyand much time which we should otherwise have had to spend inindependent research.The Foreign Secretary, supplementing the Prime Minister&apos;sreport, said that he had been surprised to find that the United StatesGovernment were ready to take so firm a line over Israel, despite theimportance of the Jewish vote in an election year. They weredetermined to avoid an arms race in the Middle East and, despite thearms deal which the Egyptians had concluded with Czechoslovakia,were resolved that the supply of arms to Israel should be reduced forthe time being to a minimum. The Tripartite Co-ordinatingCommittee were to consider in the following week whether somefighter aircraft should be supplied to Israel, to counter the threat ofthe Russian bombers which were shortly to be delivered to Egypt.The French might then propose that some Mystere fighters should besent to Israel; and it was possible that some American types ofinterceptor aircraft might be supplied; but the present disposition ofthe United States Government was to send as little as possible to Israelat the present time.In discussion the following particular points were raised:  (a) The Prime Minister said that in his discussions withPresident Eisenhower he had not pressed the suggestion that theUnited States Government might maintain a strategic stockpile offood in this country. He had ascertained that the United Statesauthorities would find difficulty in stockpiling canned meat in thiscountry; and, while they might be more willing to stockpile wheat,this would be less attractive from our point of view. The Cabinetagreed that these possibilities might now be further pursued throughthe diplomatic channel.(/;) The Prime Minister said that the United States authoritieswere unwilling to consider at the present time any proposal for theregulation or limitation of nuclear tests. They were satisfied thatthere was no scientific basis for the belief that such tests weredangerous to health. Such risks as were involved were substantiallyless if the bombs were exploded in the air and the Americans hadno intention of making further experiments with ground bursts.Public opinion in the United States was not greatly concerned aboutthe continuance of these tests possibly because the publicity on thisquestion had been handled more skilfully in the United States than inthis country. A full scientific enquiry was now being held into themedical effects of nuclear tests; and, although it would be two yearsbefore this enquiry was concluded, the Americans had undertaken tosend us such medical data as was already available on this subject.When this had come to hand, and when the Medical ResearchCouncil had completed the report on this subject which they had inpreparation, Ministers might consider whether it would be expedientthat the available evidence should be presented to Parliament in aWhite Paper.Ottawa. The Prime Minister said that no special problems had beenthrown up in the course of the talks which he and the ForeignSecretary had held in Ottawa. The Canadian Government were wellcontent with the results of the discussions in Washington. Somecomment had been made on the decrease in the volume of tradebetween the United Kingdom and Canada, and possible means ofreversing this trend had been discussed. Canadian Ministers had alsostressed the advantages of United Kingdom participation in a new
5CM. 10 (56)Wheat Agreement, and they had expressed the hope that, if wethought it likely that we should be unable to participate, we shouldexplain our difficulties at an early stage in the negotiations andindicate whether there was any alternative type of agreement in whichwe might be able to participate.The Cabinet Took note of this report by the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary on the results of their recent mission toWashington and Ottawa.Statement on 2.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence, 1956. Defence (CP. (56) 30) covering a draft of the Statement on Defence,1956.The Minister of Defence said that the basic strategic situation hadnot changed since the previous year&apos;s Statement on Defence had beenpresented. The main purpose of the present Statement was todescribe the way in which our forces were being adapted to meet thissituation. Primary attention must now be given to preparations forcold war and for limited war. It was impossible to make adequatepreparations for global war as well; and, if global war occurred, ourforces would have to fight with what they had.The Cabinet considered the draft Statement, paragraph byparagraph, and agreed on various amendments. In the course of theirdiscussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Defence drew special attention to thestatement, in paragraph 6 of the draft, that nuclear weapons might beused in limited war. The question of &quot; graduated deterrents &quot; waslikely to be discussed when the Statement was debated, and thispassage would be a helpful introduction.(b) It had become the practice to set out every year the role ofeach of the forces. This might become misleading if different wordswere used when no change of meaning was in fact intended. It mightbe preferable in future to avoid this re-statement of the role of theforces.(c) The shortcomings in the supply of aircraft to the Royal AirForce would inevitably attract criticism. The Minister of Defencesaid that he agreed that the position was serious, and he was proposingto examine fully, in consultation with the Minister of Supply and theSecretary of State for Air, what steps were needed to improve it.id) It was for consideration whether the replacement of Sabre byHunter aircraft in the Second Tactical Air Force (which wasmentioned in paragraph 45 of the Statement) should not be sloweddown pending rectification of the defects which limited the firing ofthe guns of the Hunter.(e) In connection with Annex III to the Statement, The Ministerof Defence said that he had been informed that, as a result of detailedTreasury scrutiny, the estimates for defence expenditure by civilDepartments were now to be reduced from  44-72 millions to 43   56 millions. He did not think that a figure lower than  45 millions(to the nearest million) could be defended, bearing in mind that in1955-56 this expenditure had been estimated at  70 millions andwould actually total  50 millions. The Chancellor of the Exchequersaid that he was ready to agree to a total figure of  44   72 millionsprovided that the distribution of that total between the Departmentsreflected the reductions secured by the latest Treasury scrutiny ofDepartmental estimates. He would arrange for the estimate ofexpenditure by the General Post Office to be increased in order tocounterbalance the reductions to be made elsewhere.
6(/) In connection with paragraphs 117 and 118 of the draftStatement the Home Secretary had circulated to the Cabinet amemorandum (CP. (56) 31) dealing with evacuation policy. Thisexplained that the subject had been considered by the MinisterialCommittee on Civil Defence, who had agreed that the country shouldbe divided into evacuation areas, neutral areas and reception areas,that a detailed plan should be prepared for the movement of the&quot; priority classes &quot; from the evacuation areas, and that the definitionof the priority classes should be extended. The Committee had alsoagreed that it would be wrong to make detailed plans for near-totalevacuation of all or some evacuation areas. Opinion in theCommittee was, however, divided on the question whether outlineplans should also be prepared for further measures of evacuation tobe carried out after the movement of the priority classes if time andcircumstances permitted. The Home Secretary suggested that thisissue of policy should be referred to the Defence Committee. Itwould in that case be necessary to omit from the Statement onDefence the sentence shown in square brackets in CP. (56) 30, whichstated that the Government contemplated that after the movement ofpriority classes further measures of evacuation would be carried out,as time and transport allowed.The Home Secretary said that he saw grave difficulty in indicatingthat the Government contemplated further measures after theevacuation of the priority classes. This would be thought to implythat the Government favoured evacuating as many people as possiblefrom the evacuation areas. If this impression were given, it would bedifficult in the event of an emergency to persuade the people in theevacuation areas to remain there until the Government made availablefacilities for their evacuation, and there would be grave danger of adisorganised rush to leave. The priority classes, as redefined,numbered some 11 million people, whereas before the last war planshad been made for evacuating 4 million people, and only 1^ millionhad actually been moved. The Government would be misleading thepublic if they suggested that it would be practicable to evacuate morethan 11 million people from the evacuation areas.Other Ministers argued that it would be difficult for theGovernment to state that no plans would be made for the evacuationof persons not included in the priority classes, bearing in mind thatheavy attacks might be expected on major cities. The demand for theprovision of shelter in the evacuation areas might then become veryhard to resist. The issue could not be avoided: the Governmentwould undoubtedly be pressed to define their intentions about theevacuation of persons other than those in the priority classes.The general opinion of the Cabinet was that the words shown insquare brackets in CP. (56) 30 should not be included. It would bepreferable to emphasise the fact that arrangements for the evacuationof the priority classes must be the Government&apos;s first task. Otherwisethe wording in CP. (56) 30 was suitable, in place of paragraphs 117and 118 of the draft annexed to that paper.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft of the Statement on Defence, 1956,annexed to CP. (56) 30, subject to the amendmentsapproved in their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to determine, inconsultation with the Minister of Defence and the HomeSecretary, the figures for defence expenditure by civilDepartments to be shown in Annex III to the Statement, toa total of  45 millions (to the nearest million).(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister ofSupply, whether the introduction of Hunter aircraft intothe Second Tactical Air Force should be retarded, and toreport on this point to the Prime Minister.
7CM. 10 (56)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that, after consultation with theother Ministers concerned, he proposed that a Government motionon the subject of capital punishment should be tabled in the followingterms:  &quot; That this House is of opinion that, while the death penaltyshould be retained, the law relating to the crime of murder shouldbe amended.&quot;The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for a motion oncapital punishment to be tabled, in the terms set out above,in the names of the Prime Minister and other members of theGovernment.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,10th February, 1956.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM.
