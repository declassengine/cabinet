The informalUnited discussion which they had then held had turned mainly on the MiddleKingdom. East.   The  atmosphere  had  been  fairly  cordial.   The formal(Previous discussions would be opened that afternoon.Reference :CM. (56) 17thConclusions,Minute 8.) --Cyprus.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 25thConclusions,Minute 3.)2 The Lord Privy Seal said that, after his Business Statementin the House of Commons that afternoon, the Labour Oppositionwould ask whether a Joint Parliamentary Delegation could be sentto Cyprus It would be recalled that a similar Delegation had visitedKenya at the height of the disturbances there, and had presented ahelpful report. Subject to the views of the Cabinet, he proposed togive a temporising reply to this suggestion, promising that it wouldhave consideration.In discussion the view was expressed that no advantage couldbe expected to flow from a visit by a Parliamentary Delegation toCyprus at the present time. It was pointed out that, from this pointof view a distinction could properly be made between Kenya andCyprus-&apos; for, while the situation in Kenya had fallen wholly withinthe responsibility of the United Kingdom Government, theconstitutional problem in Cyprus was also of some concern tc theGovernments of Greece and Turkey. This was an argument whichcould be used if the suggestion were pressed.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to avoid giving any encourage-ment in reply to questions in the House of Commons, tothe suggestion that a Joint Parliamentary Delegation mightvisit Cyprus in the near future.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 27thConclusions,Minute 8.)49936 43. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;sdecision of 10th April, he had held some preliminary discussion withthe Ministers directly concerned on the tactics tor handling theCommittee Stage of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill. Heproposed to continue these discussions before the opening of theCommittee Stage on 25th April; and he would submit a furtherreport to the Cabinet, at their meeting on 26th April, in the light ofthe progress made on the first day of the Committee Stage.The Prime Minister said that it would be convenient if theCabinet could review the position again, as proposed, on 26th April.Meanwhile, he hoped, that in the proceedings in the House ofCommons it would be possible to avoid a position in which theGovernment, as such, appeared to be giving definite advice to theHouse to accept or reject particular amendments. The Government&apos;sdifficulties over this Bill would be enhanced if they directly advisedthe House to reject an amendment and it were then carried againstthat advice. The Government spokesman could, as appropriate,express sympathy with the objects of an amendment or explain thedifficulties to which it would give rise; but he should avoid givingdirect advice to accept or reject a particular amendment and shouldleave the decision to be taken by the House on a free vote.b 2
4The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Government spokesmen in the proceedings inthe House of Commons on the Death Penalty (Abolition)Bill on 25th April should be guided by the viewsexpressed by the Prime Minister in the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion.(2) Agreed to resume, on 26th April, their consideration of thetactics to be followed in handling the further stages of thisBill.Export ofArms.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Israel.4. The Foreign Secretary said that the French Government hadasked whether the Mystere aircraft which they were sending to Israelcould be allowed to use Nicosia airport as a diversionary landingground in the event of need, such as shortage of fuel.The Cabinet agreed that this would be in accordance withestablished international practice for helping aircraft in distress, andcould be defended on that basis.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the FrenchGovernment that the Mystere aircraft en route for Israelmight use Nicosia airfield as an emergency landingground.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to inform the Governor ofCyprus of this decision.Singapore. 5.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Colonial(Previous Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (56) 97) on the course to be followedReference: at the forthcoming Conference on constitutional development inCM. (56) 29th Singapore.Conclusions, The Cabinet lirst considered the revised version of paragraphMinute 5.) 15 (vi) of CP. (56) 97, dealing with the future control of internalsecurity, which was set out in Colonial Office Telegram No. 83 toSingapore.  In discussion of this the following points were made:  (a) The Commissioner-General, South-East Asia, the BritishDefence Co-ordinating Committee, Far East, and the Chief Secretaryand the Commissioner of Police in Singapore had expressed theirgeneral agreement with the amended proposals. Certain commentswhich they had offered on points of detail would be consideredfurther by the Colonial Secretary.(b) No reply had yet been received from the Australian andNew Zealand Governments on these amended proposals.(c) The main threat to good government in Singapore was fromCommunist subversion. The British Defence Co-ordinatingCommittee, Far East, had stressed the importance of safeguarding thesecurity of secret intelligence information. It would be undesirable,therefore, that all secret intelligence reports should be discussed inthe Defence and Security Council. A distinction would have to bemade between those reports and any related counter-subversionmeasures which could be brought before the Defence and SecurityCouncil and those which should continue to be handled by theGovernor and the British officials concerned outside the Council.The Cabinet went on to consider what should be said at theConference about the Government&apos;s longer term policy in regard toSingapore.    The Commissioner-General,  South-East  Asia, had
5CM. 30 (56)recommended an early public declaration that, as Singapore was toosmall and too vulnerable to constitute a separate national unit, theultimate goal should be voluntary fusion between Singapore andMalaya when this was freely acceptable to the leaders and peoples ofboth. On the other hand, it seemed too early to say whether sucha fusion would play into the hands of the Communist sympathisersin Singapore who, with the help of the Chinese numerical superiority,might be able to gain control of the whole Federation. It mighttherefore be preferable at this stage for the Colonial Secretary toavoid any final commitment on this point.The Prime Minister said that, as it was uncertain how thenegotiations would develop, the Cabinet could not at this stage takefinal decisions on the extent to which the requests of the SingaporeDelegation might be met. He had therefore arranged for theColonial Secretary to keep in touch with the Lord President, theCommonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Defence, who wouldhold themselves available for consultation as the Conferenceproceeded. The Cabinet would have an opportunity to review theposition at a later stage in the Conference.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the revised proposals for maintainingcontrol over internal security in Singapore which wereset out in Colonial Office Telegram No. 83 to Singapore.(2) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (1) above, the ColonialSecretary should be guided, in the forthcoming discus-sions, by the proposals set out in paragraph 15 of CP.(56) 97.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consult with the LordPresident, the Commonwealth Secretary and theMinister of Defence on the day to day handling of thediscussions and to bring forward any new issues ofimportance for consideration by the Cabinet.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ColonialSecretary (CP. (56) 100) submitting proposals for the resumption oflimited constitutional advance in British Guiana.The Colonial Secretary said that the situation in British Guianahad been brought fully under control. In his view, the time had nowcome to take a limited step towards the restoration of representativegovernment by arranging for elected members to be introduced intothe Legislative Council and the Executive Council. This modestadvance would enable us to retain the initiative: if no such step weretaken, we should probably be forced later to make more substantialconcessions. In the long term the best safeguard would lie in theinclusion of British Guiana in a Caribbean Federation, but she wouldbe unable to join it until some degree of representative governmenthad been restored. Meanwhile, British interests would be fullysafeguarded by the fact that the elected members would not be ina majority in either the Legislative Council or the Executive Council.It was the general view of the Cabinet that this constitutionaladvance should now be made. Every effort should also be made tobring British Guiana into the Carribbean Federation where, as shepossessed undeveloped territories, she would be welcomed by theother members with surplus populations.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 100.BritishGuiana.(PreviousReference :C.C. (54) 71stConclusions,Minute 5.)
6Cancer ofthe Lung.(PreviousReference :C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute 9.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. (56) 99) summarising the most recentevidence on the relation between smoking and cancer of the lungand seeking authority to make a further statement in Parliament onthis subject.The Minister of Health said that deaths from cancer of the lunghad risen from 1,880 in 1931 to over 17,000 in 1955. Since theCabinet had last considered the matter in 1954, further evidence hadbeen collected which established a statistical connection betweensmoking and lung cancer. It was now thought likely that scientificresearch would establish a causal connection between them. HisStanding Medical Advisory Council had recommended that the publicshould be kept constantly informed of the known risks which attachedto excessive smoking and he was being pressed to make a furtherstatement on the matter in Parliament. The statement which heproposed to make was restrained rather than alarmist. It would notsatisfy those who felt that the situation demanded a generalpropaganda campaign, in the schools and elsewhere, against smoking.He considered, however, that this would not be justified in the absenceof direct scientific proof of a causal connection between smoking andlung cancer.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the time had comewhen the Government should determine their attitude to this problemand decide whether or not they should take a definite line on it. Heproposed that a small Committee of Ministers should go more fullyinto the problem and submit their views and recommendations tothe Cabinet.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theview expressed by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of Lord Privy Seal (Chairman).Lord President.Chancellor of the Exchequer.Secretary of State for Scotland.Minister of Healthto consider and report to the Cabinet whether the Govern-ment should take a definite line on the question of smokingas a cause of lung cancer.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,19th April, 1956.
