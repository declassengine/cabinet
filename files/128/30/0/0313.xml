3 CM. 89 (56)Port Said. 1.   The Paymaster-General said that he would circulate on theVisit by following day a full report on the visit which he had made to PortPaymaster- Said in order to investigate the allegations of British atrocities duringGeneral. the occupation of the town.   He was satisfied that the physicaldestruction, which he had viewed both from the ground and fromthe air, was relatively slight, except in a few areas where stiffresistance had had to be overcome. On the other hand, the earlierestimate that no more than 100 to 200 persons had been killed couldprobably not be sustained. It would be impossible to assess thenumber of casualties with complete accuracy, but it seemed likelythat it had amounted to several hundreds.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 88thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in the SuezCanal situation.In the course of a general discussion the following points weremade:  (a) It would be necessary to make a further statement ofGovernment policy in the House of Commons later in the week,after the Cabinet had had an opportunity to discuss the situationwith the Foreign Secretary on his return. Pending this statement,steps should be taken to discourage Government supporters fromstimulating further public controversy about the situation in theMiddle East.(b) It was urgently necessary that we should re-establishsatisfactory political relations with the United States. We shouldhave to announce, early in the following week, the extent of the drainon our reserves of gold and dollars during November; and it wasdesirable that we should have secured by then the support of theUnited States Government for the action which we should need totake to support sterling.(c) There were some indications that the internal position ofthe Egyptian Government might be becoming precarious, and thatthe economic situation in Egypt was deteriorating. We shouldendeavour to ascertain how far such reports were reliable.(d) It was still uncertain whether the Egyptian Governmentwould carry out their threat to expel British subjects from Egypt. Iftheir ability to maintain law and order was failing, there was a seriousrisk that our nationals would be exposed to mob violence. It wasfor consideration, therefore, whether we should endeavour to organisethe evacuation of British subjects through the agency of a neutralPower or, alternatively, whether we should insist, as part of theterms on which the Anglo-French force would be withdrawn fromPort Said, that the Egyptian Government should provide adequateprotection for them.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to endeavourto obtain more precise information about the politicaland economic situation in Egypt.(2) Took note that the Lord Privy Seal would discuss furtherwith the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs what actioncould be taken to ensure protection for British subjectsin Egypt.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion on the following day, onthe return of the Foreign Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,28th November, 1956.
