Europe.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 85thConclusions.Minute 6.)Political andMilitaryAssociation.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (57) 6) of outlining a plan for closer military and politicalassociation between the United Kingdom and Western Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that there was in Europe a propitiousatmosphere for a fresh initiative towards closer co-operation. On theeconomic side we had already taken the lead; and good progresswas being made with the proposals for a common market and a freetrade area. On the Parliamentary side, there would be no difficultyin putting forward a plan for a General Assembly of Europe on thelines indicated in paragraph 25 of his memorandum. There wouldbe some value in replacing the various existing assemblies by a singleGeneral Assembly with a number of functional committees; and theunifying influence of the existing organisations would be enhancedif they could be brought together at a single headquarters with asingle secretariat.The more significant, and possibly more controversial, part ofhis memorandum was that which proposed a closer militaryassociation between the United Kingdom and Western Europe. Itseemed clear that we could not for long sustain the defence burdenwhich we were now carrying; but our international standing wouldsuffer if we sought relief by a unilateral reduction in defenceexpenditure. He had therefore outlined in his memorandum apossible method of sharing our defence burden with our friends inWestern Europe. For this purpose he would prefer to work throughWestern European Union (W.E.U.); for past experience suggestedthat in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.), with itslarge military bureaucracy, we should find less sympathy with ourneed to reduce defence expenditure. We could not hope to developa strength in nuclear weapons comparable to that of the UnitedStates or the Soviet Union; and there seemed little advantage incontinuing alone with the development of the megaton bomb if wehad not the resources to manufacture thereafter an adequate stockpileof these weapons. Might it not be better, in these circumstances,to pool our resources with our European allies so that WesternEurope as a whole might become a third nuclear power comparablewith the United States and the Soviet Union? By this means wemight be able both to reduce our own defence burden and to developwithin N.A.T.O. a group almost as powerful as the United States.A policy on these lines need not imply antagonism towards theUnited States; it might well be developed in co-operation with them.The Lord President said that he had been disturbed by theproposals outlined in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum. Hedoubted whether a policy on these lines could be pursued consistentlywith the maintenance of the Anglo-American alliance which, in hisview, offered the best hope of securing the free world from Sovietaggression. It would be specially unfortunate if an approachtowards a closer military association with Europe were based onproposals for the common development of nuclear weapons. Forit was a main&apos; aim of United States policy to ensure that the capacityto manufacture nuclear weapons was limited to those countries whichalready possessed it. This indeed was the primary purpose of thenew disarmament proposals recently put forward by the UnitedStates Government; and the policy outlined in the Foreign Secretary&apos;smemorandum would run counter to those proposals. For himselfhe could not accept the Foreign Secretary&apos;s assumption (paragraph 4of CP. (57) 6) that it was the nuclear element in our defenceprogramme that would drive us into bankruptcy. But it was certainthat the United States, if their hostility was aroused by our adoptionof a policy on the lines now suggested, could seriously damage ourprogramme of nuclear development, both civil and military. Theyhad the means of preventing us from drawing supplies of uraniumfrom Canada, and they could probably secure two-thirds of what wehoped to obtain from South Africa.
3CM. 3 (57)In paragraph 17 of CP. (57) 6 the Foreign Secretary hadsuggested that the choices open to us were to go on alone at the riskof bankruptcy; to stop short at a point where we should be anuclear power only in name; or to pool research, development andmanufacture of nuclear weapons with our allies in Western Europe.The Lord President said that there was a fourth course namely, tocontinue our co-operation with the United States. This, in hisjudgment, was the better course and one which was more inaccordance with the fundamental basis of our foreign policy. Ourmain aim at the present time should be to repair the breach whichhad been made in Anglo-American relations by the Suez dispute.Finally, the Lord President said that he was even more disturbedby the suggestions on procedure which were outlined in paragraphs28 and 29 of C.P. (57) 6. If, in the light of recent experience overSuez, a plan of this kind were discussed in Europe without priorconsultation with the United States Government, there would begrave risk that the Anglo-American alliance would be finallyundermined. If we were to proceed at all with a policy on theselines, we ought surely to discuss it in the first instance with theUnited States as part of a full and frank review of our defence policy.The Commonwealth Secretary, in supporting the views expressedby the Lord President, said that a policy of the kind outlined inC.P. (57) 6 could not safely be launched without the fullest priorconsultation, not only with the United States, but with the oldermembers of the Commonwealth. Even then, it would involve greatrisks; and he would himself prefer to seek closer co-operation withthe United States and Canada in the development of nuclear powerfor civil and military purposes.The Minister of Defence said that, in general, his sympathies laywith the views expressed by the Lord President. He also saw greatpractical difficulties in the proposals put forward by the ForeignSecretary. It would be between seven and ten years before we wereable to supply our European allies with nuclear weapons. TheUnited States, on the other hand, could supply their needs, if theyso desired, within a year or so. They were therefore in a position tofrustrate this plan if we put it forward without their prior approval.They were unlikely to approve it, since it was their policy thatWestern Europe should remain dependent on the United States forthe supply of nuclear warheads. So long as they held the monopolyof supply, they would be able to keep the issue of these warheadswithin their control. If, however, European countries were invitedto contribute towards the development of these weapons on the linescontemplated by the Foreign Secretary, they would surely expect toown and control their share of the product. To this the United Stateswould presumably be opposed. And were we ourselves prepared tocontemplate German possession of nuclear weapons? Finally theMinister of Defence said that he agreed with the Lord President thatthe cost of the nuclear element of our defence programme should notbe exaggerated. It amounted to little more than 10 per cent, of thetotal and was not in itself a crushing burden.In discussion there was general agreement that a fresh initiativetowards closer European co-operation should not be based onproposals for co-operation in the development of nuclear weapons.Such an approach would tend to array the rest of the world againstour efforts for European unity. It would in particular arouse theantagonism of the United States. And in present circumstances thewhole economy of Europe could be undermined unless the UnitedStates was ready to help to protect the sources of its oil supplies inthe Middle East.On the other hand, strong support was expressed for the generalconcept of a closer association between the United Kingdom andWestern Europe. On this the following arguments were putforward:  (a) The Anglo-American alliance was vital to the security of thefree world; but the Suez crisis had made it plain that there must be51080 2
4some change in the basis of Anglo-American relations. It wasdoubtful whether the United States would now be willing to accordto us alone the special position which we had held as their principalally during the war. We might therefore be better able to influencethem if we were part of an association of Powers which had greaterpolitical, economic and military strength than we alone couldcommand. We ought to be in a position to deal with the UnitedStates Government on equal terms; and, if that position had now to .be founded on economic strength and military power, we must seek 4Jit through a new association with other countries.(b) In external, as well as domestic policy, the Governmentneeded new themes with which to rally their supporters throughoutthe country. The public evidently felt the need for positive policieswhich held out greater hope for the future. There was already asubstantial body of support in the Conservative Party for theconcept of closer association with Europe, and this would be afavourable moment at which to make it a central theme of foreignpolicy.(c) This theme could be developed consistently with themaintenance of the Anglo-American alliance and the cohesion of theCommonwealth. For some time past the United States Governmenthad favoured the idea of European unity. The proposals for acommon market and a free trade area in Europe already had thesympathetic interest of the United States Government and of theolder Commonwealth Governments. f(d) If we took the initiative in pressing this concept and puttingforward practical proposals for giving effect to it, we had theopportunity to seize the political leadership in Europe. Thisopportunity should not be missed.(e) It would be useful if the W.E.U. Powers could operate morecohesively as a group within N.A.T.O. It would certainly bevaluable if a European bloc could emerge within the United Nations.This development might even be welcomed by the United StatesGovernment, who were concerned at the growing influence of theAfro-Asian bloc in the Assembly.(/) While there was certainly scope for rationalising thenumerous international organisations in Europe, it might beinexpedient to take an initiative on this without regard to the progressof the negotiations for a free trade area in Europe. Thosenegotiations were now entering a more difficult phase, and anybargaining cards which we held should be kept in our hands for thetime being.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said thatthere seemed to be general agreement in the Cabinet that the timewas ripe for a fresh initiative towards closer association between theUnited Kingdom and Europe. A good start had been made, on theeconomic side, with the proposals for a common market and for afree trade area in Europe. These might now be supplemented byproposals for a&apos;closer political association and, possibly at a laterstage, a military association between the W.E.U. Powers withinN.A.T.O. It was evident, however, that the Cabinet would preferthat no such approach should be made to any European countrywithout full prior consultation with the United States Governmentand with the Governments of the older Commonwealth countries;and that, in those consultations, no suggestion should be made thatmilitary co-operation between the European Powers should be basedon the common development of nuclear weapons. The Cabinetwould evidently wish to consider at a later stage the extent to whichour political association with Europe could safely be carried: theywould certainly wish that it should stop short of federation. Onprocedure, the first step would be to open full and frank discussionsof this whole question with the United States Government and mthereafter with the Governments of the older Commonwealth  countries. Any detailed plans for developing new militaryassociations in Europe would, however, be concerted with the
5C.M. 3 (57)Minister of Defence before any communication was made to otherGovernments.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to report to the PrimeMinister the broad conclusions which had emerged fromthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of these questions at alater meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,9th January, J 957.
