3CM. 59 (56)Mr. Menzies. 1.   The Prime Minister welcomed the Prime Minister ofAustralia who, in view of the crisis over the Suez Canal, hadabandoned his projected trip to the Far East in order to return toLondon. The Cabinet would be glad of the benefit of his counsel atthis time.Cyprus. 2.   The Cabinet considered two questions of policy concerningDetention of Cyprus.Prisoners. The Colonial Secretary recalled that on 19th June the Cabinet(Previous        had considered a request from the Governor of Cyprus that certainReference:      prisoners who were serving long sentences in Cyprus for offencesCM. (56) 44th  arising out of the emergency should be transferred to prisons in theConclusions,    United Kingdom. It had been felt at that time that it would be unwiseMinute 5.)      to carry out these transfers.   Since then, however, the situation atthe Central Prison at Nicosia had become increasingly difficult andthe Governor was now most anxious to send to this country fifteendangerous terrorists whose continued presence was adversely affectingthe morale of Cypriot warders.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment accepted the need for such a transfer, but asked thatsteps should be taken to ensure that none of the prisoners to beremoved was below the age of seventeen.There was general agreement that, in the interests of public orderin Cyprus, this transfer should now be made with the minimum ofpublicity.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theHome Secretary, to arrange for the transfer of a limitednumber of prisoners from Cyprus to prisons in the UnitedKingdom.Secondary The Cabinet had before them a note by the ParliamentaryEducation in Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (56) 197) setting outCyprus. the latest proposals of the Governor of Cyprus for the control ofsecondary education in the Island.The Colonial Secretary recalled that the Colonial PolicyCommittee had previously been doubtful whether the time was yetopportune for the introduction of the far-reaching programme ofeducational reform which the Governor had originally proposed.Further consideration had since been given to this question, butaction had been deferred pending the completion of Lord Radcliffe&apos;sexploratory visit to the Island. It was now, however, desirable thatarrangements should be made to restart secondary education beforethe next school term began in October. The Governor&apos;s latestproposals involved no formal announcement of a new policy, butwould rest on security grounds. The governing bodies of the fiveGreek community secondary schools which had been closed by theCyprus Government because of indiscipline would be informed thatreopening of the schools must be conditional on the acceptance ofGovernment control regarding staff, discipline, numbers of pupils andfinancial donations. If all members of the governng bodies resigned,it was intended to appoint new governing bodies who would probablybe composed of officials. The same treatment might be accorded toother Greek community schools similarly closed for security reasons,and it was also proposed to proceed with the purchase of a numberof private schools which would be reopened as Government schools.These proposals would not involve control of the curriculum and hethought they would attract the support of many Cypriot parents, evenif the governing bodies refused their co-operation.50384 b 2
4In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In view of the risk that even these modified measures wouldbe represented as a repression of Greek culture, they should be takenin good time before the next opportunity arose for discussion ofCyprus in the United Nations.(b) It would give an unfortunate impression if, in the event of arefusal on the part of the existing governing bodies to co-operate,they had to be replaced entirely by officials. It would be preferablethat local unofficial elements should be represented; and, if thesewere not forthcoming in sufficient numbers, the possibility might beconsidered of a single governing body for a group of schools on themodel already practised in certain parts of the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (2) Subject to the point noted in paragraph (b) above, authorisedthe Colonial Secretary to give effect to the proposalsoutlined in C.P. (56) 197.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements for theforthcoming international conference about the Suez Canal.The Foreign Secretary said the conference would assemble on16th August. All the countries invited would be represented,except Greece and Egypt. The first day would be devoted toapproving the rules of procedure. As the representative of the hostcountry, he would take the Chair at the opening session. It wouldbe for the conference to elect its Chairman for the remaining sessions.It was hoped that the United States Secretary of State wouldintroduce a resolution proposing the establishment of an internationalauthority to be responsible for the control and operation of the SuezCanal. The subsequent proceedings would depend on the degree ofsupport shown by other countries for this resolution. If thereappeared to be a decisive majority in favour of the resolution, an earlyvote would be taken and an approach would then be made to theEgyptian Government. If, however, opinions were more evenlydivided, it might be necessary to arrange for an adjournment to allowfor consultation with Egypt. He hoped this could be avoided.Certain countries might move amendments to the resolution,proposing that the issue should be referred to the United Nationsbefore any action was taken. It would be desirable, therefore, at anearly stage to make some statement about the relation between thenew international authority and the United Nations. He had it inmind that this statement should be in general terms and should refermerely to some link being established which would provide forregistration of the agreement with the United Nations and an annualreport by the authority. If the principle were accepted, the details ofthe relation could be worked out later.In discussion it was agreed that it would be desirable to avoid atthis stage any detailed discussion of the relation between the newinternational authority and the United Nations. The action atpresent being taken by the western Powers could be justified underArticle 33 of the United Nations Charter. Some concern wasexpressed about the proposal of an annual report to the UnitedNations. Experience in the Trusteeship Council suggested that thismight be used by countries not directly concerned with the operationor use of the Suez Canal for criticising the major Powers. Moreover,annual reports would tend to keep the issue alive. It might bepreferable merely to register any agreement with the United Nationsand to avoid annual debates on the Suez Canal. On the other hand,it was pointed out that even without annual reports it would bepossible for any member country to inscribe the Suez Canal issueeach year on the agenda of the General Assembly, so that annual
5CM. 59 (56)debates would still take place, and these would be held in lessfavourable circumstances than if regular reports were beingconsidered by a Committee of the United Nations.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement on the arrangements for the forthcominginternational conference.(2) Agreed that at this stage it would be preferable to go nofurther than to offer that there should be &quot; some link &quot;between the new international authority for the SuezCanal and the United Nations, and that the details of therelation would be worked out later.The Foreign Secretary said that the proposal for an internationalauthority which had been prepared in consultation with theGovernments of the United States and France provided that theauthority should take over the operation of the Canal, ensure itsefficient functioning as a free, open and secure internationalwaterway, arrange for the payment of fair compensation to the SuezCanal Company and ensure to Egypt an equitable return, taking intoaccount all legitimate Egyptian rights and interests. The internationalauthority would consist of a Council of Administration, the membersof which would be nominated by the Powers chiefly interested in theCanal, and the necessary technical, working and administrativeorgans. The old Suez Canal Company could not be restored to itsformer position. There were, however, suggestions either that the oldCompany and Egypt jointly or Egypt alone might constitute the newoperating agency under the international authority. Such anarrangement might be acceptable, if the international authority hadfull powers of control and was not merely an advisory body. TheIndian Government had suggested that Egypt might accept someform of international authority, meeting two or three times a year, towhich questions relating to dues and the technical operation of theCanal might be referred.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that the management andcontrol of the Suez Canal could not be left in the hands of theEgyptian Government. Their territorial sovereignty over the areamight remain, but this would be preserved if the new authority hada perpetual lease of the Canal on the lines of the arrangement inexistence for the Panama Canal. It would also be inadvisable toprovide for any operating agency to be registered as a Company inEgypt, since this would enable a future Egyptian Government torepeat the action which had led to the present crisis.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the proposed new international authority shouldbe fully responsible for the management and control ofthe Suez Canal.The Prime Minister said he had had a discussion that morningwith Leaders of the Opposition, who had asked for Parliament to berecalled and had indicated their opposition to the use of force toimpose on Egypt any conclusion reached by the forthcomingconference. They considered that any international action should beconsidered at a special session of the United Nations and that thenew authority should be set up under that Organisation. They had.however, recognised that if any new incidents occurred, such asinterference with ships using the Canal, a new situation would arisein which force might be justified.The Minister of Labour said the Annual Trades Union Congresswould be meeting on 3rd September. They were likely to pass anemergency resolution on the Suez situation. Under present arrange-ments this resolution would be published on 22nd August.  From a
6discussion he had had with Sir Vincent Tewson, the GeneralSecretary, it was apparent that the Trades Union leaders consideredthat the action being taken by the United Kingdom was not supportedby the other countries mainly concerned. Sir Vincent Tewson hadsaid that there would be difficulty in drafting any resolutionacceptable to the Trades Union Congress which provided for actionoutside the United Nations. The Minister suggested that the PrimeMinister should see the Trades Union leaders and should ask, inparticular, that the publication of any resolution on this subjectshould be deferred until after the international conference. 0In discussion it was suggested that public opinion in this countryhad not fully realised the serious implications of the recent actionby Colonel Nasser. Though there had been initially a reaction infavour of taking firm action against Egypt, the public were nowbecoming increasingly impressed by the difficulties of such a courseand its possible repercussions in other Middle East countries. Itseemed possible that there would be insufficient public support for theuse of force against Egypt unless some new incident occurred. It wastherefore important to impress on the public that, if Colonel Nasserwere allowed to get away with his recent illegal action, the UnitedKingdom&apos;s position in the Middle East would be undermined, withserious consequences to trade and employment in this country.Mr. Menzies stressed the need to educate public opinion,particularly in the wider implications of the present dispute. ColonelNasser&apos;s action followed the pattern of all military dictators and thisaspect should be emphasised. The Australian Government wereunited in their support of the stand taken by the United Kingdom,and he was taking steps to ensure that public opinion in Australiawas fully aware of all the dangers. He believed that Americanopinion was now alive to the risks involved in the present situation.The Cabinet (4) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss the SuezCanal position with the leaders of the Trades UnionCongress.The Cabinet then discussed the action to be taken after theconference to induce Egypt to accept the establishment of a newinternational authority to control and operate the Suez Canal.The Foreign Secretary said that questions were likely to be askedat the international conference about the enforcement of any agreedresolution. At this stage he proposed to say that agreement to theprinciple of an international authority did not necessarily commit anycountry to particular means of enforcement. It was important toavoid giving the impression that the conference had been calledmerely to endorse decisions already taken to employ force againstEgypt.The Prime Minister said that the military precautions taken bythe United Kingdom Government were now being completed and,with a contribution from the French Government, there would beample force available to deal with Egypt. There would, however, bea difficult question of timing, since the United Kingdom forces couldnot be maintained in a state of readiness for any protracted period.In discussion it was suggested that, although it could be arguedthat Colonel Nasser&apos;s seizure of the Suez Canal and his enforcedretention of the employees of the Suez Canal Company justified theuse of force, such action would be unlikely to obtain general supportwithout some further cause being provided by the Egyptian Govern-ment. Financial and economic measures would be unlikely tosucceed unless they were maintained over a long time. In any event 0Colonel Nasser might well receive economic assistance from the
7CM. 59 (56)the Soviet bloc. The effect of any economic sanctions would,however, be greatly increased if the United States were prepared toco-operate. The main objective should be to ensure that it was madeapparent to the Egyptian people that Colonel Nasser&apos;s action hadfailed to fulfil his promises of improving their standard of living. IfColonel Nasser could be discredited in this way in the eyes of his ownand other Arab peoples a reaction might quickly set in.The Prime Minister suggested that, if the conference endorsedthe need for establishing an international authority for the SuezCanal, the countries mainly concerned might agree that, pending theestablishment of an international authority, no further transit duesshould be paid to any Egyptian authority. Colonel Nasser was atpresent getting between 30 and 35 per cent, of the transit dues, mostlyfrom payment by American shipping companies which had alwayspaid their dues in Cairo. Agreement to pay all dues to a blockedaccount with, say, the International Bank pending the establishmentof the new international authority should quickly cause ColonelNasser to lose prestige. If he were to retaliate by stopping shipsfrom using the Canal or by taking action against the employees ofthe Suez Canal Company, a new situation would have arisen whichwould warrant the use of force against Egypt.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain whether otherGovernments would support the line proposed by thePrime Minister for action following the internationalconference.Parliament. 4   The pHme Minister jnformed tne Cabinet that the Ministerswith whom he had been discussing the Suez situation had beeninclined to the view that Parliament should be recalled immediatelyafter the end of the forthcoming international conference. He hadinformed the leaders of the Opposition who had called on him thatmorning that, while no final decision had yet been taken, it was likelythat Parliament would be convened about that time.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Ma,ta&apos; 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Parliamentary(Previous Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (56) 201) setting out aReference: number of points on which Mr. Mintoff, the Maltese Prime Minister,CM. (56) 5lst was at issue with the United Kingdom Government in regard toConclusions, consultation over defence measures, control of the rediffusion serviceMinute 7.)      in Malta and economic affairs.The Colonial Secretary said that steps had now been taken tokeep the Maltese Government generally informed of the precautionarymeasures which were being taken to strengthen our position in theEastern Mediterranean so far as these affected Malta. He hopedthat the difficulties which had arisen over the rediffusion service inthe Island could be settled. A more serious problem was that of theIsland&apos;s economic needs, and here the main issue was that of thecomposition and terms of reference of the proposed EconomicCommission to investigate the level of United Kingdom assistancerequired. He himself was more concerned to make sure that thestrongest possible Commission was appointed: he feared that, if werefused to make concessions to the Maltese Government&apos;s wishesI regarding the terms of reference, Mr. Mintoff would refuse toco-operate with the Commission.
8The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that he had taken theinstructions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this matter and itwas the Treasury&apos;s view that Mr. Mintoff&apos;s draft terms of referencecould not be accepted.There was general agreement that it was important at the presentjuncture to avoid, if possible, a serious breach with the Governmentof Malta. Our views on the terms of reference and membership ofthe Economic Commission should be clarified at once with this inmind, with a view to the despatch of an immediate reply to the Maltese^Government. ^The Cabinet fnvited the Colonial Secretary to consult forthwith with theFinancial Secretary, Treasury, with a view to making knownto the Maltese Government the views of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding the composition and terms ofreference of the Economic Commission.Syrian Oil 6.   The Cabinet were informed that the Government of SyriaRefinery. were proposing to build an oil refinery, for whose construction theywere considering tenders from firms both from the West and fromcountries of the Soviet bloc. There was a good chance of the contractbeing awarded to an Anglo-American firm against Czechoslovakcompetition if the United Kingdom Government were prepared togive substantial assistance by means of a  2 million loan and aguarantee of up to  | million if the cost of the refinery should exceedthe firm&apos;s estimate.In discussion stress was laid on the political and economicdisadvantages of surrendering this contract to a firm in the Soviet bloc.Against this, it was argued that there could be no justification for theGovernments of the United Kingdom or the United States involvingthemselves in financial competition with countries in the Soviet bloc.The firm concerned, Procon (Great Britain) Ltd., might yet beawarded the contract by reason of its better delivery date andtechnical performance.The Cabinet Agreed that no subsidy should be offered to Procon (GreatBritain) Ltd., in connection with the contract for theconstruction of an oil refinery in Syria.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,14th August, 1956.#
