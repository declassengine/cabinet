3C.M. 1 (57)Jordan.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 97thConclusions.Minute 2.)*1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of Jordanhad announced their desire to terminate the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of1948. This treaty was no longer of any significant strategic value tous as a support for our interests in the Middle East. But the CrownPrince and the Prime Minister of Iraq had urged us to take noinitiative for the time being to terminate the treaty, and to defer adecision pending the visit of the Crown Prince to London towards theend of the month. The Law Officers had advised (in a memorandumannexed to C.P. (57) 1) that it was not open to us to abrogate thetreaty unilaterally. Nevertheless, it was important that we shouldforestall the possibility that the Jordan Government would themselvesdenounce the treaty by taking some step to disengage ourselves fromits obligations by agreement. He therefore recommended that, indeference to the view of the Iraqi Government, we should not informthe Jordan Government categorically that the treaty was no longer ofvalue to us, but should say that, in the light of their public statements,we had no wish to maintain a treaty which had apparently becomeonerous to them and might therefore impair the preservation of thelong-standing friendship between the two countries. He wouldpropose to seek the support of the Iraqi Government for a modifiedapproach on these lines.The following points were made in discussion (a) Although it was not impossible that the United StatesGovernment would be prepared to assume some degree ofresponsibility for supporting Jordan financially once the Anglo-Jordan Treaty had been brought to an end, they would expect us toreach our own decision on the future of the treaty, and would be liableto react adversely to any attempt to consult them formally or toinvolve them in a joint policy towards Jordan. On the other hand itwould be premature to sever our connection with Jordan without anyassurance of the extent to which the United States would be preparedto take over our responsibilities.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Jordan&apos;s foreignexchange reserves, amounting to some  25 millions, were held insterling, including  13 millions representing currency cover; somethree-quarters of her foreign exchange earnings of  19 millions werealso received in sterling. If the United States were to assume majorresponsibility for supporting the economy of Jordan, the externalfinances of the country would be brought progressively on to a dollarbasis. Jordan might then leave the sterling area, asking us at the sametime to convert her reserves into dollars, and this might provokesimilar claims from Iraq and the oil Sheikhdoms, where the sterlingbalances involved amounted to over  300 millions. The wiser coursemight therefore be to arrange, if possible, that financial support forJordan would be shared between the United States and ourselves ona basis which would preserve the sterling basis of Jordan&apos;s trade andthe sterling backing of her currency.(c) The financial assistance which we afforded to Jordanamounted to some  13 millions annually, of which about  10 millionswas attributable to defence and  3 millions to development projects.If we now withheld the instalment of aid due for January, amountingto  600,000, the Jordan Government might be provoked to denouncethe treaty forthwith. If, therefore, we intended to seek to secure theco-operation of the United States Government in supporting Jordanhenceforward, it would be necessary to pay the instalment of subsidyfor January. Similarly, we were committed to contribute  250,000 tothe development of a desert road scheme. On the other hand, apromise given at the end of 1955 to provide an interest-free loan of 2-1 millions for development did not represent a binding under-taking. Whatever payments we made should be used to obtain, ifpossible, some improvement in the public attitude of the JordanGovernment towards this country.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.51080 1b 2
4(d) We had stores and equipment to a value of  4 millions inJordan. These could be used elsewhere, and the terms of thetreaty allowed us to take them out of the country. The sum of 4 millions which had been spent on fixed installations, however,could not be recovered in this way.It was the view of the Cabinet that the balance of advantage layagainst taking an initiative to terminate the treaty until the UnitedStates Government had been informed of the policy which weproposed to adopt and had been given an opportunity to considerfuture arrangements for the financial support of Jordan in the lightof the importance which we attached to her remaining a member ofthe sterling area. In any event it was desirable that no final decisionregarding the future of the treaty should be taken until the matterhad been considered in the context of our Middle East policy as awhole. The instalment of subsidy due for January should be paid inthe normal way; but the Jordan Government should be informed thatthey must expect any further payment of the subsidy to be contingenton some improvement in their attitude. Meanwhile, the gradualremoval of our military stores in Jordan should be put in hand,although this operation would have to be conducted discreetly. Whilethe major part of these stores would be of most use outside the MiddleEast, it would contribute to the maintenance of good relations withthe Iraqi Government if some proportion of them could betransferred to that country.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to instruct H.M. Ambassa-dor at Washington to ascertain the reaction of the UnitedStates Government to the policy which we proposed toadopt, in regard to the Anglo-Jordan Treaty, including thesuggestion that future financial support of Jordan mightbe shared between the United States and ourselveson a basis which would not prevent Jordan fromremaining a member of the sterling area.(2) Agreed that the instalment of subsidy due to Jordan forJanuary should be paid in the normal way, and that thesum of  250,000 which had been committed for roaddevelopment should similarly be paid to Jordan as itbecame due.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to arrange for the unobtrusive removalof military stores from Jordan.(4) Agreed that no immediate initiative should be taken to bringthe Anglo-Jordan Treaty to an end, but that a decision onthis question should be deferred until it could beconsidered in the context of our Middle East policy as awhole, together with the outcome of the consultations con-templated in Conclusion (1) above.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 104thConclusions.Minute 1.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that we had now, withconsiderable difficulty, secured agreement with the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations on the use of our salvage ships in Port Saidon terms which, as regards the security and amenity of their crews,were not unreasonable. On the other hand it was clear from theestimate of the time required for the clearance of the remainder ofthe Canal which had been given by General Wheeler, the UnitedNations officer in charge of the salvage operation, that he did notintend to use our vessels below Port Said. It was for considerationwhether, in view of this breach of the understanding which weregarded ourselves as having reached with the Secretary-General,
5CM. 1 (57)we should now withdraw our ships. Their withdrawal would beliable to be misunderstood by public opinion; and there were certainother advantages in our leaving them where they were, even thoughtheir functions would be confined to completing the clearance ofPort Said itself. But we should certainly renew our pressure on theSecretary-General to secure their employment in the clearance of theremainder of the Canal.In discussion there was general agreement that public opinionwould not easily accept the marked discrepancy between the originalpromise of the Secretary-General that the method of clearance ofthe Canal would be determined by purely technical considerationsand the present discrimination by General Wheeler against the useof our salvage vessels. The fact that the Firdan Bridge had to beraised before any further substantial clearance could be undertakenmight admittedly be a technical obstacle to the employment of ourships for the time being. But this should not preclude the Secretary-General and General Wheeler from planning their subsequent usein the Canal; and the real obstacle appeared to be the unwillingnessof the United Nations to proceed more rapidly, and by any othermethods, than the Egyptian Government agreed. A further andvigorous approach should therefore be made to the Secretary-General ; and, if this failed, it might be necessary to inform Parliamentand the public that we should regard the United Nations asresponsible for the consequences. Moreover, when it becamenecessary to apportion financial liability for the clearance of theCanal, this apportionment would presumably be made on the basisof the proportions normally adopted by the United Nations. Theexpense which we had already incurred in salvage operations shouldbe credited against our share of the liability; and the refusal ofGeneral Wheeler to employ our ships south of Port Said would bea factor to be taken into account.In further discussion it was suggested that the approach to theSecretary-General should be reinforced by a parallel approach tothe United States Government. They should be warned that theadditional delay in the clearance of the Canal resulting from failureto employ our ships would entail the risk of a serious setback to ourindustrial production, and that we were not convinced that GeneralWheeler was either willing or able to ensure that the operation ofclearance proceeded with the maximum of technical speed.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the FirstLord of the Admiralty, to arrange for a fresh approach tobe made to the Secretary-General of the United Nationsabout the employment of British vessels in the furtherclearance of the Canal, and to consider how the supportof the United States Government for this approach mightbest be secured.Economic 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that figures to beSituation. published that day would show a further substantial loss to the(Previous reserves for December, after excluding from the calculations theReference: special drawings which had been made on the International MonetaryCM. (56) 104th Fund (I.M.F.). The loss had been swollen by the settlement of theConclusions, large November deficit with the European Payments Union; it alsoMinute 5.) &apos; included payments into an escrow account to cover the sums dueon the United States and Canadian loans. The obligations whichhad been responsible for this further serious fall in the reserves had
6all accrued in the early part of December: the reserves had been heldin reasonably stable balance for the second half of the month.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.4. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had originallyestimated that, with the aid of supplies from the United States, wecould rely on receiving some 75 per cent, of our normal requirementsof oil. This estimate had, however, assumed a certain increase inUnited States production, which, as a result of the latest decisionof the Texas Railroad Commission about the level of productionby the Texas oil companies, might not be achieved. Supplies of fueloil for industry could probably be maintained at the current levelduring January and February. But, short of some increase in pricewhich might secure the release of stocks in the U.S.A., prospectsfor March were more doubtful, and industry should be warnedaccordingly as early as possible. Moreover, some further demandon Admiralty stocks of fuel oil would probably become unavoidablein March.In discussion it was pointed out that the use of strategic stocksof oil to supplement civil supplies was at present under discussionin the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and that there was somerisk that, if we tried to supplement our supplies by drawing onAdmiralty stocks, we might prejudice the allocation to be made tous by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation fromthe total supplies available to Europe. Further thought mighttherefore need to be given to the use of Admiralty stocks in the lightof the discussions which were due to take place in both Organisationsin the next few days. Considerable reserves of Admiralty fuel oilwere also held in Ceylon. But in terms of the tankers required totransport them to this country, they could not be regarded as aneconomic source of supply.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume, at a subsequent meeting, their discussionof the prospects for supplies of oil.Road Transport The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport saidVehicles. that the protests about the allocation of oil to road transport vehiclesdid not reflect any failure of the original plan. That plan had been,from the outset, a discriminatory one, designed to favour goods which ,could not be carried by rail at the expense of goods which weresuitable for rail transport. Industry had so far made little effort todivert goods traffic to the railways, and nothing should be done torelieve the pressure for this diversion.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he now felt able, asregards diesel oil, to mitigate the reduction of 25 per cent, to one of17^ per cent. This mitigation should not, however, be publiclyannounced, in order not to reduce the incentive to industry to diverttraffic to the railways.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While there should be no relaxation of the general principlesof allocation, steps should be taken to explain those principles more ^clearly to the interests affected, in order to enable them to appreciate  that allocations must be determined by the national interest and notby reference to previous levels of consumption.Oil.Supplies.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 85thConclusions,Minute 4.)
7CM. 1 (57)(b) The Banks should be asked to show consideration forsmaller businesses which were in severe financial embarrassment.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofTransport (Mr. Moison) to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Fuel and Power, how to secure amongthe interests affected a clearer understanding of theprinciples of allocation of oil to road transport vehicles.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whatsteps might be taken to ensure that the Banks dealtsympathetically with small businesses in severe financialembarrassment as a result of the restrictions on the useof oil.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,3rd January, 1957.
