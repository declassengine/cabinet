CM. 14 (56)EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 13thConclusions,W  Minute 2.)*The Cabinet continued their discussion of the proposals putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (56) 32 forreducing the inflationary pressure in the national economy.The Chancellor of rhe Exchequer said that he had again reviewedhis proposals in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the previousday. It had then been suggested that he might feel justified inpostponing the proposed changes in the food subsidies if he couldfind other means of supplementing his measures for reducing theinflationary pressure in the economy. He had come to the conclusionthat there was one further measure which he could take in conformitywith his general policy for reducing expenditure on investment. Hecould suspend the taxation allowances in respect of investment. Ifthis proposal were approved, he could indicate in his statement thatno investment allowances would be given in respect of capitalexpenditure payable after that date, though such expenditure wouldqualify for the rate of initial allowance in force in 1953. Effect wouldbe given to this change in the Finance Bill.The Chancellor said that, if the Cabinet approved this proposal,he would be readv to agree that the reduction of the food subsidiesshould be made progressively, as opportunity offered to take suchaction consistently with the Government&apos;s general policy of preservingstability in prices. As a first step the price of bread would at once beincreased by \d. on the l\d. loaf, and the price of milk would beincreased by \d. a pint from 1st July. These two changes vouldproduce savings to the Exchequer at the rate of  38 millions a year.They would involve an increase of about 1 point in the cost-of-livingindex. There was, however, good reason to hope that this increasemight be offset by a downward trend in other items in the cost-of-livingindex. Thus, the changes in food subsidies to be made over the nextfour months would be consistent with the Government&apos;s aim ofsecuring a period of reasonable stability in prices.The Cabinet first discussed the proposed suspension of theinvestment allowances.The Lord Privy Seal recalled that these allowances had beenintroduced in the Budget of 1954. They had then been justified byreference to the inadequate level of investment by private industryin this country. The point had been made in the Budget statementthat the rate of industrial modernisation in the United Kingdom wasstrikingly less than that in the United States and probably less thanthat in Germany; and that British industry could not be expectedto hold its own against these competitors in export markets unlessit took steps to modernise its plant and equipment. There could beno doubt that this concession had been fully justified by our industrialneeds, and its withdrawal must be regarded as a retrograde step.While therefore he recognised that the suspension of these allowanceswas consistent with the Chancellor&apos;s plans for discouraginginvestment, he deployed the necessity for adopting this course.In discussion it was pointed that the withdrawal of theseallowances would bear with special severity on the shipbuildingindustry. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would beready to consider how far investment allowances could continue to begiven in respect of capital expenditure on the construction of ships.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion then turned on the terms in which theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to announce the changes inthe food subsidies. It was suggested that it might suffice to announcethe proposed increase in the price of bread but to leave the increasein the price of milk to be governed by the statement that the subsidieswould be progressively reduced as opportunity offered. As againstthis The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the increase in milkprices was unlikely to provoke fresh wage demands, and that it* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.
4was important that he should be able to bring into account in thepresent statement the saving of  20 millions a year which would besecured by this change.In further discussion the question was raised whether theChancellor&apos;s latest proposals, with the inclusion of the action proposedin respect of investment allowances and the food subsidies, might not 0.produce a disinflationary effect greater than that which the situationrequired. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was fullysatisfied that the measures proposed would not be excessive. If,however, it should appear in a few months&apos; time that theirdisinflationary effect was greater than he had estimated, the pressurecould be relaxed without difficulty or delay.The Cabinet next discussed the timing of the proposed announce-ment in Parliament. The decision to increase the Bank rate would betaken by the Bank of England at the meeting of their Court on16th February. The announcement of the other disinflationarymeasures which the Government proposed to take should follow assoon as possible thereafter. From this point of view it would havebeen preferable for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to have made hisstatement on 16th February. This, however, would delay thecommencement of the debate on capital punishment and was for thatreason unlikely to be acceptable either to the Opposition or toGovernment supporters in the House of Commons. On the otherhand it was undesirable that the statement should be deferred untilthe opening of the debate on economic affairs in the following week.The Opposition would wish to have in advance of the debate someindication of the proposals which the Chancellor proposed to putforward.After further discussion it was agreed that the best course wouldbe for the Lord Privy Seal to announce on 16th February that theGovernment were proposing to introduce further disinflationarymeasures in support of the action of the Bank of England in raisingthe Bank rate, that these would be debated in the House of Commonson 20th and 21st February, and that for the convenience of the Housethe Chancellor of the Exchequer would make a statement on17th February outlining the further measures which the Governmentproposed to introduce.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Chancellor of theExchequer in CP. (56) 32 for reducing the inflationarypressure in the national economy subject to (i) the resultsof the further discussion which the Chancellor of theExchequer had undertaken on 10th February to hold withthe Minister of Health on the proposed reduction ofexpenditure on old people&apos;s homes (CM. (56) 11th Conclu-sions, Minute 1, Conclusion (1)); (ii) the modificationapproved on 10th February in the form of the announce-ment of the change in the school-building programme(CM. (56) 11th Conclusions, Minute 1, Conclusions (2)and (3)); (iii) the addition of the proposal outlined abovefor the suspension of taxation allowances in respect ofinvestment and (iv) the modification summarised aboveof the proposed changes in the food subsidies.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announcethese proposals in a statement to be made in the Houseof Commons on 17th February.(3) Took note that the Chancellor&apos;s statement would be debatedin the House of Commons on 20th and 21st February.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,18th February, 1956.
