3CM. 39 (56)Cyprus.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 38lhConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Prime Minister said that the Governor of Cyprus hadreturned to London for consultation and was attending meetingsof the Colonial Policy Committee at which the course of futurepolicy in Cyprus was under review. The results of these consultationswould be reported in due course to the Cabinet. Meanwhile, hewas concerned at the trend of public opinion on this question, bothin this country and in the United States, and he suggested that theColonial Secretary should consider urgently what steps could betaken to correct the misapprehensions which seemed to be gainingground. The Government should at least try to ensure that publicdiscussion of this problem took account of some of the main facts,such as the extent of Turkish interest in the matter. Furtherexplanations of the Government&apos;s policy might with advantage begiven to groups of Government supporters in the House of Commons.Ministers might be asked to emphasise the essential facts of theproblem in speeches in the country. Factual information might beput out from the Central Office of Information. And, in the UnitedStates, suitable information might be made available to the Pressthrough the British Information Services.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider what further stepsshould be taken, along the lines suggested by the PrimeMinister, to influence the course of public discussion, inthis country and in the United States, on the Cyprusproblem.BritishSomaliland.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. At their meeting on 15th May the Cabinet had asked theForeign Secretary to consider what prospects there were of securingan extension of Italian trusteeship for Somalia. They now hadbefore them a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C.P. (56) 130)reporting the results of his further consideration of this question.The Foreign Secretary said that he was satisfied that there wasno prospect of securing agreement to an extension of this trusteeship.Neither the Italians nor the Somahs desired it, and it would beopposed by a substantial majority in the United Nations.The Cabinet Accepted the Foreign Secretary&apos;s conclusion that it wouldnot be practicable to secure an extension of Italiantrusteeship for Somalia.NuclearWeapons.Tests in 1957.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 13.)500233. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (C P (56) 131) on the proposal that an early announcementshould be made of the Government&apos;s decision to hold tests ofthermo-nuclear weapons in the Pacific in the spring of 1957. Thememorandum discussed the form and timing of the proposedannouncement in relation to the forthcoming publication of thereport of the Committee of the Medical Research Council whichhad been examining the hazards to man of nuclear and alliedradiations. This report, which was to be issued simultaneously withthe report of a similar enquiry in the United States, was due to bepublished on 12th June.The Cabinet first considered whether the announcement of theforthcoming tests could not be deferred until after the publicationof the Committee&apos;s report. In favour of this course it was arguedthat, if the announcement were made a week before the publicationof the report, the Government would be open to the criticism thatthey had deliberately chosen to deprive Parliament of the opportunityb 2
to use, against the holding of the tests, such arguments as could befounded on the report. It was also pointed out that the Committee&apos;sconclusions were, on the whole, reassuring: they had found that thegenetic effects of thermo-nuclear tests were insignificant and thatthe risk arising from the accumulation of strontium in human boneswould not become serious unless tests continued at their recent levelfor a period of several decades. The Government would thereforebe able to argue, if the announcement was postponed, that therewas nothing in the report to substantiate a claim that the holding ofthese particular tests would significantly increase the hazards ofradiation to human life. On the other side, it was argued that anyfurther postponement of the announcement would have embarrassingresults. Concealment of the preparations was becoming increasinglydifficult. Our plans were already fairly widely known andinformation about them might at any time be made public. Apetition deprecating the tests had already been forwarded to theUnited Nations from Western Samoa. Moreover, while theCommittee&apos;s conclusions were more reassuring than might have beenfeared, the report was likely to provoke much public discussion;and, if their decision to hold these tests had not already beenannounced, the Government would be urged to postpone a decisionuntil Parliament had had time to consider, and possibly to debate,the Committee&apos;s findings.On this part of the problem the Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was thatthe balance of advantage lay on the side of making the proposedannouncement of the tests before the publication of the report ofthe Committee of the Medical Research Council.Discussion then turned on the terms of the proposed announce-ment. It was recognised that, from the point of view of allayinganxiety and gaining the political initiative in this country, there wouldbe advantage in including a definite statement (on the lines of thesecond paragraph of the draft in Annex II of CP. (56) 131) thatthe United Kingdom Government had decided to ask the otherGovernments concerned to join with them in a further attempt todevise means of ensuring that test explosions would henceforwardbe limited and under effective control. On the other hand, it wasknown that the United States Government would not welcome sucha statement at a time when they were themselves carrying out aseries of nuclear tests. The Foreign Secretary said that, in thesecircumstances, he had been wondering whether it would not bepreferable to re-cast the second paragraph of the present draft interms of an offer to consider with the United States Governmentthe findings of the Committee of the Medical Research Council andthose of the corresponding American committee and to discuss withother Powers any measures for control and limitation of tests whichthese reports might indicate to be desirable. If our statement tookthat form, it might be possible for the United States Governmentto avoid taking any public line on this question until after thePresidential Election.In discussion it was pointed out that the alternative proposedby the Foreign Secretary was open to the objection that it involvedmaking a reference to the Committee&apos;s report before it had beenpublished. While it might become necessary to admit that theGovernment had received and considered the report, it would bepreferable that such a statement should not be volunteered. For, ifthe Government took the initiative in mentioning the report, it wouldbe more difficult to rebut the criticism that the announcement shouldhave been deferred until the text of the report was available toParliament.The Prime Minister said that he was still disposed to favour astatement on the lines of the second paragraph of the original draft though he suggested that the final sentence of that draft should beamended to read: &quot; They would themselves be willing to discussthis matter of limitation and control either as part of a scheme of
5CM. 39 (56)general disarmament or on its own merits.&quot; He suggested that theForeign Secretary and the Lord President should consider whetherit would be possible, while retaining the substance of this draft, toamend the wording in such a way as to make it more acceptable tothe United States authorities. On points of presentation, he wasready to consider American susceptibilities; but he was not preparedto refrain from making it clear at this stage that the United KingdomGovernment favoured the holding of discussions, between the Powersconcerned, on the means of securing some limitation of testexplosions.In further discussion the following points were also raised :-(a) In the interests of Anglo-American co-operation in atomicdevelopment it would be convenient if copies of the report of theSSSHedical Research Council could be shown to thestate authorldes in advance of publication. On the otherhand thi report was to be laid before Parliament as a CommandPane; and it St be regarded as a bieach of Parliamentary privilege^SfSAt^ Unf d Stat.

(54) 79thConclusions.Minute 4.)Attendance ofM.P.s at 1956Tests.4. The Cabinet were informed that ten Australian Membersof Parliament were to attend the tests of atomic weapons which weredue to take place in 1956 at Maralinga in Australia. The suggestionwas likely to be made that facilities should also be given for Membersof the United Kingdom Parliament to attend the tests; and thissuggestion would be supported by the argument that these weretests of United Kingdom weapons financed and carried out by theUnited Kingdom. On the other hand, only a very small numberof visitors could be accommodated at Maralinga without jeopardisingthe success of the operation, and it was undesirable that Membersshould be encouraged to think that they ought to be representedat nuclear tests. The attendance of Australian Members could bejustified on the ground that Australian public opinion needed to be
6reassured about the risks of radio-active fall-out from atomic testscarried out in their country. They would not receive any morefavourable treatment than the newspaper correspondents who wouldbe present.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would propose to announce,in reply to any Questions or enquiries on this subject, that physicalconsiderations would make it impossible to provide facilities for anyorganised party of Members of Parliament to witness the tests, butthat any Members who might wish to attend in their private capacitywould be given the same facilities as would be accorded to newspapercorrespondents.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in theterms which he had outlined on the question of providingfacilities for Members of Parliament to witness theforthcoming tests of atomic weapons in Australia.Sa,e  f 5.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the SpanishWarships to Government had made enquiries about the possibility of their buyingSpain. three British cruisers and ten destroyers. These ships were at presentheld in the unmaintained reserve, but their value for sale would beabout  7^ millions. It was in our strategic interest that the Spaniardsshould equip their Navy with British vessels, and the naval connectionso established would provide a basis for further orders for spareparts and replacements and for continuing technical exchanges. Hedoubted whether a definite order for as many as thirteen vesselswould in fact mature, but he sought authority to pursue the matter.Each specific transaction would be submitted to the DefenceCommittee for approval.The Cabinet were informed that the Governor of Gibraltar sawpositive advantage in encouraging the sale of British warships toSpain.The Cabinet Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to enter intonegotiations for the sale to Spain of a number of cruisersand destroyers now held in unmaintained reserve.industrial 6.   The Minister of Labour said that representatives of the tenDisputes.        unions concerned in the current dispute at the Coventry works ofStandard Motor the Standard Motor Company would be meeting at York on theCompany.       following day.   Among the employees themselves there was little(Previous        support for a strike and, in spite of the militant attitude of theReference:      representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, it nowCM. (56) 35th   seemed less likely that a strike would be called. It was more probableConclusions,    that the meeting at York would declare a dispute to exist and formallyMinute 5.)       invite him to intervene.  He saw, however, no satisfactory basis forintervening: he would certainly not be prepared to ask the Companyto continue to employ men who had become redundant owing to afall in the demand for the Company&apos;s products in the home market.About 500 of the firm&apos;s employees had registered with the employ-ment exchange which his Department had opened at the works.Engineering firms elsewhere in the country were seeking the servicesof these men.   Fifty had already been placed in alternativeemployment, and more could be expected to register if there wasno decision to strike.
7CM. 39 (56)In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Redundancy must be expected in the motor industry as aconsequence of credit restriction. Greater mobility of labour wasdesirable in the national interest, and redundant workers should beencouraged to seek alternative employment.(b) The recent decision of the National Insurance Commissionerthat unemployment benefit could be paid for short-time workingwould discourage the mobility of labour. It seemed likely, however,that this ruling could not be modified without legislation. This couldpresent difficulty.The Cabinet Took note of the statement made by the Minister of Labourand of the points made in the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,5th June, 1956.
