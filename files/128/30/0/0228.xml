3CM. 4 (56)Cost of Living.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 10.)1. The Cabinet were informed that the Index of Retail Pricesfor December, which was due to be published that afternoon,remained unchanged from the previous month at a figure of 154points and that, in spite of seasonal increases in the prices ofpotatoes and apples, the average level of food prices was likely toremain stable over the next few months.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Sale of SurplusWar Materials.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a draft of the proposed WhitePaper on the export of surplus war materials.The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to a number of amendmentswhich it was proposed to make in this draft. Most of these wereapproved in the course of discussion. It was, however, agreed thatfurther consideration should be given to two: (i) a proposal toinclude, in paragraph 8 of the draft, a reference to a recent decisionof the War Office that gun barrels should be cut before sale; and (ii)a proposal to include, in paragraph 15 and in a revised text ofparagraph 20, an admission that the Export Licensing Branch of theBoard of Trade had failed to observe that the French import licencesin respect of a number of Sherman tanks bore an endorsementindicating that they were destined for re-export.The Cabinet were informed that the White Paper would bepublished on 19th January and would be discussed in the House ofCommons on 24th January on a motion for the Adjournment. Theyagreed that the Minister of Defence should open this debate, andthat the reply to the debate should be made either by the Minister ofSupply or by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting).The choice of the final speaker could be deferred for a time, but itwas likely to be more appropriate that the final speech for theGovernment should be made by a Foreign Office Minister.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defenceto consider further, in consultation with the President ofthe Board of Trade, the two points noted at (i) and (ii)above.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the preparationof a revised version of the White Paper incorporating thevarious amendments noted in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion andany further amendments resulting from Conclusion (1)above.(3) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary and the Minister ofDefence should jointly present the White Paper, as sorevised, to Parliament on 19th January.(4) Agreed that the Government spokesmen in the debate in theHouse of Commons on 24th January should be theMinister of Defence and either the Minister of Supply orthe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting).Malaya.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 25thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Colonial Secretary(CP. (56) 12) covering a memorandum outlining the policy to bepursued at the forthcoming Conference on constitutional advance inMalaya.The Colonial Secretary said that the main lines of the policywhich he proposed to follow had alreadv been approved by theColonial Policy Committee.   There were three particular points to49597 1 b 2
4which he wished to draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention. As regards internalsecurity, he expected the Malayan leaders to press that the localGovernment should have administrative control over the localmilitary forces, as well as the police, operational control remainingwith the Director of Operations. The High Commissioner and hisadvisers had recommended that this request should be granted,subject to an undertaking that residual control over internal securityand control over security intelligence would continue to rest with theHigh Commissioner until the end of the present emergency. Inaddition, until full self-government was attained, the High Commis-sioner would have authority under his existing powers to reject theadvice of local Ministers on questions of internal security.As regards defence, it had been felt that we should be in astronger position at this stage, than when full self-government wasabout to come into effect, to obtain guarantees covering our right tocontinue to maintain forces in the Federation both for its defence andfor meeting our obligations under ANZAM and SEATO. He wouldattempt, therefore, in the forthcoming negotiations to reach agreementon a broad formula which would embrace these guarantees.On the question of a constitutional commission, it was now knownthat the Malayan leaders would ask that the commission should beempowered to prepare plans for full self-government as well as forthe intervening stage of internal self-government. The stage of fullself-government would not be reached before 1959. This timetablewould not, however, be advanced by empowering the constitutionalcommission to prepare a scheme for full self-government, for thepreparation of the scheme and of plans for putting it into operationwould be a lengthy task. He understood that the Malayan leaders,if their proposals in regard to the constitutional commission wereaccepted, would not seek for any major changes in the FederationAgreement during the intervening period. The High Commissionerwould therefore retain his residual powers under the Agreement untilfull self-government had been introduced.The Malayan leaders proposed that the constitutionalcommission should be composed of members from outside Malaya:they contemplated a commission of four members drawn from theUnited Kingdom, Canada, Australia and India.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthis opportunity should be taken to attempt to obtain appropriateguarantees to safeguard the future of our economic interests inMalaya when the stage of full self-government had been reached.On this, it was pointed out that the Malayan leaders could not beexpected to enter into an agreement limiting their freedom of actionin such matters as taxation after full self-government had beenattained, and that safeguards of the kind we sought would be of littlevalue if a Government wishing to pursue a discriminatory policytowards United Kingdom or foreign interests were eventually tocome into power in Malaya. On the other hand it was argued thatthe protection provided by formal undertakings would be of valueeven if a time came when Malaya was governed by less conservativeelements. Moreover, Malaya would continue to depend on theUnited Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries for her defencefor an indefinite period, and it was reasonable that this dependenceshould be associated with an assurance that our economic interestsin Malaya would continue to be respected. It was agreed that furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of securing someassurances on this point in the course of the forthcoming negotiations.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the point recorded in Conclusion (2)below, the proposals for constitutional advance in Malayacontained in CP. (56) 12.
5CM. 4 (56)(2) Agreed that an attempt should be made in the forthcomingnegotiations to secure assurances to safeguard the futureof United Kingdom economic interests in Malaya.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the ColonialSecretary and the President of the Board of Trade toconsider, in consultation, the form and scope of theeconomic safeguards which might be sought.Commercial 4   fhe President of the Board of Trade said that the EconomicPolicy. Policy Committee had recently considered, on the basis of aTariff memorandum E. P. (56) 3 which had been circulated to them, theNegotiations. general line to be taken by the United Kingdom Delegation in the(Previous forthcoming round of tariff negotiations under the General Agree-Reference:      ment on Tariffs and Trade.CM. (55) 32nd The President of the Board of Trade said that twenty-fourConclusions. countries would take part in these negotiations, which were due toMinute 4.) commence at Geneva on 19th January. It was unlikely that theywould result in more than a modest adjustment in the present levelof international tariffs, since the United States Government wereprecluded from offering to reduce their tariffs by more than 15 percent, over the next three years. We ourselves were prepared to offer,in return for corresponding benefits for our export trace, tariffconcessions of the order of 15 per cent., mainly on engineeringproducts and motor vehicles, but also on some other commoditiessuch as raw silk, certain iron and steel products, soft wood, paper,glass and paints. There would be complaints from those industrieswhose tariff protection might be reduced, but the compensating gainswe might expect to obtain would result in a balance of economicadvantage. He would seek the authority of his colleagues before anycommitment was undertaken as a result of these negotiations.The Cabinet Approved the proposals made by the President of the Boardof Trade on the general line to be followed by the UnitedKingdom Delegation in the forthcoming tariff negotiationsat Geneva.Alan NunnMay.(PreviousReference:C.C. (52) 108thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 14) on the possibility that Dr. Alan Nunn Maymight apply for the grant of a British passport for travel to Germanyin connection with an offer of employment which was likely to bemade to him by the East German Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he had summarised in hismemorandum the main considerations for and against the grant of apassport for this purpose. The issue was nicely balanced, and itwould assist him to have his colleagues&apos; views on it.The Cabinet were informed that the Lord President endorsed theview of H.M. Ambassador at Washington, as expressed in thetelegram annexed to CP. (56) 14, that future prospects of Anglo-American co-operation on atomic energy projects would be gravelyprejudiced if Dr. Nunn May took up employment in EasternGermany.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, even though Dr. Nunn May could not be prevented
6from travelling to Eastern Germany, the Government should at leastrefrain from giving him any facilities for such a journey. TheForeign Secretary should therefore reject any application whichDr. Nunn May might make for the grant of a British passport. Itwas also agreed that the Home Office and Ministry of Labour shouldmake further efforts to arrange for his continued employment in thiscountry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to reject any application thatmight be made by Dr. Nunn May for the grant of aBritish passport for the purpose of travel to EasternGermany.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour tomake further efforts to arrange for Dr. Nunn May&apos;scontinued employment on suitable scientific work in theUnited Kingdom.NationalInsuranceScheme.Widows&apos;Benefits.6. The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said thathe had now received from his Advisory Committee the report of theirenquiry into the conditions applicable to widows&apos; benefits under theNational Insurance Scheme. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views, heproposed to arrange for the printing and publication of the report,and he would expect to be able to lay it before Parliament early inFebruary. The adjustments recommended in the report would, ifadopted, cost about  3 millions a year.The public had been led to expect that this review would cover,not merely widows&apos; benefits under the National Insurance Scheme,but also the \0s. a week pensions of widows whose rights under theearlier contributory pensions scheme had been preserved by the Actof 1948. In the event, however, the Committee had not dealt withthese pensions in their report, since they fell outside the scope of theNational Insurance Scheme. This would occasion some disappoint-ment, since there had been Parliamentary pressure for an increasein the rate of these pensions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was desirable thatMinisters should take a preliminary view of the recommendations inthis report before it was published. He suggested that copies of thereport should be made available to the other Ministers directlyconcerned, and that its recommendations should be discussed by theHome Affairs Committee at an early date. Meanwhile, arrangementsfor the printing of the report could go forward.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Pensions and National Insuranceto put the necessary arrangements in hand for the printingand publication of the report of his Advisory Committeeon widows&apos; benefits under the National InsuranceScheme.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance toarrange for the Home Affairs Committee to consider atan early date the main recommendations made in thisreport.Heroin.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 13) containing a draft of a statement, to be madein both Houses of Parliament on 26th January, announcing theGovernment&apos;s decision to limit the manufacture of heroin in theUnited Kingdom and to prohibit all imports and exports of heroininto and out of this country.
7CM. 4 (56)The Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthe new decision should, or should not, be related directly to thedifference of opinion which had developed, within the medicalprofession, about the medical use of heroin. The Cabinet agreedthat no reference should be made to this or to the views which hadbeen expressed in public discussion: it could, however, be stated thatthe Government had been advised that they had no power under theexisting law to prohibit the manufacture of heroin in this country.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed that their decisionshould be announced in the following terms:  &quot; The Government s aim in deciding to ban the manufactureof heroin was to co-operate in a widespread international effortamong over 50 countries to help to eliminate the abuse of thedrug in various parts of the world. Before reaching the decisionthe Government had taken the advice of the statutory advisorybodies, namely the standing medical advisory Committees inEngland and Wales and in Scotland. The Government have,however, been advised that it is not possible under the presentlaw of this country to prohibit the manufacture of heroin. Thereis no similar legal obstacle in the way of prohibiting the exportand import of heroin, and the Government have accordinglydecided to prohibit entirely as from 1st January, 1956, exportsof this drug to countries outside the British Isles, and all imports.As regards manufacture, the Government have decided torestrict the manufacture of heroin in this country to thequantities actually required for home medical consumption andscientific use.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to make a statement in theHouse of Commons on 26th January in the terms set outabove.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for anidentical statement to be made simultaneously in theHouse of Lords.GovernmentExpenditure.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The Prime Minister said that, in his speech at Bradford on18th January, he proposed to refer to the urgent need for curbingGovernment expenditure. After mentioning the steps which hadalready been taken to this end, he would go on to say that theGovernment intended to continue their efforts to reduceadministrative costs. He asked for the full co-operation of allMinisters in charge of Departments in this further effort to reducethe level of Government expenditure.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.l,17th January, 1956.
