3CM. 13 (56)Monopolies 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lordand Chancellor (CP. (56) 34) covering a draft of the Restrictive TradeRestrictive Practices Bill which had been prepared under the supervision of aPractices. Committee of Ministers under his Chairmanship.   They also had(Previous before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerReference: (CP. (56) 37) submitting proposals for the allocation of MinisterialCM. (56) 3rd responsibility for the office of Registrar of Restrictive TradingConclusions. Agreements, for which provision was made in the Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that the essential features of the Billcould be summarised as follows:  (i) There would be a statutory obligation to register all restrictivetrade agreements within a definition which, by including commonprice rings, would extend beyond the field at present within thepurview of the Monopolies Commission. The register would be opento public inspection, subject to appropriate safeguards to protectinformation which it would be contrary to the public or a legitimatetrade interest to reveal.(ii) A judicial tribunal, of the type which the Cabinet had earlierapproved and known as the Restrictive Practices Court, would be setup to determine whether or not restrictive practices were in the publicinterest. The Court, which would sit in divisions, would consist ofjudges and lay members to be appointed by the Lord Chancellor.(hi) The statement, in Clause 16 of the Bill, of the issue whichthe Court would have to decide followed closely the lines of an earlierdraft which the Cabinet had considered. It was essential that theCourt should be required to adjudicate on an issue which was trulyjusticiable and, while the need for the exercise of some element ofpurely economic judgment could not be altogether excluded, thescope for this had been reduced to a minimum and the justiciable issuehad been defined in such a way that the Court would be in a positionof exercising judgment predominantly on questions of fact.(iv) It would prejudice the position of the President of theBoard of Trade in the exercise of his wider functions of givingguidance and assistance to industry if the responsibility were laid onhim to initiate the prosecution of cases before the tribunal.Moreover, the conduct of these cases should be as independent aspossible of political control or Parliamentary discussion. The Billtherefore provided for the appointment of a Registrar who wouldassume this responsibility, in addition to that of maintaining theregister. He would be assisted by the Treasury Solicitor, and caseswould be conducted before the Court by counsel nominated by theAttorney-General and by the corresponding Law Officers in Scotlandand Northern Ireland.Although the Registrar would initiate action before the Court, theresponsibility for deciding the order in which cases should bepresented would rest with The President of the Board of Trade. Thiswould ensure that the more objectionable types of restrictive practice,on Which the guidance of the decisions of the Court would be ofwidest immediate value, would be taken first; and it would enableother cases, such as those relating to restrictive practices in the ironand steel industry, to be deferred for a period if the industry concernedshowed signs of putting its house in order.(v) The Bill would make it unlawful collectively to enforce resaleprice maintenance by such devices as stop lists, black lists and privatecourts which had attracted much public disapproval. It wouldsubstitute a new right which would enable an individual manufacturerto enforce price maintenance in respect of his own goods by aninjunction obtained through the ordinary courts.(vi) Finally, the Bill would provide for the reconstitution of theMonopolies Commission as a smaller and more compact body fordealing with matters, e.g., monopolies as such and pure exportagreements, which could not be fitted into any justiciable system.49609 1b 2
4In discussion the following points were considered:  (a) The exclusion of the restrictive practices of labour from thescope of the Bill would be criticised. The Economic Policy Committeehad, however, reaffirmed their earlier view that, as differentconsiderations would arise in adjudicating on restrictive labourpractices and restrictive trade practices, it would not be practicableto include the former within the scope of the present Bill.Nevertheless, the Government should consider what other action itmight be possible to take in respect of them. The Committee hadtherefore invited the Minister of Labour to raise the question withhis National Joint Advisory Council and had also arranged to appointa committee of officials to go into it.ib) The Cabinet were informed that attempts had been made bythe Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Chancellor and the President of theBoard of Trade to dispel the very serious misgivings entertained bySir Archibald Forbes, the Chairman of the Iron and Steel Board,that the provisions of the Bill would over-ride the statutory authorityconferred on his Board. The point had been put to him that if theBoard should consider a particular restrictive practice in the industrynecessary and justifiable it was most unlikely that the Registrar wouldtake a different view; while, correspondingly, the existence of the newtribunal would strengthen the Board&apos;s hands in dealing with restrictivepractices of which they did not approve. Sir Archibald Forbes hadrecognised the difficulty of delegating judicial functions to a statutoryboard but had felt that the Iron and Steel Board could not finallydefine their attitude without more precise information of the detailedcontents of the Bill. It was agreed that this information could nowbe given to him.(c) As regards the working of the judicial tribunal, it was notedthat the Court could be expected to establish precedents which wouldserve as case law, and there was reason to hope that the practicemight grow up of accepting judgment by consent.It was the intention that cases relating to restrictive agreementsin Scotland and Northern Ireland should come before the divisionsof the Court sitting in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.Provision could be made for this in the rules to be made by theLord Chancellor under Section 18 of the Bill.id) The Bill, as drafted, would not apply to any restrictive tradeagreements to which the Crown might be a party. But someGovernment Departments with special interests in supply were, infact, already parties to such agreements. This would undoubtedlygive rise to criticism, for the other parties to these agreements possibly comprising important sections of industry would therebyescape jurisdiction. There were objections, however, to making theBill binding on the Crown, for the Crown would then be involved onboth sides of the case, and difficulties would arise in deciding theextent to which it would be possible to waive Crown privilege. Thepreferable course, therefore, would be for the Departments concernedcarefully to examine the agreements with which they were associatedwith a view to extricating themselves, wherever possible, from them.It was agreed that this course should be followed.(e) Cases which were under examination by the MonopoliesCommission when the new Bill became effective would lapse andwould be reopened at the appropriate time before the judicial tribunal.The purpose of this provision was to avoid the risk, during thetransition period, of any clash between the policy applied by theMonopolies Commission and the judgments of the new judicialmachinery. This arrangement would inevitably occasion some delayin dealing with cases already under consideration.(/) Both the herring and white fish industries operated, underthe authority of statutory boards, a wide range of restrictive practices.The question was raised whether the definition of the grounds forjustifying a restrictive practice should be expanded by including inSection 16 (a) a reference to the protection of an industry as well asthe protection of the public.
5CM. 13 (56)Against this it was pointed out that the definition could not bethus expanded without provoking claims from other industries forsimilar treatment. This would defeat the purposes of the Bill. Butrestrictive practices which formed part of any statutory scheme werealready outside the scope of the Bill by virtue of Clause 6(1).Although this protection would not apply to any supplementaryrestrictive agreements which did not form part of a statutory scheme,it was the normal practice for statutory schemes of the kind whichapplied to the herring and white fish industry to contain, in additionto specific provisions, a general provision authorising the statutoryauthority to adopt any reasonable measures which would contributeto maintaining the industry. It might be possible to invoke thisgeneral authority to bring within the framework of the statutoryscheme itself supplementary restrictive agreements which the industrywished to continue. If not, it would be necessary to make use of thepower which the President of the Board of Trade would possess todelay for a period the prosecution of cases under such agreements.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft Restrictive Trade Practices Bill annexedto CP. (56) 34.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and the ParliamentarySecretary, Treasury, for the Bill to be introduced in theHouse of Commons as soon as possible.(3) Agreed that it would not be practicable to bring restrictivelabour practices within the scope of the Bill, and took notethat the Economic Policy Committee had arranged forfurther consideration to be given to the courses of actionwhich might be practicable in respect of them.(4) Endorsed their previous conclusion that the iron and steelindustry should be included within the scope of the Bill,and invited the Lord Chancellor to furnish the Chairmanof the Iron and Steel Board with such further explanationsas he might need of the detailed provisions of the Bill.(5) Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 37 for the allocationof Ministerial responsibility for the Registrar ofRestrictive Trading Agreements.(6) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in formulating the procedureof the new Restrictive Practices Court, to arrange thatcases arising in relation to Scottish and Northern Irishagreements would be heard in the divisions of the courtsitting in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.(7) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to notify theDepartments concerned that they should examinerestrictive agreements to which they might be parties, orwith which they might in some way be connected, with aview to taking action in accordance with the sense of theCabinet&apos;s discussion recorded in paragraph (d) above.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 12thConclusions,Minute 2.)*2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (56) 32 forreducing the inflationary pressure in the national economy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion on the previous day, he had again reviewed hisproposals to discontinue the bread subsidy and to increase the priceof milk. There seemed to be broad agreement in the Cabinet thatin existing economic circumstances the continuance of these subsidies* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.
6could no longer be justified.   The problem was therefore to findan appropriate moment and a suitable context for their withdrawal.The Prime Minister feared that a brusque announcement of theirwithdrawal, without any preliminary discussion with the representa-tives of organised labour, would be regarded as a harsh and oppres-sive action directed against the poorest classes of the community.Coming so soon after his speech at Bradford, in which he had invitedthe co-operation of organised labour in securing a period of stabilityin prices, this might well jeopardise the prospects of fruitfulco-operation  between  the  Government  and  the  Trade Unionmovement.    The problem  was essentially  one of timing andpresentation.   Undue delay, however, would be dangerous; for thefinancial situation was worsening and there was a growing expectationof early Government action to remedy it.   On the other hand thisvery weakening of the position and the rumours of devaluation madeit easier to take early and drastic action. The Governor of the Bankof England was ready to increase the Bank rate on 16th Februaryif the Government were prepared thereafter to announce otherdisinflationary measures.   He therefore suggested that he shouldmake a statement on 17th February indicating that the Governmentproposed to supplement the action of the Bank of England in raisingthe Bank rate by other measures designed to reduce the inflationarypressure in the economy and that the House of Commons would begiven an opportunity to debate these measures early in the followingweek. The measures to be announced in the debate would include theproposed changes in the food subsidies. This would give an intervalof two or three days during which the Prime Minister would be ableto meet the leaders of the Trade Union movement, to explain tothem the gravity of the financial situation which had necessitated theincrease in the Bank rate and to indicate the nature of the furthermeasures which the Government felt obliged to take in the nationalinterest in order to check the inflationary pressure.  The purpose ofthis meeting would be, not so much to enlist the co-operation of theTrade Union movement in a policy of wages restraint, but ratherto make clear to them the compelling nature of the economiccircumstances which obliged the Government to take the drastic actionon which they had decided.The Prime Minister said that he was not convinced that it wasnecessary to announce at this stage these changes in the food subsidies.He still believed that the announcement of the other measures whichthe Chancellor was proposing to take would be sufficient to hold theposition for the time being and to restore confidence in sterling. Ifneed be, the Chancellor could make it clear in his statement that theseinitial measures would be supplemented at a later stage by othermeasures which, being related to fiscal changes, must await the Budget.This would give more time for discussions with the two sides ofindustry. In the course of those discussions the Government wouldbe able to assess more precisely what help they could expect to obtainfrom employers and workers in applying a policy of restraint designedto secure a period of stability in prices. He did not exclude thepossibility that, if those discussions proved to be fruitful, it wouldnot be necessary to proceed, even in the Budget, with the proposedchanges in the food subsidies.The Minister of Labour supported the view expressed by thePrime Minister. In the short interval between 16th and 20thFebruary it was most unlikely that any satisfactory progress couldbe made in the projected discussions with the leaders of the TradeUnion movement. If, however, the announcement of changes infood subsidies were postponed until the Budget, this would givethe Prime Minister an opportunity to judge whether any fruitfulresult was likely to flow from his discussions with the Trade Unions;and, if it had become clear that they were not in a position to giveeffective support to a policy of wage restraint, the Government wouldhave more justification for including these measures in the Budget.
7 CM. 13 (56)In further discussion it was argued, in support of the time-tableproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the primarypurpose of consultation with the Trade Union leaders at this stagewould be to persuade them that this change in the food subsidies wasnecessary in the public interest and was not being brought forwardas a repressive measure by a reactionary Conservative Administration.Political criticism of these changes was inevitable and must be faced;but it might be possible, by prior consultation with the Trade Unionleaders, to prevent a reaction which would embitter industrialrelations.The Prime Minister said that it was this latter possibility whichcaused him the greatest anxiety. He himself thought that much ofthe purchasing power removed by this increase in the price of breadwould at once be replaced by increased wages; and if, in addition,industrial relations became embittered, the disinflationary effect ofthe measure would be wholly lost. The resulting situation would notinspire sustained confidence in the stability of our economy or inthe strength of sterling.The Minister of Defence endorsed this view. It was for thesereasons that he had hitherto opposed the proposal to withdraw thebread subsidy and to increase the price of milk. He still believed thatit would be a mistake to introduce these changes in the food subsidiesat the present time. If, however, the Cabinet should decide that itwould be expedient that these changes should be introduced at alater stage, he would accept that decision.Towards the end of the discussion the suggestion was again putforward that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be justified inpostponing these changes in the food subsidies if he could find othermeans of supplementing his proposals for reducing the inflationarypressure in the economy.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting on thefollowing day.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,14th February, 1956.
