3CM. 16 (56)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the two next following weeks.On 27th February there would be a debate on Foreign Affairs.This would be opened by the Foreign Secretary, and the PrimeMinister would reply to the debate.The Statement on Defence would be debated on 28th and 29thFebruary. This debate would be opened by the Minister of Defence:if it became necessary for a Government spokesman to deal withCivil Defence questions, the Home Secretary would intervene duringthe course of the first day: the Minister of Supply and the Secretaryof State for Air would speak for the Government on the second day.The Army Estimates would be debated on 1st March. The Navy andAir Estimates would be debated during the week beginning5th March.The Second Reading of the Restrictive Trade Practices Billwould be taken on 5th or 6th March.NorthernIrelandParliament.Disqualification,(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Home Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussionon 16th February, it had been found that two further members ofthe Northern Ireland Parliament had become disqualified throughacceptance of offices of profit under the Crown. In these circum-stances he had delayed the presentation of the White Paper and theReports of the Select Committees on the earlier cases, so that all theknown cases could be dealt with together.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement and agreedthat the action which they had authorised on 16th Februaryshould be deferred until it became possible to dealcomprehensively with all the cases of disqualification whichhad so far been identified in the Northern IrelandParliament.3. The Cabinet were informed that, following the debate in theHouse of Commons on his proposals for reducing the inflationarypressure in the national economy, the Chancellor of the Exchequerwould give a broadcast talk on this subject on 25th February. Itwas also proposed that the Prime Minister, in company with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour, shoulddiscuss with representatives of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.)the measures which the Government had found it necessary to taketo remedy the economic situation. The General Secretary of theT.U.C. had already been approached with a view to arranging anearly date for this meeting.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of these forthcomingdiscussions with representatives of the T.U.C, it might now be timelyto publish the projected White Paper on the Implications of FullEmployment. The Cabinet had decided on 1st December, 1955, thatpublication of this White Paper should be postponed for the timebeing. The Cabinet were informed that the Economic PolicyCommittee had decided, at a meeting earlier in the day, that thedraft of this White Paper should be brought up to date and that arevised version should be submitted to the Cabinet with a view to itsearly publication.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.50023 2 B 2EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)Parliament.
4TechnologicalEducation.ImperialCollegeof Science.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Prime Minister recalled that on 11th January theCabinet had agreed that, despite the objections which the Royal FineArt Commission had raised to the demolition of the Collcutt building,the Government should proceed with their plan for constructing onthis site new and enlarged premises for the Imperial College ofScience. It had now been suggested to him that the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, should hold a meeting with representatives ofthe Commission and of the University authorities concerned with aview to explaining the grounds for the Government&apos;s decision andpersuading the Commission to withdraw their objections to it. Hedoubted whether it would be expedient to take this course. TheGovernment were already being criticised for failing to take earliersteps to expand the facilities for technological education. Theyshould not risk the charge of further delay in the execution of theirplan for enlarging the Imperial College.In discussion some Ministers expressed regret at the decisionto demolish the Collcutt building. It was a building of somearchitectural interest, and was a feature of the London skyline.Other Ministers expressed disquiet about the design of the newbuilding which was to take its place. They suggested that this hadlittle merit in itself and would not be congruous with the surroundingbuildings. They thought it would be wise to consider any suggestionswhich the Fine Art Commission might have to make for improvementof the design of the new building.In further discussion it was agreed that there might be advantagein holding a meeting with representatives of the Fine ArtCommission, provided that it was made clear from the outset thatthe Government were not prepared to modify their decision todemolish the Collcutt building and to build new premises for theImperial College on this site, and that the discussions could not beallowed to delay progress in the construction of the new building.On this understanding, however, the Government could offer toconsider any comments which the Fine Art Commission might wishto make on the design of the new building.The Cabinet Agreed that the Financial Secretary, Treasury, should beauthorised to invite the comments of the Royal Fine ArtCommission on the design of the new building for theImperial College of Science, on the understanding that theGovernment were finally committed to proceed with thisproject and that this consultation with the Commissionwould not be allowed to delay its execution.Egypt.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 42ndConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that he would shortly be meetingthe Prime Minister of Egypt in Cairo. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views,he proposed, in his discussions with Colonel Nasser, to take a firmline about the tone of Egyptian propaganda on British policy in theMiddle East and to make plain the advantages to Egypt of afriendlier relation with the United Kingdom. It was not to beexpected that, if Egypt showed such hostility towards us, we shouldcontinue to treat her as a friendly State and, for example, to give herfinancial assistance towards the construction of the Aswan High Dam.His object would be to make it clear that Egypt could not expectfurther help from us unless she changed her policy towards us.In discussion it was pointed out that our decision to make afinancial contribution towards the construction of the Aswan Damhad been taken, after full consideration, because it was thought tobe in our interests to prevent the Soviet Government from obtainingcontracts which would give them a foothold in Egypt. We couldnot lightly withdraw from this undertaking and certainly could notdo so without prior consultation with the United States Government.
CM. 16 (56)The Foreign Secretary said that he was not asking the Cabinetto reverse their decision about the Aswan Dam and would notpropose, in his forthcoming discussions, to threaten to withdraw theoffer of British assistance in this project. He need not at this stagebe specific about the consequences which would follow if theEgyptians failed to modify their policy towards us. He need go nofurther at present than to emphasise the common advantages toboth countries of a better understanding and friendlier relationsbetween the United Kingdom and Egypt.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the line which the ForeignSecretary proposed to take in his forthcoming discussionswith the Prime Minister of Egypt.Capital 6.   In the debate in the House of Commons on 16th February,Punishment. the Government motion commending the retention of capital(Previous punishment as the penalty for murder had been defeated, on a freeReference : vote, by 293 votes to 262.  The Cabinet considered what course theCM. (56) 10th Government should now take in the light of this expression of theConclusions, view of the House of Commons.   They had before them aMinute 3.) memorandum on this question by the Home Secretary (CP. (56) 43).In discussion of the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum thefollowing points were made:  (a) There was general agreement that, as the Government hadinvited the House to support a motion for the retention of capitalpunishment, they could not now introduce a Government Bill toabolish it. Government supporters who had voted in favour of themotion would be unwilling to support Government legislation to thecontrary effect.(b) Doubts were expressed about the expediency of thealternative course, suggested by the Home Secretary, of providingGovernment time for the passage of the Death Penalty (Abolition)Bill which had been introduced by Mr. S. Silverman, M.P. ThisBill provided that the death penalty for murder should be suspendedfor five years and that after a further five years it should be abolishedaltogether unless, in the intervening period, prayers for itscontinuance had been passed by both Houses of Parliament. TheHouse of Commons had now declared for the abolition of thepenalty, and it was undesirable that legislation should be passedwhich would have the effect of reopening the issue after a period offive years. Might it not be preferable that the leaders of the LabourOpposition should themselves promote a Bill providing for theabolition of the death penalty?As against this it was argued that, if the principle ofMr. Silverman&apos;s Bill was confirmed on Second Reading, it would beopen to the Government to move in the Committee Stage amend-ments which would transform the measure into one for the completeabolition of the death penalty. There was much to be said forallowing the House of Commons to proceed with this question onthe basis of the Bill already before them. The Government wouldseem to be assuming a greater responsibility than they need if theytook the initiative in inviting the leaders of the Labour Oppositionto sponsor a different form of Bill.(c) This should be treated as a Private Member&apos;s Bill. TheGovernment should provide no facilities for it, apart fromfinding Government time for its discussion. In all proceedingson it Government supporters should be allowed a free vote.id) In the House of Lords there was a great body of authoritativelegal opinion in favour of retaining the death penalty. Even if thisBill should pass the Commons, it was likely to be rejected by the
6Lords. Public opinion on this question was divided and this would,therefore, be a proper occasion for the exercise of the power of theHouse of Lords to delay the passage of legislation. There werealready indications of a growing volume of public support for theretention of the death penalty; and it was to be expected that thismovement would grow during the period between the first rejectionof the Bill by the House of Lords and its subsequent presentationto the Upper House.(e) The Prime Minister said that some Government supportershad suggested to him that this issue should be decided by areferendum. To these suggestions he proposed to reply that thiswas essentially a matter for decision by Parliament itself and that theholding of a referendum on it would derogate from the sovereigntyof Parliament.The Cabinet then considered the terms of the statement whichthe Home Secretary proposed to make about the exercise of theprerogative of mercy in murder cases during the interval before afinal decision on this question was taken by Parliament. The termsof his proposed statement were set out in paragraph 4 of CP. (56) 43.The Home Secretary said that, on further reflection, he thoughtit might be preferable not to state that, in deciding whether torecommend the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in any particularcase, he would be influenced by the views on the subject of capitalpunishment which had been expressed in the House of Commons.He thought it preferable to deal with this point in the more generalterms which had been used by Mr. Chuter Ede, M.P., in the statementwhich he had made, as Home Secretary, on 10th June, 1948. Mr. Edehad then stated that each case would be considered on its merits,&quot; regard being had to the special considerations relating to that caseand all other relevant considerations either of a public or privatenature.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should find Parliamentary timefor a Second Reading of the Death Penalty (Abolition)Bill introduced by Mr. S. Silverman, M.P., and^ if itobtained a Second Reading, for further proceedings onthat Bill: and invited the Prime Minister to make anannouncement to this effect in the House of Commonson the following day.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to make an early statementin the House of Commons about the exercise of theprerogative of mercy in murder cases, in the terms setout in paragraph 4 of CP. (56) 43, subject to theamendment approved in their discussion and noted above.Technical 7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Seal,Education. the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education(Previous (CP. (56) 40) covering the draft of a White Paper on TechnicalReference: Education which had been prepared under the supervision of aCM. (56) 2nd Committee of Ministers under the Chairmanship of the Lord PrivyConclusions, Seal. They also had before them a further memorandum by theMinute 6.)      Lord Privy Seal (CP. (56) 46) recommending that the referencesin the draft White Paper to technological education at the Universitiesshould be expanded in certain respects.The Minister of Education said that the proposals outlined in Atthe draft White Paper were designed to provide the maximum rangeof opportunities for technical education at all stages of the
7CM. 16 (56)educational system for pupils of all grades of mental capacity. Onlyin this way could we expect to keep abreast of the development oftechnical training in other countries. Our programme would bearcomparison with that in the United States; but in the Soviet Unionthe training of technicians was taking place at a rate which wouldenable the Soviets to outstrip Western countries within ten or twentyyears. The expenditure of  70 millions proposed in the White Paperwould not enable us to keep pace with the Soviet Union: it wasrelated to the resources, including resources in teachers, which wouldbe at our command during the five-year period and it compared withan earlier plan for the expenditure of only  45 millions. We shouldhave in mind a further expansion of our efforts after this five-yearperiod; and he would therefore prefer to omit the words inparagraph 93 of the White Paper which implied that expenditurewithin this period would be conditional on prevailing economiccircumstances. He also suggested that paragraph 5 of the WhitePaper should be expanded to refer more fully to the needs ofCommonwealth countries and the Colonies.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was agreed that paragraph 93 of the White Paper shouldbe amended as proposed by the Minister of Education.(b) It was suggested that paragraphs 105 and 106 might beomitted, as likely to give undue encouragement to the provision oftechnical libraries, financed largely by Exchequer grants. As againstthis it was argued that adequate library facilities were essential to thedevelopment of technical education and would also be of value tolocal industry. It was agreed that these paragraphs should beretained.(c) It was generally felt that the White Paper would be thoughtto devote too little attention to technological education at theUniversities and might on that account appear to be unbalanced.The further development of facilities for technological education atthe Universities in the period 1957-62 could not be foreshadowedin the White Paper, as it would depend on the results of thequinquennial review which was now being held; but it would bepossible to expand Chapter II of the draft so as to explain the reasonswhy the Government had decided to build their plans for highertechnological education on the foundations already existing in theUniversities and to describe more fully the facilities that had alreadybeen provided at the Universities.(d) It was agreed that some reference to facilities for technicaleducation for agriculture should be included in the White Paper.The existing facilities for this purpose were adequate for currentrequirements, but they would need to be expanded to meet increasingdemands in the future.(e) A Committee of Ministers under the Chairmanship of theLord Privy Seal should be appointed to co-ordinate the programmeof technical education and to supervise its execution.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofEducation, to expand Chapter II of the White Paperso as to give a fuller picture of the facilities to be providedfor technological education at the Universities.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to arrange for the amend-ment of the White Paper to take account of the pointsnoted in paragraphs (a) and (d) above.(3) Subject to the foregoing Conclusions, approved the draftWhite Paper annexed to CP. (56) 40, and authorisedthe Minister of Education to present it to Parliament inthe course of the following week.
(4) Appointed a Committee of Ministers consisting of Lord Privy Seal {Chairman),Lord President,Minister of Education,Financial Secretary, Treasury,Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, Jto co-ordinate the programme for technical educationenvisaged in the White Paper and to supervise itsexecution.Legislative 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivyProgramme Seal (CP. (56) 42) on the legislative programme for the current1955-56 Session. session- They also had before them memoranda by the Minister ofPensions (CP. (56) 35 and 44) setting out the arguments in favourof the early introduction of the Family Allowances (Amendment)Bill and the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Lord Privy Seal said that, though many Bills had beenabandoned, there was an estimated deficit of nearly five weeks ofParliamentary time before the summer recess. The Restrictive TradePractices Bill, a major piece of legislation which was to be taken onthe floor of the House, had been introduced late in the session. TheCabinet had now decided that time must be found for legislation oncapital punishment and it appeared that a Public Works Loans Billcould not be avoided. The Cabinet might feel it necessary to givefurther consideration to the claims of the Family Allowances(Amendment) Bill. But he felt that, in view of the congestion ofthe Parliamentary time-table, the remaining Bills listed in the Annexto his memorandum would have to be postponed until the followingsession. As an earnest of meeting the undertaking which had beengiven to the Public Accounts Committee, the Bill to give statutoryauthority to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Researchmight be introduced in this session, even though it could make nofurther progress. In order that no question might arise that theGovernment were weakening in their intention to introduce anti-dumping legislation he would announce that it was solely on accountof pressure of Parliamentary business that the Imports (SpecialDuties) Bill had had to be deferred.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) Ministers had more than once reaffirmed the undertakinggiven in The Queen&apos;s Speech to introduce legislation on familyallowances in the current session. There was therefore a strongcase for proceeding with this Bill. On the other hand, proposals toincrease family allowances were not in tune with the current economicsituation and the Bill, although short, might well prove controversial.(b) The Colonial Secretary said that the Caribbean Conferencehad reached an agreement which was due to be signed on thefollowing day and he had undertaken to attempt to secure beforethe summer recess the passage of the legislation which would benecessary to put the agreement into effect. He also considered thattime should be found in the current session for legislation to validatecertain undertakings of the Colonial Development Corporation andto provide for the reorganisation of the Oversea Civil Service.(c) It was agreed that, although legislation on this subject wouldhave to be deferred until the following session, the Home Secretaryshould enter into consultations with the Opposition on the provisionsof the proposed Representation of the People Bill.id) The Bill to give statutory authority to the D.S.I.R. wouldprovide for an Executive Council in place of the present Advisory
9CM. 16 (56)Council. The Chairman and the Secretary of the Executive Councilhad been nominated and it would be embarrassing if, because theBill could not be enacted in this session, a year&apos;s delay should elapsebefore the new organisation could be brought into being. The Billwould not be contentious.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to consider further at a later meeting whether anattempt should be made to enact the Family Allowances(Amendment) Bill in the current session.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to determine the remainder ofthe content of the legislative programme, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, taking into account thepoints made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.NationalInsuranceScheme.Widows&apos;Benefits.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)9. The Cabinet again considered whether any increase shouldbe made in the 10s. basic pension for widows.The Minister of Pensions said that there was no logical case forincreasing the rate of this pension. There would, however, bepolitical pressure in favour of an increase; and it would beunfortunate if the Government, having taken a stand against makingan increase, were subsequently forced to give way.In discussion it was recognised that the Government would beunder strong pressure to increase the rate of this pension, moreespecially since they were taking steps to increase the prices of breadand milk. On the other hand, the Cabinet were informed that feelingon this point among Government supporters in the House ofCommons was less vehement than had been expected.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in present economiccircumstances he would prefer that no change should be made inrespect of this pension. If it were agreed that there should be noincrease in the rate, he would withdraw his earlier suggestion thatthere should be no new issues.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no change should be made in the existingprovision for the basic \0s. pension for widows.(2) Authorised the Minister of Pensions to make an announce-ment to this effect in the statement which he wasproposing to make on the recommendations in the reporton widows&apos; benefits which he had received from theNational Insurance Advisory Committee.Road and Rail io. The Minister of Transport said that the British TransportTransport. Commission were likely to incur a deficit of about  60 millions onBritish their operations in the current year.   This would raise theirTransport cumulative deficit to about  140 millions. To meet this prospectiveCommission&apos;s deficit on the current year&apos;s account the Commission proposed toFinances. increase their revenue by about  40 millions by a 10 per cent, increase(Previous in freight charges, which would bring in an additional  26 millionsReference : a year, and by various minor adjustments of passenger fares. ForCM. (55) 43rd tne proposed increase in freight charges the authority of the MinisterConclusions, would be required, but the additional revenue from passenger faresMinute 5.)      could be raised by using up the unexhausted margin in the Id.maximum authorised by the Passenger Charges Scheme, byeliminating a number of the present sub-standard fares in Londonand, with the approval of the Transport Tribunal, by removingcertain anomalies in the existing London fares system. The50023 2 c
10Transport Commission had already submitted to the TransportTribunal a comprehensive scheme for freight charges which wouldallow them greater flexibility in their freight charges. It had beenhoped that this scheme would be introduced by May this year, butowing to the numerous representations which had been made byindustry about its details it now seemed unlikely that it could beintroduced before the end of the year. The proposed 10 per cent,increase would therefore apply to the existing scheme of freightcharges.A further problem which faced the Commission was a settlementof the superannuation scheme for their employees. The presentfinancial arrangements of the Commission were not entirelysatisfactory. Discussions were in progress between the Commissionand the Treasury about the control of capital investment. Therewould be advantage in expanding the scope of these discussions tocover the general accounting system of the Commission. It wouldnot be necessary to make a public announcement about an internalreview of this nature.In discussion concern was expressed about the effect of theproposed increase of 10 per cent, in freight charges in raisingmanufacturing costs and thus impairing the competitive power ofBritish industry in export markets. On the other hand, it wasrecognised that there would be political objections to raisingpassenger fares without making some increase in freight charges.The recent wages settlement had increased the wage bill of theCommission by  30 millions. Though there were advantages inbringing home to the public the close connection between thisincrease in the wage bill and the subsequent increase in fares bymaking the adjustment as soon as possible, there might well becriticism that the wage increase had been granted precipitately.Several Ministers suggested that the Cabinet should have afurther opportunity to consider these proposals before a final decisionwas taken.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate a memo-randum on the financial position of the British TransportCommission and their proposals for increasing theirrevenue.Malaya.(PreviousReference :C. M. (56) 9thConclusions,Minue 7.)11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (CP. (56) 47) covering the report of theConference on Constitutional Advance in Malaya.The Colonial Secretary said that in Annex C of his memorandumhe had listed the main points to which he wished to draw the attentionof the Cabinet. All the issues before the Conference had been settledamicably and the agreed recommendations were within the scopeof the authority which he had been given by the Cabinet on17th January. The Conference of Rulers in Malaya were meetingon 28th February to consider the report, and he would like to beable to inform the High Commissioner in Malaya before that dateof the Government&apos;s views on the report.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) All the recommendations relating to defence and internalsecurity had been considered and approved by the Chiefs of Staffand the Minister of Defence.(h) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the financialarrangements appeared to be satisfactory. Although he had not yethad an opportunity to study them in detail, he was prepared to accept
11CM. 16 (56)the financial and economic recommendations listed in Annex C ofCP. (56) 47 on the understanding that they reflected fully the positionagreed by the Conference.(c) The outcome of the Conference would be generally welcomedby other members of the Commonwealth. In the Federation ofMalaya a fund of goodwill had been built up and it would be unwiseto attempt to postpone the meeting of the Rulers.The Cabinet (1) Approved the report of the Conference on ConstitutionalAdvance in Malaya, including the proposals for theConstitutional Commission as approved by theConference.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to inform the HighCommissioner in Malaya of the Government&apos;s attitudeto the report.Cyprus. 12.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus(Previous        was now on the point of concluding his discussions with ArchbishopReference:      Makarios.  On the main issues which had previously beer discussedCM. (56) 8th    by the Cabinet, the Governor and the Archbishop had come veryConclusions,     near to reaching an agreement.   At this final stage, however, theMinute 4.)      Archbishop had put the agreement in jeopardy by asking for anamnesty for all political offenders in Cyprus, including those nowlying under sentence of death.   The Governor was most reluctantto make any offer of an amnesty until the Archbishop had abjuredthe use of violence and had given practical proof of his ability toinduce his followers to abandon it.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit a memorandumdefining the stage reached in the discussions between theGovernor of Cyprus and Archbishop Makarios, andreserved their decision on the question of an amnesty inCyprus until they had had an opportunity of consideringthis memorandum.Nuc,ear 13.   The Minister of Defence said that planning for the seriesWeapons.       0f nuclear weapon tests to be held in the South-West Pacific in theTests in 1957.   spring of 1957 was now reaching the stage when some information(Previous        about the operation, which had hitherto been confined to a strictlyReference :      limited number of people, would have to be given a wider circulationCM. (55) 46th  if tne necessary preparations were to be completed in time. ForConclusions,    example, the military advance party, consisting of volunteers, wasMinute I.)      due to leave this country by mid-June.  A dredger would also haveto be chartered in Australia for deepening the harbour facilities atChristmas Island. These overt preparations would increase the riskthat knowledge of the operation would leak out.  The Minister ofSupply had therefore suggested that a short announcement aboutthe tests should be made during the forthcoming Defence debate.In discussion, doubts were expressed about the need to makean official announcement so far in advance of the date proposedfor the tests. Such an announcement would stimulate political con-troversy on the general question of nuclear tests, which might be moreembarrassing than an unofficial leakage about the operation. All
12necessary preparations should therefore proceed and the risk of anunofficial leakage about the operation should be accepted.The Cabinet Agreed that all necessary preparations for the nuclearweapon tests in the South-West Pacific in 1957 should goforward, but that no announcement about them should bemade for the time being.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1956.
