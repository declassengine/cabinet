2GovernmentExpenditure.Economies.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 42ndConclusions,Minute 7.)Education.Colonies.The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the means ofsecuring a reduction of  100 millions in Government expenditurein the current financial year. They took as the basis for theirdiscussion the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C.P. (56) 144) which they had had under consideration at theirmeeting earlier in the day.The Cabinet first discussed the proposals in paragraph 4 ofC.P. (56) 144 for the reduction of expenditure on education services.Under this head it was suggested that an economy of  5 4 millionsmight be made by increasing the price of school meals from 9d. to Is.and postponing capital expenditure on the provision of schoolkitchens, &amp;c. ( 5   1 millions) and by certain minor economies onother education services ( 0-3 millions).Discussion turned mainly on the expediency of increasing theprice of school meals. In favour of this course it was argued thatthe higher price of food would in itself justify an increase to I0d.,and that for most parents there would be no real hardship if thecharge were rounded off to Is. Government supporters wouldwelcome some reduction in public expenditure on education servicesand, within those services, it was difficult to find any other field inwhich there was scope for economy. It was also right that the socialservices as a whole should make some contribution towards the 100 millions; and other proposals which had been considered(e.g., the raising of prescription fees under the Health Service) werelikely to cause greater hardship, and more political difficulty, thanan increase in the charge for school meals. The Ministers on theSocial Services Sub-Committee, who had surveyed the whole of thisfield in their search for economies, were prepared to support thisproposal if it was absolutely necessary in order to enable theChancellor of the Exchequer to realise his aim of securing a totalsaving of  100 millions.On the other hand, it was recognised that there would bedisadvantages in departing from the principle, which had beenconsistently followed since the war, that the charge for school mealsshould not exceed the amount required to cover the actual cost ofthe food provided. On earlier occasions when increases had beenmade, assurances had been given that this principle would continueto be followed. It would also be specially awkward to make thisincrease at a time when legislation was being passed to increasefamily allowances. For the larger families it would nullify thebenefits of that legislation. It would certainly increase the pressurefor further increases in family allowances. More generally, it wouldexpose the Government to the criticism that they were seekingeconomies at the expense of children&apos;s health. It was likely that,especially in rural areas, the increased charge would have the effectthat fewer children took advantage of the service.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that the balance of theseconsiderations lay against increasing this charge beyond theamount required to cover the increased cost of the food provided.They provisionally agreed that under this head action shouldbe limited to increasing the charge to \0d. and delaying capitalexpenditure on the provision of school kitchens, &amp;c. Thesemeasures, together with the minor savings on other educationalservices, might yield in the current year an economy of 3i millions.In paragraph 6(a) of C.P. (56) 144 it was suggested that areduction of  1 million might be made in expenditure on Colonialdevelopment.The Colonial Secretary said that he had considered very carefullywhat contribution he could make towards the total economy desired,
3CM. 43 (56)and he had two specific proposals to make. First, the Governmentof Kenya had already been promised a loan of  2 millions; and hewas prepared to put to them a firm request that, in view of the urgentneed for economy, they should agree that the amount of this loanshould be reduced to  1| millions. Secondly, under the ColonialDevelopment and Welfare Act, while he could not reduce the actualprogrammes already announced by Colonial Governments, he wasprepared to arrange that demands on the Exchequer in the currentyear for this purpose would not exceed  17J millions. He made thisoffer on the condition that he would be authorised to say, whenoccasion arose, that this decision did not represent a reduction inthe total sum which Parliament had made available under theColonial Development and Welfare Act for Colonial developmentup till 1960, nor did it mean that there would be any slowing downin the rate of Colonial development; that what it did mean was thatdemands on the Exchequer in the current financial year would notexceed  17j millions; and that he was satisfied that this could beachieved without harm to Colonial development.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these twomeasures should together yield a saving of  1| millions. Heaccepted this contribution on the condition suggested by theColonial Secretary.Oversea In paragraph 6(b) of C.P. (56) 144 it was proposed that aInformation reduction of at least  1 million should be made in expenditure onServices. oversea information services.The Foreign Secretary said that he was under great pressureto expand these services, and there was certainly a case for increasingsome of the activities which came under this head. It was essentiallya problem of redeployment of expanding activities in somedirections and contracting in others. He was preparing a generalmemorandum on this subject for the Cabinet, and he would havepreferred that the problem should be considered as a whole beforeany specific decisions were taken. If, however, immediate economieswere required, he would be ready to consider urgently what could begained by discontinuing some of the foreign language broadcasts tocountries in Europe. This would accord with recommendations madein the Drogheda Report. He could not say what saving could besecured by this means in the current financial year, but he doubtedwhether it would exceed  .\ million.In discussion it was argued that the Government were engagedon a general readjustment of policy based on their appreciation thatthe immediate threat to the United Kingdom&apos;s position and influencein the world was now political and economic rather than military.Any drastic reduction in oversea information services might proveto be inconsistent with this changed emphasis in national policy. Onthat account it might be unwise to seek immediate economies underthis head until the general position had been more carefully assessed.It was agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldconsider further, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, whatimmediate savings could be secured by discontinuing foreignlanguage broadcasts to European countries, but that morewidespread changes in the oversea information services shouldbe deferred until the Cabinet had had an opportunity ofreviewing the scope and direction of those services as a whole.General. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a result of theprovisional conclusions reached by the Cabinet at their two meetingsthat day, the economies which he would be able to announce in hisstatement on 26th June would not total more than  72 millions.He invited the Cabinet to consider whether this was a sufficientcontribution towards his aim of securing a saving of  100 millionsbefore the end of the current financial year.
4The Chief Whip said that Government supporters would bedisappointed that better results had not been achieved. They wereexpecting the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce that the fullsaving of  100 millions was now in sight. The Opposition wouldexploit this opportunity to embarrass the Government. A difficultpolitical situation might therefore arise in the House of Commons.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances a determinedeffort should be made to bring the total nearer to the target figureof  100 millions. In his judgment, the right course was to look againat the possibility of some effective cut in defence production. Frominformal soundings which he had taken it was evident thatGovernment supporters were expecting a reduction in this part ofour defence programmes. And, on merits, this was the sector inwhich reductions in Government expenditure would bring thegreatest immediate relief to the economy by freeing men andmaterials for other work which might improve our balance ofpayments. He therefore suggested that the Minister of Defenceshould make further enquiries into the possibility of some earlyreduction in the bomber programme (e.g., cancellation of orders forValiant aircraft which were not already in production) and alsoperhaps in the naval construction programme. The results of theseenquiries could be considered at a special meeting to be held on18th June.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, tocontinue his search for further economies, in addition tothose provisionally approved at the Cabinet&apos;s two meetingsthat day, with the aim of enabling him to announce on26th June that savings were in sight which would securea reduction of at least  80 millions in Governmentexpenditure in the current financial year.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,15th June, 1956.
