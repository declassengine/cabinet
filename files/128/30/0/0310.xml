Suez Canal.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 85thConclusions.Minute 2.)C.M. 86 (56)1. The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the ForeignSecretary in New York (Nos. 1315, 1316, 1322 and 1323) giving hisassessment of the situation in the light of the further discussions hehad had with the Secretary-General of the United Nations andseeking guidance on the attitude which he should take up in theforthcoming debate in the General Assembly.The Lord Privy Seal said that it appeared from telegramNo. 1315 that the report which the Secretary-General proposed tomake to the General Assembly on his negotiations with the EgyptianGovernment would be reasonably satisfactory as regards thecomposition, functions and location of the United Nations force andthe conditions for its ultimate withdrawal. In these respects theForeign Secretary had persuaded the Secretary-General toacknowledge more positively the validity of our policy. On the otherhand it would be impossible for us to accept the statement thatclearance of the Suez Canal in the area occupied by Egyptian forceswould not begin (apart from survey and reconnaissance) until theAnglo-French force had been withdrawn.The Foreign Secretary had indicated that the choice before usnow lay between mobilising support in the United Nations by makingsome concession on the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force oradopting delaying tactics by retaining the Anglo-French force inPort Said as a bargaining counter.  The former course implied thatwe would be content to rely on the United Nations to secure themajor objectives in the Middle East which we had originallyenvisaged; the latter course involved the risk that our occupation ofPort Said, which had hitherto been an asset, would become a liability.The Prime Minister, who had been consulted, held the view that ourmain purpose should be actively to enlist the support of friendlycountries in the United Nations.  The problem of clearing the SuezCanal should therefore be separated from that of the withdrawal ofthe Anglo-French force.  The latter should be treated as a militaryoperation, to be carried out on the basis of a phased programme;and as an earnest of our intentions, we should offer to withdraw abattalion forthwith. The clearance of the Canal, on the other hand,should be regarded as a civilian operation which should, if possible,be   conducted   simultaneously   with   the   transfer   of militaryresponsibility under the auspices of the United Nations.   It shouldbe emphasised that our forces had already cleared that part of theCanal which was under Anglo-French control to an extent whichwould permit the passage of some 70 per cent, of the shippingnormally using the Canal: and we should repeat our offer to placeour salvage organisation at the disposal of the United Nations. Itwas, however, important that, in arguing our case before the GeneralAssembly, we should make it clear that we were relying on the UnitedNations to secure the objectives which they had themselves recognisedin the resolutions which they had adopted on 2nd, 5th and7th November. The task of ensuring a satisfactory settlement of theproblems of the Suez Canal and the Arab-Israeli dispute would thenrest clearly with the United Nations; and the consequences of anyfailure to achieve such a settlement would not be our responsibility.In discussion it was agreed that we should try to prevent asituation arising in which it could be argued that it was we who wereimpeding the re-opening of the Canal by dilatoriness in withdrawingour forces. Once our forces had been withdrawn, however, weshould no longer be in breach of a United Nations resolution: andwe should be free to urge the General Assembly to compel theEgyptian Government to comply with the resolution requiring themto allow the work of clearing the Canal to proceed under UnitedNations auspices. The success which we had already achieved inclearing the northern end of the Canal would rally the support of themany other nations which had important shipping interests. Thesearguments were reinforced by the economic consequences whichwould ensue if our industries were deprived of adequate supplies ofoil for a prolonged period.
4On the other hand there were obvious risks in withdrawing ourtroops with no certainty that any undertakings by the EgyptianGovernment to co-operate in the clearance of the Canal would infact be honoured with reasonable despatch. We might thereforeendeavour to minimise these risks by proposing that the withdrawalof our troops, the entry of United Nations forces and the clearance ofthe Canal should be synchronised in a phased time-table which wouldensure that the work of clearing the Canal in the Egyptian sectorwould at least have made some progress before the withdrawal of ourtroops was complete. But, in the last resort, the overriding needwas to adopt the course which was most likely to enlist the supportof the United Nations and the United States, and to convince publicopinion that we were not impeding the clearance of the Canal. Itwould also be desirable to ensure that Government supporters inthe House of Commons were made fully aware of the factors whicha realistic policy had to take into account in present circumstances.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a telegram should be submitted for the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval authorising the Foreign Secretary,subject to the agreement of the French Foreign Ministerin New York, to speak in the forthcoming debate in theGeneral Assembly on the lines agreed in their discussion.(2) Took note that the Lord Privy Seal, with the assistance ofother members of the Cabinet, would take steps to giveGovernment supporters further guidance on theconsiderations determining the Government&apos;s policy.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Two days would be devoted to the Committee Stage of theHomicide Bill.If agreement could not be reached with the Opposition on atime-table for the Committee Stage of the Rent Bill, it would benecessary to consider applying the guillotine to the discussion of thisBill in Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,21st November, 1956.m
