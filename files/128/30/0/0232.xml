3CM. 8 (56)Export of Arms,(PreviousReference:C.C. (52) 30thConclusions,Minute 4.)India.1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (56) 23) and the Commonwealth Secretary(CP. (56) 24) on certain proposals for the sale of war material toIndia and Pakistan.The Commonwealth Secretary said that negotiations had beenproceeding for some time for the sale of a substantial number ofBritish aircraft to India.  The Indians were ready to take a numberof Folland Gnats and Hunters, but difficulties had arisen over theconclusion of a contract for the supply of Canberra bombers by theEnglish Electric Company.  It was specially important that thiscontract should be concluded, as it was known that the Indians weretoying with the alternative of buying bomber aircraft from theRussians, who had offered to meet their requirements on veryfavourable terms.   There were still outstanding three obstacles tothe conclusion of the Canberra contract delivery dates, inclusionof specialised equipment for blind bombing, and price.  There wasgood reason to believe that the first two of these obstacles could beovercome.    Delivery dates could be accelerated by deferringdeliveries to the Royal Air Force; and the specialised equipmentcould be provided if the United States authorities could be persuadedto waive their security objections to its supply to India. Thereremained the difficulty about price. The English Electric Companyhad already agreed to reduce by  10,000 their original price of 209,000 per aircraft; and they were now prepared to reduce it by afurther  20,000 if the Ministry of Supply were ready to meet halfof this by a corresponding abatement of the levy payable on exportsales on account of research and development costs. It was, however,estimated that the contribution demanded of the Ministry of Supplywould involve the complete waiver of the research and developmentlevy in respect of these sales.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The amounts payable by way of research and developmentlevy had on occasion been abated in order to assist export sales.Total waiver of the levy would, however, constitute a precedentwhich might give rise to embarrassment in the future.(b) There was some reason to believe that the price originallyquoted by the English Electric Company was excessive. TheCompany were still unwilling to disclose what margin of profit itincluded. If the whole of the levy were waived, the United KingdomGovernment might well be subsidising the Company rather than theGovernment of India.(c) The United States authorities had not yet agreed to waivetheir security objections to the supply of the specialised bombingequipment to India. In order to overcome their objections, it mightbe necessary for the Prime Minister to make personal representationsabout this to President Eisenhower.id) There were strong political advantages to be gained byconcluding this contract. If the Indian Air Force were equipped withCanberras, as well as with Folland Gnats and Hunters, they wouldbe committed very largely to the use of British types of aircraft. If,on the other hand, their bomber squadrons were equipped withRussian aircraft, the Russians would have gained a foothold whichthey would not fail to exploit. Moreover, if India, as the leader ofneutralist opinion in Asia, decided to turn to Russia for militaryequipment, their lead was likely to be followed by other countries inAsia.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that the political considerations infavour of completing this contract for the supply of Canberraaircraft to the Indian Air Force outweighed the financial objectionsmentioned in the memoranda before the Cabinet and in theirdiscussion.49598 2 B 2
4The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that every effort should be made toconclude this contract for the supply of Canberra aircraftto the Indian Air Force.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to accept the delay, indelivery of Canberra aircraft to the Royal Air Force,which would be involved by the acceleration of deliveriesunder this Indian contract.(3) Agreed that, if the English Electric Company were willing tosupply these aircraft at a price of  179,000, the researchand development levy in respect of each aircraft suppliedcould be abated by  10,000.(4) Took note that the Lord Privy Seal would inform the PrimeMinister of the foregoing Conclusions and invite him topress President Eisenhower to waive any securityobjections which the United States authorities might haveto the supply of the specialised bombing equipment whichwas to be included in these aircraft.The Cabinet were informed that the Pakistan Government wereanxious to obtain about 100 Bofors guns which had become surplusto our requirements by reason of the decision to disband Anti-&apos; Aircraft Command. The market value of these guns was put atabout  50,000: their scrap value would be about  10,000. It hadbeen suggested that this surplus equipment might be supplied toPakistan as a free gift. There were, however, objections of principleto supplying arms free of charge, even to other Commonwealthcountries; and the Cabinet agreed that, if these guns were to besupplied to Pakistan, a nominal charge should be made for them.The Pakistan Government were also negotiating for the purchaseof five warships from this country. For these the Admiralty had beenhoping to obtain a sum of  1| millions. It was thought that thePakistan Government might be willing to pay  li millions for them.The Cabinet (5) Approved the sale to Pakistan of up to 100 Bofors gunssurplus to Army requirements at the best price whichcould be obtained within a range of  10,000 to  50,000.(6) Authorised the Admiralty to arrange, subject to the formalapproval of the Defence Committee, for the sale of fivewarships to Pakistan for a sum of not less than 1  millions.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that the Second Reading of the Transport(Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Bill should be taken on9th February. The Minister of Transport had represented that, ifthis debate could be postponed for a week, he might be able to enlistthe support of the few Government supporters who were stilldisposed to vote against it. The Cabinet were, however, assured thatvery few Government supporters would in fact vote against the Bill,and they concluded that the balance of advantage lay againstdeferring its Second Reading.Pakistan.Parliament.
5CM. 8 (56)Teachers&apos; 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Burnham CommitteeSuperannuation, had now decided to expedite their review of teachers&apos; salaries and(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)were expected to submit their recommendations towards the end ofSeptember. After consultation with the Lord Privy Seal and theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Education hadsuggested at a private meeting of Government supporters in the Houseof Commons that, in view of this development, the coming intooperation of the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill might be postponeduntil 1st October. This suggestion had met with a favourableresponse; and in Standing Committee on the Bill that morning theMinister would announce the Government&apos;s intention to bringforward an amendment having this effect. It was expected that thisannouncement would ease the passage of the Bill through StandingCommittee.The Scottish members of the Standing Committee had alsorepresented that the Bill&apos;s progress could be expedited if it could bearranged that the Scottish Grand Committee should devote four daysto discussion of its Scottish clauses. They were willing to undertakethat, if such an arrangement were made, they would refrain fromspeaking in Standing Committee &quot; D &quot; on those clauses of the Billwhich applied to England and Wales. The Secretary of State forScotland said that he would be prepared to consider this procedureif he were given a firm assurance that it would not impose an unduedelay on the progress of the Rating and Valuation (Scotland) Billthrough the Scottish Grand Committee.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the coming into operation of the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill should be deferred until 1st October,1956; and authorised the Minister of Education topropose the necessary amendment for this purpose duringthe Committee Stage of the Bill.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to discuss with the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Parliamentary Secretary,Treasury, whether the Committee Stage of this Bill couldbe shortened by arranging for its Scottish clauses to beconsidered separately by the Scottish Grand Committee.Cyprus.Broadcastsfrom Athens.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)DiscussionswithArchbishopMakarios.4. As a result of premature disclosures in the press, Questionshad been asked in the House of Commons on the previous day aboutthe Cabinet&apos;s decision of 23rd January that the Governor of Cyprusshould be authorised in certain circumstances to arrange fordiscriminate jamming of subversive broadcasts from Athens toCyprus. The Colonial Secretary had made it plain, in reply to theseQuestions, that the Government reserved the right to take anycounter-measures which they considered necessary and justified topreserve British and Cypriot lives from outrages directly provokedby these broadcasts. It was to be expected that there would befurther Parliamentary controversy if the Governor found it necessaryto jam these broadcasts. The Governor would not, however, takethis action while discussions with Archbishop Makarios continued;and, even if those discussions broke down, he would give 48 hours&apos;notice to the Colonial Secretary before he acted on the authoritygiven to him by the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 23rd January.The Governor&apos;s discussions with Archbishop Makarios had beensuspended so that the latter might have an opportunity of discussingthe Governor&apos;s proposals with a number of sectional interests inCyprus. As a result, there had been partial disclosures of the Britishoffer in Greek newspapers; and the Governor had suggested that thefull text of the offer could with advantage be officially announced in
6London. The Colonial Secretary said that he had considered thissuggestion, but was not in favour of adopting it. As soon as theformula was announced, parts of it would be subjected here tocriticisms which would tend to strengthen the Archbishop&apos;s positionand lessen the prospects of his ultimate acceptance of our offer. Inhis view, it would be better that he should make no further statementuntil he was in a position, not only to disclose the formula, but tospeak freely in justification of it. Meanwhile, the text of ourproposal had been communicated to the Turkish Government inAnkara and to the local Turkish representatives in Cyprus.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement made by the Colonial Secretaryin the House of Commons on the possibility ofinterference with subversive broadcasts from Athens toCyprus.(2) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should not for the timebeing make any further statement regarding the stagereached in the discussions between the Governor ofCyprus and Archbishop Makarios.NationalInsuranceScheme.Widows&apos;Benefits.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 4thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the question whetherthe Report of the National Insurance Advisory Committee onWidows&apos; Pensions and Benefits should be published at an early date.The Minister of Pensions said that the Home Affairs Committeehad not yet completed their consideration of the recommendations inthis Report. Moreover, it was now clear that, owing to the congestionin the legislative programme for the current session, legislation to giveeffect to these recommendations would have to be postponed untilthe following session. Nevertheless, he still considered that it wasimpracticable to delay the publication of the Report, and he soughtauthority to publish it on 3rd February. The announcement of theGovernment&apos;s attitude towards its recommendations would have tobe deferred until the Home Affairs Committee had completed theirconsideration of the Report.The Lord Privy Seal and The Chancellor of the Exchequerendorsed this view.The Cabinet (1) Authorised   the   Minister   of   Pensions   to   publish on3rd February the Report of the National InsuranceAdvisory Committee on Widows&apos; Pensions and Benefits.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to circulate in due coursefor their consideration a draft statement of the Govern-ment&apos;s attitude and intentions in regard to therecommendations in this Report.Industrial 6.   The Minister of Labour said that the current dispute in theDisputes. printing industry might well last a long time.   Moreover, as the two(Previous small unions involved had ample funds, it was possible that theReference: &quot; go slow &quot; policy which they were at present following might developCM. (55) 45th into strikes and stoppages.   The dispute was beginning to affect theConclusions, work of the Stationery Office, and he had therefore thought itMinute 9.) desirable to consider emergency arrangements for continuing thePrinting Trade, printing work essential to the business of the House of Commons.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in company with the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, he had discussed with the Speaker how theessential needs of the House of Commons could be met in the event of
7CM. 8 (56)a strike seriously affecting the work of the Stationery Office. TheSpeaker had agreed that Order Papers and shorter Bills could, ifnecessary, be presented in duplicated typescript; the restricted printingfacilities available to the Stationery Office being reserved for longerBills and other documents. The Cabinet should, however, be giventhe opportunity to consider the matter further before authority wasgiven to use volunteers for the printing of Parliamentary papers.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 1stConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 27) commenting on some of the secondaryrecommendations of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment.The Home Secretary said that a debate on capital punishmentwas due to be held in the House of Lords on 15th February on amotion by Lord Chorley. Efforts to persuade Lord Chorley topostpone this debate had so far been unsuccessful. It was, however,inexpedient that this subject should be debated in the House of Lordsbefore it had been discussed in the House of Commons; for, if theLords declared themselves strongly in favour of retaining the deathpenalty, moderate opinion in the House of Commons would be morelikely to swing in favour of abolition. He therefore hoped that itwould be possible to arrange for a debate to be held in the House ofCommons on 14th February, on a motion which would provide anopportunity for a clear vote for or against the retention of the leathpenalty. He suggested, however, that the Government would havea better chance of persuading the Commons to agree to the retentionof the death penalty if they offered to introduce legislation at theearliest practicable opportunity on three of the secondary recom-mendations of the Royal Commission, set out in paragraph 1 ofCP. (56) 27, and to appoint a suitable body to consider whetherthe doctrine of diminished responsibility, which already applied inScotland, should be extended to England and Wales. In his speechin the earlier debate on 10th November, he had made it plain thatthe Government, while they rejected the principal recommendationsof the Royal Commission, did not exclude the possibility of promotinglegislation at some future convenient date on some of the secondaryrecommendations in the Commission&apos;s report. And, since thatdebate, further support for some of those recommendations hadbeen expressed in a report by a Committee of the Inns of CourtConservative and Unionist Society, under the Chairmanship ofSir Lionel Heald, which was likely to exercise a substantial influenceover Government supporters in the House of Commons.In discussion the point was made that a statement on the linessuggested by the Home Secretary would give rise to the expectationthat it would be followed by early legislation an expectation whichwas bound, in the event, to be disappointed. Moreover, it might wellbe regarded as a reversal of the policy which the Home Secretary hadannounced in the debate on 10th November. The publication of thereport by Sir Lionel Heald&apos;s Committee could not be put forward asa reason for such a change of policy.As against this it was argued that, in his speech on10th November, the Home Secretary had clearly reserved theGovernment&apos;s right to introduce legislation on the secondaryrecommendations in the Royal Commission&apos;s report. There was apositive reason for making an early offer to introduce such legislation;for it would be easier to obtain a clear decision on the main issue ifthe Government offered to deal with the minor points on whichconcessions could be made to those who favoured the abolition of
8the death penalty. The Government&apos;s case for retaining the deathpenalty would certainly be weakened if they offered no positivesuggestion on these minor points.Further discussion showed that there was general agreement inthe Cabinet that this question should be debated in the House ofCommons before it was discussed in the House of Lords. A furtherattempt should be made to persuade Lord Chorley to postpone hismotion. If that failed, arrangements should be made to debate thequestion in the House of Commons on 14th February. If the debate g,were held on an Opposition motion the final speech before the divisionwould be made by an Opposition speaker. The debate shouldtherefore be held on a motion tabled either by the Government orby Sir Lionel Heald. This should be in terms favouring the retentionof the death penalty but advocating legislation on the secondarypoints set out in CP. (56) 27. It should be so framed that thelegislation foreshadowed in it would not extend to Scotland. It wasfurther agreed that back-bench supporters of the Government shouldbe allowed a free vote in the division on this motion. TheGovernment spokesman would, however, advise the House to votein favour of the motion, and members of the Government should notbe free to vote against that advice.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to make a furtherattempt to persuade Lord Chorley to postpone the motionon capital punishment which he had set down fordiscussion in the House of Lords on 15th February.(2) Agreed that arrangements should be made for this questionto be debated in the House of Commons soon after thePrime Minister&apos;s return from Washington and that, if itproved impossible to persuade Lord Chorley to postponehis motion in the House of Lords, the debate in the Houseof Commons should be held on 14th February.(3) Agreed that the debate in the House of Commons shouldbe held on a motion to be tabled by Sir Lionel Heald,M.P.; and invited the Lord Privy Seal to prepare asuitable form of motion, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.(4) Agreed that in the division on this motion back-benchsupporters of the Government should be allowed a freevote, but that members of the Government should notbe free to vote against the motion.(5) Agreed that the Home Secretary should be the firstGovernment spokesman in this debate and took notethat the Lord Privy Seal would consider, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and the ParliamentarySecretary, Treasury, whether the concluding speech onbehalf of the Government should be made by a seniormember of the Cabinet or by a Law Officer.Betting,Lotteriesand Gaming.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 1stConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Home Secretary said that he had been asked to considerwhether, in view of the congestion of the Government&apos;s legislativeprogrammes in the forthcoming session as well as in the currentsession, an announcement of the Government&apos;s intention to introducelegislation on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming should be postponedfor the time being. He felt, however, that an early announcementought to be made in view of the serious effect which the presentstate of the law was having on police discipline. In any event itshould be made clear, in the debate in the House of Lords on8th February, that the Government took a serious view of the presentstate of the law and intended to remedy it.
9CM. 8 (56)The Lord Privy Seal said that, from the preliminary reviewwhich he had carried out, it was already evident that the legislativeprogramme for the forthcoming session would be very congestedand that a number of desirable Bills would have to be dropped.While he agreed that an announcement of the Government&apos;s intentionto introduce legislation to remedy the betting law could not bedelayed unduly, he felt that the forthcoming debate in the House ofLords would provide an opportunity for assessing the trend ofopinion on this subject and that there would be advantage in takingthis into account in framing any announcement to be made in theHouse of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an announcement should be made in the Houseof Commons at an early date of the Government&apos;sintention to give effect to the recommendations of theRoyal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate the draft of suchan announcement for their consideration at a latermeeting and, in preparing it, to take into account anytrend of opinion on this subject which might be disclosedin the debate in the House of Lords on 8th February.Prospects.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 24thConclusions,Minute 1.)Fuel and Power 9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (56) 21) setting out his provisionalviews on short- and long-term fuel prospects, particularly with regardto coal.It was stated in the memorandum that, given the prospect ofsteadily increasing industrial production, the maximum practicableuse of oil and the eventual introduction of nuclear energy wereunlikely fully to meet the increase in our total fuel requirements inthe period up to 1970. It would be necessary, therefore, to planfor an increased output of 20 million tons of coal by 1960 and of30 million tons by 1970. The output of deep-mined coal had in factfallen by 3^ million tons in 1955 and the new &quot; charter &quot; which theminers claimed could not be granted without risking a loss in outputof 40 million tons.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in connection withlegislation which would be needed in the current session to extendthe borrowing authority of the National Coal Board, a new Plan forCoal, setting out a revised development programme for the industryfor several years ahead, would be ready in March. This wouldprovide an opportunity for a further review of the problems of theindustry. Meanwhile, he sought the support of his colleagues forthe one specific recommendation in his memorandum, viz., thatopen-cast mining should continue at the present level. He wouldwelcome the appointment of a small Committee of Ministers toassist him in dealing with this problem, especially in regard tocompensation, and in formulating a policy which would balance,with particular reference to the conditions obtaining in each regionalarea, the claims of agriculture and mining for the use of land.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion covered the following aspects of theproblem:  (a) Arrangements had been made to effect a saving of 10 millions in expenditure of imported coal.(b) The reserve which existed in the form of open-cast coalwas needed now in order to save foreign exchange rather than atsome later date. There should therefore be some modification ofthe priority given in recent years to the employment of better landfor agricultural purposes rather than for open-cast mining.   It was49598 2 C
10important, however, that open-cast mining operations in each areashould be planned ahead in a manner which would give farmersand landowners ample time in which to make their own dispositions.There should also be a right of appeal. Open-cast mining wouldcontinue to be unpopular with the agricultural community,especially if no provision were made for exempting the very bestfarming land.The Minister of Agriculture said that he would be ready toco-operate in a study of this problem on the lines suggested in theCabinet&apos;s discussion.(c) On the labour aspects of the problem various points weremade. Voluntary absenteeism, which was responsible for a loss inoutput of 3 million tons, amounted to 4 per cent, of working timein spite of the special incentive provided by the payment of a bonusequivalent of one day&apos;s wage to all miners who worked fiveconsecutive shifts. Total absences from work, including thoseattributable to sickness and accidents, amounted to 12 per cent, ofworking time. There was no prospect of persuading the miners toaccept special drafts of Italian labour directed to the pits. A betterresponse might be given to a policy of bringing in foreign workers tosupplement the general labour force and allowing some of these toseek employment thereafter in the mines. Success, however, inobtaining sufficient manpower in the mines was ultimately dependenton success in restraining inflation. There was little incentive,especially in Yorkshire and the West Midlands, to make mining acareer while inflation continued to create an excess of highly-paidjobs in other industries.(d) The tendency to exaggerate the future contribution of atomicenergy as an alternative source of fuel might well do harm to the coalindustry. It was clear that atomic energy would not have more than amarginal effect for a generation to come. Meanwhile there was adanger that young miners and mining engineers would be confirmed intheir conviction that coal was a dying industry.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (56) 21.(2) Appointed a Committee of Ministers consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),Secretary of State for Scotland,Minister of Agriculture,Minister of Housing,Minister of Works,Minister of Fuel and Power,or their representatives, to formulate and apply a revisedpolicy for open-cast mining, taking into account the pointsmade in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, and to report from timeto time to the Cabinet.Cotton. 10.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of(Previous the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 22) reporting that the cotton industryReference: had renewed their request that quota restrictions should be placedCM. (55) 9th on imports of cheap cotton cloth from India and Hong Kong, andConclusions, seeking authority to inform the industry that there were at present noMinute 3.) grounds for modifying the policy on this question which had beenannounced by the Prime Minister in the preceding May.The President of the Board of Trade said that the cotton industryhad in some respects an arguable case for seeking protection againstthe unrestricted entry of cotton piece-goods from Commonwealthcountries. But it would not be practicable to admit this case and toafford the protection sought without re-opening the whole question of
uCM. 8 (56)free entry for Commonwealth products of all kinds with potentiallyfar-reaching repercussions on our trade with Commonwealthcountries generally and therefore on our balance of payments. Thedecision to reject the industry&apos;s request for a quota had been taken inthe previous May only after the most careful consideration.Meanwhile the fortunes of the industry had improved and importsof cheap cloth had been less than had been feared. He proposed toinform the industry that the Government must adhere to the decisionthey had previously taken. The door would be left open for furtherrepresentations should the situation again deteriorate.The Cabinet were in general agreement with this proposal. Theyasked that the situation should be kept under review and that theyshould be informed of any developments.The Cabinet-Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to informthe cotton industry that the Government saw no grounds atpresent for modifying their decision not to afford quotaprotection against imports of cheap cotton cloth from Indiaand Hong Kong.Food.Danish Bacon.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)11. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (56) 25) and the Minister of Agriculture(CP. (56) 26) on the question whether the current tariff negotiationswith Denmark should be abandoned in favour of the continuation ofState trading in imported bacon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of themisgivings which the Prime Minister had expressed in their previousdiscussion about the expediency of imposing a new tariff on food ata time when it was a primary object of Government policy to reducethe cost of living, he had felt obliged to reconsider this question and toset out the issues in more detail for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration. Onreflection, however, he felt unable to recommend that the tariffnegotiations should be abandoned in favour of continued Statetrading. We had no power to compel the Danes to enter into furtherbulk contracts when the present contract came to an end in September,and we might well find ourselves in the position of having no bulkcontract to serve as the basis for continued State trading and havingat the same time no tariff protection. From enquiries he had madehe was satisfied that the Danes, who were anxious to preserve theirposition in the United Kingdom market, would not be disposed todump excessive quantities of bacon here although, if they wererestrained only by a tariff, it would be open to them to do so.The Minister of Agriculture said that, of the alternative courses,the imposition of a tariff would be less likely to be fraught withtroublesome consequences. He did not expect a flood of Danishbacon on the United Kingdom market.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the current negotiations on the import of baconfrom Denmark should continue on the basis that a 10 percent, tariff would be imposed on imports into the UnitedKingdom.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to submit to theLord Privy Seal, after consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture, the draftof any statement on this subject which he might find itnecessary to make in the House of Commons.
1212. The Colonial Secretary said that Roman Catholics in Maltawere concerned lest their liberties should be affected by theconstitutional changes which might result from the recommendationsof the Round Table Conference on Malta. He proposed to state, inreply to a Question in the House of Commons on 1st February, thatthe United Kingdom Government would take no action to prejudicethe position of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the reply which the Colonial Secretaryproposed to give in the House of Commons on1st February to a Question by Mr. James Griffiths, M.P.,about the interests of the Roman Catholic Church inMalta.The Colonial Secretary said that Government supporters in theHouse of Commons were concerned about the conduct of theforthcoming referendum in Malta. It had been suggested that sixMembers of the House of Commons three Government supportersand three members of the Opposition should go out to Malta toobserve the referendum and to see that it was fairly conducted.In discussion it was pointed out that these observers would haveno means of influencing the conduct of the referendum and that theirpresence would not afford any assurance that it would be conductedproperly.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to attend a meeting to beheld on 2nd February by the Commonwealth AffairsCommittee of Government supporters in the House ofCommons and to persuade them of the inexpediency ofsending out Members of the House of Commons toobserve the conduct of the forthcoming referendum inMalta.Malta.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute?.)  Washington ] 3.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, in the course of the Cabinet&apos;sTalks. meeting, he had received from Washington the text of a declarationof the aims and purposes of Anglo-American policy which it wasproposed to make public at the conclusion of the current discussionsbetween the Prime Minister and President Eisenhower in Washington.The Prime Minister had asked for the Cabinet&apos;s comments on theterms of the proposed declaration. An immediate reply wasrequested. He therefore proposed to consult with those of hiscolleagues who were immediately available and to communicate to thePrime Minister such comments as they had to offer on the draftdeclaration.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to reply on their behalf tothe Prime Minister&apos;s request for comments on the termsof a draft declaration on the aims and purposes ofAnglo-American policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,1st February, 1956.
