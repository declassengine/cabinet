3CM. 44 (56)Ministers&apos; 1.   The Prime  Minister said  that  the  Chairman  of theSpeeches. Conservative Party had sent him a report on the number of politicalspeeches made outside Parliament by members of the Cabinet. Herecognised that Departmental duties made it more difficult for someMinisters than for others to accept these speaking engagements; buthe hoped that, in these difficult times, all his colleagues would dotheir best to help in presenting and explaining Government policyto the public. He suggested that they should keep in touch with theConservative Central Office on this.^ The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Elecricity. 2.   The Prime Minister drew attention to the decision of thePrices. Central Electricity Authority to ask the Area Electricity Boards inEngland and Wales not to increase their prices before 31st March,1957. This request applied to non-industrial consumers only: itmeant that about half of the extra cost due to increased coal priceswould not be passed on to consumers of electricity. The cost of thisconcession would be met from reserves: it was estimated that theelectricity industry as a whole would still earn a small surplus of 5 millions in the current year.In discussion it was agreed that, if the Government were calledupon to comment on this action, they should welcome it as a usefulcontribution towards their policy of seeking a period of stability inprices and wages. It should, however, be made clear that the decisionhad not been imposed by the Government but had been taken by theAuthority itself.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and of theattitude which Government spokesmen would adopt towardsthis decision of the Central Electricity Authority.Soviet Union.Trade.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 31stConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had received from theSoviet Ambassador a proposal that trade experts from the SovietUnion should visit the United Kingdom in the near future to discussdetailed means of increasing Anglo-Soviet trade, in accordance withthe offer made while the Soviet leaders were in London in April,and also to visit representative industrial undertakings in this country.This proposal should be welcomed in principle, but the timing ofthe visit might need consideration if special importance was attachedto the second part of the proposal. It might take some time to arrangea suitable tour of British industry.In discussion it was agreed that, in following up this proposal,we should attach primary importance to the practical task of makingdetailed arrangements for the desired expansion of Anglo-Soviettrade. Visits to industrial undertakings in this country should besecondary to this main purpose. On that basis we should suggestthat the visit should take place at the earliest practicable date.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to arrange for an earlyvisit of Soviet trade experts to this country with a view tocarrying forward the detailed arrangements for an expansionof Anglo-Soviet trade.50202 2 B 2
4Libya.(PreviousReference:C.C. (55) 9thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister of Libya,who was now paying a short visit to London, was putting forwardextravagant demands for further financial aid. He had evidentlyreceived competing offers of assistance from the Soviet Union andfrom Egypt; and he was taking the line that, unless we were preparedto give him further support, the continuance of the Anglo-LibyanTreaty would be in jeopardy. It seemed unlikely that we shouldbe able to satisfy his demands unless the United States Governmentwere prepared to increase the level of their assistance to Libya, andwe might have to consider seriously how much we were preparedto pay for the continuance of this Treaty. On this point he mightneed to consult further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andsome of his other colleagues before the Libyan Prime Minister leftLondon at the end of the week.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 6.)Future Policy.5. The Cabinet were informed that, since their meeting on12th June, the Colonial Policy Committee had continued theirconsideration of the future course of Government policy in Cyprus,and the views of the Turkish Government had been sought on arevised version of the second of the two alternative courses whichhad been outlined to the Cabinet at that meeting. The presentproposal was that a new statement of policy should be made on thefollowing lines:  The United Kingdom Government would press ahead with theframing of a constitution for Cyprus: Lord Radcliffe would starton this at once, as Constitutional Commissioner, and it was hopedthat he would be able at an early stage to bring into consultationrepresentatives of the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus. Itwas the Government&apos;s intention that the constitution thus evolvedshould be brought into effect as soon as possible, provided that lawand order in the Island had been fully restored. As regards the futurestatus of Cyprus, the Government had already accepted the principleof self-determination; but no change would be made in theinternational status of the Island until (i) a treaty had been concludedbetween the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey regulating in theircommon interest its use for military purposes; and (ii) special treatyarrangements had been made to safeguard the interests of racialminorities. The first of these treaties would provide that the UnitedKingdom should continue to be responsible for the external defenceof Cyprus and to enjoy such facilities in the Island as were necessaryfor this purpose and for discharging British treaty obligations inthe Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It would alsoinclude provision for defence zones over which the United Kingdomwould retain permanent sovereignty. At the end of ten years afterthe entry into force of the new constitution the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to raise with their fellow-membersof the North Atlantic Alliance the question whether, in the situationthen obtaining, a change in the international status of Cyprus wouldbe compatible with the interests of Western defence in the EasternMediterranean and the Middle East. If two-thirds of the membersof the Alliance answered this question in the affirmative, and if thetreaties above mentioned had been concluded, a plebiscite would thenbe held on the issue of self-determination. It was an essential elementof this plan that the question of self-determination should not beraised internationally by the three Governments, or be discussedbetween them, during the intervening period of ten years; and thatall parties concerned should co-operate fully in the restoration andmaintenance of law and order in Cyprus.
5CM. 44 (56)The Cabinet were informed that the special provision forpermanent defence zones under British sovereignty had been addedin view of the initial Turkish reactions to these proposals. It wasintended that we should supplement this by an offer to the Turksthat they might have use of the military facilities in the zones retainedunder our sovereignty.The considered views of the Turkish Government were nowawaited. Meanwhile, steps were being taken to ascertain whetherthe United States Government would be prepared to support a newinitiative on these lines.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the latest proposals on thefuture course of Government policy in Cyprus.Detention of The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus hadPrisoners. suggested that certain prisoners now serving long sentences in Cyprusfor offences arising out of the emergency should be transferred toprisons in the United Kingdom. This suggestion was made partlybecause of doubts about the reliability of Cypriot warders and partlybecause the transfer would discourage hopes of any early remissionof sentences. It would be unusual to transfer prisoners from aColony on these grounds but he would like, if possible, to meet theGovernor&apos;s wishes in this matter.The Home Secretary said that the powers of transfer under theColonial Prisoners (Removal) Act, 1884, were normally used for thebenefit of the prisoner, e.g., when it was thought that the conditionsin which he was detained overseas might be detrimental to health.The use of these powers for the purpose now suggested might giverise to criticism. Many of the prisoners concerned were under21 years of age; and, in the present temper of opinion, their transferto the United Kingdom was likely to be represented as exile fromtheir native land.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that it would be undesirable, at any rate for the present,to transfer these prisoners to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that it would be undesirable at present to transferto prisons in the United Kingdom persons serving longsentences of imprisonment in Cyprus for offences arisingout of the emergency.Greece. 6.   The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to the action taken byInterception of Greek military aircraft on the previous day in intercepting a BritishBritish Airliner, airliner and forcing it to land at Athens airport. It was alleged thatthe aircraft had deviated from the approved international route,and its departure from Athens had been delayed for more than anhour. It was reported that the captain of the aircraft had deniedthe charge that he had deviated from the approved route.The full facts of this incident were not yet known. It was,however, suggested in discussion that, if the facts warranted it, astrong note of protest should be lodged with the Greek Government.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, when the fullfacts were known, whether a suitable protest should notbe made against this action of the Greek authorities ininterfering with a British airliner.
6Egypt.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that General Sir Brian Robertson(the Chairman of the British Transport Commission) had acceptedan invitation to attend the ceremonies which were being held inCairo to celebrate the terminal date of the Anglo-EgyptianAgreement. This invitation had been extended to him on accountof the part which he had played, as Commander-in-Chief, MiddleEast, in the negotiation of the Agreement. His acceptance of theinvitation had given rise to some unfavourable comment among asection of Government supporters in the House of Commons, and amotion had now been tabled which deprecated the Government&apos;saction in approving his attendance at these ceremonies.The Prime Minister said that he had considered this question,with the Foreign Secretary, before the invitation had been accepted.He did not believe, that its acceptance would be misunderstood inEgypt, and General Robertson would know how to express hisdispleasure if the ceremonies were used as an occasion for anti-Britishdemonstrations.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.France.Visit ofPrime Ministerand ForeignSecretary.8. The Cabinet were informed that the French Governmenthad invited the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to visitParis in the second half of July for discussion of internationalquestions of common concern to the two countries.In discussion it was recognised that no practical results werelikely to flow from such a visit and that the main purpose of theinvitation was to strengthen the internal position of the FrenchGovernment. It would not be easy to find a convenient date for thevisit, in view of the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters and the State visit of King Faisal of Iraq.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to accept this invitation inprinciple but to explain to the French Government thereasons why it might be difficult to arrange for the visitto take place in July.Postage Stamps. 9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (CP. (56) 148) seeking their views on a proposal that postagestamps of an individual design should be printed for issue in threedenominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and in onedenomination in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.The Postmaster-General said that the proposal contemplated nofundamental change in the design of our stamps. The portrait ofthe Sovereign would continue to be the central feature of the design,but the surrounding border would include some motif or symbolappropriate to the part of the United Kingdom in which the stampwas issued. The proposal would yield additional revenue of  500,000.If the Cabinet agreed, the proposal would be submitted to HerMajesty for approval.The Home Secretary said that he favoured this proposal. Inhis view the issue of such separate stamps for Wales would not beturned to account by the nationalist movement there, and theSecretary of State for Scotland had authorised him to say that hewas of the same opinion regarding the issue of separate stamps forScotland.
7CM. 44 (56)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this innovation mightprovoke a demand for the further development of a separate coinage,the cost of which might be greater than the non-recurring revenueyield to be expected from the issue of separate stamps. He wouldnot, however, resist the proposal if his colleagues saw a balance ofadvantage in it on political grounds.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Home Affairs Committee,who had considered the matter fully, had reached the conclusionthat the proposal would provide a satisfactory means of gratifyingnational sentiment while at the same time yielding some additionalrevenue.  They therefore supported it.In discussion the view was expressed that this innovation mighthave the effect of stirring up nationalist sentiment which was atpresent dormant. The balance of opinion in the Cabinet lay,however, in favour of the proposal as a harmless means of givingsatisfaction to national feeling in the constituent parts of the UnitedKingdom without serious risk of encouraging separatist movements.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C.P. (56) 148 and authorised thePostmaster-General to submit it for Her Majesty&apos;s approval.North AtlanticTreatyOrganisation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 1.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C.P. (56) 142) on the future of the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).The Foreign Secretary recalled that at their meeting in May theNorth Atlantic Council had appointed a Committee of Three toconsider means of improving and extending N.A.T.O. co-operationin non-military fields and developing greater unity within the AtlanticCommunity. This Committee would shortly be inviting the viewsof the United Kingdom Government on this question, and he hadset out in C.P. (56) 142 the suggestions which he proposed to maketo them about the directions in which the political and economicactivities of N.A.T.O. might be developed. He also proposed towarn the Committee of certain lines of development which, in hisview, would be unprofitable.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In economic matters it would be important to avoid anyoverlapping or duplication of work between N.A.T.O. and theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation.(b) Caution would be needed in developing Parliamentaryactivities connected with N.A.T.O.(c) In this connection the point was made that few contacts werenow established between Members of Parliament and members ofthe United States Congress. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s attention hadbeen drawn to this point.(d) No reference was made in C.P. (56) 142 to the possibilityof increasing cultural activities in N.A.T.O. It was suggested thatN.A.T.O. might undertake a useful role in co-ordinating some ofthe diverse international activities now conducted on culturalquestions.The Cabinet (1) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum (C.P. (56)142) as a basis for discussion with the Committeeappointed by the North Atlantic Council to considermeans of improving and extending the political andeconomic activities of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation.
8(2) Invited the Minister of Education to discuss with the ForeignSecretary means by which the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation might play a practical part in co-ordinatinginternational consideration of cultural subjects.The Prime Minister said that the cohesion and vitality of theNorth Atlantic Alliance could not be preserved by measures limitedto the development of its political and economic activities. It waseven more important that the military policy of the Alliance shouldbe adjusted to meet the changed strategic situation. This need hadbeen considered in the course of the review of defence policy whichwas being undertaken by a special group of Ministers under hischairmanship. As a result of their discussions an approach had nowbeen made to the Governments of the United States and Canadasuggesting that an early initiative should be taken in the NorthAtlantic Council with a view to a reappraisal of the military policyof the Alliance and the issue of a new political directive to guidethe planning and preparations of its military authorities. The PrimeMinister informed the Cabinet of the terms of the communicationon this subject which had been addressed to these two Governments.Their initial response had not been unpromising. Both Governmentshad evidently been thinking on rather similar lines. There were,however, indications that the United States Government, at any rate,might consider that the proposed initiative in the North AtlanticCouncil should be delayed, at least until the United States Congresshad passed the current appropriations for foreign aid and the GermanParliament had enacted legislation authorising the German militarycontribution to N.A.T.O.The Foreign Secretary said that it was important that theproposed initiative should be so made, and timed, that it would notjeopardise the German Chancellor&apos;s efforts to secure Parliamentaryauthority for an appropriate German contribution to the militarystrength of the Alliance. From that point of view it might bedesirable that some official disclosure of our attitude should be made;for that might be less dangerous than the rumours which were nowcirculating. It might also be useful if the German Government couldbe brought into consultation at an early stage. For this purpose itmight be suggested that, in the first instance, there should be someinformal discussion between the Powers represented on the StandingGroup and Germany. A further complication was the Soviet noteof 6th June proposing that the other Powers concerned should reducetheir forces in Germany. It was clear that no substantive reply couldbe returned to this until further progress had been made towardsa general reappraisal of the military policy of N.A.T.O. Some interimreply would therefore have to be returned to the Soviet note.The Prime Minister said that he would consider further, withthose of his colleagues who were most closely concerned, the tacticsfor pursuing the initiative which we had taken in this matter withthe Governments of the United States and Canada.The Cabinet (3) Took note with approval, of the steps which had been takento secure a reappraisal of the military policy of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation.Government 11.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported to the CabinetExpenditure.    the results of the further consultations which he had held, since theirEconomies.      meetings on 14th June, on the savings to be made in Government(Previous       expenditure in the current year.Reference:CM. (56) 43rdConclusions.)
9CM. 44 (56)Defence. The proposed savings on defence expenditure now amountedto  364 millions. It had been necessary to reduce by  4 millionsthe figure of  34 millions which the Cabinet had previouslyconsidered, in order to avoid taking credit for reductions attributableto delays in the delivery of equipment rather than to cuts inprogrammes. The Service Ministers had, however, found scope forfurther savings which gave the new and higher total of  36^ millions.Home Defence. It was now clear that, for technical reasons, he could take creditfor only  | million of the saving of  4 millions in expenditure onstrategic stocks which had previously been foreshadowed. The totalsavings on home defence would therefore amount to  13i millionsinstead of  16^ millions. It would, however, be legitimate to explainin a footnote that the actual reduction in expenditure on strategicstocks would total  10 millions.Social Services. The suggestion was made that credit could not properly be takenfor that part of the saving on the school meals service which wouldresult from a reduction in capital investment on school kitchens, &amp;c.This was financed by loan. Some additional savings might beexpected as a result of the restraint which the local authorities wereexercising in carrying out minor works, but there was similar difficultyin claiming credit for this reduction.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it should be possibleto include some reference to these savings in his forthcomingstatement and he would consult further with the Minister ofEducation on this point.Foreign Office The total saving on other civil expenditure was nowExpenditure.     ] 1| millions, and included  500,000 on oversea information services.The Foreign Secretary said that he doubted whether this lattersaving could be realised because a reduction in the scope of theservices would not bring with it a corresponding immediatereduction in the cost of overheads. He would consider this furtherin consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. On the otherhand, he was now more disposed to agree that the saving on theloan to Jordan might be disclosed in the revised Estimates. On thispoint also he would consult further with the Chancellor of theExchequer.General. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the latest decisionsthe total prospective savings might amount to  75| millions, thoughit had yet to be finally decided whether  500,000 or a lower figureshould be credited in respect of savings on oversea informationservices and whether the prospective loan of  750,000 to Jordanshould be included or excluded. The review had been conductedon the basis of achieving economies through cuts in the Estimatesas presented. Revised Estimates would be presented when reductionsof  1 million or more were to be made. The savings on defence tookno account of long-term changes to be made in the size and shapeof the Armed Forces as a result of a new strategic concept. Thesepoints would be emphasised in his forthcoming statement.In this part of the discussion the following points were made:  (a) The view was expressed that the savings achieved would dolittle to meet the major problem of easing the economic situation byrelieving the pressure on industrial resources in men and equipment.It was suggested that, from this point of view, it would be valuableif an immediate decision could be taken to reduce the burden whichthe production of bomber aircraft was imposing on the nationaleconomy, e.g., by so adjusting the production programmes for Vulcanand Victor bombers as to defer the date on which we should reach thefront-line strength which had been planned.50202 2 c
10The Minister of Defence said that it would be inexpedient tocurtail the bomber programme abruptly before we had discussed withthe United States Government and our other Allies in N.A.T.O. theimplications of the changing strategic position. Moreover, theprogramme of United States aid (Plan K) under which we werereceiving assistance to a value of some $70 millions for our fighterprogramme would be jeopardised if we were to take such a course.The future of the bomber programme, as well as other aspects of ourmilitary and naval needs, was already under urgent consideration inrelation to the new strategic concept. An announcement of further Jsavings could be made before Parliament rose for the summer recessif this examination and the proposed discussions with our Alliesproceeded rapidly enough to make this possible. In any event, it wascontemplated that an announcement of supplementary economieswould be made in the autumn and any statement of further savingswhich might be achieved in military expenditure on account of thechanging strategic position could be made at that time, if it were notpracticable to do so earlier.(b) The view was expressed that total savings of the order of 75 millions as against an undertaking to achieve economies of 100 millions would evoke some criticism in Parliament, particularlyamong Government supporters. Nevertheless this total, on the basison which the review had been conducted, represented a substantialachievement and further savings could be foreshadowed for theautumn. If it had been possible to save  100 millions withoutdifficulty, the Government would have been exposed to the criticismthat too much latitude had been taken in framing the Estimates.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the ForeignSecretary to settle, in consultation, the amount to beincluded in the total of economies on account of savingson oversea information services and on the proposed loanto Jordan.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, took note with approval ofthe total figure of economies resulting from the reviewwhich had been conducted, and authorised the Chancellorof the Exchequer to announce this total and itscomposition in a statement in the House of Commons inthe following week.12. The Cabinet discussed the extent to which the Governmentwould be justified, because of the consequences for the generaleconomic situation, in attempting to influence the forthcomingdetermination by the Agricultural Wages Board of the pending wagesclaim for farm-workers. They had before them drafts of amemorandum of evidence and of a letter to the President of theNational Farmers&apos; Union which had been prepared by theChancellor of the Exchequer, and an alternative draft of this letterprepared by the Minister of Agriculture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this decision of theAgricultural Wages Board would be of crucial importance in thepresent economic situation. If a substantial increase in agriculturalwages were awarded this would provide an impulse for furtherpressure for wage advances in industry and would jeopardise thesuccess of the Government&apos;s efforts to achieve a period of stability inwages and prices. The drafts which he had circulated had beendesigned to make these consequences clear to the Board and to make  it plain to the farmers&apos; unions that they could not expect to achieve &apos;through the machinery of a Special Review any automatic recoupmentEconomicSituation.AgriculturalWages.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 4.)
11CM. 44 (56)of the additional costs which would result from an increase in wages.It was a delicate matter, however, for the Government to intervenein wages arbitration of this kind and the Cabinet would wish toconsider whether it would be justifiable to go as far as hisdrafts proposed.The Minister of Agriculture said that he was very doubtfulwhether it would be wise for the Government to intervene so in thismatter. The Board were already being criticised by the trade unionsfor laying undue emphasis on the national economic situation andtoo little emphasis on the relative position of agricultural workers.The Chairman and independent members of the Board were sensitiveto this criticism and would interpret any forthright indication of theGovernment&apos;s attitude as an attempt to influence their judgment.The unions would take the same view. He had no doubt that theChairman of the Board would prove receptive to the line of argumentin the draft memorandum. But he felt that the memorandum ofevidence on the economic situation should not be related directly tothe issue before the Board but should consist mainly of extracts fromrecent Government statements and speeches by Ministers from whichthe independent members could be expected to draw the appropriateinferences.As regards the draft letter to the President of the NationalFarmers&apos; Union, he felt that the argument would be more palatablewithout losing its force if it were linked more closely to the proposalswhich were under consideration for long-term guarantees for thefarming industry.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour said that itwould tend to jeopardise the successful operation of the jointmachinery for wages negotiation and arbitration in industry generallyif the Government were to appear to attempt directly to influence thefindings of the Agricultural Wages Board. This in itself would haveserious consequences for the stabilisation policy. Although anyadvance in agricultural wages at the present time would have therepercussions which had been foreseen, any attempt to influence theforthcoming determination should be discreet enough to avoid theappearance of actual intervention.Further discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreementwith the course proposed by the Minister of Agriculture. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that the matter was primarily oneof tactics and he would be content if this course were followed.The Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Minister of Agriculture withregard to the evidence on the general economic situationwhich the Government should lay before the AgriculturalWages Board, and the communication which should be sentto the National Farmers&apos; Union.Afro-AsianConference.Loss of IndianAirliner.(PreviousReference:C-M. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 8.)13. The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of HongKong was anxious to dispose of the thirteen Chinese who had beenheld in custody for more than a year on suspicion of complicity inthe sabotage of the Indian airliner &quot; Kashmir Princess &quot; which hadbeen wrecked off Indonesia while carrying part of the Chinesedelegation to the Afro-Asian Conference at Bandoeng. Despitesearching enquiries no sufficient evidence had been found to justifyproceedings against any of these men on a specific criminal charge.The Governor therefore proposed that they should now be deportedto Formosa.
12The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to authorise the Governor ofHong Kong to deport to Formosa the Chinese who had beenarrested in the course of the enquiries into the sabotage ofthe Indian airliner &quot; Kashmir Princess.&quot;Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,J 9th June, 1956.
