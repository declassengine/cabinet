3CM. 15 (56)NorthernIrelandParliament.Disqualification.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 39) regarding the disqualification of certainMembers of the Senate and House of Commons of Northern Ireland.The Home Secretary said that the disqualification of theseMembers had been established by Select Committees of the twoHouses of Parliament in Northern Ireland. Each House had nowpassed a resolution accepting the report of its Select Committeeand asking that legislation should be passed by the Parliament atWestminster to indemnify these Members and to validate theirelections. He proposed that the reports of the Select Committeesshould now be presented to Parliament together with a White Paperin the terms of the draft set out in Annex A of CP. (56) 39, and thatlegislation should be introduced as soon as possible thereafter toindemnify those concerned and to validate their elections.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary to present to Parliament on20th February the reports of the two Select Committeesand an explanatory White Paper in the terms of the draftset out in Annex A of CP. (56) 39.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in the Houseof Commons, in the terms of the draft set out in Annex Bof CP. (56) 39, foreshadowing the early introduction oflegislation to indemnify the Members concerned and tovalidate their elections.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 20th February the Prime Minister would move a LoyalAddress welcoming The Queen and His Royal Highness the Dukeof Edinburgh on their return from their visit to Nigeria.On 20th and 21st February there would be a debate on economicaffairs on a Government motion inviting the House to express theirconfidence in the measures which the Chancellor of the Exchequerproposed to take to deal with the economic situation. The Chancellorof the Exchequer would open this debate. On the second day, unlessthe course of the discussion made it necessary for the Prime Ministerhimself to reply to the debate, the Government spokesmen would bethe Economic Secretary, Treasury, and the President of the Boardof Trade.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 14thConclusions.)*3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since theCabinet&apos;s discussion on the previous day, he had again consideredhow the changes which he proposed to make in the taxation allow-ances for investment could be adapted for the benefit of theshipbuilding industry. He had originally intended that theinvestment allowances should continue to be payable in respect ofexpenditure on shipbuilding projects already started, even thoughthe constituent contracts had not all been placed. He recognised,however, that this concession would not fully meet the views of hisOriginally recorded in a Confidential Annex.49609 3b 2
4colleagues, who were anxious that the investment allowances shouldcontinue to be payable on future projects for the construction of ships,as well as those already started. He had therefore decided to broadenhis original exemption, which he had hitherto intended to extendonly to capital expenditure on scientific research assets; and he nowproposed that all capital expenditure on the construction of ships andon scientific research assets should continue to qualify for theinvestment allowances.The Minister of Agriculture said that he was concerned aboutthe application of the Chancellor&apos;s proposal to certain capitalexpenditure by farmers. Expenditure on the improvement of farmbuildings, and on the improvement of farm-workers&apos; cottages did notqualify for the initial allowances; and he asked whether these typesof expenditure could not similarly be exempted from the proposedsuspension of the investment allowances. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, while he would be reluctant to broaden theexemptions to be announced in his initial statement, this was a pointwhich might be considered during the Committee Stage of theFinance Bill.The Cabinet Approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequerthat the suspension of investment allowances should notapply to capital expenditure on the construction of ships;and took note that the question of a similar exemption infavour of certain types of capital expenditure in agriculturecould be considered during the Committee Stage of theFinance Bill.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(PreviousReference:C.C. (54) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that the leaders of the Oppositioncontinued to press for an early increase in the remuneration ofMembers of the House of Commons. They considered that Members&apos;salaries should be raised to  1,500 a year. They would not besatisfied with an increase in the sessional allowances to coverattendance on Fridays. They had made it clear that they would beunwilling to support any proposal to increase the salaries of juniorMinisters until after the salaries of Members had been raised and asystem of allowances for Peers had been introduced. They also urgedthat further steps should be taken to increase the funds available forassisting retired members of the House of Commons.The Cabinet recognised that Government supporters would bestrongly opposed to any proposal for increasing the salaries ofMembers. Later in the session, however, it might be possible tomake some increase in the sessional allowances and by this means toenlist sufficient support for legislation to increase the salaries ofjunior Ministers. Meanwhile, some Exchequer contribution mightperhaps be made to the Members&apos; Fund, so as to increase the resourcesavailable for assisting retired members of the House of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to reject the representations madeon behalf of the Labour Opposition in favour of an earlyincrease in Members&apos; salaries.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whethersome Exchequer contribution could not be made to theMembers&apos; Fund so as to increase the resources availablefor assisting retired Members of the House of Commons.
5CM. 15 (56)Export of Anns.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 9thConclusions,Minute 2.)Argentina.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 38) recommending that authority should be givenfor the sale of Shackleton and Canberra aircraft to Argentina, butthat the proposed sale of an aircraft carrier to Argentina shouldbe reviewed in the light of the forthcoming discussions with theUnited States Government on Antarctica.The Foreign Secretary said that these proposals were consistentwith the Cabinet&apos;s decision that no attempt should be made to evictthe Argentines and Chileans by force from their bases in the Antarctic.The new Government in Argentina were pursuing a less aggressivepolicy in the Antarctic and were showing signs of reaching aneventual accommodation with us. In these circumstances it wasdoubtful whether political and strategic considerations made itnecessary for us to forgo the trade which we should gain in the longerterm from these sales of aircraft.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) As Argentina already had Lincoln bombers, the supply ofShackleton and Canberra aircraft would not fundamentally affect hermilitary strength. In any event the Argentines would realise whatconsequences would follow from any aggressive action against theFalkland Islands themselves.(h) The Argentine order would not interfere with the deliveryof Canberra aircraft to the Royal Air Force or to India. The sales,both of Canberras and Shackletons, would be on normal commercialterms, without special price concessions.(c) The Argentines were also seeking to place orders for tanksin the United Kingdom. As there would be unused tank capacity inthis country from 1958 or 1959 onwards, there would be advantage inaccepting the Argentine orders for delivery when capacity becameavailable.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 38.(2) Agreed in principle that Argentine orders for tanks, fordelivery when capacity became available, might beaccepted.NationalInsuranceScheme.Widows&apos;Benefits.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 9thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions (CP. (56) 36) containing a selection of public statementsby members of the Government and their supporters regarding the10s. basic pension for widows.The Minister of Pensions said that, while no commitmentcarrying the authority of the Government had been accepted, animpression had been created that the report of the AdvisoryCommittee would lead to an increase in this pension. Governmentsupporters were anxious that something should be done for thesewidows. It would be unfortunate if the Government first decided notto grant any increase and were then forced by the pressure of publicopinion to do so. He could not delay beyond the end of Februaryhis announcement of the Government&apos;s intentions in regard to therecommendations of the Advisory Committee and in making thisannouncement he would not be able to avoid commenting on thisparticular pension.
6The Cabinet agreed to defer their decision on this question untilthe proposed announcement was due to be made. The forthcomingdiscussion of the economic situation might create a climate of opinionwhich would make it easier to withstand pressure for an increase inthe rate of this pension.The Cabinet  ^Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting later in the month.7.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposed visitof the Soviet leaders to the United Kingdom.In pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 11th January,H.M. Ambassador in Moscow had been instructed to seek anexplanation of the hostile statements made by the Soviet leaders intheir recent speeches in India and elsewhere. He had been asked toenquire whether these attacks on the United Kingdom representeda change in Soviet policy. In reply to this enquiry M. Bulganin hadsaid that the points in these recent speeches which H.M.Ambassador had presumably had in mind had reference to the pastand were not designed to disturb current Anglo-Soviet relations; thatthere had been no change in Soviet policy; and that the SovietGovernment were still anxious to improve relations with the UnitedKingdom.The Prime Minister said that he had also taken the opportunityto discuss this matter during his recent visit to Washington. PresidentEisenhower had expressed the view that there was no occasion forthe United Kingdom Government to withdraw the invitation whichthey had extended to the Soviet leaders to visit this country, and thatit would be inexpedient to do so.The Prime Minister said that in all the circumstances he wassatisfied that the invitation should not be withdrawn. It would,however, be expedient that, as the Cabinet had contemplated on11th January, the programme for the visit should be so arranged asto give greater opportunity for an exchange of views between theSoviet leaders and members of the United Kingdom GovernmentIndeed, it now appeared that this was the wish of the Soviet leadersthemselves, who had said that the visit would provide opportunitiesfor discussions with members of the United Kingdom Governmentwhich they would hope to use to further their desire to ease the presentinternational tension.The Cabinet agreed that it would be inexpedient to withdraw theinvitation to the Soviet leaders to visit this country.In discussion of the revised draft programme for the visit thefollowing points were raised:  (a) It was customary for Her Majesty The Queen to invite toluncheon Heads of State whom she received in audience at WindsorCastle. The Queen would be willing to extend the same courtesy tothe Russian leaders.There was some division of opinion in the Cabinet on this point.The general feeling was, however, that it might be more convenientif the Soviet leaders could arrive at Windsor during the afternoon,after their visit to the Atomic Energy Establishment at Harwell. Theymight then be entertained to tea, if Her Majesty were free atthat time.Soviet Union.Visit of SovietLeaders to theUnitedKingdom.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions.Minute 4.)
7CM. 15 (56)(b) The programme provided for a dinner given by the LabourOpposition. This was in accordance with precedents established onthe occasion of the visits of the President of Yugoslavia andMr. Nehru.(c) The programme contemplated a visit of six full days between18th and 25th April with provisionally an extra day should it provenecessary for return hospitality by the Soviet leaders or for finaldiscussions. The six-day programme provided for periods ofdiscussion on four separate occasions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the invitation to the Soviet leaders to visit thiscountry should not be withdrawn.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, would settle the programme for thevisit in the light of the points raised in the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,16th February, 1956.
