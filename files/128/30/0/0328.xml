The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian authorities hadnow stated that, as the prisoners of war in French custody were beingremoved from Egypt, they could not carry out their undertakingto release the War Office contractors&apos; staffs in exchange for Egyptianprisoners of war and civilians held in British custody. Of theprisoners in French custody it appeared that the officers had alreadybeen removed from Egypt, but the departure of the other ranks hadbeen delayed pending further instructions from Paris.The Cabinet agreed that the French Government should at oncebe asked to conform with the British policy of handing over Egyptianprisoners of war to the Commander of the United Nations force, eventhough this involved bringing back by air the officers who had alreadybeen removed from Port Said.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would send a personalmessage to the French Prime Minister urging him to arrangefor Egyptian prisoners of war in French custody to be handedover to the Commander of the United Nations force.Parliament.2 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the end of theChristmas recess.House of LordsReform.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 72ndConclusions,minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPresident (CP. (56) 275) on the reform of the House of Lords.The Lord President said that he hoped the Cabinet would nowbe able to make a final choice between the comprehensive scheme ofreform which he had put before them, or the simpler course of doingno more than take power to create life Peers, or acquiescence in thecontinuance of the present state of affairs without any change. Hisown preference was for the first of these three courses; and, on thehypothesis of a Cabinet decision which, in principle, accepted acomprehensive scheme, he suggested that the necessary legislationwould need to take account of the following amendments to the earlierproposals:  (i) Church of Scotland. The Church of Scotland, as a nationalestablished church, had a strong claim to representation in a reformedHouse of Lords; and this claim could probably be conceded withoutrisk of serious repercussion among other religious bodies, includingthe Roman Catholic Church. Of the several methods by which theChurch of Scotland might be represented, the most acceptable wouldbe to provide that there should be included among the number oflife Peers (but supernumerary to the limit of 200) six life Peers to beappointed by the Crown, on the advice of the Prime Minister, afterconsultation with the General Assembly of the Church. It wouldbe advisable to acquaint the Archbishop of Canterbury informallywith this proposal and, at the same time, to seek his views about thepossibility of reducing the number of Bishops in the reformed House.(ii) Committee of Selection. In earlier discussions the view hadbeen expressed that the Bill would be more acceptable to the Houseof Commons if it provided expressly for the principal political Partiesto be represented on the Committee of Selection in proportion to thevotes cast at the previous General Election. He feared, however,that if this principle were conceded in respect of the Committee ofSelection, it would come to be extended to the selection of thehereditary Peers. It would be wiser, therefore, to meet the pointin more general terms, e.g., by a requirement in the Bill that the51079 2b 2
4Committee of Selection shouid be so constituted as to secure, amongother things, due representation of each of the principal politicalParties.(iii) Ex-Cabinet Ministers. The earlier suggestion that bothCabinet Ministers and ex-Cabinet Ministers should be exempt fromthe process of selection would have the result, in present circum-stances, that the reformed House would include, in addition to the200 selected hereditary Peers, about forty holders or ex-holders ofCabinet office, of whom only seven would be members of the LabourParty. In view of this disparity and of the virtual certainty that anyex-Minister who was still active would be selected, it would be betterto abandon the proposal that ex-Cabinet Ministers should be exemptfrom the process of selection.(iv) Ministers and other holders of Government ojfi.ee. Onfurther reflection it seemed necessary, in order to secure support forthe Bill, to ensure that a Labour Prime Minister would not finddifficulty in ensuring adequate representation of his Government inthe House of Lords by reason of the annual quota of life Peers beingexhausted or (when the final limit of 200 had been achieved) therebeing no vacancy at the relevant time. The Bill should thereforeinclude a power to exceed the prescribed limits on the numbers oflife Peers for the sole purpose of enabling the Prime Minister of theday to make Government appointments in the House of Lords; andit would be logical that this principle should extend also to thehereditary Peers.(v) &quot; Swamping.&quot; Since the suspensory veto had been reducedto one year, of which nine months was likely to be occupied by theconsideration of a contested measure in both Houses, the delaycaused by the veto would normally amount to no more than threemonths. This represented the minimum interval that ought to beaccorded to enable the electorate to give proper consideration to theissue in question. For this reason no amendment to retain the&quot; swamping &quot; power should be required.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposalsadvanced by the Lord President as regards the Church of Scotland,the Committee of Selection and the position of Ministers and otherholders of Government office. On the question of ex-Ministers itwas suggested that, if they were not exempt from the process ofselection, the effect might be to reduce the number of other Peerswho would have the opportunity of being selected. For this reasonit might be desirable to revert to the original proposal thatex-Ministers should be exempt from the process of selection. Asregards the &quot; swamping &quot; power it was suggested that, notwithstand-ing the reduction in the period of the suspensory veto, a Governmenthaving a majority in both Houses could, in the absence of any&quot; swamping &quot; power, legislate to increase the period of the veto, andthat thereafter a Government of a different complexion which foundits legislation barred by the Upper House would discover, when itsought to reduce the period of the veto once again, that this reductioncould itself be thwarted by the House of Lords, whose membershipwould be fixed in number and relatively static in composition. Therisk that, in modern circumstances, any Government would takeadvantage of the absence of a &quot; swamping &quot; power in order to adopttactics of this kind was admittedly remote. Moreover, it must beweighed against the other risk that, if the &quot; swamping &quot; power wereretained, successive Governments might operate it, in terms of lifePeerages, on a scale which would alter the balance between life Peersand hereditary Peers and distort the character of the reformed House.Nevertheless, the absence of any &quot; swamping &quot; power in the Billcould be used for purposes of political misrepresentation, and thequestion needed further examination.
5CM. 104 (56)The Cabinet then turned to discuss the major issue of policy,viz., whether legislation for the reform of the House of Lords shouldbe introduced in the current session and, if so. which form it shouldtake.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it might be expedient toarrange for an initial debate to be held in the^House of Lords inwhich the Government spokesmen might indicate, without commit-ment, the lines on which the Government were thinking ofundertaking a comprehensive reform of the Upper House. Such adebate would serve to test the attitude of the House of Lords to theGovernment&apos;s proposals: it should also reveal the reaction of theHouse of Commons, in which there remained, so far as could bejudged, a certain body of opinion among the Government&apos;ssupporters that it would be inexpedient for the Government toundertake major constitutional changes at a time when so manyserious issues, both of foreign affairs and of economic policy, werein urgent need of consideration.The Lord President said that he endorsed this suggestion,although he would think it wise to take unofficial soundings amongthe Government&apos;s suporters in the House of Lords before initiatingany debate of the kind suggested. He hoped, however, that if thesubsequent debate suggested that the Government&apos;s proposals wouldbe favourably received in principle, they might then be publishedin more precise form in a White Paper which could thereafter bedebated in the House of Commons. At some point it would alsobe necessary for the Government to reach a decision on theintroduction of a scheme of expense allowances for Peers.In discussion there was general agreement with the course ofaction proposed by the Lord President, on the understanding thatthe initial debate in the House of Lords would not commit theGovernment to any particular course of action and that the Cabinetwould have a further opportunity of discussing the matter beforeany scheme was published with formal Government authority.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that representation should be accordedto the Church of Scotland in a reformed House of Lords.(2) Authorised the Lord President to arrange for discussionsto be held with representatives of the Church of Scotland,with a view to obtaining their agreement to a provisionin the Bill that there should be included among thenumber of life Peers (but supernumerary to the limit of200) six life Peers, to be appointed by the Crown on theadvice of the Prime Minister after consultation with theGeneral Assembly of the Church.(3) Authorised the Lord President to arrange for discussions tobe held with the Archbishop of Canterbury about thepossibility of reducing the number of Bishops in thereformed House of Lords.(4) Agreed that the Bill should empower the Prime Ministerto fill Ministerial appointments in the House of Lordswithout being bound either by the limitations imposedon the creation of life Peers or by the provisions for theselection of hereditary Peers.(5) Invited the Lord President to arrange for further considera-tion to be given to (i) the question whether ex-Ministersshould be exempt from the process of selection and (ii) thequestion whether the &quot; swamping&quot; power should beretained in the Bill.(6) Invited the Lord President, after taking unofficial soundingsamong the Government&apos;s supporters in the House ofLords, to arrange for a debate in the Upper House inwhich the comprehensive scheme of reform would bediscussed on a basis which would not necessarily committhe Government to its adoption.51079 2
6Singapore.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 98thConclusions.Minute 2.)4. The Colonial Secretary said that in his discussions with theChief Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lim Yew Hock, which wereintended to prepare the way for a further formal conference onconstitutional advance in the New Year, satisfactory progress hadbeen achieved on the two matters which the Cabinet had previouslyconsidered. The Chief Minister was prepared to agree that a Council,on which United Kingdom spokesmen together with a representativeof the Federation of Malaya would constitute a majority, shouldexercise supervision over internal security. The advantages of thisarrangement would be reinforced by the fact that the Chief Ministerwas willing to guarantee security of tenure for a period of at leastsix years to senior members of the police force, and to associate theInternal Security Council with future appointments to the force.The sanctions which we should be able to invoke, short of suspendingthe constitution, if these arrangements did not work satisfactorily,were admittedly slender. But, short of suspending the constitution,we had no effective sanctions at present. The arrangements nowproposed would give us at least as much as we could reasonablyhave hoped to obtain, and it would be in our interest to accept them.The Chief Minister had also confirmed the importance which heattached to his proposal that, under the new constitution, The Queen&apos;sRepresentative should be a local personage of standing, who wouldbe the ceremonial and constitutional head of the Government ofSingapore, while the representative of the United KingdomGovernment would be responsible for defence and external affairs,would preside over the Security Council and would be empoweredto suspend the constitution. These arrangements would thereforeconstitute a dyarchy, which would in many respects merely formalisea state of affairs v/hich already existed in practice and should provideadequate safeguards for our interests. The Governor of Singapore,the Commissioner-General in the Far East, and the representativesof the Australian and New Zealand Governments were in favourof a dyarchy of this nature.The Chief Minister represented the only sections of opinion inSingapore which were firmly attached to the British connection. Tothis extent it was desirable that we should be prepared to go as faras possible to meet his wishes. He therefore sought the Cabinet&apos;sapproval to inform Mr. Lim Yew Hock that, without commitmenton detail, the proposals which had been under discussion wouldprovide satisfactory arrangements to cover our interests and to enableus to discharge our responsibilities in regard to defence and externalaffairs, and constituted a basis on which it should prove possible toreach agreement at a formal conference in the following spring.The Lord President said that he felt some disquiet about takingdecisions, even in terms of broad principle, on matters of such far-reaching importance without time for further reflection. Theproposal relating to the respective status and functions of The Queen&apos;sRepresentative and the representative of the United KingdomGovernment was a constitutional innovation, the full implicationsof which would need very careful consideration.The Lord Chancellor said that the proposals relating to internalsecurity represented a considerable advance, and might well serve asa precedent for other Colonial territories which, while wishing toenjoy the maximum degree of self-government, could never expect toassume responsibility for their own defence or external relations. Asregards the constitutional proposals, it was essential that the peopleof Singapore should learn to regard The Queen&apos;s Representative asbeing above, and distinct from, the two executive agencies ofgovernment, which would be respectively in the charge of the ChiefMinister and the representative of the United Kingdom Government,and that they should appreciate that, while both parts of the dyarchyhad an effective contribution to make to the working of theconstitution, the right to suspend the constitution must rest with theUnited Kingdom representative.
7CM. 104 (56)In discussion it was suggested that the constitutional difficultymight be overcome if the constitution provided that The Queen&apos;sRepresentative should be bound to accept the advice of the head ofeach side of the dyarchy and that, if it became necessary for theUnited Kingdom representative to suspend the constitution for aperiod, he would automatically become The Queen&apos;s Representativefor that period. The Cabinet clearly needed to give furtherconsideration to this proposed constitutional innovation; and it wastherefore desirable that any assurances given to the Chief Ministershould at this stage be in qualified terms. He might be informed thatwhile, in our view, his proposals provided a possible basis ofagreement, the constitutional arrangements which were contemplatedmight create a precedent affecting both The Sovereign&apos;s personalposition and the interests of other Commonwealth territories. TheCabinet would, however, examine forthwith the implications of sucharrangements, with a view to giving the Chief Minister a moredefinite indication of their attitude in advance of the forthcomingconstitutional conference.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to convey assurances tothe Chief Minister of Singapore, in the terms of theconclusions reached in their discussion, on the attitude ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government towards the proposals forfurther constitutional advance which had been underdiscussion between them.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this matter at an earlymeeting, and invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange forfurther examination to be given to the proposal that TheQueen&apos;s Representative should be a local personage ofeminence, while the representative of the United KingdomGovernment would be the head of only one side of theproposed dyarchy, but would nevertheless be empowered,if necessary, to suspend the constitution.Economic 5.

(54) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)InternationalMonetary Fund.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our presentpayments agreement with Egypt imposed on us an obligation totransfer, on 1st January, 1957, a further  20 millions from Egypt&apos;sNo. 2 account to her No. 1 account. Under the regulations whichhad been brought into effect as a result of the seizure of the SuezCanal this money would continue to be blocked, even after itstransfer. Nevertheless it might damage the international reputationof sterling if we refrained from honouring our formal obligation inthis matter, and he therefore proposed to authorise the transfer.The Egyptian Government had given notice to the InternationalMonetary Fund (I.M.F.) that they intended to exercise their right todraw on the Fund and were seeking to ascertain the probablereactions of the United States Government to this proposal. He hadinstructed the Treasury representative in Washington to inform theUnited States Treasury that, in our view, a decision on this applica-tion should be deferred until other outstanding matters had beensettled.   As we ourselves had made substantial drawings on the
8I.M.F., he did not propose to press this suggestion unduly hard; butif the Egyptian application came to a vote in the LM.F., herecommended that the United Kingdom representative should abstainfrom voting.Suez Canal The point was made in discussion that the French were enactingCompany. legislation to protect the assets of the Suez Canal Company whichwere lodged in France and that consideration might be given tocorresponding action in this country. It was, however, pointed outthat, while domestic legislation would protect such assets against suitsbrought in French and United Kingdom courts, it would not beeffective against suits brought in an international court.The Cabinet Took note of the statement made by the Chancellor of theExchequer and of the points made in the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion.Motor 7.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the difficulties inindustry. which the motor industry now found itself were due partly to itsover-expansion in the past and partly to the current restrictions onthe consumption of petrol. There was relatively little which theGovernment could do to assist the industry; but he recommendedthat an increased allocation of petrol should be made to overseasvisitors who bought cars in this country, and that the initial depositon a car bought on hire-purchase terms should be reduced from50 per cent, to 20 per cent. Both measures should help to relievethe industry&apos;s present difficulties. On the other hand, he could notrecommend any reduction in the purchase tax on cars, which woulddo little to assist the industry and would involve a sacrifice ofrevenue.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Whileit was undesirable that the Government should appear to be reversingtheir general disinflationary policy, an exception in respect of themotor industry could be justified on the ground that the currentrestrictions on petrol were an additional handicap to the industrywhich could not have been foreseen. The action appropriate to thisindustry was not therefore a precedent for similar concessions toother industries.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, for (i) anincrease in the allocation of petrol to overseas visitorsbuying cars in this country and (ii) the reduction from50 per cent, to 20 per cent, of the initial deposit onhire-purchase of motor cars.8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, during his recentvisit to Paris for the meeting of the North Atlantic Council, he hadhad some conversation with the Secretary of the United StatesTreasury about the possibility of securing a revision of thoseprovisions of the United States-United Kingdom Loan Agreementwhich defined the circumstances in which application could be madefor waiver of the payment of interest. It was evident that theUnited States Government would find great difficulty in obtainingthe approval of Congress for the kind of amendment of thoseprovisions which would meet our needs.    Therefore, instead ofUnited StatesLoan.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 96tlConclusions.Minute 1.)
9CM. 104 (56)proposing a detailed amendment of this clause of the Agreement,he was disposed to follow the alternative course of suggesting anentirely new provision for waiver of an annual payment under theAgreement. What he had in mind was a provision which wouldenable the United Kingdom Government to claim, at their owndiscretion and without any objective test of need, that an annualpayment of capital and of interest should in any given year bedeferred and should become due for payment at the end of theperiod of the Agreement. Provision would be made that such aclaim would not be exercisable on more than a specified maximumnumber of occasions (say, nine or seven) during the currency of theAgreement.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to pursue withthe United States Government the possibility of securing amodification of the United States-United Kingdom LoanAgreement on the lines which he had proposed indiscussion.LocalGovernmentFinance.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordPrivy Seal, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the President ofthe Board of Trade (C.P. (56) 282, 287 and 289) on the reform oflocal government finance.The Minister of Housing said that the radical scheme of reformwhich was analysed in these memoranda would clearly need furtherdiscussion by the Cabinet on a subsequent occasion. It was,however, important that he should announce, before the Christmasrecess, the Government&apos;s intention to take certain steps to correct therating&apos;system, with effect from April 1957, as follows (i) A relief of one-fifth of the rates on shops, commercialproperties of all kinds, and other properties assessed to a gross value(other than houses) for the period until 1961 of the current ValuationLists.(ii) A revision of the level of payments by the State-owned gas,electricity and transport industries.(iii) A change in the basis of equalisation grants.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Housing to introduce, as soon aspossible, legislation on the basis which he had outlinedin discussion.(2) Agreed to resume at a subsequent meeting their considerationof a comprehensive reform of local government finance.Kashmir.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 27thConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in reply to aParliamentary Question that day, it was proposed to state that it wasstill the Government&apos;s hope that the Kashmir dispute would besettled by agreement between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, theGovernment would continue to support efforts to reach an agreementwhich would give effect to the resolutions of the United Nations.
10The Cabinet were in agreement with the proposed reply. It waspointed out, however, that this dispute was now a source of seriousembarrassment to us in our relations with India and Pakistan. Itwas agreed that in the New Year the Cabinet should consider whatfurther steps might be taken, whether inside or outside the UnitedNations, to achieve a settlement.The Cabinet-Approved   the  terms   of  the   proposed   reply   to aParliamentary Question on Kashmir.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,20th December, 1956.
