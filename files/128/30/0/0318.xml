2Suez Canal. The Cabinet considered whether, before the withdrawal of our(Previous troops from Egypt, we should arrange to convey to the UnitedReference: Kingdom from Port Said, in addition to the 20,000 tons of fuel oilCM. (56) 93rd belonging to the Admiralty, a further 80,000 tons which were theConclusions.) property of commercial companies. These stocks represented onlya few days&apos; consumption in this country but were of considerablyOil stocks in greater importance to Egypt. The Egyptian Government had issuedort ai &apos;      a decree purporting to sequestrate them.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been advised that in lawthe sequestration order affected only the control over this oil anddid not affect its ownership. As Port Said was under our occupation,and the Egyptian Government did not exercise control there, weshould not be committing any illegal act in removing the oil if weobtained the written authority of the owners, which was likejy tobe forthcoming. Nevertheless, whatever the legal position might be,he considered that if we removed this oil we should be regarded byworld opinion as having taken advantage of our occupation of PortSaid to misappropriate it.The Cabinet were in agreement with this view. They consideredthat the benefit to the United Kingdom economy would not besufficient to offset the damage which such an act was likely to doto our international reputation. It might well imperil the executionof the emergency oil plan for Europe which, it was understood, theUnited States authorities had now agreed to put into operation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no action should be taken to remove from PortSaid, before the departure of the Anglo-French force, the80,000 tons of oil belonging to commercial companies.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to consider whether and, ifso, when this decision should be made public.The Foreign Secretary said that the French Foreign Minister hadagreed with the Cabinet&apos;s earlier view that the United Nations shouldbe invited to conduct an independent enquiry into the number ofcivilian casualties which had resulted from Anglo-French militaryoperations in Egypt. He himself, however, felt some doubt aboutthis. If the enquiry were made by representatives of membercountries, there could be no certainty that the countries selected couldbe relied upon to nominate impartial representatives. Nor couid wehave entire confidence in an enquiry conducted by members of theUnited Nations Secretariat. It might be wiser to arrange that theenquiry should be carried out by an individual who had no officialstatus but would command international confidence. The head ofthe Red Cross in Norway or Switzerland might, for example, bepersuaded to undertake the task.In discussion the view was expressed that no enquiry could nowestablish the facts with certainty and that an estimate carrying theauthority of the United Nations would, if it were significantly higherthan our own revised figure, damage our reputation even more thanthe exaggerated figures likely to result from an Egyptian investigationmade after the Anglo-French force had withdrawn. Nevertheless,some further enquiry was now desirable. Several Ministers hadpublicly stated that casualties had been limited to about a hundred;the figure was now thought to be of the order of three hundred; andneutral opinion in the world was tending to give credence to thefar higher figures quoted by the Egyptian Government. Althoughthe Paymaster-General had had no adequate opportunity, during hisbrief visit to Suez, to reach a definite conclusion on the question, ^it would help to allay disquiet if the evidence which he had beenable to collect were published in answer to a Parliamentary Question.
3CM. 94 (56)In itself, however, this would not be sufficient, and it was clear thatsome independent enquiry should be held. Such an enquiry shouldbe conducted urgently, preferably before the Anglo-Frenchwithdrawal was complete.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to consider the possibility ofarranging for a further enquiry into Egyptian casualtiesin Port Said to be carried out by an independent personwho would command international confidence.(4) Invited the Paymaster-General to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence, how the information whichhe had acquired during his recent visit to Port Said shouldbe communicated to Parliament.Military The Lord Privy Seal said that discussion with the French ForeignMovements. Minister had confirmed that the French Government hoped thatsome of the French forces now in Egypt might be transferred toCyprus, to be retained there as part of a strategic reserve in theMiddle East. It would be necessary to discuss this proposal in greaterdetail with the French Government; but, since the French nowagreed that such French troops as might be stationed in Cypruswould remain under British command, it was not easy to find reasonsfor rejecting the proposal. Any arrangement of this kind which itmight prove necessary to make should, however, be brought to anend as soon as possible.The Cabinet (5) Took note of this statement.Statement of The Cabinet had before them the first draft of the statement toPolicy. be made by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons on3rd December. This had been prepared by the Lord President inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the LordChancellor, the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence.The Lord Privy Seal said that, from conversations which he andthe Foreign Secretary had held with the French Foreign Ministerduring the afternoon, it seemed that the French Government wereanxious to concert with us a rather shorter text which would representthe substance of the agreement between the two Governments butcould be elaborated by each of them in whatever manner wasmost appropriate for presentation to their respective Parliaments.The French draft was not dissimiliar from our own in essence, excepton the timing of the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force. Fordomestic political reasons the French Government were opposed tothe fixing of any definite date for this operation. They were preparedthat the withdrawal should take place rapidly, but they would preferto leave it to the Allied Commander-in-Chief to agree a time-tablewith the Commander of the United Nations force in the light of theadministrative considerations involved in the transfer of responsibilityfor the area.The French Government proposed that the agreement towithdraw the Anglo-French force should be described as being basedon certain understandings about the Suez Canal, in terms ofclearance, non-discriminatory transit and future administration. TheFrench statement would also refer in strong terms to the importanceof adequate protection for non-Egyptian nationals in Egypt; andit would stipulate that the withdrawal of the Anglo-French forceshould be conducted in an orderly fashion, with due provision forthe maintenance of law and order in Port Said and for the transferto the United Nations salvage organisation of such salvage equipmentas the Anglo-French force might leave behind.
In discussion the following points were made: -(a) There was a certain advantage, from our point of view, inleaving the time-table for the withdrawal to be agreed between ourCommander-in-Chief and the Commander of the United Nationsforce. On the other hand, the absence of a fixed date might provea drawback, in so far as we wished to insist that the phasedwithdrawal of the Anglo-French force should be accompanied bya simultaneous clearance of the Canal.(b) We must not appear, by agreeing that the time-table forwithdrawal should be left to be settled by the Commanders of therespective forces, to be seeking further excuses for delaying thisoperation. It was important that any public statement should makeit clear that it was our intention that the withdrawal should beginforthwith.(c) The order of presentation of the French draft tended toimply that the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force was dependenton certain conditions about the Suez Canal, in respect of non-discriminatory transit and other matters. This form of presentationwas liable to invite questions about the extent to which theseconditions had been, or were likely to be, fulfilled. Our own draft,on the other hand, began by describing the objectives which we hadnow achieved, and made it clear that it was in the light of thisfulfilment of our original purpose that we were now ready towithdraw the Anglo-French force. In view of the advantages ofthis approach to the subject, the French Government should beinvited to adopt in their statement our own sequence of argument.The Lord Privy Seal said that the discussions with the FrenchForeign Minister would be resumed later that evening in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, and that the Cabinet would need to meetagain on the following day in order to consider the draft of theForeign Secretary&apos;s statement in greater detail.The Cabinet (6) Agreed to resume on the following day their discussion ofthe statement of policy to be made in Parliament on3rd December.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,Ist December, 1956.
