3CM. 41 (56)Trinidad OilCompany.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 12.)* 1. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (56) 140) covering a report by officials on theconsiderations to be taken into account in determining whetherconsent should be given for the transfer of the British stockholdingin the Trinidad Oil Company to the Texas Oil Company of theUnited States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, on the merits ofthe matter, the governing factor was that in the oil industry of to-dayit was no longer possible for a small concern to flourish. TheTrinidad Oil Company was not now capable of supporting itself incompetition with the main oil companies.  If, therefore, consent forits purchase by the Texas Oil Company were withheld, it would benecessary unless   the   Government   were   to   assume directresponsibility for it at a cost of  30 millions to persuade one orother of the &quot; British &quot; oil companies to take it over.   He hadascertained that, for good reasons, neither the British Petroleum,Limited (B.P.), nor the Shell Oil Company (Shell) would wish toabsorb this company.   Although B.P. had expressed some interestin the Canadian operations of Trinidad Oil if control over these couldbe secured in isolation, neither company considered that it wouldbe to its commercial advantage to take over the company&apos;sproduction operations in Trinidad or its distribution operations inthe United Kingdom. There were no valid grounds on which eithercompany could be pressed to modify this commercial judgment. Forthe reasons given in the memorandum annexed to CP. (56) 140 therewas, from the economic point of view, a balance of advantage inconsenting to the proposed transfer provided that certain conditions,desisned to safeguard the interests of Trinidad and our own balanceof payments interests, were satisfied.   If the Cabinet approved thetransfer he would propose, as a first step, to convey these conditionsto the Chairman of the Trinidad Oil Company.The Colonial Secretary said that he had been reluctant tocontemplate the sale of this important Colonial enterprise. He had,however, come to the conclusion that it would not be in the interestsof Trinidad to refuse consent to this transaction. Although someanxiety had been voiced in Trinidad over the ultimate consequencesof yielding control over the Island&apos;s oil to an American concern, thebalance of opinion in Trinidad was in favour of the transfer. TheGovernor of Trinidad endorsed this opinion and supported theproposal. The transfer should, however, be dependent on theagreement of the Texas Company to conditions (b) to (h) set out inparagraph 15 of the memorandum. Of these, the condition thatproduction and refining should be carried on by a company registeredin Trinidad was particularly important from the point of view oftrade relations.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was understood that the Texas Oil Company wereprimarily anxious to secure a share in the distribution of oil in theUnited Kingdom. The Trinidad Oil Company, through the RegentOil Company, had a 15 per cent, share of this market.(b) The loss to British interests of the Trinidad Oil Company&apos;sbusiness in Canada would be unfortunate, but it could not beregarded as decisive. The Canadian Government, who had beenconsulted, had raised no objection to the transaction.(c) It was understood that the Texas Company were preparedto accept those conditions which were specifically designed to protectthe interests of Trinidad. It was possible, however, that for reasonsof taxation the company might find some difficulty in accepting thecondition that production and refining operations in Trinidad shouldbe carried out by a company registered there.Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.50198 2b 2
4(d) It would tend to impair our relations with the United Statesif consent were withheld. It was our policy to press the argumentthat the United States as a creditor country should be ready freelyto invest overseas; correspondingly, we ourselves wished to be freeto build up and restore dollar-earning assets in the United States.The transaction would be put in its proper context if these pointswere given prominence in any public statement on the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasunfortunate that, on the eve of the formation of the CaribbeanFederation, one of the most important industries in the West Indiesshould pass under foreign control. He had no doubt, however, thatthe transfer was in the best economic interests both of Trinidad andof the West Indies generally. It was evident that the Cabinet wereagreed that consent to the transfer should not be withheld if the twocompanies concerned were prepared to accept the conditions setout in paragraph 15 of C.P. (56) 140.The Cabinet then considered how the decision could best bepresented to Parliament and to the public.It was agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should firstcommunicate to Mr. Vos, the Chairman of the Trinidad OilCompany, the conditions on which the Government would beprepared to give their consent to the transaction and that, in viewof the great public interest in the matter, a Parliamentary statementshould be made as soon as possible. The proposed transfer had,however, aroused considerable disquiet among Governmentsupporters and it would be convenient if some guidance could begiven to them before any debate took place in the House ofCommons. This could not, however, be done before theGovernment&apos;s decision was announced, in view of the risk ofspeculation in the shares of the Company. For the same reason itwas important that there should be the shortest possible intervalbetween the communication to Mr. Vos and an announcement inParliament. If Mr. Vos were to indicate that any of the decisionsmight prove unacceptable, the Parliamentary statement would haveto be framed in somewhat more general terms indicating that theGovernment were prepared to consent to the transaction in principleprovided that satisfactory conditions could be worked out innegotiation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that consent should be given for thetransfer to the Texas Oil Company of the Britishstockholding in the Trinidad Oil Company, subject toconditions on the lines of those set out in paragraph 15of the memorandum annexed to C.P. (56) 140.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to convey tothe Chairman of the Trinidad Oil Company on 14th Junethe terms on which the Government were prepared togive their consent to the transaction, and thereafter tomake an announcement in the House of Commons in thecourse of that afternoon.BritishTransportCommission.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 27thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C.P. (56) 139) on the financial prospects of the BritishTransport Commission.The Minister of Transport recalled that the Government haddecided to defer, for an experimental period of six months, one-halfof the increases in railway freight charges for which the Commissionhad asked. At the end of that period he would have to make aconsidered statement about the future prospects of the railways. It
5CM. 41 (56)would be known by then that in 1955 the Commission had incurreda deficit of  30-6 millions on the year&apos;s working and that theiraccumulated deficit, now  69-7 millions, was likely to rise above 100 millions by the end of 1956. The Commission would find greatdifficulty in meeting this situation by further increases in charges,which would tend to divert still further traffic to the roads, and itseemed doubtful whether they would be able to balance their currentaccount for many years to come.  He was therefore discussing withthe  Chancellor of the Exchequer the possibility that, if theCommission could show that they would eventually be able to paytheir way, they might be allowed to transfer to a special account thedeficit   accumulated  during   the  period   of  rehabilitation anddevelopment since 1948.   This would enable them to present thefinancial results of their current operations in a more favourablelight; it would help to give the public greater confidence in the futureof the railways; and it would give a keener sense of purpose andefficiency to the Commission and their staff.  The Minister thereforesought authority to prepare, for publication later in the year, a WhitePaper giving a realistic exposition of the railways&apos; difficulties,explaining the continuing deficits as a reflection, not of an inherentlyweak financial position, but of a long period of rehabilitation andreconstruction, and outlining the Commission&apos;s plans for rebuildingan efficient and economic railway system in this country.   In thisWhite Paper the particular proposal for transferring the accumulateddeficit to a special account would be presented, not as a device ofaccountancy, but as part of a practical plan for putting the railwayson a healthy basis of efficiency.   If this latter objective were to beattained, hard political decisions would have to be taken (e.g., theclosing of uneconomic branch lines) and the Government would haveto be able to show that these problems were being tackled resolutely.In discussion some apprehension was voiced about the particularproposal for a special account. The view was also expressed thatthe publication of a White Paper on the lines suggested might provokea demand for a comprehensive review of the working of thenationalised industries as a whole. Among Government supportersin the House of Commons there was growing dissatisfaction withthe results of nationalisation, and the Government might well bepressed to undertake in the present Parliament a radical revision ofthe whole system. As against this it was argued that, as a resultof changes made by Conservative Governments since 1951, theorganisation of the British Transport Commission had now beenplaced on a sound basis; and that what was needed now was, notfurther changes of organisation, but a period in which the changesalready made could bear fruit.In further discussion it was suggested that, before deciding thata White Paper should be published, Ministers should first be satisfiedthat it could contain practical proposals for increasing the efficiencyof the railways. The Minister of Transport said that he would beglad if he could have the help of some of his colleagues in workingout these proposals in detail and deciding which of them couldusefully be included in a White Paper on the lines which he had inmind.The Cabinet-Appointed a Committee consisting of Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),Minister of Agriculture,Minister of Labour,Minister of Transport,Financial Secretary, Treasury,50198-2 B 3
6to consider what practical proposals for increasing theefficiency of the railways could with advantage be includedin a White Paper on the lines suggested in CP. (56) 139,and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.Employment.Redundancy.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (56) 146) on the Government&apos;s powers toassist the transfer to other employment of workers who had becomeunemployed through redundancy.The Minister of Labour said that such unemployment as waslikely to occur in the immediate future would be due, not so muchto automation, as to the disinflationary policies which theGovernment were pursuing. The powers available to him under theEmployment and Training Act, 1948, would be fully adequate tomeet this situation. There had, however, been little occasion tomake use of these powers in the conditions of full employment whichhad obtained since 1948; and, in view of the publicity which instancesof redundancy were now attracting, there might be some dispositionto suggest that the Government were not making enough use of thepowers available to them. He therefore proposed to make it clear,in answer to a Parliamentary Question on 12th June, that theGovernment had powers to give such assistance as was necessary,that they already had in existence schemes which up to now hadmet the need, and that they would keep the position under review.Thereafter he proposed to discuss this problem with the NationalJoint Advisory Council for Industry at its forthcoming meeting inJuly.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Minister of Labour said that, as part of the measuresfor reducing Government expenditure, he had intended to close threeof the Government training centres and to reduce the standard ofservice in Employment Exchanges. The Government might,however, be exposed to criticism for taking these steps at thisparticular time, and he proposed to reconsider them in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in normal timesit was reasonable that industry itself should bear the main burden ofre-training redundant workers for other employment. He hopedthat a strong line would be taken on this point in discussion with theemployers&apos; representatives. Reference might properly be made tothe expense which firms had been prepared to incur in attractinglabour under conditions of full employment.(c) The Minister of Education said that he would consider withthe Minister of Labour how far the technical colleges could help intraining able-bodied redundant workers for other employment. Itwould be preferable that Government training centres should bereserved primarily for disabled men and ex-servicemen.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to discuss with the NationalJoint Advisory Council for Industry the general problemof assisting redundant workers to transfer to otheremployment.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to discuss with the Ministerof Labour what contribution the technical colleges couldmake towards a solution of this problem.(3) Took note that the Minister of Labour would reconsider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, hisearlier proposal to close a number of Governmenttraining centres and to reduce the standard of service inEmployment Exchanges.
7CM. 41 (56)CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 143) seeking authority to arrange for variousamendments to be moved during the Report Stage of the DeathPenalty (Abolition) Bill.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) It was proposed to arrange for amendments to be movedwhich would have the effect that capital punishment would beretained as a penalty for murder committed by a member of theArmed Forces while on active service. This proposal was approved.The Attorney-General said, however, that he also wished toconsider what effect the Bill would have, in view of the provisionsof the Visiting Forces Act, on courts-martial held by United Statesmilitary authorities in this country.(b) As now drafted the Bill provided for capital punishment tobe suspended for an experimental period of five years. It wasproposed that amendments should be moved which would have theeffect of transforming the measure into a Bill for the abolition ofcapital punishment.In discussion it was pointed out that, if the Act in force in thiscountry provided onlv for an experimental suspension of the deathpenalty, it might be easier to resist pressure for its abolition in theColonies. It was agreed that the Colonial Secretary should considerthis point further in consultation with the other Ministers concerned.(c) In paragraph 7 of CP. (56) 143 it was suggested that powershould be taken to remove to Broadmoor murderers who, thoughnot certifiably insane, were so mentally abnormal that they oughtto be held in custody indefinitely.In discussion it was suggested that this proposal would becontroversial and that, as the question was one which might becovered in the forthcoming report of the Roya* Commission onLunacy, it was arguable that legislation on it should not beundertaken in advance of the presentation of that report.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the ColonialSecretary and the other Ministers concerned to considerfurther the point noted in paragraph (b) above.(2) Agreed that, before the Committee Stage of the Bill wastaken in the House of Lords, further consideration shouldbe given to the point noted in paragraph (c) above.(3) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, authorised the HomeSecretary to arrange for amendments to be moved, on theReport Stage of the Bill in the House of Commons, asproposed in CP. (56) 143.(4) Agreed that, in divisions on the Report Stage in the Houseof Commons, Government supporters should continueto be allowed a free vote.Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet considered a draft of the Prime Minister&apos;sproposed reply to the request, made by the leaders of the Labour andLiberal Parties in the House of Commons, that an independentcommittee should be appointed to advise on the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament.In discussion minor amendments to this draft were suggested andapproved.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to reply to this request in theterms approved in the course of their discussion.
8Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 13.)6. The Prime Minister welcomed the Governor of Cyprus andexpressed to him the Cabinet&apos;s appreciation of the courage andpatience with which he was discharging his difficult task in Cyprus.The Governor had returned to London for consultation on thefuture course of Government policy in Cyprus, and the ColonialPolicy Committee had been discussing with him what new initiativecould now be taken. The Governor was convinced that there wasno prospect of securing the co-operation of Cypriots in evolving oroperating a constitution unless they had an assurance that the rightof self-determination would at some future stage be conceded. Onthe other hand, he was equally convinced that no new constitutioncould be operated successfully unless the issue of self-determinationcould be set aside for a period of years, so that agitation for earlyunion with Greece could be brought to an end. With a view tomeeting these requirements the Colonial Policy Committee hadevolved two alternative statements of policy, which were nowsubmitted to the Cabinet. Both began by announcing that aConstitutional Commissioner (Lord Radcliffe) had been appointedto frame a constitution; that, at an appropriate stage of his work,he would seek to bring into consultation representatives of the Greekand Turkish Communities in Cyprus; and that the constitutionwould be brought into effect as soon as law and order had beenfully restored. The remainder of the proposed statement wasconcerned with the application of the principle of self-determination.Under the first alternative it would be announced that the issue ofsovereignty would be determined by a plebiscite held after theexpiration of fifteen years from the date when the new constitutioncame into effect. The holding of this plebiscite would be conditionalon (i) the previous conclusion of a treaty between the UnitedKingdom, Greece and Turkey regulating in their common interestthe use of Cyprus for military purposes; (ii) previous agreementthat no change would be made in the international status of Cyprusuntil special treaty arrangements for safeguarding the interests ofminorities had been concluded; (iii) abstention from any internationaldiscussion of self-determination during the intervening fifteen years;and (iv) co-operation by all parties in restoring and maintaining lawand order in Cyprus. Under the second alternative the UnitedKingdom Government would undertake that, at the expiration of tenyears from the date on which the new constitution came into effect,they would accept a majority decision of the Standing Group of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) on the questionwhether a change in the international status of Cyprus could bereconciled with the due discharge of Western defence obligations inthe Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. No change wouldbe made in the international status of Cyprus until a treaty had beenconcluded between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkeyregulating in their common interest the use of Cyprus for militarypurposes, and the change would also be dependent on special treatyarrangements safeguarding the interests of minorities in the Island.If however the Standing Group gave an affirmative answer, and ifthese treaties had been concluded, the issue of sovereignty wouldthen be determined by a plebiscite. As under the first alternative,the holding of a plebiscite would be conditional on abstention frominternational discussion of self-determination during the interveningperiod of ten years and on co-operation by all parties concerned inrestoring and maintaining law and order in Cyprus.In discussion of these alternatives the following points weremade:  (a) Was it realistic to suppose that the issue of self-determinationcould be set aside in the manner proposed, whether for ten or forfifteen years?The Cabinet were informed that there was some reason tobelieve that the Greek Government now wished to disembarrassthemselves of the Cyprus question. If they had firm assurances that
9CM. 41 (56)the issue would be determined at a prescribed future date, they mightwell be ready to accept such a settlement and to discourage continuingagitation in the interval. In the past there had been long periodsduring which the agitation for union with Greece had been suspended.(b) At the end of the period, whichever was chosen, the UnitedKingdom Government would find it hard to avoid proceeding withthe determination of the issue of sovereignty, even though the otherparties had failed to observe the condition that it should not in theinterval be raised internationally. This condition would not in factbe enforceable. Once the undertaking had been given, it would beimpracticable for the Government to resist the pressure to proceed,despite the condition, at the end of the specified period.(c) Government supporters would be apprehensive about adefinite commitment to take this action after a specified period ofyears, whether ten or fifteen. They would much prefer that the datefor determining the issue of sovereignty should continue to be leftopen.(d) Some Government supporters would also be reluctant toagree that this issue should be left to be determined, in effect, by aninternational organisation like N.A.T.O. They would consider thatthis was a decision which the United Kingdom Government shouldreserve to themselves.(e) Though there was a case for arguing that the strategic issueshould be determined by N.A.T.O., it was unlikely that the Greeksor the Turks would be ready to agree that a decision should be takenby the Standing Group, which was confined to representatives ofthe United States, United Kingdom and France. The Cabinetrecognised that, if this alternative course were followed, it wouldprobably be necessary to propose that the decision on the strategicquestion should be taken by a two-thirds majority of the MilitaryCommittee of N.A.T.O.In view of the objections raised to both the alternative forms ofundertaking that the issue of sovereignty would be determined aftera specified period, the Cabinet next considered whether it wouldsuffice at this stage to confine the announcement to the machineryproposed for the framing of a new constitution. Sir John Hardingsaid that, if no prior agreement had been reached to set aside thequestion of self-determination for a period, the framing of the newconstitution would be used by the Cypriots as a means of securingearly union with Greece. A constitution framed and operated withthat object in view could not be satisfactory. It would not, in hisjudgment, contribute towards the restoration of law and order inCyprus. The period of repressive rule in the Island would thereforehave to be prolonged. The United Kingdom Government would findit difficult to maintain, against a mounting weight of public opinionthroughout the world, what would be represented as a purely negativeand repressive policy. If, therefore, the announcement had to beconfined to the machinery for framing a new constitution, he hopedthat it would at least contain a clear statement that the UnitedKingdom Government had accepted the principle of self-determination and would continue their efforts, through diplomaticchannels, to reconcile the views of the three Governments concernedon this issue. In his judgment it must be made plain that the UnitedKingdom Government were still seeking to find some practical meansby which the principle of self-determination could be applied.In further discussion the suggestion was made that, in the intervalbefore any change in the international status of Cyprus could becontemplated, some sort of condominium might be established underwhich the Governments of Greece and Turkey would in some waybe associated with the British administration of the Island.The Colonial Secretary said that, while this proposal might havestood some chance of acceptance a year ago, he could not believethat any progress could now be made along those lines. The proposal
10implied continuing British sovereignty over the Island, and on thataccount it was unlikely to be acceptable to Greek Cypriots.Further discussion showed that, if the final choice was foundto lie between the two alternative courses outlined by the PrimeMinister at the outset of the discussion, the balance of the opinionin the Cabinet would be in favour of the second of these twoalternatives under which the strategic issue would be referred toN.A.T.O. at the expiration of ten years after the date on which thenew constitution came into effect. The Prime Minister said that,as Sir John Harding should return to Cyprus within the next fewdays and as he ought to be in a position to make a statement ofpolicy immediately after his return, no time should now be lost inascertaining confidentially whether the Turkish Government wouldbe prepared to accept a solution on those lines. He thereforesuggested that the Colonial Policy Committee should considerfurther, in the light of the points raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,the second of the alternative courses which he had outlined at theoutset of the discussion; and that he should have the authority ofthe Cabinet to ascertain the views of the Turkish Government, inconfidence, on any revised version of that course which theCommittee might submit to him.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Policy Committee to give furtherconsideration to this question, at a meeting later in theday, in the light of the points made in the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion.(2) Agreed   that   the   Prime   Minister   might   authorise aconfidential approach to the Turkish Government witha view to ascertaining their views on a revised versionof the second of the two alternative courses which he hadoutlined at the outset of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at alater meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,12th June, 1956.
