3CM. 53 (56)Parliament. 1,   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that, in the absence of the Lord Privy Seal, theHome Secretary should speak for the Government in the debate on30th July on a motion to set up a Select Committee on Procedure.The debate on Defence, on 31st July, was to be limited, at thedesire of the Opposition, to the man-power aspects of defence policy.The Minister of Defence would be the first Government spokesman,^ and the reply to the debate would be made by the Minister of Labouror the Secretary of State for War, according to the terms of theOpposition motion.It was proposed that Parliament should be adjourned for thesummer recess from 2nd August until 23rd October. It was intendedthat the business of the current session should be completed by1st or 2nd November and that the new session should be opened on6th November.Industrial 2.   The Minister of Labour said that the refusal of a highDisputes.        proportion of the employees of the British Motor Corporation toBritish Motor   respond to the decision to call a strike was a considerable blow toCorporation.    the prestige of the two major unions involved.  It was possible that(Previous        tne umons would renew their attempts to make the strike effectiveReference-      when the holiday season was over, but it seemed unlikely that theyCM (56)50th  wou^ De successful.

This would probably take the form o. an offerto consider with the unions how future redundancy might be handled.They were willing that discussions should now take place with theunion leaders under the chairmanship of officials of his Departmentand, with the Cabinet&apos;s approval, he proposed in answer to aParliamentary Question that afternoon to give encouragement to thiscourse.The Cabinet approved this proposal, on the understanding thatno impression would be given that the Government were interveningdirectly in the dispute.In further discussion the view was expressed that theGovernment would now have the support of public opinion in takingsteps to curb industrial unrest and to secure a more effectiverecognition of the right to work. Against this, it was argued that anysuch action would unite the unions in opposition to the Government.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour to make in answer to aParliamentary Question that afternoon, a statement on thelines agreed in their discussion on the current strike ofemployees of the British Motor Corporation.AgriculturalWages.(PreviousReference:C-M. (56) 50thConclusions,Minute 4.)Mi50251 23. The Minister of Agriculture said that the Opposition werecontinuing to press their argument that the Government hadattempted to influence the decision of the Agricultural Wages Boardon the current wages claim by informing the National Farmers&apos; Unionthat, if an increase in wages were awarded, full recoupment of theadditional costs could not be assumed. He therefore wished to makeit known that the Labour Government had themselves gone muchfurther than this in 1948, when they had informed the AgriculturalWages Board that, if their award on a current wage claim was notin full accordance with the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costsand Prices, no recoupment of the additional costs would be given.b 2
4The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to discuss with the Minister ofAgriculture the terms in which reference might be made, inreply to Parliamentary Questions, to the advice which theLabour Government had given to the Agricultural WagesBoard in 1948.House of Lords.Reform.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the LordPresident (C.P. (56) 189) reporting the conclusions of the Committeewhich they had appointed on 17th May to consider his proposalsfor the reform of the House of Lords.The Lord President said that the alternative courses open to theGovernment were: (i) to introduce a one-clause Bill conferringpower to create life Peers; or (ii) to undertake a more ambitiousscheme of reform which, in addition to conferring power to createa limited number of life Peers, would also reduce the rights ofhereditary Peers by providing that only a limited number, selectedby the House of Lords itself, should be able to sit and vote. Thefirst course was open to the serious objection that it would do nothingto prevent the House of Lords from being dominated on occasionby the incursion of &quot; backwoodsmen &quot; who normally took no partin the business of the House. It would be no more than a palliative;and, if the Government took that course, they would have missedan opportunity for a comprehensive reform which would transformthe House of Lords into a really effective second Chamber. HisCommittee had therefore favoured the second alternative. Heinformed the Cabinet of the main features of this plan, which wasset out in detail in C.P. (56) 189.The Lord President added that, in order to present the narrowestpossible front to amendment, the Bill would contain no detail relatingto the machinery for selecting the hereditary Peers who would sitand vote in the House. It was, however, desirable that these mattersshould be publicly explained before the legislation was introduced.It was therefore suggested that, before the Bill was introduced, aresolution should be moved in the House of Lords setting out thedetails of the plan of reform.   This would enable the Governmentto explain and justify the plan as a whole.   Acceptance of theresolution would demonstrate the willingness of the House of Lordsto reform itself.   If, on the other hand, it encountered seriousopposition the Government would be able to fall back on the morelimited alternative of taking power to create life Peers.   It wouldbe convenient if this resolution could be debated in the Lords whenthe current session of Parliament was resumed in the autumn.  If allwent well, mention of the Bill could then be included in the Queen&apos;sSpeech and the Bill itself could be introduced in the House ofCommons early in the following session.   This procedure would,however, make it necessary to extend the current session, in theautumn, for one week longer than was at present planned.In discussion of the particular plan of reform proposed inC.P. (56) 189 the following points were made:  (a) Under this plan the House of Lords would themselves selectthose of their number who were to sit as Peers of Parliament, ftwas a weakness of the plan that this would be represented as a meansof ensuring a permanent Conservative majority in the secondChamber. To overcome this it was suggested that, once the newHouse had been constituted in the manner proposed, all vacanciesshould thereafter be filled by the Crown on the recommendationof the Prime Minister of the day. This would have the result that,in the fullness of time, the House would be broadly representativeof all parties.
5CM. 53 (56)The Lord President said that this proposal would involve thegradual extinction of the hereditary element in the House of Lordsand, on that account, was unlikely to be acceptable to the hereditaryPeers.(b) It was suggested that, in place of a formal selection of alimited number of hereditary Peers as Peers of Parliament, it mightsuffice if there were two writs of summons one empowering a Peerto speak in the Lords and the other empowering him to speak andvote. It could then be left to each individual Peer to decide forwhich of the two writs he would apply. This would ensure thatonly a limited number of hereditary Peers attended to transact thenormal business of the House, without denying to the others the rightto attend and speak on occasion.It was the general view of the Cabinet that there would be littlepublic support for a solution along those lines.(c) It was a feature of the plan described in CP. (56) 189 thatCabinet Ministers, past and present, who were hereditary Peerswould be entitled as of right to sit and vote in the House of Lordswithout the necessity of being selected. It was suggested that, inaddition, the Prime Minister of the day should be empowered torecommend that a life peerage should be conferred on a CabinetMinister, outside the normal limit of numbers of life Peers, on theunderstanding that the next vacancy arising among the life Peerswould not be filled.(d) It was proposed in CP. (56) 189 that the legislation shouldnot initially provide for any representation of the Church of Scotlandor for any change in the representation of the Church of Englandin the House of Lords. The difficulties of rationalising therepresentation of the Churches in a reformed second Chamber wereso great that it seemed desirable, if it were possible, to evade thisissue.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that this question hadalready been canvassed in ecclesiastical circles in Scotland and itwould not be possible to evade it. He could not accept the argumentin paragraph 27 of CP. (56) 189 that, if the National Assembly ofthe Church of Scotland were allowed to nominate representativesto sit in the House of Lords, it would be difficult to resist the extensionof this privilege to other Churches and to professional bodies andother sectional interests. The Church of Scotland, as an EstablishedChurch, could be clearly differentiated from those other bodies. Theprinciple of nomination need not, however, be accepted. It shouldbe possible to proceed by conferring on the holders of specified officesor benefices in the Church of Scotland a right to sit in the Houseof Lords.It was pointed out that, in considering the representation of theChurch of Scotland in the House of Lords, regard would have tobe paid to the fact that elders, as well as clergy, participated inthe government of that Church.(e) The Lord President said that he no longer proposed thatthe legislation dealing with the reform of the House of Lords shouldinclude provision for payment to its members. He would preferthat this matter should be dealt with separately. But, despite whatwas said in paragraph 3 (a) of CP. (56) 189. he considered that ascheme of expense allowances for Peers should be approved by theCabinet, and announced in public, before legislation for the reformof the House was introduced.A general discussion followed on the expediency of proceedingat the present time with a comprehensive plan for the reform of theHouse of Lords on the genera! lines indicated in CP. (56) 189. Inthis part of the discussion the following points were raised:  (/) Some Ministers expressed doubts about the expediency ofproposing   any   comprehensive   measure   of   reform. Outside50251 2c
6Parliament the reputation and standing of the House of Lords werestill high. The public were not aware of any urgent need to reformit in order to ensure its survival. In some quarters, at any rate, thereforms proposed might be represented as an unnecessary tamperingwith a constitutional mechanism which was still working well. Itwas natural that those concerned with the current management ofthe House should be impressed by the difficulties of securing adequateattendance and sufficient representation of Labour interests. Forthose purposes, however, it was not necessary to restrict theattendance of the &quot; backwoodsmen &quot;: the appropriate remedy wasto get more people to attend the normal business of the House. Thiscould be secured without any comprehensive scheme of reform e.g.,by introducing a system of expense allowances, or by creating moreLabour Peers or, if necessary, by taking power to create life Peers.(g) It was admitted that the success of a comprehensive schemeof reform would depend on the co-operation of the OppositionParties. Was it likely that this could be secured ? The Labour Partywould be tempted to represent the plan as a means of strengtheningthe powers and authority of the second Chamber and weakening therelative strength of the elected Chamber. If the Government wentforward with this plan at the present time, it would have to bepresented in the context of the current controversy over capitalpunishment; and the Labour Party were likely to argue that its realpurpose was to strengthen the power of the second Chamber tooverride the will of the Commons.As against this it was argued that, even if the Opposition declinedto co-operate, the Government should be able to enact and put intooperation either of the alternative schemes of reform. If the firstalternative were chosen, a Conservative Prime Minister couldnominate persons of Labour sympathies for appointment as life Peers.And, under the second alternative, a Conservative committee ofselection could select a body of hereditary Peers who would berepresentative of all Parties. It was unlikely that the Labour Partywould continue indefinitely to refuse to co-operate in the working ofa reformed House of Lords.(h) The view was expressed that, while there was a clear needfor a second Chamber, it was not possible in modern times to defenda hereditary right to govern. There was widespread support for theprinciple of life peerages; and many of the recently created Peerswould have preferred, if the choice had been open to them, to accepta life peerage rather than a hereditary peerage. There was thereforemuch to be said for taking an unlimited power to appoint life Peersand using it in such a way as to bring about the gradual extinctionof the hereditary right to govern.On the other side it was argued that this course would involvea progressive increase in the size of the House of Lords. It couldhardly be argued that a House with a potential membership of wellover 1,000 would be an effective second Chamber. It was alsopointed out that it would be more difficult to justify a system ofexpense allowances for Peers if the membership of the House hadnot been restricted.The Prime Minister, in summing up the discussion, said that itwas evident that the Cabinet were not yet ready to decide betweenthe alternative courses outlined in CP. (56) 189. The Cabinet weregrateful to the Lord President for his strenuous efforts to find anacceptable solution of this problem. And they sympathised with hisdesire to secure an effective second Chamber which would be freedof the reproach that the Peers who conducted its normal businesscould at any time be outvoted by the &quot; backwoodsmen.&quot; On theother hand, serious doubts had been expressed in the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion about the wisdom of allowing the House of Lords itselfto select those of its members who should be Peers of Parliament;and there was some support in the Cabinet for the view that it niigM
7 CM. 53 (56)be preferable to limit action at this stage to a Bill conferring powerto create life peerages.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question in thefollowing week.Jordan. 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Union had offered(Previous to supply arms to Jordan without payment. He sought authority toReference: instruct H.M. Ambassador at Amman to inform the JordanCM. (56) 40th Government that we should regard the acceptance of such an offerConclusions, as a violation of the Anglo/Jordan Treaty in which we could notMinute 6.)       acquiesce.   We should, in such an event, be obliged to review ourTreaty obligations towards Jordan, including the payment of thesubsidy for the support of the Arab Legion.The Cabinet agreed that a firm line should be taken in thismatter. Steps should be taken to ensure that the King, as well asthe Government, was aware of the consequences which would flowfrom a decision to accept arms from the Soviet Union.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the King andGovernment of Jordan to be informed of the consequenceswhich would ensue if Jordan accepted arms from the SovietUnion.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 190) on the course which should be followedin the next stage of the negotiations with Saudi Arabia over Buraimi.The Foreign Secretary said that the time had come to try tobring these negotiations to a head. He proposed to make it clearthat we could not contemplate the creation at Buraimi of either aneutral zone or a zone under Saudi sovereignty. The most we coulddo would be to promote the question of Buraimi in the order ofitems on the agenda for the negotiations, and to offer to explorethe possibility of giving Saudi Arabia access to the sea at Qatar.We could also offer to return the Buraimi exiles and to make minormodifications in our declared frontier.These proposals would be tantamount to a rejection of the Saudiclaims and it was possible that, on receiving them, Saudi Arabiawould decide to refer the matter immediately to the Security Council.The offer of access to the sea at Qatar, which involved no cessionof sovereignty and was acceptable to the Sheikh of Qatar, had alreadybeen put forward informally and it would strengthen our case beforethe Security Council if it had been proposed formally and wasincluded in the evidence which the Council would consider.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to put forward proposalsin the terms which he had outlined in the next stage of thenegotiations with Saudi Arabia over Buraimi.Buraimi.(PreviousReference:C-M. (56) 17thConclusions,Minute 2.)
8BritishTransportCommission.London Fares.(PreviousReferences:CM. (55) 43rdConclusions,Minute 6, andCM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Minister of Transport said that London Transport werenow anxious to make certain minor adjustments in omnibus faresin London. When the Cabinet had considered the general questionof the finances of the British Transport Commission in March ithad been recognised that these adjustments would have to be made.No general increase in fares was proposed. No fare would beincreased by more than Id. The changes would yield  \\ millionsand would on the average affect only 7 per cent, of the travellingpublic. London Transport had intended to make these adjustmentsforthwith; but, as the announcement of the increases might coincideinopportunely with a statement on economic stability which the PrimeMinister proposed to make before Parliament rose, it might bedesirable to defer it for a few days.The Cabinet agreed that any announcement of these increasesin fares would be open to misconstruction if it were made at the sametime as the Prime Minister&apos;s forthcoming statement on the economicsituation. It might also be misconstrued if it were made immediatelyafter Parliament had risen. It was agreed that the best course wouldbe for the increases to be announced on or about 20th August ascoming into effect on 1st September.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange with the BritishTransport Commission for the proposed increases inLondon fares to be announced on or about 20th August.LocalGovernmentReorganisation,(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Cabinet were informed that, in the light of theirdiscussion on 24th July, the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment had decided to change the title of the White Paper onLocal Government Organisation, and to omit the passages dealingwith functions and finance. The Cabinet agreed that the WhitePaper, as so amended, should be published before Parliament rosefor the summer recess.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto arrange for the White Paper on Local GovernmentOrganisation to be presented to Parliament before thebeginning of the summer recess.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the possibility offraming a Government measure to amend the law of murder so asto restrict the scope of capital punishment.The Lord Chancellor said that, as requested at the Cabinet&apos;smeeting on 20th July, he had discussed this problem with some ofhis Cabinet colleagues. Those with whom he had discussed it weredisposed to think that a Government measure on the lines indicatedin C.P. (56) 186 would attract the support of a fair number of thoseGovernment supporters in the House of Commons who had originallyfavoured the abolition of the death penalty. He also had reasonto believe, from informal discussions with the Lord Chief Justiceand the Lord President of the Court of Session, that a Bill on theselines would be generally acceptable to judicial opinionIn discussion it was argued that it would accord with majorityopinion throughout the country if capital punishment were retainedonly for those types of murder which directly threatened thepreservation of law and order in a civilised society There was,therefore, much to be said for the proposal that the Government
9CM. 53 (56)should themselves introduce a measure based on that principle. Itwould, however, be important to secure the support of as many aspossible of those Conservative Members of Parliament who had votedin favour of the total abolition of the death penalty; and it mightbe necessary on that account to define rather more narrowly thanwas proposed in CP. (56) 186 the categories of murder for whichcapital punishment would be retained. Thus, it was perhaps arguablethat it was not essential for the preservation of law and order thatthe death penalty should be available for murders committed inconnection with theft or house-breaking. The objective ofdiscouraging criminals from carrying fire-arms would be sufficientlysecured by retaining capital punishment as a penalty for murderinvolving the use of fire-arms or explosives.The Cabinet were informed that it was open to some doubtwhether a Bill on the lines envisaged would be acceptable to asufficient number of Government supporters to ensure that it wouldbe carried if, as must be assumed, the Opposition Parties voted solidlyagainst it. It was known that some of those on the Government sidewho had hitherto supported the abolition of the death penalty wouldbe ready to vote in favour of a Bill on these lines. There were,however, others who were at present disposed to continue to pressfor the total abolition of the death penalty. It was clear that a Bill onthe lines envisaged would be carried, if at all, by a narrow majority;and it would not be possible to estimate whether a majority couldbe obtained without sounding informally all of the Governmentsupporters who had previously favoured abolition.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances it would beinexpedient for the Government to make a hasty announcement oftheir intentions. He recognised that moderate opinion throughoutthe country would welcome a decision by the Government to regainthe initiative in this matter by introducing a measure on the linesproposed. But the Government must also take into account thetactical difficulties of handling the matter in Parliament and thepolitical risks involved. It was clear that the Government couldnot take a final decision on this question until they had a clearerpicture of the state of opinion among their supporters in the Houseof Commons.The Cabinet  (1) Authorised the Chief Whip to take such informal soundingsamong Government supporters in the House of Commonsas would enable him to form an estimate of the prospectsof carrying, against the votes of the Opposition Parties,a measure on the general lines indicated in CP. (56) 186.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at theirmeeting on 31st July.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,26th July, 1956.
