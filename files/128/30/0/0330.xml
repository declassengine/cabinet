CM. 2 (57)EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (57) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)::: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Suez crisis,and the consequent loss of confidence in sterling, had revealed theinherent weakness of our post-war economy. It was too early toassess the full economic consequences in terms of loss of production,additional dollar expenditure on oil and the servicing of new credits.But we had already had to mobilise all the credit available to us inorder to maintain the parity of sterling. In these circumstances thenational economy, already weighed down by external and internaldebt amounting to over  27,000 millions, could not be expected tobear the burden of increased estimates for defence and civilexpenditure for the coming year, in addition to the cost of investmentin the nationalised industries. The estimates for 1957-58 discloseda prospective deficit of  564 millions above and below the line, ascompared with an estimated deficit of  352 millions for the currentyear. Unless it could be demonstrated that Government expenditurewould be effectively curtailed, international confidence in sterlingcould not be maintained. It was the orthodox financial view that, ifsterling was to be effectively safeguarded in these conditions, theBudget should provide for such increases in revenue and reductionsin expenditure as would enable an overall balance to be struck.While it would not be practicable, in his view, to carry retrenchmentto such a length, he thought it would be necessary to achieve areduction of the order of  300 millions in the estimates of expenditureabove the line. He would hope for a cut of  200 millions in defenceexpenditure and a reduction of  80  100 millions in expenditure onthe social services. He looked for a substantial reduction inexpenditure on civil defence and on the National Health Service.He hoped that the Cabinet would approve the proposal for a generalExchequer grant to local authorities, instead of the present systemof specific grants. An increase in the charge for school meals mightyield a further saving of  10 millions. A Budget on these lines couldbe expected to maintain the economy broadly in balance and toprovide some scope for tax remission aimed at increasing efficiencyand productivity.Investment in the nationalised industries presented a separateproblem. More than one committee of enquiry, reporting on anationalised industry, had commented adversely on its arrangementsfor drawing up its capital programmes. As the nationalised industrieswere unable to borrow in the market on their own credit theExchequer was obliged to assume responsibility for financing theirneeds. But the whole question of the capital expenditure of theseindustries, and of the central machinery for controlling it, would needfurther consideration with a view to ensuring that fresh capital wasprovided only for schemes and developments which were likely toshow a profit.In a preliminary consideration of the situation disclosed by thismemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Cabinetconcentrated their immediate attention on expenditure on defenceand on the National Health Service.The Minister of Defence said that defence expenditure wasdivided about equally between the provision of equipment and themaintenance of manpower. Any big reduction in expenditure onequipment without a corresponding reduction in manpower wouldhave the result that the forces were ill-equipped. He was convincedthat long-term defence policy should be based on the principle ofsmaller forces equipped with fully up-to-date weapons. He thereforeproposed that the number of male all ranks in the Services should bereduced eventually from the present strength of about 760,000 to atotal of about 450.000. He accepted the need to achieve thesereductions as quickly as possible, but there were certain limitationson the extent to which this process could be accelerated. The long-term objective was to increase the number of regulars in the Servicesand to reduce the proportion of National Servicemen.  In the main,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.51460 10Defence.
4therefore, reductions would have to be achieved by reducing thenumber of National Servicemen.  One way of doing this would beto reduce the period of full-time service to eighteen months or oneyear, but this would create difficulties for the Services in trainingand in manning units stationed overseas.   Alternatively, the intakeof National Servicemen could be reduced.  There would, however,be serious practical and political difficulties in stopping the intakeof National Servicemen altogether, even for a short time, since itwas inevitable that some form of National Service would have to mcontinue even with the reduced size of the Services. Nevertheless,it was hoped to reduce the total in the Services by about 70,000during the coming year.   He was convinced that a reduction in thesize of the Services was the right way to make savings in defenceexpenditure.   Past attempts to achieve reductions by reachingagreement between the Services on cuts in commitments or in theprovision of equipment had only resulted in short-term compromises.It was imperative to lay down, and to enforce, a long-term policyon the size of the Forces.  In this way big savings would flow in thelong term. There were, however, difficulties in achieving any furthereconomies in the short term. On the basis of the defence programmeof some eighteen months earlier, the Defence Budget for theforthcoming year would have been about  2,000 millions.   As aresult of discussions with the Services and the Chiefs of Staff thistotal had now been reduced to  1,550 millions.  This reduction wasin addition to the  50 millions contribution which the Services hadmade to the  100 millions saving during the current financial year.Moreover, the real reductions made by the Services were evengreater, since this new total included the full cost of retaining Britishforces in Germany and made no allowance for any assistance fromUnited States aid. For the reasons he had given it would be difficultto increase the run-down in the size of the Services during the nextfinancial year, and the scope for any reduction in productionexpenditure was also limited by the heavy redundancy charges whichwould be involved  in cancelling orders.     The alternative ofpostponing deliveries of equipment would be wasteful, since the costof the weapons would in the end be greater.  Cuts in works serviceswould have to fall mainly on the provision of new accommodationfor the Services and would be likely to prejudice regular recruitmentwhich it was essential to build up in the interests of the long-termpattern of the forces.  He would, however, examine the possibilitiesof further savings during the next financial year and would makea further report to the Cabinet on the following day.In discussion the point was made that an unduly large proportionof the industrial research and development effort in the country wasdevoted to defence purposes. It was highly desirable to reduce thisburden on industry in order to free more resources for civilianresearch and development to help in increasing industrial efficiencyand productivity.National Health The Minister of Health said that he could not achieve a savingService. of  15 millions in the estimated expenditure on the National HealthService without increasing charges or reducing the provision ofhospital beds by nearly 20,000. As some 600,000 people weremaintained at any one time by the National Health Service, theincreased costs, e.g., on bread and milk, which were the result ofthe various measures of economy which the Government hadintroduced during the current year had led directly to an increase of 19 millions in the estimate for this service. Furthermore, theestimate reflected the pay increases to staff which, following other payincreases, had recently been awarded; and some further provisionfor increased pay for doctors must also be contemplated. TheNational Health Service was now absorbing, in relative terms, 12^ per 0cent, less of the national income than in 1951 and capital expenditureon hospitals, particularly mental hospitals, was seriously in arrear.
5CM. 2 (57)Any significant increase in charges, or the imposition of a hospitalboarding charge, would be most unpopular. On the other hand, herecognised that there was a tendency for people to enter hospitalswhen they could be treated at home if the facilities were available,and some useful economy might be achieved if arrangements couldbe made with the local authorities for providing such facilities.The Minister of Pensions said that there was. in his view, noscope for increasing the employee&apos;s contribution to the NationalInsurance Fund as a method of increasing the insurance element inthe National Health Service. The income and expenditure of theNational Insurance Fund were barely in balance at present; the Fundwould inevitably run into serious deficit in the years immediatelyahead; and some improvement in the rates of benefit, already low,would be expected if the contribution were to be increased. The sameconsiderations would not apply to a proposal to set up a separatecontributory scheme for the partial financing of the National HealthService.Discussion showed that there was support for the view that thecost of the National Health Service, which was now between twoand three times as high as had originally been estimated, exceededthe maximum amount which the Exchequer could properly beexpected to bear. A considerable proportion of the users of theService could afford to pay some part of the cost of their treatmentand there were various methods by which this could be achieved.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of these questions at ameeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th January, 1957.
