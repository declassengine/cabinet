3CM. 64 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements proposedfor the meeting of Parliament on 12th to 14th September.The House of Commons would debate the Suez situation on12th and 13th September. The Government spokesmen would be thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. The debate on the firstday would be held on a motion for the adjournment: this wouldleave it open for the Foreign Secretary to move, at the outset of thesecond day&apos;s debate, an appropriate motion of confidence in the\ Government&apos;s handling of the situation.On the 14th September the House of Commons would hold adebate on Cyprus, in which the Government spokesmen would bethe Colonial Secretary and the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs.In the House of Lords the Lord President would open the debateon the Suez situation on 12th September and the reply to the firstday&apos;s debate would be made by the Lord Chancellor. The Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Reading) would be the Govern-ment&apos;s spokesman if the debate were to continue into a second day.There would also be a debate on Cyprus in which the Governmentspokesman would be the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forthe Colonies.The GoldCoast.(PreviousReference:C.M.(56) 32ndConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ColonialSecretary (CP. (56) 204) recommending that the remaining stepsshould now be taken to accord full self-government to the Gold Coastunder the new name of Ghana and that the necessary legislation forthis purpose should be prepared for introduction in the forthcomingsession of Parliament.The Colonial Secretary recalled that, with the Cabinet&apos;s approval,he had announced in Parliament on 11th May that the UnitedKingdom Government would be prepared to promote the final stagesof constitutional advance in the Gold Coast after the people had beengiven the opportunity in a general election to express their views onthe proposed constitution and a motion calling for independencehad been passed by a reasonable majority in the new legislature. Bothof these requirements had now been fulfilled and, although theOpposition Parties in the Gold Coast mustering less than one-thirdof the seats in the legislature, had refrained from voting on themotion for self-government, this was not a sufficient reason formodifying the policy to which the United Kingdom Government werecommitted. Every effort had been made to meet the wishes of theOpposition Parties by introducing the greatest possible measure ofregional devolution into the new constitutional arrangements, butit would not have been practicable to have gone further and deviseda federal form of constitution for the Gold Coast. Given thesafeguards provided by the arrangements for regional devolution,the right course for the dissident Parties was to form themselves intoan effective Parliamentary Opposition and to attempt to make theconstitution work. He had emphasised this to a group of Oppositionleaders from the Gold Coast now in London.There were two further points. First, as regards corruption inpublic life, the Prime Minister (Dr. Nkrumah) had announced that thereport of the recent Commission of Enquiry into irregularities in thefinances of the Cocoa Purchasing Company would be published infull and that steps would be taken to bring the finances of such bodiesunder closer Parliamentary control. Secondly, as regards Togoland,the inhabitants proposed to appeal to the United Nations against thetermination of trustee status for their territory. But the TrusteeshipCouncil had, by a virtually unanimous decision, already decided toapprove the termination of the trusteeship and there was little doubtthat their recommendation would be endorsed by the GeneralAssembly.50547 2 b 2
4He therefore proposed to issue in the following week a publicstatement on the advance of the Gold Coast to full self-governmentwith effect from 6th March, 1956, and to introduce the necessarylegislation in the forthcoming session. The risk must be acceptedthat this announcement might lead to disturbances in the Gold Coast;but there was a certainty of much more serious disorder if theGovernment failed to fulfil their undertakings.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Housing said that the introduction of thisunitary constitution would have the effect of placing the tribalinhabitants of the Central and Northern Territories of the Gold Coastunder the control of the more advanced and educated merchantgroups in the coastal areas. Moreover, it was proposed to withdrawfrom the Northern Territories without their consent the protectoratestatus which they now enjoyed. This was not a satisfactory dischargeof our responsibilities. He strongly urged that, even at thislate stage, further consideration should be given to the possibility ofadopting a federal system.The Colonial Secretary said that he was satisfied that, both oneconomic and financial grounds, the Gold Coast, with five millioninhabitants, was too small to be divided into the five separate unitswhich a federal system would entail. Nor was there any practicablealternative but to abrogate the protectorate treaties when, under anysystem of self-government, we should be unable to fulfil ourobligations under them. The Chiefs concerned had seen that thiswas inevitable, and the provisions in the constitution for devolutionof authority contemplated a House of Chiefs in the NorthernTerritory.The Commonwealth Secretary endorsed the views expressed bythe Colonial Secretary on these points.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, having regard to the undertakings already given, there was nowno alternative but to proceed with the introduction of the unitary-constitution proposed for the Gold Coast.(b) It would, however, be necessary to examine the implicationswhich the withdrawal of protectorate status from the NorthernTerritories in the Gold Coast would have for our policy in NorthernRhodesia and Nyasaland. The Governments of Northern Rhodesiaand Nyasaland had been assured that we could not withdrawprotectorate status from the native populations in their territorieswhich enjoyed it. It would now be necessary to satisfy theseGovernments that a policy in regard to protectorates was beingfollowed which was not inconsistent as between one colonial territoryand another.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it should be madeclear to the Gold Coast Government that the proposed advance toself-government status would not carry with it a claim to any fundsof the Colonial Development and Welfare Corporation. Moreover,Gold Coast balances now held in London amounted to nearly  100millions. In view of the strains which sterling must be expectedto suffer in the period immediately ahead, it might be desirable todefer the date on which full self-government would come into effectin case this might involve the risk of these balances being withdrawnfor investment elsewhere.On this, however, it was pointed out that the Gold Coastauthorities were already free to withdraw their balances fromLondon, should they so wish, and it was agreed that the next stageof constitutional advance could not be deferred on that account.
5CM. 64 (56)The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 18 of CP. (56) 204.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the ColonialSecretary, in consultation, to give further considerationto the implications for Commonwealth policy of thepoint recorded in paragraph (b) above.BechuanalandProtectorate.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 60thConclusions,Minute 6.)3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (CP. (56) 206) on the prospects of resolving 1the problem of the succession to the Chieftainship of the Bamangwatotribe.The Commonwealth Secretary said that both Seretse Khamaand Tshekedi Khama had decided to renounce their claims to theChieftainship and were prepared to support Rasebolai as AfricanAuthority. They wished to be allowed to return to the BamangwatoReserve with the right as free citizens to serve their people in anycapacity to which they might be elected. They had both signed astatement to that effect.He was disposed to accept these assurances, in the hope thatthey would bring to an end the troubles over the succession, and toallow Seretse and Tshekedi to return to the Reserve. It was ofcourse conceivable that the presence of Seretse in the Reserve wouldexcite a spontaneous demonstration in favour of his election as Chiefbut, as Tshekedi would be opposed to this, the risk could bediscounted.Subject to the approval of his colleagues he proposed, therefore,that Seretse&apos;s renunciation should be made known to the Tribe andannounced in London during the current month. Seretse himselfwould then be allowed to return to the Reserve in October and anAdvisory Council for the Tribe, on which both Seretse and Tshekediwould be free to serve, if called upon to do so, would be set up.The Cabinet agreed that the assurances which had been givenoffered a reasonable prospect of a settlement of this question. Therisks involved might be reduced if Seretse, on return to the Reserve,continued to receive, while of good behaviour, the allowance whichhad been paid to him in London, and it was agreed that this pointshould be further considered.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the further point made in theirdiscussion, the proposals in CP. (56) 206.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 63rdConclusions.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Menzies&apos; mission toCairo had at least produced a clear-cut result. The EgyptianGovernment had flatly rejected the proposals for international controlof the Suez Canal which had been put to them by Mr. Menzies&apos;Committee on behalf of eighteen of the nations represented at theLondon Conference. The Prime Minister and he had therefore beenconsidering with the Governments of the United States and Francethree possible courses which might now be taken. The first was toproceed at once with military action to restore the position. To thisthe United States Government were strongly opposed. The secondwas to put forward in the Security Council a resolution supportingthe proposals emanating from the London Conference and calling onEgypt to restore to the maritime Powers their rights under theConvention of 1888. The United States Government were nowinclined to think that we should be on weak ground in putting forwardsuch a resolution at this stage.   They favoured the third course of
putting into operation the plan, which they had now elaborated, forestablishing an organisation to enable the principal users of the Canalto exercise their rights under the 1888 Convention. It it was to befully effective, this plan would require the co-operation of theEgyptian authorities; but it had now been confirmed that theAmerican proposal was, not to enter into negotiations with theEgyptians, but to call on them to provide the necessary facilities.The essence of the plan was that the principal users should togethertake positive action to assert their rights. It would, moreover, be apart of the plan that all the countries making use of the facilitiesprovided by this organisation would immediately pay the transit duesto it. The plan would have two great advantages: first, it woulddirectly involve the United States in action designed to enforce therights of users of the Canal; and secondly, it would deprive theEgyptian Government of more than 80 per cent, of the transit duesfor passage through the Canal. The Egypt Committee had thereforedecided, at their meeting on the previous day, that we should goforward with this plan if the United States Government were willingthat their intention to participate in it should be publicly announcedin the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons. In that eventwe should not at this stage submit any resolution to the SecurityCouncil: we should do no more than bring the situation to the noticeof the Chairman of the Council under Article 35 of the UnitedNations Charter.In discussion it was recognised that an organisation of users,operating from outside Egypt, would find great practical difficulty inoperating the movement of ships through the Canal. It should beable to organise a service of pilots, working from warships stationedat either end of the Canal; but it would have no control over thebridges and the signalling system along the Canal. It was likely,therefore, that this attempt to assert the users&apos; rights under theConvention would produce a confused situation in the Canal, evenif the Egyptians refrained from taking forcible action to prevent thepassage of ships operated by pilots acting on behalf of the users&apos;organisation. It was, however, the view of the Cabinet that thesepractical difficulties were outweighed by the great advantage thatthe United States would be publicly involved in a plan of positiveaction to enforce the users&apos; rights under the Convention. If theplan succeeded, Colonel Nasser&apos;s original action would be largelyfrustrated: if it failed, by reason of Egyptian obstruction, themaritime Powers would have stronger grounds either for an appealto the Security Council or for recourse to more forcible measures.Discussion then turned on the question whether any referenceshould be made to the Security Council at this stage. The Cabinetwere informed that the High Commissioners of the older Common-wealth countries, in their recent discussions with the CommonwealthSecretary, had expressed the view that recourse should now be hadto the machinery of the United Nations. It was likely that thisview would be reflected in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons. The Foreign Secretary said that, if the United StatesGovernment were willing that the Prime Minister should announce inthe House of Commons on the following day the plan for the estab-lishment of an organisation to enable the users of the Canal to asserttheir rights under the 1888 Convention, he would be in favour ofsending simultaneously to the Chairman of the Security Council asimple notification of the situation in the terms which had been agreedwith the French Government. This notification would be madeunder Article 35 of the United Nations Charter. It need not leadto any immediate debate in the Security Council, nor would itpreclude the continuance of negotiations between the parties underthe terms of Article 33 of the Charter. It might, however, be to ouradvantage to have made this preliminary notification if it becamenecessary at a later stage to bring the issue before the Council underArticle 37 of the Charter.
7CM. 64 (56)The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was evident that the Cabinet were in favour ofproceeding with the plan for establishing an organisation toenable the principal users of the Canal to exercise their rightsunder the 1888 Convention, provided that the United StatesGovernment were willing that this project should be announcedin the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons and broughtinto operation without delay; and that the Cabinet were furtheragreed that in this event, the situation should be formally notifiedto the Chairman of the Security Council under Article 35 of theUnited Nations Charter.Discussion then turned on the further steps which mightsubsequently have to be taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his judgment, itwas unlikely that effective international control over the Canal couldbe secured without the use of force. He regarded the establishmentof this users&apos; organisation as a step towards the ultimate use of force.It would not in itself provide a solution. It was very doubtfulwhether the Canal could be operated effectively under such anarrangement as this; and it seemed certain that the Egyptians couldnot accept it as a permanent system. It should, however, serve tobring the issue to a head. This was of great importance from thepoint of view of the national economy. If we could achieve a quickand satisfactory settlement of this issue, confidence in sterling wouldbe restored; but, if a settlement was long delayed, the cost and theuncertainty would undermine our financial position. He thereforehoped that Parliament could be persuaded to give the Governmenta mandate to take all necessary steps, including the use of force, tosecure a satisfactory settlement of this problem.The Minister of Defence said that he hoped that the adoption ofthis plan for the establishment of a users&apos; organisation would not beregarded solely as a step towards the use of force. He did not excludethe possibility that, if the Canal could be brought under effectiveinternational control, the present regime in Egypt might be over-thrown by means short of war. Any premature recourse to force,especially without the support and approval of the United States,was likely to precipitate disorder throughout the Middle East and toalienate a substantial body of public opinion in this country andelsewhere throughout the world.The Lord Chancellor said that it would be mistaken to assumethat, if force had ultimately to be used, this would be inconsistentwith the United Nations Charter. While the detailed provisions ofthe Charter placed all their emphasis on the preservation of peace,it was one of the essential purposes of the Charter, as reflected in thepreamble, to secure respect for international obligations. It wasthis which was the main issue at stake in this situation. We certainlyhad a duty to do our utmost to secure it by peaceful means. Theestablishment of the users&apos; organisation would be a further step, inaddition to those which we had already taken, to secure a peacefulsettlement. But, if it failed, by reason of Egyptian obstruction, hebelieved that we should be fully justified in having recourse to forceand submitting the issue simultaneously to the Security Council.The Lord President supported the views expressed by theLord Chancellor. In the last resort, a decision to use force couldbe based either on some incident in the Suez Canal or on the needto enforce respect for international obligations. He would greatlyprefer that our case should be based on the second of those grounds.It was on that basis that an approach should be made, when the timecame, to the Security Council. If it failed by reason of a Russianveto, it would be seen that the United Nations was incapable ofenforcing the principles laid down in the preamble of the Charter.We should then be justified in taking action ourselves to enforcerespect for international obligations.
8The Lord Privy Seal said that the Conservative Party in theHouse of Commons would be ready to support the use of force ifthey were satisfied that all practicable steps had been taken, withoutsuccess, to secure a settlement by peaceful means.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was clear that the Cabinet were agreed that Egypt&apos;sdisregard of her international obligations could not be toleratedand that effective international control over the Suez Canal mustbe re-established; that every reasonable effort must be made tosecure this objective by peaceful means; but that, if these shouldall fail, we should be justified in the last resort in using force torestore the situation. It would be a difficult exercise ofjudgment to decide when the point had been reached whenrecourse must be had to forceful measures. In determining this,we should weigh, not only the state of public opinion in theUnited States, but also the views of the French, who were eagerto take firm action to restore the situation and were increasinglyimpatient of delay.The Cabinet then held a brief discussion on the nature of themilitary operations which might, if need arose, be undertaken in theEastern Mediterranean. They were informed of certain changes inthe military plans. These had been discussed with representativesof the French Government, who were in full agreement with them.The revised plans had much greater flexibility than the earlierproposals which the Cabinet had considered. They would notinvolve so large a redeployment of forces, and they could be broughtinto effect at shorter notice.The Cabinet finally discussed the resolution on the Suez situationwhich had been passed at the recent meeting of the Trades UnionCongress. It seemed likely that, if in the last resort it provednecessary to have recourse to forceful measures, this course might beactively opposed by some trade unions. Difficulties were most likelyto arise in the mines and in the docks. It would be useful if, afterthe forthcoming debate in the House of Commons, the Minister ofLabour could ascertain confidentially from responsible trade unionleaders what prospect there was of serious industrial trouble if militaryoperations had to be undertaken in the Eastern Mediterranean.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to obtain the agreement of theUnited States Government to the announcement, in theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons, of theproject for establishing an organisation to enable theprincipal users of the Suez Canal to exercise their rightsunder the 1888 Convention.(2) Agreed   that,   if   the   announcement   foreshadowed inConclusion (1) were made, a formal communicationshould simultaneously be made to the Chairman of theSecurity Council notifying him, under Article 35 of theUnited Nations Charter, of the situation in the SuezCanal.(3) Took note of the revised plans for possible military operationsin the Eastern Mediterranean/(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theMinister of Labour to ascertain at the appropriate stagefrom responsible trade union leaders whether it was likelythat serious difficulties would arise within industry if itbecame necessary to undertake military operations in theEastern Mediterranean.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,12th September, 1956.
