3CM. 48 (56)East/WestTrade.China.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute %)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Chinese had beennegotiating for the supply of 350 land-rover vehicles and a smallnumber of tractors from the United Kingdom. The United StatesGovernment had been informed that it was our intention to regardthis transaction as falling within the &quot; exceptions procedure &quot; and toauthorise the export of the vehicles in accordance with the generalprinciple that there was no sufficient ground for withholding fromChina goods which could be freely exported to countries in theSoviet bloc. The United States Government had lodged a formalobjection to our proposal, arguing that the land-rover vehicles wouldhave some military value to China and that a decision to supply themwould constitute a serious breach in the system of strategic controlswhich would undoubtedly be exploited by other countries anxiousto develop their trade with China. They had added that thetransaction would arouse hostile reactions in the United States to anextent likely to jeopardise the Foreign Aid Programme.This question was due to be discussed by the Co-ordinatingCommittee in Paris on the following day. In view of the United Statesattitude it was not now proposed to attempt to secure agreement onthe issue of principle involved but to seek the approval of theCo-ordinating Committee for the transaction on the narrower groundof its commercial value to us in present economic circumstances.Our motor industry was in difficulties and, if we did not supply thesevehicles, the order would be obtained by Czechoslovakia. It wasexpected that the United States member of the Co-ordinatingCommittee would express opposition to the proposal; and ourrepresentative would be instructed to report the views of theCommittee so that Ministers could consider the matter further beforeaction was finally taken.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom representative in the Co-ordinating Committee inParis to present in the terms which he had outlined the casefor proceeding with the supply of these land-rover vehiclesand tractors to China.Nuc,ear 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that further ParliamentaryWeapons Questions had been addressed to the Prime Minister and himself onTests. the continuance of tests of nuclear weapons.  They would be pressed(Previous        to state, in reply to supplementary questions, whether the GovernmentReference:      were prepared to take any initiative in securing internationalCM. (56) 40th   agreement for the control of such tests. This was one of the subjectsConclusions,    now under discussion by the Disarmament Commission in New York.Minute 9.)       The United States Government had accepted a formula indicatingwillingness to examine the question of imposing some limitation ontests of these weapons, but only in the context of a general agreementon disarmament. He suggested that the Prime Minister and he shouldnow be authorised to say that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be ready to discuss the possibility of international limitation ofthese tests without makins it a condition that the discussions shouldbe held in the context of a comprehensive agreement on disarmament.The Cabinet Agreed that, in reply to further Parliamentary Questions onthis subject, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should indicate, inthe terms outlined by the Foreign Secretary, their readinessto enter into negotiations for the purpose of securinginternational agreement for the limitation of tests of nuclearweapons.50203 3 B 2
4Bahrain.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that, in pursuance of theCabinet&apos;s decision of 29th May, he had taken the first steps towardsa reorganisation of the administration in Bahrain, and on 9th Juneit had beer: announced that one of the British officials in theadministration would be appointed to a new post of Financial Adviserto the Ruler. This plan had now, however, been placed in jeopardyby rumours that Sir Charles Belgrave would not after all be retiring.As a result, the Committee of National Union had decided to ask theRuler to announce Belgrave&apos;s dismissal under the threat that, if thiswas not done, they would call a strike of all workers in Bahrain. Inthese circumstances it was suggested that some official announcementshould be made without delay about Sir Charles Belgrave&apos;s retirement.This might take the form that he had already asked the Ruler somemonths ago for leave to retire and that his request had been accepted.It might be added that he would be leaving Bahrain soon after theFinancial Adviser had taken over his new duties.In discussion it was agreed that it would be useful if someannouncement of this kind could be made. Care should, however,be taken to avoid giving any impression that the decision was due tothe threat of a strike. It would also be inadvisable to discuss theproposed announcement with the Committee of National Union:there could be no question of negotiating the terms of the announce-ment with that body. Finally, it would be preferable that no specificdate for Sir Charles Belgrave&apos;s retirement should be mentionedpublicly at this stage: if any reference had to be made to timing, itshould not go beyond suggesting that he might retire towards the endof the year.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider this questionfurther in the light of their discussion, and to sendappropriate instructions to Her Majesty&apos;s Representative inthe Persian Gulf in reply to his telegram No. 608 of 9th July.Parliament. 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.They were also informed of the provisional arrangements for thetwo following weeks. A debate on foreign affairs was likely to beheld on 23rd and 24th July. A defence debate would probably beheld in the last week before the summer recess.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 47thConclusions,Minute 12.)5. On 10th July, after a two-day debate, the House of Lordshad on a free vote rejected by a majority of 238 to 95 the SecondReading of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill. In the light of thisdecision the Cabinet considered their future tactics in handling thequestion of capital punishment in the present Parliament.The Lord President said that the Attorney-General hadpreviously put forward the proposal that in the next session ofParliament the Government should themselves introduce legislationto alter the law of murder and should then be prepared, if necessaryby the use of the Government Whip, to prevent the passage of anyPrivate Member&apos;s Bill providing for the total abolition of the deathpenalty. Before the debate in the House of Lords he had not beenattracted by this proposal. During that debate, however, both theArchbishop of Canterbury and Lord Samuel had put forward, inmoderate terms, the suggestion that the Government should them-selves introduce legislation designed to narrow the scope of thedeath penalty and had argued that, if this were done, the retentionof capital punishment would command a wider measure of supportthroughout the country.   These speeches had made a substantial
5CM. 48 (56)impression on the House of Lords; and there might now be anopportunity for the Government by this means to recapture theinitiative in this matter.Discussion showed that there was a substantial body of opinionin the Cabinet in favour of taking this course. It would be consistentwith the arguments advanced on the Government&apos;s behalf in theHouse of Commons, both in the discussion of the original motion,in which the Government had offered to take steps to amend the lawof murder, and in the proceedings on the Death Penalty (Abolition)Bill. It would meet the view, which was widely held, that in a matterso closely affecting the preservation of law and order the Governmentshould themselves assume responsibility. The Lord Chancellor andThe Attorney-General said that, despite the legal difficulties, it wouldbe practicable to frame legislation on the four points with which theGovernment had previously undertaken to deal, viz., suicide pacts,provocation, constructive malice and diminished responsibility. Itwas, however, suggested that, if the proposed legislation could gosomewhat further than this, it might command the support of someof those who had previously favoured the abolition of the deathpenalty. Consideration should therefore be given to the possibilityof narrowing the scope of capital punishment still further byidentifying some of the other classes of case in which reprieves wereregularly recommended.In further discussion it was agreed that, if a satisfactory Billcould be framed on these lines, there was a reasonable prospect thatit could be carried through the House of Commons as a Governmentmeasure. Those Government supporters who favoured the abolitionof capital punishment might be persuaded to vote for it on the basisthat it would have the effect of restricting the application of the deathpenalty. It should therefore be possible to use the Government Whipto further the progress of such a measure. Greater difficultywould, however, be encountered if it were proposed, after theintroduction of such a measure, to use the Government Whip tosecure the rejection of any Private Member&apos;s Bill providing for theabolition of the death penalty; for there were some members of theAdministration and some back-bench supporters of the Governmentwho would still feel unable, as a matter of conscience, to vote againsta proposal to abolish this penalty. It was, however, possible that thissituation might be avoided if progress could first be made with aGovernment Bill commanding a substantial measure of support inthe House of Commons. In that event it might be possible, withoutthe use of the Government Whip, to secure a sufficient majority forthe defeat of any measure subsequently introduced by a PrivateMember for the abolition of the death penalty.Discussion then turned on the question whether any furtheraction could be taken in this matter in the course of the currentsession. In favour of early action it was argued that, in the light ofthe debate in the House of Lords, the Government now had anopportunity of regaining the initiative and that, if this opportunitywere not seized, it might not recur. From that point of view therewas much to be said for the early introduction of a Governmentmeasure in the House of Lords. On the other hand, it was arguedthat it might be easier to persuade the House of Commons to acceptnew proposals on the lines which the Cabinet had discussed if theywere first introduced in that House. There would also be someunreality in introducing in the House of Lords a Bill which, even if itwere accepted by the Lords, could not conceivably be passed throughthe Commons before the end of the session. Finally, it was pointedout that it would take some time, not only to work out the details ofthis difficult legislation, but to ascertain what prospects there wereof securing a sufficient measure of support for it in the House ofCommons. In these circumstances the suggestion was made thatrecourse might be had to the old procedure of debating, before the
6introduction of a Bill, a formal resolution indicating in some detailthe lines on which the legislation would be framed. This proceduremight be followed, as a means of testing opinion, either in the Houseof Lords alone or possibly in both Houses of Parliament.In further discussion it was agreed that the Government needfeel no obligation to make an immediate statement of their intentionson this matter. It was one of considerable importance, which mightin certain circumstances endanger the stability of the Government,and Ministers could be excused for declining to be rushed into anypremature statement about it. The Speaker had already refused toaccept a Private Notice Question from Mr. S. Silverman, M.P.,asking for a statement of Government policy on this matter, butquestions about it were likely to be asked in the exchanges after thethe Statement on Business on the following day. It was agreed that,in reply to these, it should be said that the Government would makean announcement before the end of the current session and hopedto be able to do so before Parliament rose for the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee consisting of Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),Home Secretary,Secretary of State for Scotland,Attorney-General,Lord Advocate,to consider, and report to the Cabinet on, the possibilityof framing a Government measure to amend the law ofmurder so as to restrict the scope of capital punishment.(2) Authorised the Lord President to ascertain informally whatsuggestions the Archbishop of Canterbury and LordSamuel might have to make regarding the form of anyGovernment legislation on this subject.Armed Forces.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Conditions ofService inGermany.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (56) 157) and the Secretary of State for War(CP. (56) 155) seeking a decision on the extent to which certainprivileges and allowances should continue to be enjoyed by membersof the Armed Forces stationed in Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the contributionwhich the German Government had been making to the cost ofmaintaining our Armed Forces in Germany had been reducedsubstantially in the current year and would come to an end altogetherin the following year; and the cost of the civilian German labourwhich the Forces employed would now increase. It would benecessary to table a Supplementary Estimate of  31 millions to coverthe additional cost of our Forces in Germany in the current year,and Ministers should therefore examine very critically anyexceptional privileges and allowances which these Forces enjoyed.Agreement had been reached between the Treasury and the ServiceDepartments on a number of economies: three points remained fordecision. First, although the Forces serving in Germany had a logicalclaim for the payment of an allowance similar to that paid at otherstations overseas, to meet the cost of food purchased locally, he hopedthat the introduction of this allowance could be deferred until1st April next. This postponement would save some  800,000.Secondly, he saw no reason why officers serving in Germany shouldbe provided with the services of batmen on a more lavish scale thanofficers serving in other stations or at home.   Thirdly, he felt that
7CM. 48 (56)a reduction of one-third should be made in the current year in theallowances paid for domestic servants and that these allowancesshould cease altogether in the following year.The Secretary of State for War said that he appreciated the needfor economy, and savings totalling  5 millions in the cost of ourForces in Germany had already been agreed in discussions with theTreasury. To carry economies too far would, however, nullify theeffect of recent decisions to improve the pay and allowances of% members of the Armed Services which had been designed to induceofficers and men to make their careers in the Regular Forces.Moreover, it would put our own soldiers in Germany in an inferiorposition to the members of the armed forces of other Europeancountries stationed in Germany. He was, however, prepared toaccept the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer regardingration allowances and batmen if it could be agreed that the rate ofallowance for domestic servants which he had proposed in hismemorandum should be maintained until the end of the year whendecisions would be reached on the number of troops which it wouldbe necessary to retain in Germany. It would then be possible toconsider including in a local oversea allowance for Germany asuitable provision to cover the costs of domestic service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of thearguments which had been put forward, he was prepared to agree tothe course which the Secretary of State for War had proposed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequerregarding ration allowances and batmen should beaccepted.(2) Agreed that the rate of allowance for domestic servantsproposed by the Secretary of State for War should bemaintained until the end of the year when the matterwould be reconsidered in the light of decision to bereached on the numbers of troops to be retained inGermany.yprus- 7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(Previous (C.P. (56) 161) covering a revised draft of a Parliamentary statementReference: on Cyprus which had been prepared by the Colonial PolicyC-M. (56) 47th Committee in the light of comments received from the Governor ofConclusions, Cyprus.Minute 8.)In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was suggested that the fourth paragraph of this reviseddraft might be criticised by Government supporters as attributingto the Turkish Government too much of the blame for the deadlockwhich had now been reached. It was agreed that, in order to meetthis point, the second sentence of this paragraph should be amendedto read: &quot; It has become plain that steps to create conditions whichmight lead to the application of self-determination for Cyprus wouldraise far wider issues for our Turkish allies as parties to the LausanneTreaty settlement.&quot;(b) The Colonial Secretary said that, in his judgment, it wouldbe easier for the Government to defend their position if theypublished the full text of the proposals which they had put to theTurkish Government. He had summarised the arguments for andagainst publication in a minute to the Prime Minister, copies ofwhich had been circulated informally to members of the Cabinet.The broad outlines of the proposals were already widely known,but no publicity had been given to the particular aspects whichwere most likely to find favour with Government supporters (e.g., the
8proposal to retain defence zones under British sovereignty). It waslikely that the Government would eventually be compelled, byParliamentary pressure, to publish the proposals in full; and therewas much to be said for the Government&apos;s taking the initiative inthis, in order to reassure their supporters in the House of Commons.The Cabinet were also informed that there was reason to believethat full details of these proposals were now in the possession of aNew York newspaper.On the other side it was argued that, if the Government madethese proposals public, they would thereby limit their future freedom fto negotiate with the other Governments concerned. The view wasalso expressed that knowledge of the proposal to reserve defencezones under British sovereignty would not go far towards allayingthe anxieties felt by Right-wing supporters of the Government inthe House of Commons.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the Cabinetlay against the publication of these proposals.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to make a statement on Cyprus,in the House of Commons on 12th July, in the termsof the draft annexed to C.P. (56) 161, subject to theamendment noted in paragraph (a) above.(2) Invited the Lord President to make simultaneously anidentical statement in the House of Lords.(3) Agreed that, for the present at any rate, the Governmentshould decline to publish details of the proposals onCyprus which they had put forward in the recentnegotiations with the Turkish Government.Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReferencer.CM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 5#t In   Cabinet agreed that, in view of the indisposition of theLord Privy Seal, the Prime Minister should speak on behalf of theGovernment m the debate in the House of Commons on 12th July onthe remuneration of Members of Parliament. They also agreed thatthe Home Secretary should reply to the debate.In discussion of the line to be taken by Government spokesmenin the course of this debate the following points were made:  (a) It might be helpful that a statement should be made to theeffect that the Government did not exclude the possibility of anExchequer contribution to the Members&apos; Superannuation Fund, ifneed for this should subsequently arise. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he was content that such a statement should bemade.(b) While it remained the general opinion of the Cabinet that theremuneration of Members should be determined by Parliament itself,the suggestion of an enquiry by an independent body need not befinally rejected on this occasion.(c) No indication should be given of the date when the Govern-ment might be prepared to consider some improvement in theremuneration of Members.The Cabinet Took note of the arrangements for handling the forthcomingdebate in the House of Commons on the remuneration ofMembers, and agreed that the Government spokesmen inthis debate should be guided by the views expressed in theirdiscussion on the three specific points noted above.
9CM. 48 (56)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Agriculture (CP. (56) 167) seekingauthority to present a White Paper to Parliament on the lines of thedraft annexed to the memorandum setting out the Government&apos;sintentions with regard to financial and other assistance to meet theproblems of small farmers in rural Wales.The Home Secretary said that in modern conditions the smallfarmers and smallholders in rural and upland Wales were no longerable to make an economic living out of their land, and there was astrong tendency for young men to leave in favour of better employ-ment on the farms which they would previously have taken over whentheir fathers died. The consequent decline in the traditional way oflife in rural areas was causing some concern to Welsh opinion butthis decline could not be arrested except at the cost of Exchequerassistance on a scale for which there would be no economic justifica-tion. The Welsh Agricultural Land Commission had put forwardcertain proposals which were practicable and with which the Ministersconcerned were in general agreement. They had recommendedthat the hill farms should concentrate on sheep-rearing and that theobjective should be to work towards an amalgamation of the smallerfarms into units which would be economically viable. The HillFarming and Livestock Rearing Acts, which were now being extendeduntil 1963, could be used to promote this objective. Powers werealso available under certain other Acts to extend and improve theservices available to Welsh farmers, and the Forestry Commissioncould help in a number of ways.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Welsh Members of theHouse of Commons had been given an opportunity in the previousweek of expressing their views on the needs of rural Wales. Althoughthe proposals in the draft White Paper would disappoint those whofelt that more should be done to preserve the traditional way of lifein rural Wales, he did not think they would arouse serious oppositionThe Cabinet Authorised the presentation of a White Paper on RuralWales on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56) 167.Wales.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 38thConclusions,Minute 6.)Rural Areas.ColonialImmigrants.(PreviousReference:C.M. (55) 39thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Cabinet had before them a report (CP. (56) 145) of theCommittee of Ministers which, under the Chairmanship of the LordChancellor, had examined the need for early legislation to controlthe immigration into the United Kingdom of coloured people fromCommonwealth territories.The Lord Chancellor said that, in spite of the strong argumentsin favour of assuming power to control the flow of colouredimmigrants into this country, the majority of the Committee hadreached the conclusion that the balance of advantage lay againstimmediate legislation. Such legislation, however it might be framed,would be regarded as discrimination on grounds of race and colourand would come as a shock for which public opinion was still notprepared. Moreover, it could be expected to add to the economicproblems of the West Indies at a time when the newly formedCaribbean Federation would be struggling to get on its feet. In viewof these considerations, the majority of the Committee thought thatthe problem was not sufficiently urgent to justify action at a time whenthe Parliamentary time-table was already congested and theGovernment were faced with other important preoccupations, andthat it would be enough if the problem were reviewed again in abouta year&apos;s time.The Lord President said that he did not share this view. Thereport disclosed a growing and ominous potential danger from the50203 3 c
10uncontrolled immigration of coloured people. The force of thearguments in favour of control would not diminish within a year and,although he recognised that there was no public pressure at presentfor legislation, there was a serious risk that, by deferring action fromyear to year, the Government might find that the problem had cometo assume dimensions which would defeat any attempt to control it.Moreover, he considered that, in addition to the requirementsregarding housing which were discussed in the report, considerationshould be given to controlling immigration by means of labourpermits valid for a limited period.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some 14,000 coloured immigrants from Colonial territorieshad arrived in this country in the first six months of this year andimmigration might be running at a higher rate this year than last year.It appeared also that over 1,000 Indians were arriving each week withthe intention of settling here.(b) Coloured workers, in a time of full employment wereprepared to take jobs which had little appeal for our own workers.Some of the public services were aware of this and had been anxiousto obtain coloured workers.(c) Nevertheless the employment situation was changing.Unemployment among coloured people had doubled within the lastyear. Although only some 5,000 coloured workers were in factunemployed, this was over four times the national average. Ifunemployment further increased this in itself should serve to checkthe number of arrivals. The Colonial Secretary undertook to discusswith the Chief Ministers of Jamaica and Barbados, during their nextvisit to this country, the prospects for coloured immigrants in relationto the trend in the employment situation here with a view to inducingthem to discourage emigration from the West Indies.id) The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had no doubt thatany legislation we might enact must apply in form to the Common-wealth as a whole. He did not fear that this would give rise to anyserious consequences in our relations with Commonwealth countries,many of whom under their own laws practised discrimination againstimmigrants from other parts of the Commonwealth.It was pointed out, however, that it would be to our disadvantageif anything were done which might cause the Indian Governmentto reconsider their practice of allowing United Kingdom citizens toenter India freely.(e) Although it would be difficult to apply any control toimmigrants from Eire without subjecting immigrants from NorthernIreland to a similar control, further consideration should neverthelessbe given to the justification for making an exception, as proposedin C.P. (56) 145, for citizens of the Irish Republic. The justificationfor extending the franchise to Irish citizens who were resident hereshould also be examined.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would not be wiseto defer the further consideration of this problem for as long asa year. The matter should be reviewed again in the autumn unless,in view of the changing trend in the employment situation or for anyother reason, it should become necessary to return to it earlier.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C.P. (56) 145.(2) Agreed that the question of taking powers to impose controlover the immigration of coloured people should bereviewed in the autumn, or earlier if necessary.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to discuss the question ofcoloured immigrants from the West Indies with the ChiefMinisters of Jamaica and Barbados.
11CM. 48 (56)(4) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committeeof Ministers under his Chairmanship to give furtherconsideration to the point recorded in paragraph (e)above, and to report to the Cabinet.*00d- 11.   The Minister of Agriculture said that the ReorganisationFuture Commission which the Secretary of State for Scotland and he hadMarketing of set up in July 1955 under the Agricultural Marketing Acts to enquirepigs and Bacon, into marketing of pigs and bacon, had now reported and he sought(Previous trie authority of his colleagues to publish their report.

The Colonial Secretary said that certain financial trans-actions in which the Premier of Eastern Nigeria, Dr. Azikiwe, hadapparently been engaged had led to the tabling of a motion of censurein the Legislative Assembly. This had created a constitutional issueand he proposed, under powers which he possessed, to appointa Commission of Enquiry into the matter. Dr. Azikiwe would,however, first be given the opportunity to ask for such a Commissionto be appointed if he thought it preferable that he should appear tobe taking the initiative.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,llth July, 1956.
