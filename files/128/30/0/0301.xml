2Suez Canal. The Prime Minister said that it was likely that during the next(Previous        few hours Israeli forces would reach a position about twelve milesReference:      east of Port Said and, in the south, would be within ten miles of theCM. (56) 76th   Canal opposite Suez.  He therefore suggested that he should proposeConclusions,     to the French Foreign Minister, who would be arriving in LondonMinute 2.)       later that evening, that a further note should be sent to the Govern-ment of Israel warning them to keep their forces ten miles to the eastof the Canal.    He also had it in mind to suggest that theGovernments of the United Kingdom and France should inform theUnited Nations that they would be prepared to transfer theresponsibility for policing the area to a United Nations military forceas soon as one could be effectively established in the area.In discussion it was agreed that, in any submission to the UnitedNations Assembly, we should reaffirm our view that police action inthe Suez Canal area was urgently necessary, and that Anglo-Frenchmilitary action could only be suspended on the following conditions (i) that both the Egyptian and the Israeli Governments agreedto accept a United Nations force to preserve the peace;(ii) that the United Nations undertook to maintain such a forceuntil a peace settlement was reached and satisfactory arrangementshad been agreed in regard to the Canal, both agreements beingguaranteed by the United Nations; and(iii) that in the meantime, until the United Nations force wasconstituted, both combatants agreed forthwith that limited detach-ments of Anglo-French troops should be stationed between them.In further discussion it was suggested that such a proposal mightbe coupled with an offer to suspend the Anglo-French operation fora period of twelve hours, within which the Egyptian and IsraeliGovernments would be required to give an answer.The Foreign Secretary said that, in considering this proposal, theCabinet should take account of the strength of the feelings which theAnglo-French action had aroused in the United States. If noconcession were made to those feelings, it was possible that oilsanctions might be imposed against us. We might then be compelledto occupy Kuwait and Qatar, the only suppliers of oil who were notmembers of the United Nations; and we should alienate, perhapsirretrievably, all the Arab States. The Government of Syria hadalready broken off relations with the United Kingdom. It waspossible that Iraq, Jordan and Libya would follow her example. InIraq this would have disastrous consequences, for the Prime Ministerwould fall and the King himself might be overthrown. We could nothope to avoid serious difficulties with the Arab States for more thana very short time longer, certainly not for as long as it would take usto complete an opposed occupation of Egypt.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government&apos;s position in theHouse of Commons, as reflected by the division on the OppositionVote of Censure on the previous evening, was now as favourable asit could be expected to be during the present crisis. This wasundoubtedly the result of the Prime Minister&apos;s offer to transfer theresponsibility for policing the Suez area to a United Nations force.This Parliamentary position could not be maintained unless theinitiative which the Government had established on the previousevening was exploited at once. By developing as rapidly as possiblethe concept of transferring responsibility to a United Nations force,we might be able both to secure our requirements in the Canal areaand also to restore our position within the Atlantic Alliance and theUnited Nations.In further discussion it was recognised that it would beGans^ous to propose a twelve-hour suspension of militaryoperations. The military disadvantages might be relatively small, butthe loss of momentum would be damaging politically. If the Anglo-French operation were seen to hesitate before it had been successfully
3CM. 77 (56)completed, it might well be arrested indefinitely, waiting for aUnited Nations force which would never materialise. In that eventthe whole of the odium of the initial bombing would attach to theFrench and ourselves, while we should have achieved none of theobjectives which would have made that odium tolerable.On the other hand it was politically urgent that the Anglo-Frenchoperation should be brought as far as possible under the aegis of theUnited Nations. Our objective should therefore be to establishdetachments of Anglo-French forces between the combatants at keypositions along the Canal, and to make it clear that we shouldwelcome any reinforcement of these detachments which the UnitedNations could provide. At the same time we should press for somefurther retirement by the Israeli forces, perhaps to twenty miles,instead of ten miles, from the Canal, in order both to demonstrate tothe world our impartiality as between the two combatants and toreinforce the Government of Iraq in their efforts to maintain politicalstability in their country and to preserve their connection with theUnited Kingdom. Any additional requirement of this kind shouldbe put to the Government of Israel immediately, before their troopsactually reached the Canal.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting later thatevening.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd November, 1956.
