3CM. 47 (56)OverseaInformationServices.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 44thConclusions.Minute 11.)1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignSecretary (C.P. (56) 150 and 156) reviewing the policy which shouldbe followed in regard to propaganda directed against the Communistsystem in various parts of the world, and recommending that foreignlanguage broadcasts to some Western European countries should bediscontinued.The Foreign Secretary said lhat the main weight of Sovietpropaganda was now being transferred from the West to the uncom-mitted countries and to Colon.al territories, and the balance of ourown propaganda should be adjusted accordingly. We should continueto attempt to establish contact with the Russian people, framing thecontent of our propaganda to meet changing conditions in the SovietUnion, and we should not relax the attention we devoted to theSatellite countries; but we should exert a much greater effort in theMiddle East and in the Colonies than we had hitherto done. Heproposed to discontinue foreign-language broadcasts to a number ofWestern European countries: this would save rather mere than thefigure of  135,000 quoted in his memorandum and would be in linewith the recommendations of the Drogheda Committee. Such adecision would no doubt be criticised because of the reputation whichthe British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) had built up duringthe war, and it would be resisted by the B.B.C. itself, but there wasevidence that these broadcasts attracted few listeners and exertedlittle influence. The General Overseas Service of the B.B.C. wouldremain.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) There was need for ar, increased propaganda effort in theMiddle East, and this should not be made dependent on the achieve-ment of relatively minor savings on broadcasts to Europe. It wasparticularly important that we should have adequate broadcastingfacilities in the Persian Gulf area and discussions should take placeurgently with the local Rulers with a view to working out proposalsacceptable to them.(b) The B.B.C, in its concern for impartiality, frequentlyincluded in oversea broadcasts news of events which would notenhance our prestige. Foreign opinion would not be convinced thatthe B.B.C. was not an organ of the Government and it was importantthat our propaganda services should not disseminate news andinfnrmatinn which miaht be misconstrued abroad.&quot;(c)     Moreover, there should be a comprehensive re- rexamination of the relative value of the various instruments twhich could be employed for propaganda purposes. Long- trange short-wave broadcasting might have become out ofdate as a propaganda instruments.    Most countries now , mn ^material originated in the United Kingdom, ine relative effective-ness of sound broadcasting should also be considered in comparisonwith the results to be expected from the greater use of television andfilms.(d) In spite of the arguments against continuing foreign languagebroadcasts to Western Europe, we were nevertheless entering intoa period in which, with the relaxation of tension and the discussionof important economic proposals affecting Europe, the maintenanceof our influence through broadcasting might become more importantthan it had been in the past. There was already a lack of balancebetween our expenditure on armaments and our expenditure onmaintaining our general influence and prestige in the world, and theproposals relating to broadcasts to Europe should be considered inthe course of the current reappraisal of our defence programmes.{e) The comparative value for the long term of subsidising theemployment of English teachers abroad should also be examined.50203 2
3CM. 47 (56)OverseaInformationServices.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 44thConclusions,Minute 11.)1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 150 and 156) reviewing the policy which shouldbe followed in regard to propaganda directed against the Communistsystem in various parts of the world, and recommending that foreignlanguage broadcasts to some Western European countries should bediscontinued.The Foreign Secretary said that the main weight of Sovietpropaganda was now being transferred from the West to the uncom-mitted countries and to Colonial territories, and the balance of ourown propaganda should be adjusted accordingly.

Foreign opinion would not be convinced thatthe B.B.C. was not an organ of the Government and it was importantthat our propaganda services should not disseminate news andinformation which might be misconstrued abroad.(c) There should be a searching review of the relative valueof the various instruments which could be employed forpropaganda purposes. Long-range short-wave broadcasting mighthave become out of date as a propaganda instrument. Mostcountries now possessed broadcasting facilities,, and it might be moreadvantageous to concentrate on providing material for disseminationthrough local systems or to use relays for the dissemination ofmaterial originated in the United Kingdom. The relative effective-ness of sound broadcasting should also be considered in comparisonwith the results to be expected from the greater use of television andfilms.(d) In spite of the arguments against continuing foreign languagebroadcasts to Western Europe, we were nevertheless entering intoa period in which, with the relaxation of tension and the discussionof important economic proposals affecting Europe, the maintenanceof our influence through broadcasting might become more importantthan it had been in the past.

4The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that over  5 millions ofthe  12 millions which would be devoted to oversea informationexpenditure this year would be expended through the B.B.C. As itappeared that considerable changes in our present practice withregard to sound broadcasting might prove to be necessary, it wasdesirable that a Committee of officials should examine the matterurgently with a view to recommending comprehensive proposalswhich could be submitted to the B.B.C.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in C.P. (56) 150.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to consider in the course of the currentreappraisal of defence programmes the value of broadcaststo Western European countries in relation to our defenceneeds and expenditure.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a Committee ofofficials of the Foreign Office, Treasury, CommonwealthRelations Office, Colonial Office, Ministry of Defence andBoard of Trade, to re-examine, under the Chairmanshipof the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (Mr. Dodds-Parker) the scale and distri-bution of our expenditure on oversea broadcasting, in thelight of the points made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, and tosubmit recommendations.GovernmentPublicity.(PreviousReference:C.C. (51) 21stConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Prime Minister said that he was concerned about thepresentation of Government policy to the public in this country.Some of the recent programmes of the Independent TelevisionCompanies had given a misleading impression of the employmentsituation.The Lord Privy Seal said that there was scope for improvementin the machinery for co-ordinating the presentation of Governmentpolicy.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whatadjustments should be made in the existing arrangements forco-ordinating the presentation of Government policy.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Report Stage and Third Reading of the Finance Bill wouldbe completed during the course of the week.On 12th July there would be a debate on the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament. This would be held on an Oppositionmotion, but it was not certain that the motion would be pressed to adivision. It was agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should speak for theGovernment in this debate.New Towns.(PreviousReference:C.C. (51) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Minister of Housing said that, in the debate on newtowns which was to be held in the House of Commons on 9th July,he was likely to be asked to make some statement about the futureownership of the assets of the new town corporations. The statutecontemplated that, when the time came to wind up a new towncorporation, its assets would be transferred to the local authority.There was, however, no reason why a corporation should not dispose
5CM. 47 (56)of some of its assets before that stage was reached. There were infact strong arguments of policy in favour of its doing so. For thenew towns would otherwise remain artificial communities in whichthe vast majority of the buildings were rented from the local authority.As a matter of social policy it was preferable that some of thefactories should pass into private ownership, and that some at leastof the houses should be privately owned or owned by a housingassociation.In discussion there was general support for the policy suggestedby the Minister of Housing. Some doubts were, however, expressedabout the expediency of making any detailed statement of policy farin advance of the date on which it would begin to be applied. TheMinister of Housing said that he would be content if he could give atthis stage a broad indication of the policy which he had in mind. Hewished, however, to be able at least to make it plain that it should notbe assumed that the assets of new town corporations would all passautomatically to the local authority.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing to make it clear, in thedebate in the House of Commons on 9th July, that it shouldnot be assumed that all the assets of a new town corporationwould in due course pass automatically to the localauthority.Rent 5.   The Lord President said that, in view of the statement whichRestriction. the Labour Party had recently issued on their housing policy, the(Previous Cabinet might wish to reconsider their decision of 26th April thatReference- legislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts should be givenCm. (56) 3ist Priority in the legislative programme for the forthcoming session ofConclusions Parliament.   It might be expedient, in the light of the policy whichMinute 6) &apos; had now ^een adopted by the Opposition, to defer this legislation untilthe next Parliament.In the course of a short discussion on this question argumentswere advanced in favour of proceeding with this legislation, aspreviously planned, in the forthcoming session. The Minister ofHousing undertook to discuss the matter further with the LordPresident.Police Pay.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 44thConclusions,Minute 13.)6. The Home Secretary said that the House of Commons wasshowing widespread concern that pay awards to the police could notbe made retrospective and he was being pressed to make a moredefinite concession on this point. Because of the possible reper-cussions which retrospection for police pay might have on the pay ofteachers and various pensions and allowances, he had in an earlierstatement which the Cabinet had approved on 21st June confinedhimself to saying that the Government viewed the claims of the policewith some sympathy and were considering what steps might be takento resolve the problem. He now felt that it would be necessary to gofurther than this and he proposed, in answer to a Question thatafternoon, to say that the Secretary of State for Scotland and he wereexploring the possibility of introducing legislation to enable futurepay awards to be made retrospective. This would, of course, implya commitment that time would be found as soon as possible for thislegislation. It was not proposed, however, that the award made inDecember 1955, should be made retrospective.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary to reply in the terms he hadoutlined to a further Question that day on police pay.
67. The Foreign Secretary said that Israel was now attemptingin an unduly aggressive manner to assert her claims in the Jerusalemarea and relations between Israel and Jordan had reached apotentially explosive point. The situation had been thought seriousenough for the Permanent Under-Secretary, Foreign Office to see theIsraeli Ambassador in London on the previous day and to remindhim of the existence of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty and of the provisionsin the Treaty which would come into effect if there were a definite actof aggression against Jordan.The Minister of Defence said that, notwithstanding this situation,the Chief of Staff of the Arab Legion had been reported as sayingthat there could be no question of use being made of British troopsif fighting were to take place. Arrangements had been made towithdraw British subjects from Amman at short notice should thesituation there deteriorate.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Israel.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 27thConclusions,Minute 1.)Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 46thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them the text of a draft of aParliamentary statement on Cyprus (Colonial Office telegramNo. 1209 to Cyprus).The statement rehearsed the recent history of this question andmade it plain that, though the principle of self-determination hadbeen accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, it had not been foundpossible to devise a solution for its application which would safeguardour own interests in Cyprus and the Mediterranean and would also beacceptable to Turkey and to other countries to whom we had treatyobligations. The Turkish Government had made it clear that anysteps to create conditions which might lead to the application of self-determination for Cyprus would raise far wider issues for them. Inthese circumstances, Her Majesty&apos;s Government had no option butto suspend for the present their attempt to secure internationalagreement on this matter. The statement would end either byexpressing the Government&apos;s intention to proceed with the framingof a constitution for Cyprus and its introduction as soon as law andorder had been restored; or by stating merely that the Governmentwould keep under consideration the possibility of constitutionaladvance in the Island. The draft statement had been sent both to theGovernor of Cyprus and to H.M. Ambassador at Ankara.Comments from the former had not yet been received, but theAmbassador at Ankara had expressed the opinion that the TurkishGovernment, while likely to prefer the second alternative commit-ment in regard to further constitutional advance for Cyprus, would beready to acquiesce in the first.The Prime Minister said that it would not be possible to defermaking a statement on Cyprus for more than a few days. He hopedthat the Governor of Cyprus would accept the need for a positivestatement of our intentions in regard to a constitution for Cyprus.The Governor had, however, previously thought it unwise to enterupon the framing of a constitution until the question of self-determination had been put aside by international agreement, and ifhis doubts on this point should persist it would be necessary to bringthe matter before the Cabinet again.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the draft statementand with the more positive statement of intention with regard toconstitutional advance.
7CM. 47 (56)The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the draft statement on Cyprus(in its first alternative form) as set out in Colonial Officetelegram No. 1209 to Cyprus.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for the views of theGovernor of Cyprus on this statement to be expedited.m ____Federation ofRhodesia andNyasaland.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 42ndConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C.P. (56) 165) containing further proposalsfor enhancing the status of the Federation of Rhodesia andNyasaland.The Commonwealth Secretary said that since the Cabinet&apos;smeeting on 14th June this question had been further discussed withthe Prime Minister of the Federation, Lord Malvern. It would havebeen preferable to postpone further action until 1960 when theConstitution of 1953 was due to be reviewed; but Lord Malvern hadmade it clear that, as soon as the Gold Coast became fully self-governing, there would be a demand from all European Parties inthe Federation for an advance in the Federation&apos;s status. He hadtherefore been considering the possibility of a scheme which, withoutanticipating the review of the constitution, would safeguard theposition of the Africans in the Federation territories and maintain thepledges given in Parliament in 1953 that no advance towards fullmembership of the Commonwealth would be made without theagreement of the inhabitants of the Federation. He had been advisedthat the Federation already possessed an area of sovereignty verynearly sufficient to justify Commonwealth membership, and heproposed that it should be offered an advance in status in the fourrespects set out in paragraph 8 (a) of the Annex to C.P. (56) 165.These provided: (i) that the Federal Prime Minister should beadmitted to future Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings as of right; (ii) thatthe Federal Government should be formally recognised as a memberof the Commonwealth (even though not fully self-governing); (iii) thata greater measure of responsibility for conducting its external relationsshould be devolved on the Federation; (iv) that the Federal PrimeMinister should be given some right of direct access to The Queen.The Colonial Secretary said that the full scheme set out inparagraph 8 of the Annex to C.P. (56) 165 presented him with greatdifficulties. He saw no difficulty in the first proposal; indeed, hewould be ready to add to it that the precedence of the Prime Ministerof the Federation at Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministersshould be determined by the date on which it was agreed that heshould attend them as of right. Nor did he see any problem in thethird and fourth proposals. There were, however, grave objectionsto the formal recognition of the Federal Government as a fullmember of the Commonwealth. First, it was bound to arouse greatcontroversy in Parliament in view of the pledges given in 1953 (andwritten into the preamble to the Federation&apos;s Constitution) tosafeguard the position of the African inhabitants. Secondly, seriousrepercussions would be likely elsewhere. We were already pledgedto give regional self-government to the East and West Regions ofNigeria, whose constitutional development was due to be discussedin the autumn of this year. In the light of any such offer to theFederation of Rhodesia the Regions would be bound to raise thequestion of full membership of the Commonwealth for themselves.Such membership had already been refused to Singapore and toMalta. He feared that this particular proposal would gravelyprejudice our general position in the matter. Finally he did not thinkthere was any strong feeling on this subject in the Federation atpresent, though he admitted that such feeling could easily be aroused.
8In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although it would be preferable to defer action until aconstitutional review became possible in 1960, a strong demand for animprovement in status was to be expected in the Federation beforethat date. It might be wise, therefore, to forestall more sweepingproposals by an offer on the lines suggested by the CommonwealthSecretary.(b) The Federal Government&apos;s position was not yet fullyestablished in face of the Territorial Governments of the constituentterritories and of opposition from the Afrikaans element in thepopulation. It was largely upheld by the personal authority of thepresent Prime Minister.(c) An offer confined to heads (i), (iii) and (iv) only, as proposedby the Colonial Secretary, was unlikely to satisfy Lord Malvern.(d) The possibility was mentioned of conferring fullCommonwealth membership on Southern Rhodesia alone. Againstthis it was argued that such a course would lead to the dissolution ofthe Federation.Further discussion showed that there was general agreement inthe Cabinet that it would be both illogical and dangerous to attemptto confer Commonwealth membership on the Federation before itreached the stage of full internal self-government. It was, however,suggested that an offer could be put to Lord Malvern on the basis ofthe proposals under (i), (iii) and (iv) of paragraph 8 (a) of the Annexto CP. (56) 165 together with a statement that these practical changeswere marks of the special position of the Federation within theCommonwealth and of its Prime Minister&apos;s relations with hisCommonwealth colleagues.If this plan were acceptable to Lord Malvern, it could be put tothe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting. It was thought,however, that the communique to be issued at the end of thatMeeting should refer only to item (i), the remainder being reservedfor a statement by the United Kingdom Government alone.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to discuss with thePrime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia andNyasaland the proposals set forth in paragraph 8 (a) ofthe Annex to CP. (56) 165, as amended in their discussion.(2) Took note that if these proposals were acceptable to thePrime Minister of the Federation the matter would beraised at the Meeting of the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters with a view to securing their agreement to theattendance of the Prime Minister of the Federation at theirMeetings as of right.Ceylon.UnitedKingdomDefenceInstallations.(PreviousReference:C.C. (52) 78thConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Defence (CP. (56) 168)reporting the outcome of discussions which had taken place with thePrime Minister of Ceylon, Mr. Bandaranaike, during the period ofthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, on the future of theBritish bases in Ceylon. Annexed to this memorandum was a draftof a public announcement; a revised version of this draft wascirculated to the Cabinet at their meeting.The Minister of Defence said that Mr. Bandaranaike had provedless intransigent in the discussions than had been expected. He hadbeen ready to agree, in general terms, that we should continue to havethe use of the facilities we needed in Ceylon, but he had not beenprepared at this point to specify what these facilities should be or toundertake that we should have the exclusive use of them. Althoughthis agreement was not entirely satisfactory from our point of view,
9CM. 47 (56)our need for defence installation in Ceylon was now less than it hadbeen. The Service wireless stations and certain other communicationsinstallations in Ceylon were, however, still essential to us.In discussion further revisions of the draft announcement wereagreed. The announcement would emphasise the right which theGovernment of Ceylon enjoyed under the Defence Treaty of 1947 totake over the naval base at Trincomalee and the R.A.F. station atKatunayake if they so wished. It would also express, on a basis ofreciprocity, the declared intention of the Ceylon Government to makeavailable to us certain defence facilities in Ceylon which we enjoyedat present, and the intention of the United Kingdom Government toprovide assistance for the development and training of the CeylonArmed Forces. A mission would go to Ceylon to settle the details andit would be necessary later to consider negotiating a new defencetreaty with Ceylon.It was desirable that the terms of the agreement should be settledin time for Mr. Bandaranaike to make an announcement before heleft for Ceylon. In that event the Prime Minister might make acorresponding announcement in the House of Commons on 9th July.The Lord Privy Seal said that the basis of reciprocity on whichthe agreement now rested would make it more acceptable toGovernment supporters.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the agreement, outlined in CP. (56) 168, which hadbeen reached with the Prime Minister of Ceylon coveringthe continued use by United Kingdom forces of Britishdefence installation in Ceylon.(2) Approved, subject to the amendments accepted in theirdiscussion, a draft statement announcing this agreement.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister ofDefence to secure the agreement of the Prime Minister ofCeylon to the terms of the proposed announcement.New Zealand 11.   The Minister of Agriculture, in his capacity of Corn-House in missioner of Crown Lands, said that the New Zealand GovernmentLondon. were proposing to erect on a Crown site which they had leased inPall Mall a new building which would be of modern design and ofgreat height. There was a danger that such a building would beseriously out of character with its architectural environment.Commonwealth Governments enjoyed Crown exemption fromplanning control, but the fact that the proposed building would be onCrown land enabled the Commissioners of Crown Lands to refusetheir agreement to such a building if they thought fit. The NewZealand Prime Minister, Mr. Holland, attached great importance tothe proposal, however, and could be expected strongly to resist anyattempt to induce him to agree to major alterations in the design. Itwas understood that the architect concerned would be able to effectcertain modifications in the design if that were desired. The essentialfeatures which Mr. Holland would wish to retain were the height ofthe building and a modern architectural style, and he thought thatsome concession ought to be made to the New Zealand Governmentin both these respects.The Cabinet studied a model of the proposed building and therewas general agreement that some modification was called for. It wasclear, however, that to reject the proposal would have an unhappyeffect on relations with New Zealand. The suggestion was madethat the New Zealand Government might be asked formally tosubmit the design to the Minister of Housing, who could then referit to the London County Council and to the Royal Fine ArtCommission for comment in the normal way.   It was agreed,50203 2c
10however, that it would be preferable as an immediate step that furtherconsultation should take place with Mr. Holland in an endeavourto see if agreement could be reached on some compromise proposalwhich could be further considered by the Cabinet. For the purposesof such a discussion it was agreed that the possibility of a highbuilding in this quarter of London should not be excluded inprinciple, provided that such a building was of acceptable design.At a later stage it would be desirable to refer the question to theRoyal Fine Art Commission.The Cabinet Tnvited the Minister of Housing and the Minister ofAgriculture to discuss the proposed building further withthe Prime Minister of New Zealand, and to report theresults of the discussion to the Cabinet.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)12. The Lord President said that the Second Reading of theDeath Penalty (Abolition) Bill would be taken in the House of Lordson 9th and 10th July. An unusual number of Peers had expressedtheir intention of taking part in the debate and there would be a freevote. The Committee of Ministers which had been appointed toconsider, under his Chairmanship, the line to be taken by Govern-ment spokesmen in the House of Lords, had decided that it wouldbe best for the House to be advised to reject the Bill outright onSecond Reading. The House of Lords had been evolving, since 1945,a constitutional convention that, if contentious Bills came to themfrom the Commons in pursuance of a mandate from the electorate,they should receive a Second Reading and should then be subjectedto scrutiny in Committee. It was a corollary of this that the Houseof Lords would remain free to reject a contentious Bill on SecondReading on the ground that it was not the subject of a mandate fromthe electorate. No proposal for the abolition of the death penaltyhad been put to the electorate during the last election and this wasa constitutional argument for rejecting the Bill.The Lord Chancellor supported this proposal.The Cabinet Approved the proposal outlined by the Lord President forhandling the Second Reading of the Death Penalty(Abolition) Bill in the House of Lords.National HealthService.Remunerationof Doctors.(PreviousReference:C.C (52) 33rdConclusions,Minute 8.)13. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health(C.P. (56) 160) recommending the rejection of proposals by the BritishMedical Association (B.M.A.) for an increase in the remuneration ofgeneral practitioners and hospital medical staff from 1st April, 1956.The Minister of Health said that a memorandum had beenreceived from the B.M.A. claiming a 24 per cent, increase in doctors&apos;remuneration to compensate for the decline in the value of moneysince 1951. The memorandum maintained that the Spens report onmedical remuneration and the Danckwerts award gave the doctorsa contractual right to periodical adjustments in their remuneration.Such a claim, if granted, would cost little short of  20 millions a yearand would have serious repercussions. It was his view, and that ofthe Secretary of State for Scotland, that the Government shouldinform the B.M.A. that they could not consider any claim for ageneral increase in medical remuneration in present economic andfinancial circumstances. The Secretary of State for Scotland hadwished to add to this reply that there was no question of anycontractual right to an adjustment.   He himself feared, however,
11CM. 47 (56)that this might invite the argument that the Government weredisputing the interpretation to be placed on the Danckwerts award,and that the Association would then seek to have the matter referredto arbitration.The Minister of Labour said that he was doubtful of the wisdomof rejecting this request on general economic grounds as distinctfrom the merits of the case as this would imply a commitment toincrease doctors&apos; pay as soon as the economic situation eased.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, supporting this view, said thatfurther consideration would need to be given to the wording of therejection.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister ofLabour and the Minister of Health, to give furtherconsideration to the terms in which the British MedicalAssociation&apos;s approach should be rejected, and to reporttheir conclusions to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,5th July, 1956.
