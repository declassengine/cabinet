2The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations had asked the Governments of the United Kingdomand France whether they would recognise the decision of the GeneralAssembly, establishing a United Nations Command, as meeting theircondition for a cease-fire. He was also asking the Government ofIsrael if they were able to accept the resolution of the GeneralAssembly on the establishment of a United Nations Command. If hereceived affirmative replies to these questions he intended to addressto the four Governments a further communication calling for anagreed cease-fire.In deciding what reply should be sent to this enquiry, the Cabinetwould wish to take account of the following considerations:  (i) It was now urgently necessary that we should regain theinitiative in bringing hostilities to an end while there was anopportunity to carry with us the more moderate sections of opinionin the General Assembly.(ii) It was equally important that we should shape our policyin such a way as to enlist the maximum sympathy and support fromthe United States Government.(iii) But we must also maintain our position against the SovietUnion. A menacing letter had just been received from PresidentBulganin calling on the United Kingdom to stop the war in Egypt,and stating that the Soviet Government were submitting to the UnitedNations a proposal to employ, together with other members of theUnited Nations, naval and air forces in order to bring the war inEgypt to an end and to curb aggression. We must not appear to beyielding in face of Soviet threats, and our reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations must not be such as to give thatimpression.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would still be practicable to proceed with the Anglo-Frenchoccupation of the Canal area, regardless of opposition from anyquarter. But, if we adopted this course, we must reckon with thepossibility of a Soviet invasion of Syria or some other area in theMiddle East, and possibly a direct Soviet attack on the Anglo-Frenchforces in the Canal area. It was also probable that the other ArabStates in the Middle East would come actively to the aid of Egypt,and that the United Nations would be alienated to the point ofimposing collective measures, including oil sanctions, against theFrench and ourselves.(b) If we agreed to break off hostilities at once, we could maintainthat we had achieved our primary objectives. The fighting in theCanal area had been brought to an end; and the United Nations hadagreed in principle that an international force should be established inthat area. On the other hand, the United Nations had not acceptedthe definition of the functions of the international force which wehad proposed; and, if its membership was to be confined to Stateswho were not members of the Security Council, this would excludethe Anglo-French contingent which was already moving into position.There remained, therefore, a real risk that an effective internationalforce would never be established in the Canal area; and, if we accepteda cease-fire at a moment when we had only just occupied Port Saidand had not yet secured Ismailia and Suez, we should appear to havefallen short of that effective occupation of the Canal area which wehad publicly declared to be one of our objectives. In addition, theCanal was now blocked to shipping; and, if we had to wait until aninternational force was available to remove the obstruction, freetransit might not be restored for many months.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, in order to regain the iniative and to re-establishrelations with those members of the United Nations who wereSuez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 79thConclusions.)
3CM. 80 (56)fundamentally in sympathy with our aims, we should agree, subjectto the concurrence of the French Government, to stop further militaryoperations provided that the Secretary-General of the United Nationscould confirm that the Governments of Egypt and Israel had nowaccepted an unconditional cease-fire and that the international forceto be set up would be competent to secure and to supervise theattainment of the objectives set out in the operative paragraphs ofthe original resolution passed by the General Assembly on2nd November. In addition, we should state that, pendingconfirmation of these assumptions, the Anglo-French force wouldcease fire at some point during the day, the exact time to be determinedin the light of operational considerations. But we should at the sametime emphasise that the clearing of the Suez Canal, which was in nosense a military operation, was now a matter of great urgency, andthat we proposed that the technicians accompanying the Anglo-French force should begin this work at once.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, subject to the concurrence ofthe French Government, to reply to the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations on the lines indicated above.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,10th November, 1956.
