3CM. 40 (56)Soviet Union.PrimeMinister&apos;s Visit.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Prime Minister recalled that, before the Soviet leadersleft London, they had pressed him to make a return visit to theSoviet Union. With his colleagues&apos; concurrence, he had acceptedthat invitation without fixing a definite date. He had recently givensome further thought to the question of timing, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, and had obtained the views of H.M.Ambassador at Moscow. The choice lay between the autumn of1956 and the spring of the following year; and it was felt that thebalance of advantage lay on the side of making the visit in Aprilor May, 1957. H.M. Ambassador had also advised that it wouldbe convenient if the date could be finally settled, and announced,in the near future. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views he proposed tosuggest to the Soviet Government that a definite date for the visitshould now be fixed, for April or May, 1957, and should beannounced simultaneously in both capitals.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the arrangements which thePrime Minister was proposing to make to visit the SovietUnion in April or May, 1957.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Labour Party had nowdecided to make a formal request for the appointment of anindependent committee of enquiry to advise on the pay andallowances of Members of Parliament. In his view it would beinexpedient to reject this request altogether: it would be wiser forthe Government to take the line that they were unwilling to appointsuch a committee during the current session. The Opposition mightseek to have the matter debated: they had some reason to hope thata motion could be framed which some Conservative Members mightbe disposed to support. This, however, was not a matter whichcould be left to a free vote of the House: if it came to a debate, theGovernment whip should certainly be used.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was dividedon the expediency of holding such an enquiry. Arguments in favourof this were that it would gain some time; that it would providesome useful independent support for an increase in Members&apos;remuneration; and that the final decision on the amount of theincrease to be granted would still rest with the Government andParliament. If a committee of enquiry were appointed, it wasimportant that it should consist mainly of former Members ofParliament whose judgment would rest on personal and practicalexperience of the duties and problems of Members. The suggestionwas also made that, if such an enquiry were held, it might also coverthe position of Peers. On the other side, the view was stronglyexpressed that this was a matter which Parliament itself shoulddecide, and that it would not accord with the dignity or the traditionsof the House that an outside committee should be asked to adviseon it. The majority of Government supporters in the House mightbe expected to take this view. It was also argued that it would bedanaerous to remit this question to an outside body, which mightwelfrecommend levels of remuneration much higher than those whichthe Government would think justified.50198 1b 2
4The Cabinet were, however, fully agreed that no action shouldbe taken during the current session to increase the remuneration ofMembers. In the coming session it might be possible to proceed withthe comprehensive project for improving the remuneration ofMembers, increasing the salaries of junior Ministers and introducinga system of expense allowances for Peers. It might also bepracticable to pass in that session legislation increasing the salariesattaching to minor judicial offices (County Court Judges, &amp;c).Meanwhile, the best line for the Government to take would be toexpress sympathy with these objects, to admit that on merits thecase for some improvement was strong, but to argue that in view ofthe economic situation this was not a suitable moment at which totake action. To adopt any other course at the present time wouldbe inconsistent with the Government&apos;s general policy of seeking tosecure a period of stability in wages and prices.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to consider, in the light of theirdiscussion and in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal andthe Chief Whip, the terms of the reply which should bereturned to the request of the Labour Opposition for theholding of an independent enquiry into the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister said that, following the meeting whichMinisters had held on 10th May with representatives of the TradesUnion Congress, further meetings were due to be held withrepresentatives of employers and of the nationalised industries. Hedoubted whether it would be possible to hold both of these meetingsbefore the Minister of Labour went to Geneva on 15th June, andhe would welcome the advice of his colleagues on the order in whichthe two meetings should be taken.Meetings with In discussion it was agreed that the projected meeting withRepresentatives employers&apos; representatives was the more urgent, and thatof Employers the meeting with representatives of the nationalised industries couldand Workers, be deferred until after the Minister of Labour had returned fromGeneva. It was also agreed that these meetings should be presentedto public opinion, not as a fresh initiative, but as the completion ofthe series of meetings on which Ministers had been engaged beforethe Whitsun recess.Agricultural Discussion then turned to the pending claim for an increase inWages. agricultural wages. It was recognised that there was a significant gapbetween agricultural and industrial wages and that, on grounds ofcomparability, there was a case for some increase in the former. Onthe other hand there was a real danger that, if agricultural wageswere now increased, this would provoke a fresh round of wage claimsby industrial workers. It was important that the Agricultural WagesBoard should have this consideration in mind. The Ministers con-cerned should consider whether any confidential approach could bemade to the Board before the application came before them.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furthermeetings to be held with representatives of employers andof the nationalised industries on the need for a period ofstability in wages and prices.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Agriculture Ministers and theMinister of Labour, whether any steps could be taken to
5CM. 40 (56)ensure that, in the consideration of the forthcomingapplication for an increase in agricultural wages, fullaccount would be taken of the needs of the nationaleconomy.Disarmament.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 5.)5 The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 137) seeking approval for a new disarmamentplan and authority to discuss it with the Governments of the UnitedStates. Canada and France in advance of the forthcoming meetingof the Disarmament Commission.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the draftdisarmament plan, which was based on the proposals in CP. (56) 117which the Cabinet had previously approved.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The Minister of Defence drew attention to the risk that, ifthis plan were accepted, we might be required to cease themanufacture of nuclear weapons before we had built up an adequatestock of them Even on the basis of our present programme, weshould not have a sufficient stock of these weapons until 1970.Moreover, the extent to which we were to convert our tacticalequipment to nuclear weapons had yet to be decided. The positionwould improve if the proposals for a new diffusion plant, now underconsideration, came to fruition. The Foreign Secretary had, however,accepted his proposal that paragraph 11 of the draft plan should beamended to ensure that nuclear disarmament would not followautomatically on the completion ot the remainder of the plan butwould be considered in relation to the prevailing internationalsituation. He was prepared to rest on this safeguard(b) The view was expressed that the danger which the Ministerof Defence had foreseen might make it necessary for us at some laterdate to oppose the completion of the plan in regard to nucleardisarmament if the remainder of the plan had been put into effectiveoperation before we had accumulated a sufficient stock of nuclearweapons This might expose us to the charge of having beendisingenuous in sponsoring the plan. It was pointed out however,that the reservation we had entered in paragraph 11 of the draft wasintended to give us an opportunity, when the time came, to considerour position in the light of the stocks we had accumulated and ourneed for these weapons at that time. This safeguard need nottherefore involve us in embarrassment.(c) The proposed International Control Organisation, for whichthe draft plan provided, was known to be unacceptable to the Sovietleaders who disliked the proposal in principle and felt that it couldnot be made effective in such large countries as the United States andthe Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the Cabinet agreed that effectivemachinery for inspection and control was one of the essentialsafeguards on which we must continue to insist.id) The United States Government were anxious that someprovision should be made for restriction of the supply of nuclearmaterial, so as to deny to the smaller countries the opportunity ofmanufacturing nuclear weapons. We should find it difficult to acceptsuch a restriction, before we had built up our own stock of nuclearweapons, unless the United States would undertake to meet ourneeds.The Cabinet-Approved the draft disarmament plan annexed toCP. (56) 137, and authorised the Minister of State forForeign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) to seek the support of theGovernments of the United States, Canada and France fora Four-Power initiative in the Disarmament Commission onthese lines.50198 1 b 3
6Jordan. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary and the Secretary of State for Air (CP. (56) 136) on aReference: request for the supply of British swept-wing aircraft to the RoyalCM. (56) 32nd Jordanian Air Force (R.J.A.F.).Conclusions,Minute 4.)Air Force.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) said thatneither Hunter nor Gnat aircraft could be supplied, nor could theirpilots be trained, as quickly as King Hussein wished. Moreover, itwas not clear how the re-equipment programme, which would cost 2\ millions if carried out with Hunters and  l-  millions if carriedout with Gnats, was to be financed. Nevertheless, the intention tobring the R.J.A.F. up to date was in itself a sound aim and there wasa risk that King Hussein would be inclined to turn to the SovietUnion for aircraft if he had cause to feel that there would be unduedelay in obtaining British equipment. The present proposal wastherefore designed to gain time by putting forward an alternative planfor the re-equipment of the R.J.A.F. and inviting the JordanGovernment to indicate how the programme would be financed.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thisproposal. It was suggested that, in view of the prospective cost ofre-equipping the R.J.A.F., King Hussein might be encouraged toreview the relative strategic importance, in present conditions, of hisland and air forces.The Cabinet Approved the proposal put forward in paragraph 9 ofCP. (56) 136.Egypt.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) saidthat the Egyptian Government had decided to hold on 19th Juneceremonies celebrating the terminal date of the Anglo-EgyptianAgreement in pursuance of which British troops had been withdrawnfrom the Canal Zone. They had further decided that this day shouldbe celebrated annually as Egypt&apos;s National Day. All the Heads ofdiplomatic Missions in Cairo would be invited to attend the ceremonyon 19th June, and it would be inexpedient for H.M. Ambassador toabsent himself from it. It was therefore proposed that he shouldattend, though he had warned the Egyptian authorities that HerMajesty&apos;s Government would take it amiss if it were made theoccasion for any demonstration of anti-British sentiments.The Governments of Iraq and Jordan had decided not to sendspecial delegations to Cairo for these celebrations.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.NuclearRadiations.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 39thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPresident (CP. (56) 132) covering the report of a Committee of theMedical Research Council which had assessed the hazards to man ofnuclear and allied radiations.The Lord President recalled that this Committee had beenappointed because of the widespread public anxiety about thegenetic effects of test explosions of nuclear weapons. That particularanxiety would be allayed by the Committee&apos;s findings. Two otherproblems emerged, however, from the report. First, it disclosed anew risk from thermo-nuclear explosions, viz., the absorption,through food, of radio-active strontium which accumulated in humanbones and would, if test explosions continued indefinitely, eventuallyincrease human liability to cancer and other diseases of the bone.This point had been fully explained to the Cabinet at their meetingon 5th June, and it had then been accepted that there were no
7CM. 40 (56)sufficient grounds for immediate anxiety on this account.Nevertheless, it was to be expected that this part of the report wouldprovoke much discussion and some public alarm. Secondly, thereport showed that a more significant and immediate risk arose fromthe extensive use of radiology in medicine and dentistry. This alsowould arouse public anxiety, and the problem was one which clearlyneeded further examination.This was a highly technical report, and care would be neededin presenting it to the public. It would be laid before Parliamenton 12th June, and a short statement about it would be made in bothHouses on that day. The general line of this statement would bethat the report would require much study by all concerned and that,to the extent that it concerned Government Departments, thenecessary consideration would proceed without delay. The reportwould be explained to representatives of the Press at conferences withLobby correspondents and scientific correspondents.The Lord President said that a corresponding enquiry had beenconducted in the United States and, by arrangement, its report wouldalso be published on 12th June. Its findings were on much the samelines as those of the Medical Research Council. It raised, however,one further matter, viz., the disposal of radio-active waste; andproposed that an international conference should be convened toconsider the problems arising from the disposal of this waste in thesea.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Minister of Health said that some public comment mustbe expected on the degree of occupational risk to which workers inatomic energy establishments were exposed.The Lord President said that steps were already being taken toreduce this risk by varying the duties of workers in theseestablishments. A public statement could, if necessary, be madeabout the precautions which were being taken.(b) The Minister of Health said that the title of the report, withits reference to &quot; the hazards to man,&quot; was itself likely to cause unduepublic alarm. He hoped that the wording of this title would not beunnecessarily stressed in any public announcements.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report by a Committee of the MedicalResearch Council on the hazards to man of nuclear andallied radiations.(2) Took note of the arrangements which the Lord Presidenthad made for the publication of this report.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Departmentsconcerned to proceed without delay with theirconsideration of the various issues raised by the report.NuclearWeapons.Tests in 1957.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 39thConclusions,Minute 3.)9 The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider therevised draft of a statement which he was proposing to make in theHouse of Commons, later in the day, about the tests of nuclearweapons which were to be held in the Pacific in the spring of 1957.The Prime Minister said that the United States Government hadshown continuing concern about the consequences of a fresh initiativefor international discussion of the means of limiting test explosionsof nuclear weapons. They feared that, if the announcement weremade in the form originally proposed, this might become an issue inthe forthcoming Presidential Election. He still thought it necessaryto indicate the Government&apos;s readiness to discuss methods of limitingtest explosions; but, in view of these representations, he had decidedto confine himself in this announcement to a repetition of his earlieroffer to join in such discussions. He therefore proposed to recall that,
8in a statement in the House of Commons on 6th December, 1955, hehad made it clear that the United Kingdom Government wereprepared to discuss methods of regulating and limiting tests; to saythat this remained the policy of the United Kingdom Government;and to assure the House that the Government would seek everyopportunity to put it into effect.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreement withthe line which the Prime Minister proposed to take on this point.mThe Cabinet Approved the revised draft of the announcement which thePrime Minister proposed to make in the House of Commonslater that day about the tests of nuclear weapons which wereto be held in the Pacific in the spring of 1957.Prince ofHanover.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 133) setting out arguments in favour ofproceeding with the appeal which had been lodged in the House ofLords against the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the claim ofPrince Ernst of Hanover to British nationality.The Attorney-General said that, if the appeal were pursued,discussion of the relation between the Royal Marriages Act, 1772,and the Act of 1705 could not be excluded. Although the extentto which the Royal Marriages Act might be held to apply to personsaffected by the Act of 1705 was obscure, he would feel unable toavoid drawing attention, in the course of his argument in the Houseof Lords, to the relation between the two Acts and indicating thatother questions would be involved than the mere nationality ofPrince Ernst and other persons who might come within the purviewof the Act of 1705. If the appeal were to succeed there would be nofurther problem but, in his view, the chances were very evenlybalanced. In any event there was no possibility of diverting theattention of the Press from the wider aspects of the matter. Therehad been no Press comment since the appeal had been lodgedbecause, in response to enquiries, he had reminded the Press thatthe matter was sub judice. But the newspapers would again be freeto discuss the matter if the appeal were withdrawn.The Lord Chancellor said that he had taken the view that themarriage of a princess to a person who was a British subject onlyunder the Act of 1705 was, nevertheless, a marriage into a foreignfamily if the husband&apos;s family was in substance a foreign family.On this interpretation legislation would be unnecessary and, as therewere serious objections to legislation, he had taken the view thatit would be best not to carry the matter further.It was the general view of the Cabinet that a further attemptshould be made to clear up the doubts arising from the recentjudgment. If the appeal in the House of Lords succeeded, theproblem would be resolved. If it failed, the Government would haveno choice but to introduce legislation. In that event, it would behelpful to have had the judgment of the House of Lords.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should proceed with the appealwhich had been lodged in the House of Lords in the case ofPrince Ernst of Hanover.
CM. 40 (56)Education.CapitalInvestment.(PreviousReferences:C.C. (54) 80thConclusions,Minute 4, andCM. (56) 14thConclusions.)11. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 135) and the Minister ofEducation (CP. (56) 134) on the extent to which the school buildingprogramme should be retarded because of the general economicsituation.The Minister of Education said that the problem had arisenbecause, since the Cabinet had approved the proposals put forwardin February in connection with the economic situation, it hademerged that  32 millions instead of  20 millions of building workwhich was due to have been started in the previous year had beenbrought forward for commencement in the current year. This wasa new factor which could not have been foreseen. The proposalsin CP. (56) 135 would involve a much more serious retardation ofthe programme than had been contemplated in February, and wouldmean the loss of 200,000 instead of 100,000 school places in 1958when the numbers in secondary schools would increase most sharply.It would be difficult to present such a further economy merely as adelay in the building programme and not as a cut in it. Moreover,such a decision would be seen to be inconsistent with theGovernment&apos;s programme for technical education which dependedon the proper development of secondary education and theGovernment would be exposed to criticism on that score.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, cuts in expenditurewhich were made necessary by the economic situation should fall oneducation only in the last resort when it was clear that other meansof saving would not yield enough. The public would be preparedto accept the need for the measures demanded by the economicsituation if they were satisfied that economy was not being pursuedat the expense of their children&apos;s education.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the average rate ofnew school building in the previous year had been  4 6 millions amonth. He had been reluctant, in view of the economic situation,to accept the need which the Minister of Education&apos;s proposalscontemplated for an actual increase in this monthly rate in thecurrent year and the following year. He agreed, however, that inview of the arguments which had been put forward there must besome compromise in the matter. He was prepared therefore toaccept the figure of  55 millions as the total of new school buildingwhich should be started this year and he proposed that thecorresponding figure for 1957-58 should be  25 millions in eachhalf-year. Local authorities could be authorised to plan on thisbasis and could be informed that the figure would be further increasedif the economic situation justified it.The Cabinet Approved the proposals with regard to new school buildingwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer had put forwardin their discussion.TrinidadOU ,2. ^ Compan,        C^cMta^^ ^^Z^J^l^^^^^^^ 5 tTk^CldwS to see*the  ews of his colleagues in the Cabinet. Meanwhile,however he was to be asked that afternoon in the House ofrommons bv Private Notice Question, whether he had any statementto make. &apos; He proposed to say in reply that the matter was underconsideration.The Cabinet-Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldsubmit   for   the   Cabinet&apos;s   approval   his considered
10recommendation on the question whether consent shouldbe given for the transfer to the United States of the Britishstockholding in the Trinidad Oil Company.Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)13. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussionon 5th June, indications had been received that there was muchpublic misapprehension in Canada about the basis of British policyin Cyprus. The Commonwealth Secretary was anxious to take allpracticable steps to correct these misunderstandings. Factualmaterial was being supplied to him by the Colonial Office. It wouldalso be helpful if extracts from Ministers&apos; speeches on Cyprus couldbe forwarded to the Commonwealth Secretary for transmission toCanada.The Cabinet Agreed that Ministers who were proposing to refer toCyprus in their public speeches should, in addition to priorconsultation with the Colonial Secretary, send extracts tothe Commonwealth Secretary for transmission, asappropriate, to Canada and other Commonwealth countries.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 5.)14. The Minister of Agriculture said that he was to answer,in the House of Commons that afternoon, several Questions aboutthe action taken by his Department in dispossessing Lady Garbettof her agricultural property in Sussex. Most of these were concernedwith questions of fact, but one raised the general question oflegislation on this subject. As his colleagues were aware, he washolding confidential consultations with leaders of the farmingindustry, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusion of 26th April, onthe disciplinary powers under the Agriculture Acts and the provisionsfor security of tenure for tenant farmers. In his opinion, however,it would be premature to disclose the Government&apos;s plans for dealingwith this general problem in reply to this particular Question.Subject therefore to the Cabinet&apos;s views he proposed to avoid makingany public reference at this stage to the general enquiries which theGovernment were conducting on this subject, and to confine himselfto pointing out the difficulties of undertaking legislation on thisquestion at the present time.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Agriculture should, if possible,defer for the time being any general statement of theGovernment&apos;s intentions in respect of the disciplinarypowers under the Agriculture Acts and the provisions forsecurity of tenure for tenant farmers.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,7th June, 1956.
