3CM. 24 (56)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Malta. 2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the handling in(Previous       Parliament of the report of the Round Table Conference on Malta.Reference: The Colonial Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussionCM. (56) 23rd on 15th March, this question had been considered at two meetingsConclusions, of the 1922 Committee. These had shown that, among GovernmentMinute 10.) supporters in the House of Commons, there was a strong body ofopinion against the constitutional recommendations of the RoundTable Conference. It was clear that in the House of Commons atthe present time a motion approving those recommendations couldonly be carried by using Labour votes to outweigh Conservativedissent. He still thought it desirable, however, that some discussionof this question should be held in Parliament before the Easier recess.If discussion were delayed, the political situation in Malta woulddeteriorate. The Prime Minister, if he were obliged to returnempty-handed to Malta, might well be tempted to make someextreme statement which would altogether exclude the possibility ofan agreement between his Government and the Roman Catholicauthorities in the Island, and it would then become impossible toretrieve the situation by political means. It would be deplorable ifthere developed in Malta a situation comparable with that which theGovernment now had to face in Cyprus. He therefore recommendedthat there should at least be a preliminary debate in the House ofCommons before the Easter recess, possibly on a motion for theadjournment.In discussion it was pointed out that the recommendations ofthe Round Table Conference, since they would involve legislation,could not be discussed on the adjournment. The debate, if it wereheld before Easter, would have to take place on a Government motioninviting the House to take note of the report. The suggestion had,however, been made by Private Members on both sides of the Housethat, as this question involved a religious issue, it was inappropriatethat it should be debated in Parliament during Holy Week; and theOpposition Whips had now suggested that it might be preferable forthis reason to defer the debate until after the recess.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet should take accountof the state of feeling on this subject among Government supporters.There was widespread uneasiness about it, and there was likely to beresentment of any action which suggested that Parliament was beingrushed into taking hasty decisions on it.In further discussion it was pointed out that three months hadpassed since the report of the Round Table Conference had beenpublished, and all that was now suggested was that the House ofCommons should hold a preliminary debate on its recommendations.The Government would run a grave risk if they accepted theresponsibility of deferring a debate of this kind. There was no directevidence that the Roman Catholic authorities in Malta would thinkit wrong that this question should be debated at Westminster in HolyWeek. The suggestion that the debate should be deferred on thisaccount had come originally from Members who were anxious onother grounds to delay decisions which might go in favour of thereport of the Round Table Conference. If the debate were delayed,and the situation in Malta then deteriorated, it would certainly besaid that this was due to the Government&apos;s dilatoriness in dealingwith the report. On the other hand, if the debate were held, theColonial Secretary could make it clear in his speech that, beforeembarking on legislative action to give effect to the report, theGovernment would need further evidence that its recommendationswere welcomed by a substantial majority of the Maltese people.This evidence could be provided either by an agreement between the49935 1 b 2
4Government of Malta and the Roman Catholic authorities in theIsland or, failing that, by the result of a further election in Malta.The Parliament at Westminster would not be asked to take definitivedecisions until further progress had been made, by these means, toestablish the wishes of the Maltese people.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that he wasin favour of holding a preliminary debate on this question in theHouse of Commons before the Easter recess. This debate might takeplace on 26th March, on a Government motion inviting the Houseto take note of the report of the Round Table Conference. If theLabour Opposition pressed the suggestion that the debate shouldnot be held in Holy Week, he would accept this postponement oncondition that they undertook to state publicly that they favoured it.In that event it should be publicly stated that the debate would beheld in the course of the week in which Parliament reassembled afterthe Easter recess.The Cabinet Took note that, in his consultation with the Oppositionleaders on the Parliamentary handling of the report of theRound Table Conference on Malta, the Prime Ministerwould put forward the proposal which he had outlinedin summing up the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.3. The President of the Board of Trade said that, in accordancewith the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 15th March, he had informed theorganisers of the London section of the British Industries Fair thatthe Government were not prepared to give them the financial supportneeded to ensure the continuance of this section of the Fair. Theorganisers had accepted this decision; but they were anxious that,in view of their obligations to traders, the announcement of thedecision should not be deferred until after the end of the forthcomingFair in April but should be made at once. The President said thatthis was a point on which the Cabinet might be content to be guidedby the views of the organisers. If so, he would announce the decisionon 27th March. He would make it clear, in his announcement, thatthe Birmingham section of the Fair would continue and that theGovernment would also make increased efforts in future to improvethe quality of British exhibits in industrial fairs overseas.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade and authorised him to announce, on 27th March,the Government&apos;s decision to terminate their financialsupport of the London section of the British Industries Fair.BritishIndustriesFair.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 23rdConclusions,Minute 9.)Cost ofLiving.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Minister of Labour said that the figure for February,under the new Index of retail prices, would be published on thefollowing day. It would show no increase, as compared with the basefigure for January 1956. This was satisfactory.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.MiddleEast.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)*5. The Foreign Secretary recalled that, before leaving on hisrecent tour of the Middle East, he had discussed with the Cabinet theline which he should take in his conversations with the Prime Ministerof Egypt. As a result of those conversations he was satisfied thatColonel Nasser was unwilling to work with the Western Powers orto co-operate in the task of securing peace in the Middle East. Itwas evident that he was aiming at leadership of the Arab world; that,in order to secure it, he was willing to accept the help of the* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.
5CM. 24 (56)Russians; and that he was not prepared to work for a settlement ofthe Arab dispute with Israel. Despite the conversations in Cairo,there had been no slackening in the Egyptian propaganda against theBritish position in the Middle East. It was now clear that we couldnot establish a basis for friendly relations with Egypt. That beingso, we ought to realign our policy in the Middle East: instead ofseeking to conciliate or support Colonel Nasser, we should do ourutmost to counter Egyptian policy and to uphold our true friends inthe Middle East. Thus, we should seek increased support for theBagdad Pact and its members. We should make a further effort topersuade the United States to join the Pact. We should seek to drawIraq and Jordan more closely together. We should try to detachSaudi Arabia from Egypt, by making plain to King Saud the natureof Nasser&apos;s ambitions. We should secure further support for Libya,in order to prevent the extension of Egyptian or Communist influencethere. We should seek to establish in Syria a Government morefriendly to the West. We should counter Egyptian subversion in theSudan and in the Persian Gulf. There were also possibilities of actionaimed more directly at Egypt e.g., the withholding of militarysupplies, the withdrawal of financial support for the Aswan Dam, thereduction of United States economic aid and the blocking of sterlingbalances. In all this we should need the support of the United StatesGovernment. The first task would be to seek Anglo-Americanagreement on a general realignment of policy towards Egypt.The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary had alreadydiscussed with him and some of his senior colleagues the proposalswhich he had now outlined to the Cabinet. He was in full agreementwith this approach to the problem. It might not be easy to secureUnited States support for a new policy on these lines. We must,however, do our utmost to persuade them of the importance andurgency of checking Colonel Nasser in his bid for leadership of theArab world. He had therefore authorised the Foreign Secretary toput these proposals to the United States Secretary of State, throughH.M. Ambassador at Washington, and he had reinforced thisapproach by a personal message to the President.In discussion there was general agreement that every effortshould now be made to persuade the United States Government togo forward with us in a new policy towards Egypt on the linesindicated by the Foreign Secretary. In the course of the discussionthe following particular points were raised:  (a) Since the Foreign Secretary&apos;s visit to Cairo the Egyptians hadmade a further attempt to supplant us in Libya. No further timeshould be lost in promising further financial support to the LibyanGovernment.(b) British influence in the Persian Gulf must be maintained.For this purpose British forces must be readily available, so that theycould intervene without delay to restore law and order in anemergency. The Army must have sufficient hot-weather accommoda-tion, whether at Aden or at Sharjah, to enable them to undertakethese duties. The Navy must have at their disposal a sufficientnumber of ships equipped for duty, under all weather conditions, inthe Gulf.(c) Further study should be made of the economic aspects of thepolicy outlined by the Foreign Secretary. The Foreign Secretaryshould arrange for this study to be carried out by officials of theForeign Office, Treasury and the Board of Trade. The results shouldbe reported to Ministers.id) An early increase in Israel&apos;s military strength might deter thethreatened aggression by Egypt. At the moment Israel&apos;s greatest needwas for interceptor aircraft. We had recently supplied them withsome Meteor night fighters; and some Mystere fighters were on theirway from France. The United States Government might, however,be asked to consider urgently whether any further assistance couldbe given to Israel in this respect.
6The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the approach that had been madeto the United States Government with a view to theformulation of a new Anglo-American policy towardsEgypt.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to follow up the points notedin paragraph (b) above.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for further study ofthe economic aspects of this policy in accordance withparagraph (c) above.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take up with the UnitedStates Government, as suggested in paragraph (d) above,the question whether further fighter aircraft could besupplied to Israel.East /WestTrade.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Tractors forChina.6. The Cabinet were informed that the Chinese wished toplace a trial order for 100 agricultural tractors in this country.H.M. Ambassador at Washington, who had been asked to forecastthe likely reactions of the United States Government, had atfirst advised that the export of the tractors should be licensed.Subsequently, however, he had telegraphed that this would be anunpropitious time at which to raise this matter with the United StatesAdministration who were involved in difficulties with Congress overthe Foreign Aid Bill.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be difficult tojustify a refusal to export agricultural tractors to China at a time whenshort-time working and unemployment were developing in the motorindustry. The export of these tractors could be licensed under the&quot; exceptions procedure &quot; and the French were believed to be aboutto send tractors to China under that procedure. Moreover, therefusal of licences would not prevent the Chinese from obtainingtractors; for, under the present arrangements governing East-Westtrade, the Soviet Union would be free to import them and transferthem to the Chinese. In these circumstances we should be fullyjustified in raising the matter with the United States Government.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. Ambassadorat Washington to discuss with the United States Governmentthe question of licensing the export of agricultural tractorsto China.Agriculture.DisciplinaryPowers andSecurity ofTenure.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 24thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivySeal (CP. (56) 81) reporting the conclusions reached by the HomeAffairs Committee on a proposal to appoint an independentcommittee of enquiry to review the statutory provisions for ensuringsatisfactory standards of husbandry and estate management and forgiving security of tenure to tenant farmers.The Lord Privy Seal said that the arguments in favour of suchan enquiry were strong. The disciplinary powers under Part II of theAgriculture Act, 1947 had fallen virtually into disuse; and theAgricultural Holdings Act, 1948 continued to provide an excessivedegree of security of tenure for the tenant farmer. Unless these Actswere amended or their administration put on to an acceptablefooting, it would become increasingly difficult for the AgricultureMinisters to discharge their responsibilities. It was important thatthere should be a greater freedom of entry into agriculture, and thestatutory powers governing both discipline and security of tenurewere out of harmony with Conservative principles.On the other hand, it could not be expected that such an enquirywould be welcomed by the farmers. It would arouse controversy and
7CM. 24 (56)it might not be completed in time for legislation to be introducedbefore the 1957-58 session. It would be dangerous to introducelegislation on this subject late in the lifetime of the Parliament.Nevertheless, the balance of argument, in his view, was in favour ofholding an enquiry, especially if it could be related to an announce-ment of the Government&apos;s intention to modify their farm price policyin such a way as to relate it more directly to farming efficiency.The Minister of Agriculture said that excessive security of tenurewas leading to immobility and stagnation in the farming industry.This was the more important of the two problems; and theGovernment could not promote amending legislation on it withoutthe support of an independent enquiry. The disciplinary powerscould not be left to become a dead letter: they should either beabandoned or revived on an acceptable basis. Here again he neededthe support of an independent enquiry in formulating and applyinga policy adapted to current needs.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The appearance of concentrating the enquiry exclusively onthe controversial issues of discipline and security of tenure mightbe avoided by giving it a more positive purpose, e.g., to review theopportunities which in present conditions were available to youngfarmers to enter the industry.(b) It was argued that, as guaranteed prices were high, theinefficient farmer was easily able to cover his costs, remain in theindustry, and impede the entry of a newcomer. The enquiry should,therefore, be combined with a new longer term policy for reducingthe levels of guaranteed prices. On the other hand, it would takesome time to formulate such a policy. It might, therefore, bedangerous to link the proposed enquiry too closely with undertakingsforeshadowing fundamental changes of policy in regard to priceguarantees.(c) If the enquiry were to be completed in time for legislationin the 1957-58 session, it must be set on foot without delay. Evenso, there could be no certainty that this time-table would be fulfilled.It would be embarrassing to the Government to be confronted witha controversial report on this question late in the lifetime of theParliament. It might, therefore, be preferable to appoint a RoyalCommission to conduct a more comprehensive review of agriculturalpolicy. This might report in time for legislation in the early sessionsof the next Parliament.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to re-examine, in the light ofthe points made in their discussion, the proposal to appointan independent enquiry into the statutory provisionsrelating to agricultural discipline and tenure, and to reportfurther to the Cabinet on this proposal.LegislativeProgramme.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivySeal (CP. (56) 82) seeking a decision on the question whether one ormore of four specially urgent Bills should be added to the legislativeprogramme for the current session.The Lord Privy Seal said that, since his memorandum wascirculated, he had agreed that the Colonial Development CorporationBill should be included in the programme. He invited the Cabinetto decide whether legislation should be introduced to give effect tothe main recommendations in the recent Report of the NationalInsurance Advisory Committee on Widows&apos; Benefits. In view of theinterest which this Report had aroused, it would be difficult to deferlegislation on this subject until the next session. He thought thatit should now have priority over the Family Allowances Bill.
8The Cabinet considered that time should be found for both theseBills. An undertaking to introduce a Family Allowances Bill thissession had been given in The Queen&apos;s Speech and had since beenreaffirmed. The legislation would come late in the session and theOpposition would scarcely wish to make difficulties about it. Anattempt should therefore be made to reach agreement withOpposition leaders to facilitate the passage of these two Bills andalso, if possible, of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill.The Cabinet noted that a Bill to give effect to the CaribbeanFederation would have to be enacted in this session. Legislationon Colonial Governors&apos; pensions and the Overseas Civil Servicewould, however, be deferred until the next session.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Bills on Family Allowances, Widows&apos;Benefits and the Colonial Development Corporationshould be added to the legislative programme for thecurrent session.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip to consultwith Opposition leaders with a view to securing theiragreement to facilitate the passage of the Bills on FamilyAllowances and Widows&apos; Benefits and also, if possible,the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill.Economic 9.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the ChancellorImplications of the Exchequer (C.P. (56) 83) covering the draft of a popular versionof Full of the  White  Paper  on  the  Economic  Implications  of FullEmployment. Employment.(Previous The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although the printingReference: strike would prevent publication of the popular version beforeCM. (56) 23rd 9th April, it was his intention to publish it at the earliest possibleConclusions, date, to have it distributed as widely as possible and to give it theMinute 7.) maximum publicity.The Cabinet approved the draft, subject to certain textualamendments suggested in the course of discussion.The Cabinet Authorised, subject to further textual changes, thepublication of the popular version annexed to C.P. (56) 83of the White Paper on the Economic Implications of FullEmployment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st March, 1956.
