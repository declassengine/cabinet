2The Lord Privy Seal said that from the latest informal soundingsof opinion among Government supporters in the House of Commonsit was evident that there was still an imperfect understanding of thelines on which Government policy was developing, and considerabledisquiet at the prospect of any decision which might be interpretedas an unconditional withdrawal of the Anglo-French force. It wasfor consideration, therefore, whether we should now press theSecretary-General of the United Nations to give more positiveassurances on the points about which public opinion in this countrywas exercised, particularly the clearance of the Suez Canal.The Foreign Secretary said that he had already instructed theUnited Kingdom Representative at the United Nations to emphasisethe following points to the Secretary-General:  (i) We should require the most categorical assurance that, afterthe Anglo-French force had been withdrawn, the EgyptianGovernment would not seek to deny free transit of the Canal toBritish ships on the pretext that there was a state of war betweenthe United Kingdom and Egypt. H.M. Ambassador at Washingtonhad also been instructed to make clear to the United StatesGovernment the importance which we attached to this point.(ii) It would be a considerable advantage, from the point ofview of enlisting the support of public opinion in this country, if wecould receive from the Secretary-General a more positive assurancethat, as soon as we announced a firm decision to withdraw theAnglo-French force, he would proceed without delay to secure theclearance of the rest of the Canal. For this purpose we could notaccept as sufficient the Secretary-General&apos;s existing undertaking that,as soon as the Anglo-French force began to withdraw, he woulddespatch survey parties to plan the operation and would endeavourto put in hand the work of actual clearance as far as possible; amore categorical assurance was needed that physical clearance wouldin fact proceed simultaneously with the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) We might compromise on the issue of the clearance of theCanal by undertaking to withdraw, say, 5,000 troops from theAnglo-French contingent, but suspending further withdrawals untilthe clearance of the Canal had been put in hand. Alternatively, wemight allow withdrawal to proceed for five days and then suspend itif work on clearance had not made significant progress. On the otherhand, there were obvious risks in conducting a partial withdrawalwhich would leave the Anglo-French force in an ambiguous position.(b) We might offer an undertaking to withdraw theAnglo-French force in return for a specific assurance from theSecretary-General that clearance of the Canal would proceed as fastas purely technical resources permitted, without reference to politicalfactors. On the other hand, this would provide no guarantee thatwe should in fact achieve our objective. The Egyptian Governmenthad never withdrawn their original statement that clearance of theCanal would not begin until the withdrawal of the Anglo-Frenchforce had been completed; and there was a considerable risk that,whatever assurances the Secretary-General might now be willing togive us, the Egyptian Government would be able to resist any furtherclearance of the Canal until the last British soldier had left Egyptiansoil. This was the more likely in that the United States Governmentappeared to be unwilling to bring pressure to bear against Egypt untilthe Anglo-French withdrawal was complete. If events followed thiscourse, the Egyptian Government would be regarded by worldopinion as the victors in the struggle, and we should suffer a severehumiliation.(c) The view was expressed that it might be wiser for the ForeignSecretary to inform the Secretary-General that, on his return to thiscountry, he had found that public opinion had hardened to an extentSuez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 91stConclusions,Minute 2.)
3CM. 92 (56)which made it more difficult for him to recommend to Parliamenta settlement on the basis which he had discussed with the Secretary-General, without commitment, during his visit to the United Nations.If we deployed this argument sufficiently firmly, we might hope thatboth the United Nations and the United States would realise thatthe only chance of a solution lay in their making some furtherconcession to public opinion in this country on the clearance of theCanal.(d) On the other hand, it was recognised that the final agreementwith the United Nations could not ignore the realities of the presentinternational situation. There could be no certainty that we shouldbe successful in exerting further pressure on the United Nations andthe United States Government; and there was some risk that furtherattempts to do so would cause the United Nations to reopen, possiblyto our disadvantage, the settlement which the Secretary-General hadprovisionally agreed with the Foreign Secretary in New York.In further discussion there was general agreement that theGovernment must be able to demonstrate that they had secured fromthe Secretary-General the most positive assurances about theclearance of the Canal which it was practicable to obtain in presentcircumstances, and that their policy in the United Nations had beendesigned to protect the vital interests of the United Kingdom in theMiddle East as these were interpreted by a large section of theirsupporters. The Cabinet&apos;s final decision must, therefore, be deferreduntil they could consider the result of the approach which the ForeignSecretary had made to the Secretary-General and to the UnitedStates Government in order to obtain a more definite undertakingabout the clearance of the Canal and an assurance that, once it wascleared, the Egyptian Government would permit complete freedomof transit without discrimination.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of these questions on thefollowing day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st December, 1956.
