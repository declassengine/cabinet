2Suez Canal. The Minister of Defence said that the Anglo-French forces(Previous        landed in Port Said had been ordered to cease fire at midnight onReference:      the night of 6th-7th November. He had not yet received final reportsC.M. (56) 80th  on the military situation at the time when that order took effect. ItConclusions.)   appeared, however, that British troops had reached a position midwaybetween Port Said and El Kantara and that, except for some limitedirregular activity, fighting had stopped in the Port Said area. Frenchtroops had probably penetrated a little further south. The unloadingof supplies, including the equipment needed to clear the harbourat  Port  Said,  was  proceeding  without  hindrance.   The nextobstruction in the Canal, however, was at a point considerably southof the position reached by British troops; and, if the work of clearingthe Canal was to proceed expeditiously, the engineering teams wouldneed authority to move into the obstructed area.The Cabinet discussed the political objectives which, followingthe &quot; cease-fire &quot; order, it would be necessary for us to pursue inthe United Nations and elsewhere. We were no longer in a strongposition to insist on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territorywhich they had occupied, since the French Government, in theirreply of 6th November to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations, had not followed the Government of the United Kingdomin subscribing to all the objectives enumerated in the operativeparagraphs of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly on2nd November, and had deliberately omitted reference to theparagraph urging the parties to the Armistice Agreements of 1948to withdraw all their forces behind the Armistice lines. Nevertheless,we should continue to insist that the Anglo-French forces shouldnot be withdrawn from the area of the Suez Canal until they hadhanded over to an international force competent to carry out thefunctions which we had in mind. We should oppose any attempt tocompel us to withdraw our own forces prematurely, on the lines ofthe resolution tabled by the Afro-Asian group at the GeneralAssembly.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of a further exchangeof messages with the President of the United States following theirtelephone conversation on the previous day. President Eisenhowerhad emphasised that in his view the &quot; immediate consummation &quot;of the United Nations&apos; plan for an international force was of thegreatest importance if the situation in Egypt was not to present aninvitation to &quot; developments of the greatest gravity&quot;; that, in orderto give the Soviet Union no excuse for participating in aninternational force, it was necessary to accept the majority proposalof the General Assembly that this force should not includecontingents from the major Powers; and that any attack on theUnited Nations force would meet an &quot; immediate reaction from allthe United Nations.&quot; The Prime Minister had said, in reply, thatwhile he was himself inclined to agree that the international forceshould be constituted as the General Assembly had proposed, thematter was of such importance that he must consult the Cabinetbefore expressing a final view on it. He had also indicated that thecomposition of the international force must depend to some extenton the functions assigned to it.The Cabinet first considered the arguments for and againstconstituting the international force on a basis which would excludecontingents from the major Powers. The acceptance of aninternational force from which the major Powers, including ourselves,were excluded could be justified on a number of grounds. It woulddo much to restore the confidence of the smaller nations; indeed,the Afro-Asian Powers might be uncompromisingly opposed to aproposal that the force should include British or French contingents.Furthermore, the acceptance of the majority view of the GeneralAssembly on this issue v/as probably an essential preliminary tore-establishing close relations with the United States and securingtheir general support in the negotiations which would be necessarybefore a settlement could be achieved in the Middle East. An
3CM. 81 (56)international force which might be substantially composed ofcontingents from the older members of the Commonwealth and theScandinavian countries could be expected to remain reasonablywithin the diplomatic control of the Western Powers. Finally, ifthe force comprised contingents of the major Powers, the SovietUnion would have a claim to participate in it on a substantial scale.Nevertheless, there were strong arguments in the contrary sense.The control of Port Said was now in our hands; but we should risklosing this single tangible gain if we did not, by participating in theinternational force, maintain our own troops in the area. Moreover,it was not clear that the United States were yet seized of the gravityof the Middle East situation, and there were grounds for believingthat they were more immediately concerned to secure the removal ofBritish and French troops from Egypt than to take an active partin seeking a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the problemsof the area. Nor was it certain that the participation of Soviet troopsin an international force would be the worst of evils. There wasevidence that the Soviet Union intended to intervene further in theMiddle East, and to exploit the position (possibly by re-armingEgypt for a rapid resumption of hostilities, or by occupying Syria)to the maximum limits of advantage short of precipitating a generalwar in which the United States would be involved. Participationin an international force would at least bring her intervention intothe open and keep it under some sort of control.fn further discussion the Cabinet took the view that there couldbe no lasting settlement in the Middle East until the differenceswhich now separated the major Powers had been resolved. TheSwiss Government, in proposing a new &quot; summit &quot; conference atGeneva, had suggested one possible approach to this problem. But,whatever method we adopted, our immediate purpose must now beto resume our close relations with the United States Governmentand to devote our efforts to inducing them to acknowledge theexistence in the Middle East of the dangerous situation which theyhad consistently refused to recognise since the end of the war. Itwas agreed that the Prime Minister should consider further howsuch an approach to the United States Government might bearranged, and should endeavour to convince them that a finaldecision by the United Nations on the composition and functionsof the international force in the Suez Canal area should, if possible,be deferred until the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States had reached a clearer understanding on their commonobjectives in the Middle East.In the light of these considerations it would be necessary to givefurther thought to the attitude which the United KingdomRepresentative at the United Nations should adopt towardsresolutions dealing with the constitution of the international forceand the withdrawal of the Anglo-French contingent. It might bedesirable that, while voting in favour of any resolution which wasnot unacceptable to us in principle, he should reserve the position ofthe United Kingdom on various points of detail which we consideredfundamental. It would, however, be in the common internationalinterest that, irrespective of the &quot; cease-fire &quot; order, the Anglo-Frenchforce should be allowed to proceed with the task of clearing theSuez Canal, for which they were equipped. We might suggest thatthese operations should be conducted under the direction of theUnited Nations, who could, if they so wished, nominate a suitabletechnical expert to supervise the work.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Egypt Committee to consider further, at ameeting to be held later in the day, what instructionsshould be given to the United Kingdom Representativeat the United Nations regarding the composition andfunctions of the international force which was to bestationed in Egypt.
4(2) Agreed that we should endeavour to seek a basis on whichwe could support any further resolution in the GeneralAssembly on this subject, while attempting to safeguardour essential interests by reservations or other means.(3) Agreed that, in seeking the authority of the GeneralAssembly to undertake the clearing of the Suez Canal,we should be prepared, if need arose, to place our salvageorganisation under the supervision of the United Nations.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,10th November, 1956.
