2Suez Canal. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the United(Previous Nations Assembly, in special emergency session, had adopted twoReference: resolutions, one put forward by Canada, the other by a group ofCM. (56) 78th Afro-Asian States led by India. The Canadian resolution requestedConclusions.) the Secretary-General to submit within forty-eight hours a plan forthe constitution of a United Nations force to secure and supervisethe cessation of hostilities in the Suez Canal area. The Afro-Asianresolution authorised the Secretary-General to arrange an immediatecease-fire in the area within twelve hours. The Secretary-Generalhad now transmitted this demand to the United KingdomGovernment in a letter which made it clear that, as the representativeof the Israel Government had offered in the debate in the UnitedNations Assembly to accept a cease-fire, and as Egypt had previouslyagreed to order a cease-fire, it now lay wholly within the capacityof the United Kingdom and French Governments to bring thehostilities in Egypt to an end. This letter placed a heavy onus ofresponsibility on the Governments of the United Kingdom andFrance; for it implied that, unless they accepted a cease-fire, theywould alone be responsible for the continuance of hostilities whichit had been the professed intention of their intervention to stop. Ifboth the Israelis and the Egyptians were in fact willing to accepta cease-fire, it would be difficult to deny that the purpose of ourintervention in Egypt had already been achieved.Our reply to the Secretary-General&apos;s message would need to bedespatched not later than midnight. It was therefore necessary todecide whether we should allow the initial phase of our occupationof the Canal area to proceed, as planned, in the early hours of thefollowing morning and, if so, what reply we should send to the UnitedNations.In discussion it was recognised that three courses of action werepossible:  (i) The initial phase of the occupation, consisting of the landingof British and French parachute troops at Port Said, should beallowed to proceed, and the United Nations should be informed that,although this action had been made imperative by the need tore-establish authority in the Suez Canal area, we remained willingto transfer the responsibility for policing that area to a UnitedNations force as soon as such a force could be effectively constitutedand on the spot. We could not, however, accept the suggestion thatthis force should not include British and French detachments.(ii) The parachute landings should be suspended for the nexttwenty-four hours in order to give the Governments of Egypt andIsrael an opportunity to agree to accept a United Nations force inthe Suez Canal area and to allow the United Nations time to considerwhether the Anglo-French force should effect the landing alreadyplanned as an advance guard of the ultimate United Nations force.(iii) We should defer further military action indefinitely, on theground that by bringing to an end the hostilities between Egyptand Israel we had achieved the substance of our original objective,and that we must henceforward be content to exert such pressureas we could maintain through political and diplomatic channels tosecure a final settlement of the problems of the Suez Canal areaunder the aegis of the United Nations.It was agreed that there were serious political disadvantages inrefusing to suspend military action in defiance of majority opinionin the United Nations. The Egyptian Government had alreadyagreed to the cease-fire which the General Assembly had demanded;and the latest reports suggested that the Israeli Government hadalso accepted this demand. If so, it would be difficult to sustain theargument that further military action by ourselves was necessaryin order to separate the combatants; and, if the initial phase of theAnglo-French landing encountered opposition and had to bereinforced by air or naval bombardment resulting in heavy civilian
3CM. 79 (56)casualties, we might well be unable to sustain our position in theface of world opinion. We should run a grave risk that the UnitedNations would feel compelled to adopt collective measures, includingoil sanctions, against the United Kingdom and France.On the other hand, the dangers inherent in deferring the initialparachute landings for even a brief interval were no less great. Ifthe momentum of the Anglo-French operation was allowed toslacken, the weight of public opinion would be against anyresumption of the attack; and, since we could not rely on the earlyintervention of an effective United Nations force, we should fail toachieve our main purpose of establishing an impartial authoritybetween Egypt and Israel.The Cabinet were informed that prospects for the initialparachute landings were now more favourable than had beenexpected on the previous day. The Egyptian forces appeared to bewithdrawing from Port Said towards Cairo, probably in order toprotect the seat of Government until a United Nations force arrived.There was now a reasonable chance that the parachute forces couldbe landed at Port Said and could secure a sufficient length of theport front without encountering such resistance as would make aheavy bombardment unavoidable.After a full discussion the Prime Minister invited each of hiscolleagues to indicate his view on the three alternative courses setout above. It then became clear that the preponderant opinion inthe Cabinet was in favour of the first course, viz., allowing the initialphase of the Anglo-French occupation of the Canal area to continueas planned. Two Ministers were inclined to favour the third courseof deferring further military action indefinitely; but they made itclear that, if a majority of the Cabinet favoured a different course,they would support it. Four Ministers were in favour of the middlecourse of suspending parachute landings for twenty-four hours; butthese Ministers also made it clear that, if the majority favoured adifferent course, they would support it. The Paymaster-General saidthat he remained in favour of suspending further military actionindefinitely and that, if this course did not commend itself to hiscolleagues, he must reserve his position.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasevident that the overwhelming balance of opinion in the Cabinetwas in favour of allowing the initial phase of the military operationto go forward as planned. This being so, he proposed that the UnitedNations should be informed that it remained necessary, in the viewof the Governments of the United Kingdom and France, to interposea force between Egypt and Israel in order to prevent the continuanceof hostilities, to secure the speedy withdrawal of Israeli forces, torestore traffic through the Suez Canal and to promote a settlementof the outstanding problems of the area. For this purpose certainAnglo-French operations with strictly limited objectives wouldcontinue; but, as soon as the Israeli and Egyptian Governmentsaccepted a plan, endorsed by the United Nations, for an internationalforce with the above functions, the United Kingdom and Francewould stop all military action. A new and constructive solution ofthe problems of the Middle East would, however, remain urgent. Tothis end an early meeting of the Security Council should be called,at Ministerial level, in order to work out an international settlementwhich would be likely to endure, together with the means to enforce it.At the end of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion information was receivedthat, contrary to earlier reports, the Government of Israel, whilewilling in principle to agree to cease hostilities in the Canal area,had now made it clear that they were not prepared to do so on theconditions specified in the United Nations Resolution. It thusappeared that a cease-fire had not yet been achieved in the area;and this, coupled with the refusal of Israel to accept a United Nations
4force and to withdraw from the Egyptian territory which she hadoccupied, was a sufficient ground for proceeding with police actionin the area of the Canal.  In these circumstances The Cabinet (1) Agreed that subject to the concurrence of the FrenchGovernment, the initial phase of the Anglo-Frenchoccupation of the Suez Canal area should be put intoeffect on the lines proposed.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to reply to the communicationfrom the Secretary-General of the United Nations on thelines agreed in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,5th November, 1956.
