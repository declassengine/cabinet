jCM. 101 (56)Northern 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeIreland. Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary (CP. (56) 284) regardinga number of acts of terrorism recently organised in Northern Irelandby members of the Irish Republican Army.The Home Secretary said that these incidents had aroused acutefeeling in Northern Ireland and there was a real risk of reprisalsleading to armed conflict on both sides of the border. He and theCommonwealth Secretary had intended, when their memorandumwas circulated, to recommend that a strong protest should at oncebe lodged with the frish Republican Government so that the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland might be able to say, when the matterwas raised in the Belfast Parliament on 18th December, that thisaction had been taken in Dublin. Since then, however, the DublinGovernment had themselves issued a firm statement deprecating theaction of these organisations in arrogating to themselves the powersand functions of government and declaring their intention to take,in conjunction with the police and defence forces, all necessary stepsto prevent these activities which, if they were allowed to continue,would involve a risk of civil war. In view of the initiative thus takenby the Dublin Government it might now be unnecessary to lodge aprotest on the lines previously envisaged.In discussion there was general agreement that the best coursewould be for the Government to indicate their grave concern at therecent acts of violence, to welcome the statement made by the DublinGovernment, and to express the hope that it would be followed byprompt and effective action to bring these irregular activities to anend.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for anurgent communication to be made to the Irish RepublicanGovernment on the lines agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to inform the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland of the terms of this communicationand to authorise him to refer to it in the debate in theNorthern Ireland Parliament on the following day.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 100thConclusions,Minute 1.)Prisoners ofWar.2. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion on 12th December, he had given further thought to thequestion whether the Egyptian prisoners of war now in our custodyshould be removed to Cyprus, in order that their surrender might benegotiated against the repatriation of War Office contractors&quot; staffsnow interned in Egypt. The balance of argument seemed to him to beagainst this course. It would be contrary to the Geneva Conventions;it would be inconsistent with the action of our French allies, who wereproposing to hand over their prisoners of war to the Commander ofthe United Nations force; and it would conflict with the strong advicetendered by the Commander-in-Chief. There would however be lessobjection to the removal to Cyprus of the Egyptian civilians nowdetained in Port Said; and he believed that the pressure which wewere applying for the release of the contractors&apos; staff could beincreased by letting it be known that we were making preliminaryarrangements for the removal of these Egyptian civilians to Cyprus.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There would be great difficulty in providing accommodationfor any large number of prisoners in Cyprus, in view of the obligationswhich had already been undertaken to provide facilities there for thereception, in transit or otherwise, of British subjects evacuated fromEgypt and other countries of the Middle East. There was, however,51078 3b 2
4no possibility of providing for the early reception of these prisonersin any other British possession in the area; and The ColonialSecretary said that, if it were decided that the prisoners of war shouldbe handed over to the Commander of the United Nations force, hewould be ready to ask the Governor of Cyprus to make plans for thereception of the Egyptian civilians now detained in Port Said.(h) Was it desirable that a senior Egyptian officer should be fretained in British custody as a pledge for the return of the Britishofficer (Lieutenant Moorhouse) who had recently disappeared in PortSaid? It was recognised that this would be gratifying to publicopinion in this country. On the other hand, it now seemed likely thatLieutenant Moorhouse had been killed; and there would be nojustification in law for holding an Egyptian prisoner as a means ofcompelling the payment of compensation for the murder of LieutenantMoorhouse. The better course would be to continue our efforts totrace Lieutenant Moorhouse, for so long as the Anglo/French forceremained in Port Said, and to press the United Nations force tocontinue the search for him thereafter.(c) The Cabinet were informed that, if all the Egyptian civiliansnow detained in Port Said were to be shipped to Cyprus before theevacuation of the Anglo/French force was completed, their removalmust begin at once. It should therefore be made clear to theCommander of the United Nations force that, while the movementmust be started for this reason, we were still prepared to conclude anagreement with the Egyptians for the simultaneous release of thecontractors&apos; staffs and of the Egyptian civilians held in custody inPort Said.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that all Egyptian prisoners of war in the custody ofBritish forces in Port Said should without exception betransferred to the custody of the Commander of theUnited Nations force.(2) Agreed that arrangements should be made for the removalto Cyprus of Egyptian civilians now detained by Britishforces in Port Said, but that every effort should continueto be made to reach an agreement for the simultaneousrelease of these civilians and of British civilians held inEgyptian custody.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to give instructions in thissense to the Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo/Frenchforce; and invited the Colonial Secretary to givecorresponding instructions to the Governor of Cyprus.Clearance of the j/ie foreign Secretary said that, as there still seemed littleCanal. prospect that rapid progress would be made with the clearance of the(Previous Canal in the near future, he proposed to make a statement in theReference: House of Commons that day, setting out the terms on which we wereCM. (56) 100th prepared to make our salvage resources available to the UnitedConclusions, Nations and the unsatisfactory response which had been made toMinute l.)      our offer.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the civilian crewsof our salvage ships had been disturbed both by the attitude ofGeneral Wheeler, the officer in command of the United Nationssalvage operation, and by the statement of the Egyptian ForeignMinister that, if British personnel took part in the further clearanceof the Canal, their safety could not be guaranteed. It was to beexpected, therefore, that British crews would be unwilling to take anyfurther part in the operation unless they were assured of adequateBritish naval protection. The owners of the German salvage vesselswhich the Admiralty had chartered had already refused to release usfrom the charter unless the United Nations could offer a parallelguarantee that their crews would be protected. In these circumstancesit was recognised that public opinion in this country would expect
5 CM. 101 (56)the Government to be more forthright in their contention that Britishsalvage teams should be allowed to continue the clearance of theCanal; and it was agreed that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement shouldemphasise that the action of the Egyptian Government in blockingthe Canal was a breach of the 1888 Convention in the light of whichwe were entitled to claim that all available resources should be used,without discrimination, for its clearance. On the other hand, it wasargued that we could not afford to offend world opinion by appearingto insist on unreasonable terms for the employment of our vessels.The United States Government were now sympathetic with our pointof view on this question, and we should not risk alienating them. Anobjective statement of the facts, emphasising both our own willingnessto co-operate to the maximum in the clearance of the Canal and theunsatisfactory attitude of the United Nations, might be the best meansof securing that the United States Government would exert furtherpressure on the United Nations in this matter.In further discussion some doubt was expressed about theexpediency of making a statement on the lines proposed in Parliamentthat day, in view of the risk that it might provoke another debate onthe Suez Canal before the Christmas recess. On the other hand publicopinion was already showing signs of increasing concern about thedelay in the clearance of the Canal; and, as it might eventually provenecessary to withdraw our salvage ships if we could not reachagreement with the United Nations about the terms of theiremployment, it would be prudent to prepare the House of Commonsfor this eventuality. If the public were informed in good time of thealternative courses now open, the Government were more likely tocommand support in withdrawing the ships in the last resort ratherthan risking the safety of their crews.The Cabinet agreed that, on balance, the advantage lay on theside of making a statement that day on the lines proposed by theForeign Secretary, subject to various amendments which had beenproposed during the discussion.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that day, indicating the terms onwhich we were prepared to make our salvage resourcesavailable to the United Nations for the further clearanceof the Suez Canal, and emphasising that the responsibilityfor any further delay in this operation lay clearly with theUnited Nations.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,17th December, J956.
