JCM. 102 (56)Cyprus. J.   The Colonial Secretary said that, during his visit to Athens, he(Previoushad found that the Greek Government were disinclined, for politicalReference:      reasons, to concede any public acknowledgement of the merits ofCM. (56) 99th  Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report. They were particularly critical of the powersConclusions,    reserved to the Governor under the draft constitution. Moreover,Minute 2.)      unless  the Government&apos;s statement  of policy contained someindication of the date by which self-determination would be exercisedand made provision for the early return of Archbishop Makariosfrom exile, the attitude of the Greek Government to our proposalsmust be expected to be hostile.The Turkish Government had been more co-operative.Although they were likely to find difficulty in persuading their publicto accept a constitution which did not concede the Turkish Cypriots&apos;demand for equality with the Greek Cypriots, they were prepared toacquiesce in reforms on the lines recommended in Lord Radcliffe&apos;sreport in order to appear as conciliatory as possible by contrast withthe Greek Government. They would have preferred that theGovernment&apos;s statement of policy should make no reference toeventual self-determination. But, if something had to be said on thispoint, they hoped it would envisage a partition of the Island on abasis which would provide for the retention of a military base byourselves. They were also anxious that the reference to partition inthe earlier draft of the statement annexed to C.P. (56) 281 should bereplaced by a more positive form of words on the following lines &quot; This would mean that, in the event of the exercise ofself-determination resulting in a choice in favour of a change ofthe international status of the Island, then the Turkish Cypriotswould be given the option of electing for partition.&quot;A statement on these lines would secure the acquiescence of theTurkish Government. It was also likely to be acceptable to theGovernment&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons. If anannouncement of policy embodying a statement to this effect weremade later in the week, the Government would appear to be actingfrom strength and would secure the maximum advantage from thegoodwill which the Turkish Government had shown during his visit.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The amendment proposed by the Turkish Governmentwould have the result that the concept of partition would figure moreprominently among the eventual solutions to the problem than it hadin the original draft of the statement. This would be liable toincrease the local pressure for the date of self-determination to beadvanced; and we might then find that we were compelled to concedeself-determination with no adequate assurance that our continuingstrategic needs in the Island would be safeguarded. The draftstatement already made it clear, however, that we should not beprepared to review the question of the application of self-determination until the international and strategic situation permittedand self-government was working satisfactorily. These stipulationsshould suffice to ensure that we could maintain strategic facilities inthe Island for as long as was necessary.(b) We could not, however, deny that it would rest with us todecide when the international and strategic situation permittedself-determination and when self-government was workingsatisfactorily. We were therefore liable to be accused of making ouroffer of self-determination conditional upon a time-table which couldbe adjusted to suit our own convenience. If we envisaged that ourneed of strategic facilities in the Island would persist for as long ascould be foreseen at present, it might be wiser to make the exerciseof self-determination explicitly dependent upon our retaining theright to maintain such facilities indefinitely.(c) On the other hand there was considerable doubt whetheran enclave of British territory in an Island otherwise divided between51083 B 2
4Greek and Turkish communities would be strategically satisfactory.In particular, we should be dependent, for the effective maintenanceof a military base in such an enclave, on local labour which would bedrawn from areas over which we no longer exercised sovereignty.For these reasons it might be wiser to rely simply on the originalstipulation that we would be ready to review the question ofself-determination as soon as the international and strategic situationpermitted. I(d) The more explicit reference to partition which the TurkishGovernment favoured was open to the further objection that, eventhough it was proposed that partition should not become a practicalissue until self-Government was working satisfactorily, the admissionthat it might prove to be the eventual solution would weaken theincentive to the local communities to co-operate in the effectiveestablishment of self-government. But the alternative of concedingpartition forthwith would be a premature and unrealistic approach tothe problem. The constitution proposed by Lord Radcliffe was asound one on merits and should at least be given an adequate trial.At this point the Colonial Secretary had to withdraw from themeeting in order to fulfil an important public engagement.In subsequent discussion it was agreed that, in the light of theconflicting arguments which had been advanced, the balance ofadvantage seemed to lie in rejecting the formula about partitionwhich the Turkish Government preferred and in reverting to thetreatment adopted in the original draft of the statement of policy,which had put the possibility of partition in a more remoteperspective. But, in order to preserve as far as possible the goodwillof the Turkish Government, a more positive form of wording mightbe adopted, on the following lines:  &quot;In other words Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that&quot; X&quot;   the exercise of self-determination in such a mixed communitymust include partition among the eventual options.&quot;It was agreed that further consideration should be given to thisalternative formula, both in terms of its probable effect on theTurkish Government and from the point of view of the possibleanalogy with the relations between Northern Ireland and the IrishRepublic.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Home Secretary, to consider theimplications of a formula on the lines of &quot; X &quot; above.Broadcasting.The FortnightRule.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 98thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that he had ascertained that theOpposition leaders would be ready to agree that the existing rulesagainst anticipation of Parliamentary debate should now besuspended, in the light of assurances from the British BroadcastingCorporation, and Independent Television Authority (I.T.A.) and theI.T.A.&apos;s programme companies that, despite the suspension of therules, they would continue to act in a way which did not derogatefrom the primacy of Parliament as the forum for debating the affairsof the nation. He therefore suggested that the Government couldnow announce their intention to suspend the existing rule on thisbasis for an experimental period of six months.The Cabinet Agreed that the existing rules for preventing the anticipationof Parliamentary debate in broadcast or televisionprogrammes should be suspended for an experimentalperiod of six months.

The Paymaster-General said that Sir Edwin Herbert, afterinvestigating in Port Said the estimates of the casualties which hadresulted from the Anglo-French military operation, had reached theconclusion that about 650 people had been killed, about 800 seriouslywounded and possibly 1,000 slightly wounded. These figures wereappreciably higher than the estimates which he himself had preparedafter his preliminary visit to Port Said. Sir Edwin Herbert&apos;s reportwould be available to the Minister of Defence on the following day;and it wotild then be necessary for the Government to decide whatpublicity they should give to the revised estimates.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office.
