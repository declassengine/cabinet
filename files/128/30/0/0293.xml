3 CM. 69 (56)The Queen&apos;s 1.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord Privy SealSpeeches. (CP. (56) 227) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on theProrogation.     Prorogation of Parliament.In discussion some textual changes were suggested, and Ministerswere invited to send to the Secretary of the Cabinet any furtherdrafting amendments which they might wish to propose.It was agreed that a reference to the Suez Canal dispute shouldbe included in the section of the Speech which affirmed theGovernment&apos;s continuing support of the United Nations, but that thefinal drafting of this section would have to await developments.The point was also made that, as the question of nuclear testexplosions was likely to become an issue in the Presidential electionsin the United States, the proposed reference to such tests inparagraph 3 of the draft Speech might need to be re-examined. TheLord Privy Seal undertook to ascertain the views of the PrimeMinister on this point.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate a revised draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliamentincorporating the amendments approved in their discussionand such further amendments as Ministers might submit.Capital 2.   The Lord Privy Seal recalled that in the Cabinet&apos;s discussionPunishment     on 26th September it had been suggested that members of the(Previous        Government, though they would be expected to vote in support of aReference:       Government measure on  the lines  of the draft  annexed toCM. (56) 67th  CP. (56) 215, might be free to refrain from voting on an amendmentConclusions,    designed to convert that Bill into a measure for the abolition ofMinute 3.)       capital punishment. On further reflection it seemed doubtful whetherthis freedom could be allowed to members of the Government. Thiswould be a Government Bill, introduced with the support of theGovernment Whip; and it would seem illogical that members of theGovernment should be free to abstain from voting against anamendment which was designed to defeat the whole purpose of theBill.  There was also the practical argument that, if it were knownthat members of the Government were to be free to refrain fromvoting against this amendment, it would be difficult to persuade thoseback-bench supporters of the Government who favoured the abolitionof capital punishment to follow the Government Whip in votingagainst the amendment.   The Chief Whip&apos;s calculation of theprospects of defeating the amendment had been based on theassumption that members of the Government would vote against it.In discussion the suggestion was made that freedom to abstainfrom voting on this amendment might be conceded only to thosemembers of the Government who had very strong conscientiousscruples about the retention of the death penalty. If the concessioncould be limited to two or three members of the Government, itmight be possible to extend it only to a small number of back-benchers who held similarly strong convictions on this question. Asagainst this, it was argued that, if such a concession were made toany members of the Government, this would undermine theargument that it was the duty of Government supporters to followthe Government Whip on a Government measure; and that, once thatposition was breached, there could be no certainty that theamendment would be defeated.The Cabinet were also informed of a further difficulty whichmight arise from the rule of order that two successive Bills dealingwith the same main issue should not be considered by the House of50638 2 b 2
4Commons within the same session. Thus, it was arguable that, if areasoned amendment to the Government Bill were moved on SecondReading and were defeated, the supporters of abolition would beprecluded from proceeding with a Death Penalty (Abolition) Billwithin the same session. It might be that they would be in the sameposition if they moved, and lost, an amendment to Clause 7 of theGovernment Bill designed to convert it into a measure for theabolition of the death penalty. Steps were being taken to obtain afirm opinion on these points from the Clerk of the House ofCommons; and, when this was available, these possibilities wouldneed to be considered further in relation to the understanding thatthe Government would give some opportunity, in the forthcomingsession, for further discussion of the proposal that the death penaltyshould be wholly abolished.The Lord Privy Seal, in summing up the discussion, said that anyMinisters who might find difficulty in voting against an amendmentdesigned to convert the Government Bill into a measure for theabolition of capital punishment would wish to reflect on theirattitude in the light of the Cabinefs discussion. The Cabinet wouldalso wish to have a further opportunity of considering the risk thatdiscussion of a Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill might be excludedunder the rules of order as a result of proceedings on a Governmentmeasure.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their consideration of these questions at alater meeting.Electricityindustry.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (C.P. (56) 223) setting out the case forincluding in the legislative programme for the forthcoming session aBill to reorganise the structure of the electricity industry.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the HerbertCommittee, which had enquired into the efficiency of the industry,had recommended that its basic structure should be reorganised andthat the functions of generating and distributing electricity should beseparated. The Committee had reported many months ago and hewould be pressed, when Parliament reassembled, to declare theGovernment&apos;s intentions in the matter. Meanwhile, the Suez Canaldispute had underlined the urgency of the need to lessen ourdependence on imported oil supplies by developing atomic power.No confidence could be placed in the capacity of the CentralElectricity Authority, as at present constituted, to discharge its partin this development; but the necessary reorganisation of the structureof the electricity industry could not be carried out without legislation.If The Queen&apos;s Speech included no reference to this question, itwould be assumed that little progress would be made with thisreorganisation during the forthcoming year. Meanwhile, it wasalready becoming difficult to find suitable candidates to acceptpositions in the industry.The Lord President said that he strongly favoured the proposalswhich had been put forward for associating the electricity industrywith the Atomic Energy Authority in the industrial development ofatomic energy. Some doubts had, however, been expressed onprevious occasions about the proposal that the two bodies shouldhave some element of common membership and these doubts wouldneed to be resolved. He proposed to discuss this matter further withthe Chairman of the Authority.
5CM. 69 (56)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the financialprovisions of the proposed legislation, which was not yet drafted,would need to be in harmony with the new arrangements forfinancing the nationalised industries which had been introducedearlier in the year. Subject to this he supported the case forincluding a Bill to reorganise the electricity industry in the legislativeprogramme for the forthcoming session. Both the electricity and theA atomic energy industries were new and developing industries fromwhich great benefits were to be expected, and it was important thatthe Government should not fail to lake the necessary steps to furthertheir development.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to their final decision on thecomposition of the legislative programme for theforthcoming session, the proposed Bill to reorganise thestructure of the electricity industry should be included in theprogramme.House of Lords. 4. The Cabinet continued their discussion of the LordReform. President&apos;s proposals for the reform of the House of Lords.(Previous While differing views were again expressed on the relative meritsReference:       cf proceeding with either of the alternative schemes of reform, theCM. (56) 67th   balance of opinion was inclined towards the more comprehensiveConclusions,     measure. In favour of the shorter Bill it could still be argued that theMinute 9.)       more comprehensive scheme would reaffirm the hereditary principleand would appear to be designed to perpetuate a Conservativemajority in the Upper House.  If these objections were overriding, itmight be better to refresh the membership of the House of Lords bytaking power to create life Peers and to defer until some lateropportunity the further step of reforming the hereditary content of theHouse.   This course would, however, be open to the more seriousdrawback that it would leave intact the rights and privileges of the&quot; backwoodsmen &quot; who rarely attended the House.  It was wrong inprinciple and had become objectionable in practice that Peers,accepting no regular responsibilities for the work of the House, shouldretain the right to attend when particular issues of exceptional publicinterest were debated; and there was little prospect of securing anygeneral measure of support for a scheme of reform which made noattempt to deal with this problem.  In comparison with this defect,the possibility that the more far-reaching scheme of reform wouldprovoke the Labour Party to press for the abolition of a secondchamber was of secondary consequence.The Lord Chancellor said that the shorter Bill would serve theimmediate and temporary purpose of reinfusing life into a dyingHouse, but it would make no contribution towards the problem ofcreating a second chamber which was adapted to meet the needs ofthe constitution in modern times. The machinery of governmentwould not function effectively without a second chamber of some sort.We were precluded from creating the kind of second chamber whichwas customary under federal constitutions; and the Labour Party hadmade it plain that they would not tolerate an Upper House which wascompetitive in authority with the House of Commons. Therefore,the only practicable way of devising a second chamber which wouldmeet modern needs was by adapting the existing institution, and thebroader scheme now envisaged would achieve this purpose. Themore comprehensive scheme was unlikely to arouse in the countrythe cry of &quot; the Peers against the people.&quot; This was now an out-moded issue. The Labour Party, even if they were unwilling to acceptthe scheme at first, would come to collaborate with it in time; and,meanwhile, it would provide an effective second chamber and woulddispose of the problem of the &quot; backwoodsmen.&quot; The reputation ofthe Government would be enhanced if they showed courage in seizingan opportunity for reforming the House which was unlikely to recur.50638 2b 3
6The Lord President said that he did not agree that the reformof the House of Lords was too dangerous or difficult a subject totackle. On the relative merits of the two schemes, and his persona)position in regard to them, he must reaffirm the views he hadpreviously expressed. It had, however, been represented to him bysome of his senior colleagues that the proposals in the morecomprehensive scheme which would govern the selection ofhereditary Peers to serve as Peers of Parliament would be morelikely to prove acceptable to the House of Commons, and to the iOpposition, if it were laid down explicitly that the SelectionCommittee would be composed of representatives of each of thepolitical Parties in suitable proportions with an appropriateadmixture of cross-benchers. This would somewhat transform thecharacter of the scheme, and he was not sure whether it would beacceptable to the present House of Lords. Nevertheless, herecognised the force of the arguments which had been put to himand he would take further soundings on the point among hissupporters in the House of Lords.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the purpose of eitherof the proposed schemes of reform was to restore the vitality of theHouse of Lords and to enable it to function effectively. There wasalready agreement on the need, under either measure, to create lifePeers and to overcome the financial difficulties which preventedPeers from taking up their duties in the House. It could be expectedthat life Peerages, once introduced, would become the customarymethod of honouring merit and achievement and that henceforwardhereditary Peers would rarely be created. If matters were to developin this way, the composition of the House of Lords would changeover the years by a process of gradual evolution. In his view theessence of the problem lay in the method of selecting the hereditaryPeers to serve in a reformed House under the more comprehensivescheme. He appreciated that the distinction between the twomethods of selection which had been under discussion was one ofpresentation rather than substance and that the Peers who wouldin fact be selected would tend to be the same under either system.Nevertheless, a scheme which provided for the entire body of thehereditary Peerage to select, according to no settled principle, somefrom among their number to perform the duties of the House wouldnot command support in the House of Commons or the country.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President to consider further, in consulta-tion with representative Peers, the proposals regardingthe selection of hereditary Peers to serve in Parliamentwhich had been outlined in their discussion, and to reportto the Cabinet.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Rent 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theRestriction. Minister of Housing (CP. (56) 234) recommending that the legislation(Previous to amend the Rent Restriction Acts which the Cabinet had decidedReference: should be included in the legislative programme for the forthcomingCM. (56) 55th session should include provision for the immediate decontrol of aConclusions,    proportion of higher valued houses.Minute 6.) The Minister of Housing recalled that it had originally beenproposed that the Minister should be empowered to make ordersfrom time to time releasing specified categories of houses from thescope of rent control. The Committee of Ministers which had beenconsidering this legislation had now reached the conclusion that theBill ought to provide for the immediate decontrol of a certain numberof houses. It was important that the Government should be seento be taking a definite step towards decontrol. Virtually all the facts
7CM. 69 (56)on which a decision could be taken to decontrol a certain proportionof houses were known already and little fresh evidence wouldaccumulate in the period immediately ahead. Although final figureshad yet to be worked out, it was thought that between 500,000 and750,000 houses might be released from control. He recommendedthat the Cabinet should agree in principle that the Bill should includesome measure of immediate decontrol, and that it should be left tohis Committee to determine precisely how far this should go.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this proposal, so far as it affected England and Wales. If theRent Restriction Acts were to be amended at all there would beadvantage in putting through the maximum relaxation that could becontemplated in one operation. This would lead to a more flexiblerental market and, by making more properties available, tend toprevent the effects of the Government&apos;s policy from being undulyconcentrated on any one section of the community.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the application ofthis legislation to Scotland presented difficulties which had not yetbeen resolved. These would be enhanced by the further proposalthat a proportion of houses should be released from rent control atonce. In earlier discussions of the problem it had always beenassumed that rent control should not be lifted until alternativeaccommodation was available. This was certainly not the case inGlasgow, where the housing shortage was still serious. As regardsthe legislative proposals generally, a new rating valuation, on whichthese proposals depended technically, was not due to be made inScotland until 1960; but the application of the Government&apos;s policyto Scotland could not easily be deferred for such a long time and itwas difficult to see an alternative basis on which the proposals couldbe applied to Scotland in the intervening period. He would welcomethe assistance of his colleagues in overcoming this difficulty.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposal in CP. (56) 234, subjectto further consideration of the basis of qualification forthe release of houses from rent control and the numberslikely to be affected.(2) Appointed a Committee of Ministers consisting of the LordChancellor {in the Chair), the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Housing and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, to consider how best the proposedlegislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts mightapply to Scotland, and to report to the Cabinet.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing to settle, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the extent to whichthe Government&apos;s intentions to amend the Rent Restric-tion Acts might be disclosed at the forthcoming annualconference of the Conservative Party.Legislative 6.   In the light of the discussions recorded in Minutes 2-5 above,Programme:    the Cabinet proceeded to consider the content of the legislative1956/57 Session, programme for the 1956-57 session of Parliament, on the basis of a(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (56) 233).In their discussion the following particular points were raised:(a) The Colonial Secretary said that in present circumstancesit was unlikely that legislation would be needed in the forthcomingsession of Parliament to provide for full self-government for theFederation of Malaya. The Malaya Bill could therefore be omittedfrom the programme.
8(b) The Colonial Secretary said that it also seemed unlikelythat he would be ready to introduce in the forthcoming sessionlegislation to give effect to the recommendations of the Malta RoundTable Conference. He would be willing that the legislativeprogramme should be framed on that basis on the understandingthat, if the negotiations should proceed more rapidly than was nowexpected, the Malta Bill could be reinstated in the programme.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the1 Governmentwould be exposed to damaging criticism in Parliament if they delayedthe introduction of legislation giving effect to the work of the SelectCommittee which had been considering a Bill to amend the NavalDiscipline Act. The Act had not been amended for over a century,and the Admiralty were already suspected of obstruction by reasonof the delay which had occurred in making progress with its revisionsince the project was first raised in 1951.It was recognised that the question whether this legislationshould be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech must depend on whetherthe report of the Select Committee would have been published beforethe Speech was made. The Government could not appear to committhemselves to findings which they have not yet seen. The ChiefWhip undertook to ascertain when the report of the Select Committeewas to be expected.id) The President of the Board of Trade said that in announcingearlier in the current session the Government&apos;s decision to postponelegislation to impose anti-dumping duties, he had given an under-taking that this legislation would be introduced as soon as possible.It was important therefore that the Customs Duties (Dumping andSubsidies) Bill should be included in the programme and mentioned inThe Queen&apos;s Speech.(e) The President of the Board of Trade said that for similarreasons the Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Billshould remain in the legislative programme and be mentioned in TheQueen&apos;s Speech. The Government had already announced theirintention to introduce this legislation, and the interests concerned hadentered into financial commitments on this understanding.(/) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that widespreadexpectations had been aroused that legislation on mining subsidencewould be passed in the forthcoming session. For this reason theMining Subsidence Bill should be retained in the legislativeprogramme and mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech, even though itshould subsequently prove that, owing to pressure of time, the Billhad to be deferred until the following session.(g) It now seemed unlikely that it would be possible to pass inthe forthcoming session comprehensive legislation on local govern-ment finance. In that event it would be necessary to bring forward ashorter Bill to deal with the rating of shops and utilities.(h) In view of the prospective congestion in the programme, itmight be convenient and politically advantageous to defer until thefollowing session the Shops (Closing Hours) Bill. As against this,however, the Prime Minister had given the Trades Union Congressto understand that one of the three social measures arising out of theReports of the Gowers Committee would be introduced in theforthcoming session; and the Lord Chief Justice had recently madesome severe criticism of the existing law relating to shops. In thesecircumstances, it was agreed that the Shops (Closing Hours) Billshould remain in the programme.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had hoped that it would havebeen possible to have achieved some measure of flexibility in thelegislative programme by incurring no commitment in The Queen&apos;sSpeech to introduce some of the relatively less important Bills. Forvarious reasons, as disclosed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, this was
9CM. 69 (56)likely to prove more difficult than he had hoped, although theomission from the Speech of any reference to legislation on Maltaand the possible omission of any reference to legislation on navaldiscipline and the fishing industry would prove helpful. Nevertheless,the demands of the programme set out in Groups A and B ofCP. (56) 233, together with certain other Bills which would no doubtbe found to be essential, would clearly exceed the Parliamentary timewhich would be available for legislation. It could already beforeseen that recesses would again have to be curtailed and thatParliament would have to meet in the autumn to complete theirlegislative business. The programme was dominated by the prospectof four or five major Bills, viz., those dealing with rents, capitalpunishment, the electricity industry, customs duties and House ofLords reform. In order to reduce it to more manageable dimensionsit might prove necessary to abandon one or other of these major Billsif the additional time could not be found by withdrawing from theprogramme three or four of the relatively less important Bills. TheCabinet would need to give further consideration to this question ata later meeting.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to review, in the light of theirdiscussion, the legislative programme for the 1956-57session of Parliament.The Queen&apos;sSpeeches.Opening ofParliament.7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Seal(CP. (56) 228) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of the new session of Parliament.In discussion, attention was drawn to changes which would needto be made in the draft Speech in consequence of the decisions reachedin the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the content of the legislative programmefor the forthcoming session. Various minor amendments of draftingwere also suggested.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to revise the draft Speech in thelight of their decisions on the legislative programme for theforthcoming session and of the suggestions made in theirdiscussion on points of drafting, and to circulate in duecourse a further draft for consideration by the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,9th October, 1956.
