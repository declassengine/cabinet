Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 54thConclusions.)* The Cabinet were informed of the progress of the discussionswith representatives of the United States and French Governmentson the situation created by the decision of the Egyptian Governmentto nationalise the Suez Canal Company.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentwere anxious to help and support us at this juncture. The UnitedStates Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, who had joined in the discus-sions that day, had said that Egypt must be made to &quot; disgorge &quot; theSuez Canal, and he was prepared to agree that the communique tobe issued at the end of the talks should contain a strong condemnationof Egypt&apos;s action and an affirmation of the need to place the Canalunder international control. He was also at one with us in thinkingthat the international machinery for the supervision of the Canalshould not be an agency of the United Nations. He had, however,made it clear that the United States Government would stronglydeprecate any premature use of force to secure these objectives. Intheir view the right course was to make an earnest effort to securethem by the method of international conference. They were readyto join with the United Kingdom and France in calling such a confer-ence and to assist in the diplomatic preparations for it. They were,however, determined that its composition should be related to theConstantinople Convention of 1888, even though this would involveinviting the Soviet Union to attend. Their insistence on this was,admittedly, due to their anxiety to distinguish the Suez Canal fromthe Panama Canal. They suggested that invitations to the conferenceshould be extended to (i) eight of the ten signatory countries of theoriginal Convention (viz., the Soviet Union, Spain, Egypt, Turkey,United Kingdom, France, Holland and Italy); (ii) five of the leadingmaritime Powers whose shipping used the Canal (viz., Norway,Sweden, Denmark, United States and Germany) and (iii) six Powerswith a vital interest in seaborne trade through the Canal (viz., India,Pakistan, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand and Japan). This listincluded six Commonwealth countries. The omission of South Africafrom the list was regrettable, but there was no clear ground uponwhich she could be included. It was the American intention thatthe United Kingdom, United States and France should agree inadvance on a scheme for the international control of the Canal andthat appropriate procedural methods should be adopted to ensurethat this scheme would be approved by a majority of the conference.It would be our aim that such a conference should meet in Londonnot later than 13th August.In discussion there was general satisfaction at the degree ofAmerican support obtained, but anxiety was expressed about theproposal that the Soviet Union should be included among those to beinvited to the conference. This would involve a risk of Russianmanoeuvres on behalf of Egypt and would be repugnant to politicalopinion in this country. There was general agreement, however, thatif this was the price of United States co-operation, it must reluctantlybe accepted. If the invitation made it clear that the purpose of theconference was to create an international instrument for the super-vision of the Canal, the Russians might find it difficult to accept aninvitation in such terms. Any Russian suggestion that EasternGermany should be included should be firmly resisted. We shouldalso take such steps as we could to ensure that American co-operation,if it were obtained at this price, would be fully maintained and thatthere would be no departure from the understandings reached. Rwould be preferable that these should be embodied in a writtenminute of agreement. We should, in particular, continue to pressour views on the time and place of the conference.The Cabinet were informed that tripartite discussions were nowto be held on the nature of the international body to be set up tosupervise the Canal. In discussion of this aspect of the problem thefollowing points were made:  * Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.
3CM. 56 (56)(a) It would be important to consider whether or not an inter-national force could be based on the Canal. This would involve thequestion whether the Canal area should be established as aninternational zone.(b) There might be a risk that the Egyptian Government wouldbe prepared to accept international supervision of the Canal in returnfor Russian help to maintain their internal position. It was thought,however, that reversal of the Egyptian Government&apos;s action regardingthe Canal would be likely to result in their downfall.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in return for a firm undertaking of continuedUnited States co-operation, the Foreign Secretary shouldaccept the suggestion that some of the signatories of theConvention of 1888, including the Soviet Union, shouldbe invited to attend the international conference which itwas proposed to convene on this question.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the course of his furthertalks with representatives of the United States and FrenchGovernments, to take account of the points raised in theCabinet&apos;s discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,2nd August, 1956.
