2Suez Canal(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Meeting ofNorth AtlanticCouncil.*The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on thediscussion of the Suez question at the meeting of the North AtlanticCouncil on the previous day. Four Foreign Ministers had attendedthis meeting. The Netherlands Foreign Minister had taken avigorous line and had advised the Council that, if Egypt rejected theproposals emanating from the London Conference, the NorthAtlantic Powers should refuse to recognise the seizure of the Canal,should withhold the payment of transit dues to the new Authorityand should join in referring the matter to the Security Council. Theseproposals were endorsed by the Canadian Foreign Minister who,though averse to military sanctions, took the line that the use of forcecould not be excluded in the last resort. The PermanentRepresentatives on the Council, having received no instructions, madelittle contribution and the United States Representative, in particular,refrained from participating. In spite of this the meeting had beensuccessful and would exercise a valuable influence.Parliament. The Prime Minister said that the recall of Parliament could notsafely be deferred for more than a few days. The Government shouldseek Parliamentary support for the military precautions which hadbeen taken and for the further measures of this kind which were inpreparation. It could now be assumed that the outcome of thecurrent discussions in Cairo would be known very soon, and heproposed that Parliament should be reconvened early in the followingweek. He had ascertained that this step would not be embarrassingto Mr. Menzies, whose report on the Cairo discussions should beavailable by 10th September.The Cabinet agreed that Parliament should meet during thefollowing week. They further agreed that, in order to give more timefor study of Mr. Menzies&apos; report, Parliament should not assemblebefore 12th September. They approved the terms of announcementsimplying that the Government&apos;s concern in not recalling Parliamentearlier had been to avoid prejudicing the success of Mr. Menzies&apos;Mission and to provide every opportunity for a negotiated settlement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that statements should be issued that afternoonannouncing that steps had been taken for Parliament tobe recalled on 12th September.United The Cabinet next considered the further political action whichNations. should be taken if the Egyptian Government rejected the proposalsput to them as a result of the London Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that the first steps were to induce asmany nations as possible to withhold the payment of dues for the useof the Suez Canal and to refer the dispute to the Security Council.The timing of this latter step, however, presented serious difficulty;and, as it had been mentioned at the meeting of the North AtlanticCouncil on the previous day, the possibility could not be excludedthat the Egyptian Government would themselves refer the matter tothe Security Council. It was also desirable that we should avoid asituation in which the matter was being debated in the Council atthe moment when our military preparations were seen to be comingto a head. The French, however, took the view that it would beunwise to go to the Security Council until undertakings had beenobtained from the United States that they would not support anyresolution in the Security Council which varied materially from theLondon proposals or restricted our eventual freedom of action.These were valid considerations, and he proposed to ascertain to whatextent the United States Government could be relied on to supportus on these two points as well as on the question of withholdingtransit dues. Nevertheless, if the discussions in the Security Councilwere to take place at the time which would be least embarrassing in* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
3CM. 63 (56)relation to our military preparations, our request for a meeting ofthe Council would have to be made within the next few days.Mr. Menzies had taken the view that, if an approach were made tothe United Nations before the talks in Cairo had been concluded,this would enable President Nasser to avoid the blame for the failureof the discussions. As however, the Cairo talks had already reacheda deadlock, it was to be hoped that Mr. Menzies would be able toannounce the failure of his Mission in a formal communique inadvance of submitting his report, so as to clear the way for areference to the Security Council.The Cabinet were in agreement with the views expressed by theForeign Secretary. Although there was little prospect that theSecurity Council would be able to secure a settlement of the problem,it was desirable that we should be seen to have made the fullestpossible use of all available international machinery in our searchfor a peaceful settlement of the dispute.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that steps should be taken to refer the dispute overthe Suez Canal to the Security Council as soon as it wasknown that Egypt had rejected the proposals resultingfrom the London Conference, and invited the ForeignSecretary to concert the necessary arrangements for thispurpose with the Governments of the United States andFrance.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet ot the terms of athe United communication which he had received from the President of theStates. United States expressing his disquiet at the prospect that the UnitedKingdom and France might have it in mind to take military actionbefore all the possibilities of securing a peaceful settlement had beenfinally exhausted. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of theterms in which he proposed to reply to this message.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the terms of the reply whichthe Prime Minister proposed to send to this message fromPresident Eisenhower.The Cabinet were informed, in this connection, of furthersuggestions which had now been received, in preliminary form, fromMr. Dulles to the effect that, with the support of Article 8 of theConvention of 1888, the principal user countries should themselvesform an organisation to take over the Canal and operate it. Thisproposal, although it seemed to be misconceived on some points,indicated that our continued firmness was having the effect ofencouraging the United States Government to consider further meansof bringing pressure to bear on Egypt.The Cabinet (4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange forofficials of the Departments concerned to make an urgentstudy of the suggestions outlined in Washington telegramsNos. 1804 and 1812.Military The Cabinet were informed of the scope of the militaryOperations. preparations which were being made. These would be reviewed bythe Egypt Committee on the following day. The Prime Ministerundertook to consider what additional information on the militaryaspects of the problem could be given to the Cabinet at their meetingon 10th September.
4In this part of the discussion the following further points weremade:  (a) The United States Government had undertaken to makegood from the Western Hemisphere any deficiency in our oil supplieswhich might result from the closure of the Suez Canal. They hadnot, however, given any undertaking to finance the supply of thisoil. We should not be able to pay for it ourselves, and it was evidentthat the United States Government would be unwilling to undertakeany financial commitments, at least until matters had developedfurther.(b) It was estimated that, if the Egyptians decided to sabotage it,the Suez Canal might be out of use for as long as three months.The interruption of oil shipments through the Canal for such a periodwould involve us in very serious financial and trading losses.(c) It must be recognised that military operations against Egypt,unless their outcome was swift and our troops could be withdrawnimmediately, would probably involve a run on sterling. Thisconsequence might have to be accepted if the alternative was sloweconomic strangulation as Egypt extended her control over the Arabworld and the oil-producing countries.(d) There was a risk that events might develop in such a waythat a military timetable might govern political decision. Thissituation must be avoided. Military action must remain subject topolitical decision.The Cabinet (5) Took note of the points made in this part of their discussionand agreed that consideration of the military aspects ofthis question should be resumed at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,6th September, 1956.
