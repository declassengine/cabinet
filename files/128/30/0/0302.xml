2Suez Canal. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the French(Previous Foreign Minister had favoured the proposal that a submission shouldReference: be made to the United Nations Assembly on the lines which theC.M. (56) 77th Cabinet had considered at their meeting earlier in the day. SubjectConclusions.) to the concurrence of the French Prime Minister, he proposed thathe should make an announcement on these lines in the House ofCommons on the following day, and that the proposal shouldthereafter be put forward in the United Nations Assembly. TheFrench Foreign Minister had, however, insisted that this offer shouldnot imply that the Anglo-French operation for the occupation ofthe Canal area would be abandoned. If we halted our own operationthe Israeli forces would not withdraw; and, unless Anglo-Frenchdetachments were established between them, the Israelis and theEgyptians would continue the battle on the banks of the Canal. TheFrench Foreign Minister had also been unwilling to agree to the issueof any demand that Israeli forces should keep 20 miles distant fromthe east bank of the Canal.In discussion attention was drawn to the difficulty of reconcilinga statement on the lines proposed with the continuance of theAnglo-French operation against Egypt. Some Governmentsupporters in the House of Commons would be reluctant to supportthe launching of an assault on Egypt immediately after we had offeredto transfer to the United Nations the responsibility for police actionin the area. The United Nations also might feel that our offer hadnot been made in good faith. On the other hand, the reasons againstpermitting any pause in the operation were very cogent, and therewould be other Government supporters who would be dissatisfiedif our proposal to transfer responsibility to the United Nations wereregarded as an excuse for abandoning the Anglo-French enterprisebefore it was clear whether the United Nations could discharge thatresponsibility effectively. The statement should therefore make itclear that we were willing to stop military action as soon as (butnot before) it was agreed that, until the United Nations force wasconstituted, detachments of Anglo-French troops should be stationedon Egyptian territory between the two combatants.The Foreign Secretary said that he was in some doubt whetherwe should now stop the export of arms to Israel. He had also beenasked by the British Petroleum Company whether they should diverta cargo of aviation spirit, which was at present lying in a port inthe South of France consigned to Israel, or whether the Governmentwould wish them to allow the tanker to complete its voyage to Israel.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that furtherexports of arms to Israel should now be stopped.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce inParliament on the following day the terms of ourproposal to transfer responsibility for the policing of theCanal area to the United Nations on certain conditions.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to suspend theexport of arms to Israel.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to consider further whatreply should be given to the enquiry from the BritishPetroleum Company about a consignment of aviationspirit to Israel.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd November, 1956.
