2Suez Canal. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now received from the(Previous       Secretary-General of the United Nations a reply (New York telegramclvw^fif q? h No&quot; 1480^ t0 his recluest for a more definite undertaking about theConclusions)   clearance of the Suez Canal and for an assurance that, once the CanalUnited Nations was cleared&apos; ths Egyptian Government would not seek to deny  transit to British ships on the pretext that there was still a state ofwar between the United Kingdom and Egypt.   On the first point theSecretary-General, after consulting the Egyptian Foreign Minister,had given an assurance &quot; that the United Nations, in its assistance tothe Government of Egypt in clearing the Canal, would be free touse all available equipment that it found necessary for the quickestpossible completion of the clearing operation.&quot; On the second pointthe Secretary-General proposed to seek the agreement of theEgyptian Government to his publication of a statement, giving anassurance, based on discussions with the Egyptian Foreign Minister,that &quot; the state of affairs prevailing between Egypt on the one sideand the United Kingdom and France on the other side, after thecomplete  withdrawal  of Anglo-French  troops,  would  not beconsidered by Egypt as a reason for an exceptional relation to thosecountries from Egypt&apos;s full implementation of the freedom of passageestablished in the 1888 Convention.&quot;In discussion doubts were expressed whether this assuranceabout the clearance of the Canal would satisfy those Governmentsupporters who were reluctant to accept an unconditional withdrawalof the Anglo-French force. The concept that the United Nationswould afford &quot; assistance to the Government of Egypt&quot; in clearingthe Canal was unfortunate, and the substitution of &quot; equipment &quot;for &quot; resources &quot; might be interpreted as excluding the employmentof British personnel, whether naval or civilian. Moreover, incommenting on the Secretary-General&apos;s assurance, the UnitedKingdom Representative at the United Nations had emphasised(New York telegram No. 1481) that the Secretary-General wassatisfied that the logic of events would inevitably lead to a satisfactoryuse of our resources for clearing the Canal &quot; once our troops hadwithdrawn.&quot; If the implied stipulation about the prior withdrawalof the Anglo-French force must be regarded as governing theSecretary-General&apos;s assurance about &quot; the quickest possiblecompletion of the clearing operation,&quot; that assurance might proveno more acceptable to Government supporters than had any of theearlier undertakings which had themselves been ambiguous on thispoint.The view was expressed that we should not compromise tooeasily on this issue. There were grounds for believing that ourposition was slowly improving. The United States Government hadjust announced that they would view with the utmost gravity anythreat to the territorial integrity or political independence of theMiddle East members of the Bagdad Pact and H.M. Ambassador atWashington had reported that the United States Government wouldthat day issue a re-assuring statement about the maintenance ofsupplies of oil to Europe. These were perhaps significant indicationsof a gradual movement of official opinion in Washington towards there-establishment of friendly relations with this country; and it mightbe premature to abandon our effort to secure a settlement whichwould provide that our withdrawal and the clearance of the Canalwould proceed simultaneously. As, however, it was unlikely that weshould make further progress towards such a settlement by seeking tonegotiate with the Secretary-General a greater degree of verbalprecision in his undertaking, it would be wiser that we shouldourselves define our own understanding of the assurances which hehad given and should inform him that the Foreign Secretary wouldmake a statement to this effect in the House of Commons at thebeginning of the following week. This statement should indicate thatthe Secretary-General had agreed that clearance of the Canal wouldnow proceed without any further delay, in the sense that the survey
3CM. 93 (56)parties would be despatched forthwith and that, as soon thereafteras the officers in charge of the operation requested that resources besupplied for this purpose, the Secretary-General would put at theirdisposal all the resources which were available to him (including ourown salvage units) without regard to the extent to which the Anglo-French force had by then been withdrawn from Port Said or to anyother political consideration. If the Egyptian Governmentattempted to impede clearance of the Canal after this statement hadbeen made, our evacuation of Port Said could be suspended and wecould employ every means to bring the maximum internationalpressure to bear on Egypt.The Secretary-General&apos;s second assurance, about non-discrimin-atory transit of the Canal, seemed acceptable in substance, though itswording was not wholly clear. It was important to ensure that hisstatement on this issue was absolutely clear and was fully acceptedby the Egyptian Government.The Cabinet (1) Invited  the  Lord  President,  in  consultation  with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Chancellor, theColonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toprepare, in the light of their discussion, a statement onthe withdrawal of the Anglo-French force from Port Saidand the simultaneous clearance of the Canal which theForeign Secretary might make in the House of Commonson 3rd December.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform theGovernments of the older Commonwealth countries of thegeneral lines of the statement which the ForeignSecretary would be making on 3rd December.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how best to obtainfurther clarification of the Secretary-General&apos;s assuranceregarding the future freedom of transit through the Canal.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion later in the day, after theForeign Secretary had discussed the Cabinet&apos;s provisionalconclusions with the French Foreign Minister.The Foreign Secretary said that the French Government, in theirattitude towards the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force,appeared to be less concerned about the clearance of the Suez Canalthan about the need to reach agreement on its future administration.There was reason to believe, however, that their proposals for asettlement of this latter question would prove unacceptable to Egyptas well as, possibly, to ourselves; and for this reason it would havebeen desirable that the parties to the negotiations should be theUnited States, the United Kingdom and Egypt, under the Chairman-ship of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The French,however, had so clear a locus standi in this matter that it would beunrealistic to seek to exclude them, and their participation must beaccepted.Ships held in The Lord Privy Seal said that the Egyptian Governmentthe Canal. appeared to be continuing to insist that the merchant ships whichcould now move into that part of the Canal which had beencleared could not be released until the Anglo-French force had beenwithdrawn. Further pressure should be exerted on the UnitedNations to require the Egyptian Government to give free passage tothese ships. As a first step a statement should be compiled showingthe nationality of the ships involved and the costs which they werereported to be incurring.Future Adminis-tration of theCanal.
4The Cabinet (5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport, the possibility of exertingfurther pressure through the United Nations to secure therelease of merchant ships now held in the Suez Canal.Casualties. The Minister of Defence said that the Commander-in-Chief wasreasonably satisfied that the total number of civilian casualtiesresulting from the Anglo-French military operations did not amountto more than 300, including those in the area of French operations.Unless bodies were to be exhumed, which Egyptian law did notpermit within a year of death, the only way of verifying or amendingthis figure would be to ask the United Nations to conduct anindependent enquiry into the matter. Unless such an enquiry wascarried out there was a risk that the Egyptian Government, afterpurporting to conduct an investigation of their own, would announcea far higher figure. He therefore proposed to say, in reply toParliamentary Questions, that casualty figures which we believed tobe correct had been communicated to the United Nations, who hadbeen informed that we should raise no objection to their conductingan independent enquiry.The Cabinet (6) Approved the line which the Minister of Defence proposedto take in reply to Parliamentary Questions on the subjectof civilian casualties resulting from the Anglo-Frenchmilitary operations in Egypt.Military The Minister of Defence said that, with the cessation of militaryMovements. operations in Egypt, the French Government had decided, with ouragreement, to transfer the French Deputy Commander-in-Chief toother duties. The Commander of the French military forces at PortSaid had subsequently informed the Commander-in-Chief that henow considered himself to be under the direct orders of the FrenchGovernment. This statement might possibly imply that difficultieswould be encountered in conducting the withdrawal of the Britishand French forces in a joint phased operation, or that the FrenchGovernment were intending to make reservations on this subject.This question should be explored further with the French ForeignMinister.In addition, the French authorities had expressed the desire thatsome of the French forces now in Egypt should be withdrawn toCyprus, and should be retained there as part of a strategic reservein the Middle East. While it might not be possible completely toreject this request, it was undesirable that French forces in anysignificant numbers should be stationed indefinitely in Cyprus, in viewof the possible effect on our own relations with the Arab countries-It was therefore proposed, as a compromise, that the French shouldmerely be offered facilities for stationing in Cyprus detachments ofadministrative troops and of the ground staff of the French Air Force.This would provide a sufficient basis on which a French combat forcecould be reconstituted, should the occasion arise.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thisrecommendation.The Cabinet (7) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to discuss with the French ForeignMinister later that day the points relating to the Frenchforces in Egypt which had been considered in theirdiscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,1st December, 1956.
