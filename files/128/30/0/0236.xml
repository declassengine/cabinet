Disappearanceof Two ForeignOffice Officials.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)3 CM. 12 (56)1. The Cabinet took note of the statement made by the ForeignSecretary in the House of Commons earlier in the afternoon aboutthe interview which Burgess and Maclean had given in Moscow toselected representatives of the British and Soviet Press. In thisinterview Burgess had claimed that he had worked for the SecurityService during the war; and, although this point had not beenpursued in the House of Commons, newspaper representatives werenow pressing the Foreign Office to say whether there was any truthin this claim. The Cabinet were informed that Burgess had not atany time been a member of the Security Service, but that, whenworking for the British Broadcasting Corporation during the war,he had from time to time supplied to the Security Service, forpayment, information which he had received about Germany froma person with whom he had had contact.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to disclose, in responseto Press enquiries, the limited connection which Burgesshad had with the Security Service during the war.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 11thConclusions,Minute 1.)*2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (56) 32 forreducing the inflationary pressure in the national economy.The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on10th February he had had some further discussion with theChancellor of the Exchequer about the proposal to discontinue thebread subsidy and to increase the price of milk. The Chancellor stillfelt that the announcement which he proposed to make would notbe fully effective in restoring confidence unless it included these twomeasures. For himself, he saw great difficulty in this timing. In hisBradford speech he had outlined a policy of restraint in the pursuitof wage claims and had promised to enter into consultations withboth sides of industry on the means of applying such a policy. Anannouncement of increases in food prices, made while the wageclaims in the engineering and shipbuilding industry and in the miningindustry were still under negotiation, was bound to give a freshimpetus to those and other claims for wage increases. It would alsomake it very difficult for him to pursue his promised consultationswith both sides of industry on a policy of wage restraint. He hadtherefore suggested to the Chancellor that these changes in the foodsubsidies should be postponed until the Budget, by which time thecurrent wage claims would have been settled and some progressmight have been made with the projected consultations with bothsides of industry. Meanwhile, if the Chancellor&apos;s other proposalswere thought to be insufficient, he would be ready to consider whatother measures might be added to strengthen them.The discussion which followed showed that opinion in theCabinet was divided on this question.Some Ministers supported the Chancellor&apos;s proposal that thesechanges in the food subsidies should be announced at once amongthe measures to be taken for dealing with the immediate situation.In support of this view it was argued that in present circumstances,with full employment and high wages, the continuance of theseconsumer subsidies could no longer be justified. Their withdrawalwould be proof of the Government&apos;s determination to applydisinflationary policies. The Chancellor&apos;s other proposals would notby themselves be sufficient to check the inflationary pressure andto restore confidence in sterling. The financial situation wasbecoming more serious, and there was a real risk that a run on49599 3* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.b 2
4sterling might develop. Important as it was for the Governmentto maintain good relations with the Trade Union movement and toenlist the support of its leaders for a policy of wage restraint, itwas even more important to sustain confidence in sterling.Other Ministers, while agreeing that these subsidies could notbe continued indefinitely, thought it preferable that they should bewithdrawn at the time of the Budget. Those who took this viewattached special importance to the timing of these changes and tothe context in which they were made. They argued that, if includedin a Budget, they could be offset by concessions to the poorest classesof the community and by other measures directed against thoseclasses who would suffer less from increases in the prices of breadand milk. The disinflationary effects of these changes could easilybe exaggerated; for much of the purchasing power which theyremoved was likely to be replaced by wage increases. If the othermeasures which the Chancellor had in mind were not by themselvessufficient to deal with the immediate situation, could they not besupplemented in other ways, e.g., by further reductions in currentGovernment expenditure?It was also argued, in the course of the discussion, that thesechanges in the food subsidies could not easily be reconciled withthe policy outlined by the Prime Minister in his Bradford speech.There was much public support for the policy of securing a periodof reasonable stability of prices. Stability now seemed to be withinreach. The public would not understand why the Governmentshould choose this moment to make changes in food subsidies whichwould have the direct effect of increasing the cost of living. Suchaction was bound to provoke further applications for wage increases.In addition, it might well embitter industrial relations and inducein the workers a mood of active hostility towards the Government.On these grounds, a minority of the Cabinet thought it would beinexpedient to make these changes either in the immediate futureor at the time of the Budget.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that thiswas not purely an economic issue: it was one which called forpolitical judgment. He recognised that the problem of timing wasspecially difficult. He was, however, most reluctant to postponethese changes until the Budget. The present situation was precarious.Judged by the real test, the figures of visible trade, the nationalaccounts were tending steadily towards insolvency. Sterling wasweakening: Government and gilt-edged securities were falling: infinancial circles there were already rumours of devaluation.Expectations had been aroused of early and vigorous action by theGovernment. If these were disappointed the situation was bound todeteriorate. In his judgment, this deterioration could not be avertedunless he included, in his announcement of the measures which hewas proposing to take to remedy the situation, some reference tothese consumer subsidies. He recognised the difficulties of justifyingthis to the public generally and, more especially, to the leaders ofthe Trade Union movement. He believed, however, that the realjustification was that these changes were necessary in order to checkan inflationary movement which, if it continued, would leadinevitably to devaluation. Both the public and the Trade Unionswould surely understand that they would suffer far more fromdevaluation than from this relatively small increase in food prices.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that if thesechanges in food subsidies were made, the Assistance Board wouldbe reluctant to make any consequential increase in the rates ofNational Assistance. The increase contemplated by the Chancellorof the Exchequer would raise the real value of these rates appreciablyabove the 1948 level and, even so, would not eliminate the possibilitythat a further increase might have to be made before the end of the
5 CM. 12 (56)year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of theattitude of the Board and the disadvantage of appearing to exaggeratethe importance of these changes in the food subsidies, it might bepreferable not to proceed further with his proposal for aconsequential increase in National Assistance rates.Discussion then turned on the proposals for increasing theexisting restrictions on hire purchase and for controlling the hiringof certain consumer goods.The President of the Board of Trade said that he hoped thatthe Cabinet would not under-estimate the social, political andeconomic consequences of these proposals. They would certainlyhave a marked disinflationary effect. In addition to their directeffect on consumption expenditure, they would lead to decreasedoutput in various industries of which some were already workingshort time and some were located in development areas. As a resultsome increase in unemployment in these industries was inevitable.He believed, however, that these consequences must be faced.Some discussion followed on the extent to which hire purchaserestrictions should be increased. It was finally agreed that the initialpayments should be increased from 33| per cent, to 50 per cent.,but that the period for repayment should not be reduced below twovears.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion on the proposed changesin the food subsidies at a meeting on the following day.Newsprint. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous President of the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 33) reporting the resultsReference: of the further discussions which he had held with the Chancellor ofCM. (56) 5th the Exchequer, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusion ofConclusions. 23rd January, about the future of the Government control overMinute 3.)       the distribution of newsprint.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreed that, as there wasno possibility of persuading the newspapers to introduce voluntarycontrol over the consumption of newsprint, the Government shouldgo forward with the plan outlined in paragraph 7 (iii) of CP. (56) 15for rationing the size of newspapers until the end of 1956. Whenannouncing this decision the President would add that an increasein the size of The Times newspaper would be authorised in viewof the arrangements made to print that newspaper on mechanicalprinting paper instead of newsprint.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Government control over the distribution ofnewsprint should be continued until the end of 1956 onthe basis outlined in paragraph 7 (iii) of CP. (56) 15.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make astatement to this effect in the terms set out in paragraph 3of CP. (56) 33.industrial 4.   The Minister of Labour said that the employers in theDisputes. London printing trade were now proposing to dismiss printers whoPrinting. persisted in working to rule.

6The Minister said that the only action which he could takewould be to appoint a Court of Inquiry. There would, however, beno point in his doing so unless the employers agreed to suspenddismissals and the Union agreed to urge their members to resumenormal working. This possibility was being canvassed; but theprospects were not favourable, as the Union had so far declined toconsider any form of conciliation or arbitration.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.International 5.   The Cabinet were informed that the Economic PolicyWheat Committee had considered what line should be taken by the UnitedAgreement. Kingdom representatives in the discussions on the renewal of theInternational Wheat Agreement which were to be resumed at Genevaon 20th February. The Committee recommended that the UnitedKingdom should decline to participate in an agreement of the kindnow envisaged but should offer to associate itself with the Inter-national Wheat Council for the purpose of discussing other meansof dealing with the problem of surplus stocks of wheat. This attitudewould be a disappointment to the Governments of Canada andAustralia. It was less likely to upset the United States Government.The Prime Minister said that he would be glad to have a furtheropportunity of considering this problem before the United Kingdomrepresentatives were authorised to take this line at the forthcomingmeeting in Geneva.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to submit a memo-randum on the attitude to be adopted by the UnitedKingdom Government towards the renewal of theInternational Wheat Agreement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th February, 1956.#
