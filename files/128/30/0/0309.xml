3C.M. 85 (56)The PrimeMinister.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 84thConclusions.)1. The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister wassuffering from the effects of severe overstrain and, on medical advice,had cancelled his immediate public engagements.The Cabinet asked that an expression of their sympathy shouldbe conveyed to the Prime Minister, together with their wishes forhis early recovery.2. The Cabinet held a short discussion on the Suez Canalsituation.It was agreed that Ministers should, if possible, avoid makingfurther statements in the House of Commons on the situation untilthey had learned and considered the results of the discussions whichthe Secretary-General of the United Nations had held in Cairo onthe composition and functions of the United Nations force. It mighteven be possible to defer any further statement in Parliament untilthe Foreign Secretary returned from New York later in the week.Attention was drawn to the continuing speculation in certainsections of the press about the extent of the foreknowledge whichthe United Kingdom and French Governments had had of Israel&apos;sintention to attack Egypt. While there could be no question ofacceding to requests for an independent enquiry on this point, theGovernment might well be pressed to make some further statementon it. It was the general view of the Cabinet that the best coursewould be to repeat the assurances which had been given by theForeign Secretary in the debate in the House of Commons on31st October. It was, however, agreed that Ministers shouldconsider, after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return to London, whetheranything further should be said on this question.The Cabinet took note, with approval, of the terms of the replywhich the Prime Minister proposed to send to M. Bulganin&apos;s noteof 15th November on the situation in the Middle East. &quot;IndependentTelevisionAuthority.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 24thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C.P. (56) 260)by the Postmaster-General about the claim by the IndependentTelevision Authority (I.T.A.) for a grant under Section 11 of theTelevision Act for the financial year 1957-58.The Postmaster-General said that, although the case for a grantwas not a strong one on merits, the Government were committed,by various statements made during the debates on the TelevisionBill, to providing financial assistance to the I.T.A. up to a maximumof  750,000 a year. He was satisfied that, if the present claim wasrefused outright, the Government would be regarded as guilty of abreach of faith and the Chairman and certain members of theAuthority would resign. He therefore recommended that a grant of 100,000 should be made for the financial year 1957-58, on theunderstanding that this was temporary support in a difficult periodand implied no right to continuing Exchequer assistance.The Cabinet Authorised the Postmaster-General to offer to theIndependent Television Authority a grant of  100,000 forthe financial year 1957-58 on the basis which he haddescribed.OH Supplies. 4.   The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Fuel andPower proposed to make a statement in Parliament that day,announcing the Government&apos;s plans to restrict the consumptionof oil.51077 1
4The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these plans werebased on certain assumptions which were themselves very uncertain,particularly about the interval likely to elapse before the Suez Canalwas finally cleared of obstructions and the damage to the IraqPetroleum Company&apos;s pipeline in Syria was repaired. It was clear,however, that the 10 per cent, reduction in supplies which hadalready been imposed would prove insufficient, and that a reductionof 25 per cent, would be necessary. This figure itself assumed thatwe should receive from the United States, without any considerabledelay, the greater part of the supplies assigned to us under theemergency arrangements which had been agreed with the UnitedStates before the Anglo-French operation against Egypt but werenow in suspense. But, if our expectations were disappointed, itwould be necessary to achieve a more drastic reduction ofconsumption, and plans for this purpose were already beingprepared.The price of oil would probably rise as a result of the increasein freight rates; but the plans would provide for rationing byphysical allocation and not by price increase. They had beendesigned to reduce as far as possible the dislocation of industrialproduction, particularly in the case of steel; but some disturbanceof production was inevitable as a result of the substitution of railfor road transport which it would be necessary to encourage to themaximum extent.The Cabinet Took note of this statement, and invited the Minister ofFuel and Power to announce in the House of Commonsthat afternoon the Government&apos;s plans for the restrictionof oil consumption.Economic *5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the CabinetSituation.        might shortly face the grave choice of deciding whether to mobiliseall our financial resources in order to maintain the sterling/dollar rateat its present level, or to let the rate find its own level with the possiblef consequence that sterling might cease to be an international currency.The latter course, which would lead almost inevitably to thedissolution of the sterling area, would be a severe blow to the prestigeof the United Kingdom and a major victory for the Soviet Union.Moreover, there could be no certainty that even a floating rate wouldnot need to be supported on a scale which might entail almost as greata demand on our reserves as the maintenance of a fixed rate.The Chancellor said that during the first week in December hewould have to announce the loss of gold and dollars duringNovember. This figure might be as high as $300 millions and theshock, both to public opinion in this country and to internationalconfidence in sterling, would be very serious. Nevertheless there wasa reasonable chance that, if we maintained the existing sterling/dollarrate and mobilised our financial resources as rapidly and effectivelyas circumstances allowed, we could maintain the sterling area in beingand preserve sterling as a major international currency. We couldnot look for any assistance from the United States in this course untilthe situation in the Middle East had been sufficiently clarified toenable us to re-establish our normal political relations with theUnited States Government. But, although any formal approach tothe United States would be premature at the present time, we shouldendeavour to establish informal contact with them through theTreasury Delegation in Washington, in order gradually to enlist theirsupport for the loans which we should have to raise both by exercisingour drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and bypledging our own dollar securities in the American market.  If we* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
5CM. 85 (56)were assured of the good will of the United States in this respect itmight be possible for us to declare, simultaneously with theannouncement of the loss of gold and dollars during November, ourdetermination to maintain the existing sterling/dollar rate and torestore the economy by means of appropriate internal and externalpolicies.In a brief discussion it was emphasised that there was increasingevidence that unofficial opinion in the United States was showing agreater understanding of our policy in the Middle East. We shoulddo all we could to ensure that our actions and motives werepresented to public opinion in the United States as fully andconvincingly as possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (LordReading) to consider what further action might be takento enlist the support of public opinion in the United Statesfor the policies of the United Kingdom Government.CommercialPolicy.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 83rdConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals for amutual free trade area with Europe.The Colonial Secretary said that he was willing to accept theprovisional decision of the Cabinet that the Government should nowseek the endorsement of Parliament for their policy of entering intonegotiations with other European countries about the participationof the United Kingdom in a free trade area in Europe. He wouldhave preferred that we should take this opportunity to secure theelimination of some of the restrictions which we had accepted underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.), particularlythe rule prohibiting the creation of new preferences, which hadproved an obstacle to Commonwealth development. He was alsoanxious to exclude the dependent territories of the &quot; Six Powers &quot;from the Customs Union in order to avoid the risk of the produce ofthese territories competing in the United Kingdom market withthe exports of our own Colonies.In discussion of these points it was agreed that: (i) any attemptto couple a revision of the G.A.T.T. with an offer of United Kingdomparticipation in a free trade area would antagonise the Government ofCanada, who had made it clear that their general approval of the planfor a free trade area in Europe was conditional on its not resulting inany reduction of that impetus to remove the barriers to thedevelopment of competitive multilateral trade which was the mainobjective of the G.A.T.T.; and (ii) the &quot;Six Powers&quot; might beinduced to reconsider the inclusion of their dependent territories inthe scheme if we made it clear that, in that event, we should find itnecessary to press for the inclusion of Hong Kong.The Cabinet Reaffirmed their earlier decision that the Governmentshould now seek Parliamentary endorsement of theirintention to enter into negotiations with other Europeancountries about the participation of the United Kingdom ina free trade area in Europe.Gold Coast 7.   The Colonial Secretary said that it had been considered(Previous appropriate that a Cabinet Minister should attend the celebrationsReference: by which the Gold Coast proposed to mark the attainment ofCM. (56) 64th independence in the following spring, and that a member of theConclusions, Royal Family should be invited to be present at the opening of theMinute 2.) Legislature of the new State a few days later.   It now appeared,
6however, that the Government of the Gold Coast proposed to invite,in addition, representatives of virtually every State in the world,including members of the Government of the Soviet Union andsatellite countries, President Nasser, and both the President of theChinese People&apos;s Republic and Dr. Chiang Kai-shek. It wouldclearly be necessary to persuade the Gold Coast to issue invitationson a somewhat less ambitious scale, and to reconsider our attitudetowards the proposed celebrations if they could not be inducedto exclude representatives of States whose presence would beembarrassing to the United Kingdom Government. In particular,there could be no question of a member of the Royal Family beingpresent in Accra during the celebrations if the Head of a State withwhich the United Kingdom were not in friendly relations was to bepresent at the same time.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary to reconsider, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary, the question of UnitedKingdom representation at the forthcoming celebrations ofthe independence of the Gold Coast.ColonialImmigrants.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 48thConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C.P. (56) 263) reporting the further conclusions reachedby the Committee of Ministers which had been examining theproblem of immigration from other parts of the Commonwealth.The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee of Ministers hadformed the view that, even if it were eventually decided to regulatethe entry of Commonwealth citizens into this country, there weresound practical reasons for excluding immigration from the IrishRepublic from the scope of such a control. Moreover, while it wassomewhat anomalous that citizens of the Irish Republic resident inthis country should enjoy the franchise, this privilege resulted froma decision taken during the passage of the Ireland Act, 1949, to whichleading members of the Conservative Party had then assented. Itwould be difficult, in the absence of any new factor, to reverse adecision which had been in effect for several years.The Committee had also taken the opportunity of reviewingthe trend of immigration since the Cabinet had last considered thematter. Although about as many coloured immigrants wouldprobably arrive in this country in 1956 as in 1955, and the demandfor them in employment had not yet reached saturation point, theacceleration in the rate of immigration which had been the causeof concern in recent years seemed to have been checked. TheCommittee had therefore seen no grounds for modifying theconclusions which they had submitted to the Cabinet earlier in theyear.The Colonial Secretary said that the reports of conditions herewhich coloured immigrants were sending to their families and friendswere now less optimistic. This was likely to check the flow ofimmigration. It was also significant that a higher proportion ofarrivals this year had consisted of wives and families.The Lord President said that he remained disquieted by thecontinuing rate of immigration, and he considered that the situationshould still be kept under review. If it were eventually decided toregulate the entry of British subjects into this country, he doubtedwhether it would be right to continue to accord preferentialtreatment, in regard both to immigration and to the franchise, tocitizens of the Irish Republic. The Conservative Party was not, assuch, committed by the decision taken in 1949: he himself hadspoken in the contrary sense in the debates on the Ireland Bill inthe House of Lords.
7 C.M. 85 (56)Discussion showed that there was some support in the Cabinetfor the view that it would be difficult to justify according exceptionaltreatment to citizens of the Irish Republic if the entry of Britishsubjects had eventually to be controlled. The Cabinet agreed thatno final decision could be taken on the treatment which should beaccorded in that event to immigrants from the Irish Republic.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report in C.P. (56) 263.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committeeof Ministers to keep under review the trend of colouredimmigration and of employment among coloured people,,and to submit a further report in the following spring,unless developments should make it desirable to do soearlier.Food.FutureMarketing ofPigs and Bacon.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 48thConclusions.Minute 11.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(C.P. (56) 265) seeking authority to publish a White Paper, in theterms of the draft annexed to the memorandum, setting out theGovernment&apos;s policy for the development of the pig industry.It was stated in the memorandum that the Report of theRe-organisation Commission for Pigs and Bacon, whose publicationthe Cabinet had authorised in the previous July, had since beendiscussed with the interests concerned; and the Home AffairsCommittee had approved the policy for the pig industry which theAgriculture Ministers had put forward. The announcement that aPig Industry Development Authority would be set up, to beresponsible for the technical development of pig production,processing and distribution, would be welcomed both by producersand the trade. The Government&apos;s refusal to set up a comprehensivepig marketing board would disappoint the National Farmers&apos;Unions; but their disappointment should be reduced by the factthat it was not proposed to accept other recommendations of theCommission for regulating the marketing of bacon pigs which wouldhave had serious consequences for the Fatstock MarketingCorporation. As a whole, the proposals in the White Paper werelikely to command general support.The Cabinet Authorised the publication of a White Paper, in the termsannexed to C.P. (56) 265, setting out the Government&apos;spolicy for the development of the pig industry.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 83rdConclusions.Minute 7.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C.P. (56) 266) seeking authority to publish,in the terms of the draft annexed to the memorandum, a WhitePaper setting out the Government&apos;s policy in regard to long-termassurances and capital grants for agriculture.The Minister of Agriculture said that the proposals on long-termassurances and capital guarantees had been welcomed by the farmers&apos;representatives, and would be well received by the agriculturalindustry as a whole. He would, however, continue to be pressedto improve the existing credit facilities for agriculture, and to extendto horticulture, in some degree, the system of capital grants. Thehorticultural industry had been prepared to agree that greenhousesand other specialised equipment should not qualify for these grants;but they considered that grants should be payable for modernisingheating equipment, which made an important contribution to thereduction of costs.
8The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not possible,in present economic circumstances, to consider any improvement inthe credit facilities for agriculture. Nor could he agree thathorticultural heating apparatus should qualify for capital grants, eventhough the expenditure involved might not be substantial.It was disappointing that the farmers had been unwilling,throughout the negotiations, to concede anything of substance inreturn for the very considerable benefits which they were to obtain.If the settlement which had been reached was to serve as the basisfor an agreed agricultural policy, it was important that the farmersshould be induced to make a favourable response, not qualified byconditions or requests for further benefits, to the proposals which theGovernment had made.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this view. It was agreed, however, that no specific referenceshould be made in paragraph 25 of the White Paper to the exclusionof heating equipment from the improvements which would qualifyfor capital grants, and that certain amendments should be made inparagraph 27 of the draft.The Cabinet-Authorised, subject to the amendments agreed in theirdiscussion, the publication of the draft White Paper, in theterms annexed to CP. (56) 266, on long-term assurances foragriculture.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,20th November, 1956.
