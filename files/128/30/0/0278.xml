2Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:C.C. (54) 6thConclusions,Minute 3.)*The Cabinet considered the situation created by the decision ofthe Egyptian Government to nationalise the Suez Canal Company.The Prime Minister said that, with some of his senior colleagues,he had seen the French Ambassador and the United States Charged&apos;Affaires on the previous evening and had informed them of thefacts as we knew them. He had told them that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would take a most serious view of this situation and thatany failure on the part of the Western Powers to take the necessarysteps to regain control over the Canal would have disastrousconsequences for the economic life of the Western Powers and fortheir standing and influence in the Middle East. The Cabinet shouldnow consider what courses of action were open to us to safeguardour interests. Our first aim must be to reach a common under-standing on the matter with the French, as our partners in the Canalenterprise, and with the United States Government. The FrenchForeign Minister, M. Pineau, was due to arrive in London on29th July; and he proposed that he should send an urgent messageto the President of the United States inviting him to send arepresentative to take part in discussions early in the following week.The Cabinet were given the following information of theimportance of the Suez Canal to trade and the flow of supplies, andof Egypt&apos;s financial position:  (i) Oil. Of a total of some 70 million tons of oil which passedannually from the Persian Gulf through the Suez Canal, 60 milliontons were destined for Western Europe and represented two-thirds ofWestern European oil supplies. To move this volume of oil by thealternative route round the Cape would require twice the tonnage oftankers. If the Egyptian Government decided to interfere with thepassage of oil through the Canal, it would be necessary for WesternEurope to turn to the western hemisphere for supplies: as much as10 million tons might be involved, and it would be necessary to askthe Americans to divert to Western Europe the supplies they nowreceived from the Persian Gulf. We ourselves had supplies sufficientto last for about six weeks. In order to conserve these it would benecessary at an early date to introduce some arrangement for therestriction of deliveries to industry and to garages.(ii) Trade. Interference with traffic passing through the SuezCanal would not seriously affect the flow of imports other than oilinto this country, but it would seriously hamper the export trade,particularly to India. Our exports costs would also rise, as freightcharges would go up.(iii) Egypt&apos;s sterling balances. Egypt had  102 millions in herblocked account, of which no more was due to be released untilJanuary 1957. In addition she probably had about  14 millionsavailable on current account, of which  7 millions was held by theBank of England and the remainder by commercial banks. Theblocking of the current balances would probably not seriouslyincommode Egypt at the present time. Her cotton crop, of whichabout one-third went to Soviet countries and little was purchased byus, would be coming on to the market shortly and the proceeds fromthis would tend to put her in funds.The Cabinet next considered the legal position and the basis onwhich we could sustain, and justify to international opinion, a refusalto accept the decision of the Egyptian Prime Minister ColonelNasser, to nationalise the Canal.The Cabinet agreed that we should be on weak ground in basingour resistance on the narrow argument that Colonel Nasser had actedillegally. The Suez Canal Company was registered as an Egyptiancompany under Egyptian law; and Colonel Nasser had indicated that* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
3CM. 54 (56)he intended to compensate the shareholders at ruling market prices.From a narrow legal point of view, his action amounted to no morethan a decision to buy out the shareholders. Our case must bepresented on wider international grounds. Our argument must bethat the Canal was an important international asset and facility, andthat Egypt could not be allowed to exploit it for a purely internalpurpose. The Egyptians had not the technical ability to manage iteffectively; and their recent behaviour gave no confidence that theywould recognise their international obligations in respect of it.Moreover, they would not be able to provide the resources neededfor the capital development needed, in widening and deepening theCanal, to enable it to carry the increased volume of traffic which itshould carry in the years ahead. The Canal was a vital link betweenthe East and the West and its importance as an internationalwaterway, recognised in the Convention signed in 1888, had increasedwith the development of the oil industry and the dependence of theworld on oil supplies. It was not a piece of Egyptian property but aninternational asset of the highest importance and it should bemanaged as an international trust.The Cabinet agreed that for these reasons every effort must bemade to restore effective international control over the Canal. It wasevident that the Egyptians would not yield to economic pressuresalone. They must be subjected to the maximum political pressurewhich could be applied by the maritime and trading nations whoseinterests were most directly affected. And, in the last resort, thispolitical pressure must be backed by the threat and, if need be, theuse of force.The Cabinet then considered the factors to be taken into accountin preparing a plan of military operations against Egypt. In this partof the discussion the following points were made:  (a) Egypt&apos;s military forces consisted mainly of three infantrydivisions and one armoured division. She had about 500 tanks, anda great deal of armoured and wheeled equipment which was ofdoubtful efficiency. There were some 600-800 Polish and Czechtechnicians at present employed in the Egyptian Army, but it couldnot be predicted whether they would be willing to help the Egyptiansin active operations. If they were, the Egyptian Army would be amore dangerous force. About two-thirds of the Egyptian forces werein the Sinai area; the armoured division, however, straddled theCanal.(b) A military operation against Egypt, including consequentialresponsibilities for keeping the Canal in operation and controllingthe area, would require the equivalent of three divisions. Thenecessary forces could be made available for this purpose; but, asa great quantity of vehicles and other heavy armoured equipmentwould have to be transported to the area by sea, the necessarypreparations for mounting the operation would take several weeks,ft would be necessary, moreover, to requisition ships and, possibly,to direct labour.(c) While the military plan was being worked out, preparationswould be made to build up a ring of bomber forces at points aroundEgypt. Fighter squadrons would also be sent to Cyprus. It wouldbe a week before the full resources of Transport Command could bemobilised. The size of the air forces needed would depend on thetype of bombing to be carried out.(d) The naval forces available in the Mediterranean consistedof a carrier, a cruiser of the New Zealand Navy, 3 Daring Classdestroyers, 7 destroyers and an amphibious warfare squadron.Another cruiser was approaching the Canal from the Red Sea; and,after discussion, it was agreed that she should be diverted to Aden.Summer leave in the Home Fleet was due to begin in the followingweek: it would be necessary to consider whether this should bestopped.50546
4(e) In preparing any plan for military operations account mustbe taken of the possible effects on our Arab allies in the Middle Eastand the Persian Gulf if force were used against Egypt. It wasimportant that the operations should be so planned as to reduce tothe minimum the risk that other Arab States would be drawn intosupporting Egypt.(/) Consideration should be given to the possibility of cuttingthe oil pipeline from the Canal to Cairo, which was vital to theeconomic life of Egypt&apos;s capital.The Prime Minister said that against this background the Cabinetmust decide what our policy must be He fully agreed that thequestion was not a legal issue but must be treated as a matter of thewidest international importance. It must now be our aim to placethe Suez Canal under the control of the Powers interested ininternational shipping and trade by means of a new internationalCommission on which Egypt would be given suitable representation.Colonel Nasser&apos;s action had presented us with an opportunity to finda lasting settlement of this problem, and we should not hesitate totake advantage of it. An interim note of protest against the decisionto nationalise the Canal should be sent forthwith to the EgyptianGovernment and this should be followed up, as soon as possible, bymore considered representations concerted with the Americans andthe French. We should also consider inviting other maritime andtrading countries to support this diplomatic pressure. Common-wealth Governments might suggest that the matter should be referredto the Security Council. He did not favour this course, which wouldexpose us to the risk of a Soviet veto. It would be necessary, however,to consider denouncing the Canal Base Agreement of 1954 in viewof the fact that Egypt had given an undertaking in this Agreementnot to interfere with the Canal. The fundamental question beforethe Cabinet, however, was whether they were prepared in the lastresort to pursue their objective by the threat or even the use of force,and whether they were ready, in default of assistance from the UnitedStates and France, to take military action alone.The Cabinet agreed that our essential interests in this area must,if necessary, be safeguarded by military action and that the necessarypreparations to this end must be made. Failure to hold the SuezCanal would lead inevitably to the loss one by one of all our interestsand assets in the Middle East and, even if we had to act alone, wecould not stop short of using force to protect our position if all othermeans of protecting it proved unavailing.The Cabinet finally discussed a number of consequential matterson which decisions were needed:  (g) The British cruiser which was at present paying a goodwillvisit to Alexandria should be withdrawn immediately. Steps shouldbe taken, short of physical interference with the vessels, to delay foras long as possible the departure of the four Egyptian ships whichwere at present in the United Kingdom or in Malta.(h) The export of arms and military materials to Egypt shouldbe discontinued forthwith.(/&apos;) No action need be taken in regard to Egyptians v/ho wereon training courses in military and other establishments in thiscountry or who were due to come here for&apos; that purpose.(/) It could be decided on 30th July whether leave in the HomeFleet should be cancelled. Meanwhile, Commanding Officers couldbe warned privately that this was a possibility.(k) The Bank of England and the commercial banks would needformal authority to block the current Egyptian balances held inLondon. It would be difficult to justify the release of such balancesin present circumstances and there was support for the view that these
5CM. 54 (56)balances should be blocked if the French Government decided totake similar action in regard to balances held in France. Effortsshould also be made to prevent the Egyptian authorities from securingcontrol of the funds and negotiable assets of the Suez Canal Companywhich were held in London. The Chancellor of the Exchequerundertook to give further consideration to these points in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(/) Between 10,000 and 15,000 British subjects were understoodto be resident in Egypt at the present time. These included some8,000 Maltese and about 800 contractors&apos; employees in the CanalZone. It would not be possible to arrange for the evacuation of thewhole number. The Foreign Office should, however, considerurgently whether some of them should not be warned to leave.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should seek tosecure, by the use of force if necessary, the reversal of thedecision of the Egyptian Government to nationalise theSuez Canal Company.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to inform Commonwealth HighCommissioners in London of this decision later that day.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to send a personal message to thePresident of the United States asking him to send arepresentative to London to discuss the situation withrepresentatives of the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and France.(4) Appointed a Committee of Ministers consisting of:  Prime Minister {In the Chair)Lord PresidentChancellor of the ExchequerForeign SecretaryCommonwealth SecretaryMinister of Defenceto formulate further plans for putting our policy intoeffect.(5) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to prepare a plan and time-tablefor military operations against Egypt should they proveunavoidable.(6) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe further export of arms and military supplies to Egyptto be stopped.(7) Instructed the First Sea Lord to take the action noted inparagraphs (d) and (g) above.(8) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Fuel and Power, to consider whatarrangements might need to be made for the restriction ofoil deliveries.(9) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Transport, what actionmight need to be taken to ensure an adequate supply ofshipping for any military operations that might becomenecessary.(10) Agreed that we should act in concert with the FrenchGovernment in blocking Egyptian current financialbalances held by the central banks of the two countries.(11) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider what warnings ofthe situation could and should be given to British nationalsresident in Egypt.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,28th July, 1956.
