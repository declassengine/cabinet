3CM. 70 (56)AgriculturalPolicy.Special Reviewof Farm Prices.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 53rdConclusions.Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C.P. (56) 229) regarding the request made bythe National Farmers&apos; Union for England and Wales for a specialreview of farm prices following the award of an increase in theminimum agricultural wage in England and Wales.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Government hadwarned the farmers on the occasion of the last annual review of farmprices that they would wish to give further consideration to the needfor future special reviews, and the farmers&apos; unions had subsequentlybeen told that in present circumstances the Government would needto take a severe view of any request for a special review and that inany event full recoupment of any wage increase must not be assumed.Since then, a wage increase had been awarded for England and Wales,but not so far for Scotland or Northern Ireland. Bad harvestingconditions had also affected the farmers&apos; financial prospects for theyear, but the unions had been careful not to make this the basis oftheir request for a special review. The wage award was likely toincrease costs by about  5 millions before the determinations of thenext annual review became effective. This would represent onlyabout 2 per cent, of the industry&apos;s income. He therefore thought thaton this occasion the Government should refuse a special review. Inthat event, however, it would be the more important that adequatearrangements should be made to satisfy the farmers about theguaranteed prices for fat cattle in the present livestock year.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported this recommenda-tion. If a special review were held, this would stimulate furtherwage demands in Scotland.In discussion there was general agreement that a special reviewof farm prices should be refused on this occasion, both for theparticular reasons mentioned by the Minister of Agriculture and inview of the state of the national economy as a whole and the need torestrain further wage claims.Beef Prices. The Cabinet also had before them a note, circulated at themeeting by the Minister of Agriculture, on beef prices.The Minister of Agriculture said that since the guaranteed pricefor fat cattle had been raised in February last to 15 b. the marketprice had fallen on account of increased imports of chilled beef fromthe Argentine, and this had caused a gap between the producers&apos;average return and the guaranteed price which the present means ofmaking deficiency payments would be slow to fill. As a result, therewas likely over the year to be an under-payment of about  13 million.This would be recouped to the farmers in course of time. It was,however, desirable that the gap should be substantially reduced thisyear if the Government were not to be accused of bad faith. More-over, any under-payment during the current year would be reflectedin a lower net income to be taken into account at the next annualreview of guaranteed prices, and the Government might then beforced in effect to recoup the farmers twice over. He had it in mindto make additional payments to bring the average total return of theindustry over the present livestock year to about 149s. per livehundredweight. This would cost  11-12 millions and would involvea Supplementary Estimate. The existing guarantee system hadbroken down, and he was anxious that any offer of additionalpayments on the lines which he had proposed should be accompaniedby discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Unions regarding new andmore effective arrangements. It would, he thought, be desirable toannounce this to the unions at the same time as the decision regardinga special price review.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) During the previous two years the producers of beef cattle hadreceived  7-7 millions more than the guaranteed standard price. It50638 3 B 2
Awould be equitable to take the current year with the preceding twoand to pay the farmers no more than, say, an additional  5 millions.As against this, it was argued that the  7-7 millions over-paymentwhich the farmers had received in the past two years had comelargely from the market and not from the Government.{b) The farmers should not be given the impression that theadditional payments would bring the average total return over thepresent livestock year right up to the guaranteed price of 15 Is. Theformula in the Minister&apos;s note should, therefore, refer to the aim ofbringing the average return &quot; closer &quot; to that of the standard price.(c) No financial compensation was being given to the farmersfor the effects of the bad harvest weather which had involved thepayment of heavy overtime.(d) The imposition of a tariff on foreign imports of beef, whichthe Cabinet had approved in principle on 3rd October, would be afurther encouragement to farmers The negotiation of such a tariffwould, however, form part of complicated discussions with theAustralians. No announcement about it could be made until thosediscussions had been completed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the request of the National Farmers&apos; Union inEngland and Wales for a special review of farm pricesshould be refused.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to arrange for additional payments,as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, to be madefor fat cattle presented in the current livestock year andfor discussions to be initiated with the National Farmers&apos;Unions regarding a new guarantee system for fat cattle.(3) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to inform thePresident of the National Farmers&apos; Union of the decisionsrecorded above.NationalInsurance.UnemploymentBenefit.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 46thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and the Minister of National Insurance(C.P. (56) 213) proposing changes in the rules entitling personsworking on short-time to claim unemployment benefit.The Minister of Labour recalled that the present insurancescheme assumed a six-day working week. Some workers wereobtaining unemployment benefit for two days, even though theymight have lost only one day&apos;s employment from a normal five-dayweek. This situation was being used by employers to subsidise short-time working and had some effect upon the mobility of labour.When the Cabinet had last considered this question on 28th Junethey had asked him and the Minister of National Insurance to reviewthe problem in the autumn and to consider whether a clause toregulate it should be included in the National Insurance Bill whichit was hoped to pass in the coming session. The proposals putforward in C.P. (56) 213 provided that no benefit should be paid inany calendar week unless the worker was unemployed in that weekfor two days on which he normally worked, and that no benefitshould be paid for a day on which the worker did not normally workunless he were wholly unemployed in that week. These proposalswould remedy the anomaly which had arisen and was causingunfavourable comment in the Conservative Party. They would,however, be resented by the motor-car industry, where short-timeworking had now been introduced, and also by the less well paid mworkers in the Lancashire cotton industry who had long been on ^
5CM. 70 (56)short time; and strong trade union opposition must be expected.The inclusion of these proposals in the National Insurance Bill wouldtransform it into a controversial measure which would be likely totake up a good deal of Parliamentary time. These considerationshad disposed the Prime Minister to think that it would be preferableto accept the proposals in principle and to incorporate them in thedraft Bill, but to make no announcement on the subject until theCabinet had had an opportunity to consider further, in accordancewith the progress of wage claims during the autumn, whether theBill should go forward in that form. If heavy wage increases didnot materialise, it might be preferable to let the matter rest for thetime being.The Minister of National Insurance said that he was inagreement with these views.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals set out in CP. (56) 213.(2) Invited the Minister of National Insurance to arrange for adraft clause, giving effect to these proposals, to beincluded in the National Insurance Bill.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question on thebasis of the draft Bill, at a meeting towards the end ofthe year.CoalProduction.Open-castMining.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 232) setting out therecommendations of a Committee of Ministers for improvedcompensation to the occupiers and owners of land used for open-castmining.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cost of theseproposals, to be borne by the National Coal Board, would be about 300,000 a year. This was a small amount compared with the greatvalue to the national economy of increased coal production, whichwould be assisted by better co-operation from landlords and tenants.The one point on which the Committee had not been fully agreedrelated to the date from which the improved arrangements shouldtake effect. He himself, with the majority of the Committee, didnot favour retrospection in principle and would prefer, therefore,that the arrangements should become effective from the date of theirannouncement. If, however, there should be strong pressure fromthe agricultural organisations for retrospection, the Committee hadhoped that it would not be necessary to go back further than10th May, 1956, when it had been announced that improvementsin compensation were under consideration.The Minister of Agriculture explained that he shared the generaldislike of retrospection and agreed that the initial offer should notmake any provision for it. Since, however, the whole object of thenew arrangements was to secure the good-will of landowners andtenants, he would be prepared for a measure of retrospection if thiswas necessary in order to secure that good-will.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be preferablethat the improved compensation should be made effective from thedate of its announcement.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in paragraph 8 of CP. (56) 232,on the understanding that the improved terms ofcompensation would become available from the date oftheir announcement.
64. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theColonial Secretary (CP. (56) 180 and 231) on future policy in regardto the Somaliland Protectorate and the Horn of Africa.The Colonial Secretary said that, in view of the Suez Canaldispute, the Cabinet had deferred consideration of the earliermemorandum which he had circulated in July. Since then, however,the problem had become even more urgent, as relations between theSomaliland Protectorate and Ethiopia had become more strained.He now recommended, with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s concurrence, that %a committee of officials should be appointed to consider the proposalsput forward in CP. (56) 180, and any alternative suggestions thatmight be made by other interested Departments, and to submitrecommendations for the consideration of Ministers. He suggestedthat this Committee should have an independent Chairman nominatedby the Prime Minister.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister favoured thisproposal.The Cabinet-Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for acommittee of officials representing the Treasury, ForeignOffice, Colonial Office and Ministry of Defence, under aChairman to be provided by the Cabinet Secretariat, toconsider the issues raised in CP. (56) 180 and to submitrecommendations for the consideration of Ministers.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 230)reporting the results of their consultations with leaders of theOpposition Parties on the proposals relating to the redistribution ofseats which the Cabinet had considered on 22nd September, 1955.The Home Secretary said that he and the Secretary of State forScotland had set out in this memorandum their views on the varioussuggestions which had been put forward by the Opposition Parties.There should be no great difficulty in meeting the points made bythe Leader of the Liberal Party. On the other hand, most of thesuggestions made on behalf of the Labour Party were open to seriousobjection on the grounds stated in the memorandum. It was howeverimportant that any amending legislation on this subject should bebased on the fullest practicable agreement between the Parties; and,if the Cabinet endorsed the views expressed in the memorandum,the next step would be to renew the discussions with the Oppositionleaders in order to see how far the present gap between the views ofthe Parties could be narrowed.In discussion the following points were raised :  (a) It was agreed that the Chief Whip should join in any resumeddiscussions with the leaders of the Opposition Parties.(b) It was unlikely that room could be found for amendinglegislation on this subject in the Government&apos;s programme for theforthcoming session. There was therefore no reason to hasten thecompletion of the consultations which were to be held with the leadersof the Opposition Parties.(c) It had been proposed on behalf of the Labour Party that theBoundary Commissions should be presided over by High Court Judgesappointed by the Lord Chancellor. Hitherto, the Government hadpreferred that the Speaker should continue to preside over theBoundary Commissions and he had been persuaded, with somedifficulty, to acquiesce in that course. Nevertheless, it was true thatthis duty tended, as recent experience had shown, to embroil the aSpeaker in political controversy; and the Government might be  justified on that account in reconsidering their earlier view on thisSomaliland.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)House ofCommons.Redistributionof Seats.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)
/CM. 70 (56)point. Alternatively, there might be merit in the suggestion, putforward in paragraph 8 of C.P. (56) 230, that persons of judicial rankshould serve as Deputy Chairmen of the Commissions.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the results of the preliminary consultations withleaders of the Opposition Parties on the Government&apos;sproposals relating to the redistribution of seats, andapproved the general approach proposed in C.P. (56) 230to the comments made by the Opposition Parties on thoseproposals.(2) Invited  the  Lord  Privy  Seal  to  ascertain  what viewMr. Speaker now took of the proposal that he shouldcontinue to serve as Chairman of the BoundaryCommissions, and how far the political difficulties of thisarrangement could be mitigated by the appointment ofpersons of judicial standing to act as Deputy Chairmenof the Commissions.(3) Agreed that, subject to the results of the enquiry to be madeunder Conclusion (2) above, the Home Secretary,Secretary of State for Scotland and Chief Whip shouldundertake further discussions with the leaders of theOpposition Parties on the lines envisaged in C.P. (56) 230with a view to narrowing the present gap between theviews of the Parties on this question.6. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet of the progress of the discussions in the Security Councilon the Suez Canal dispute. With the exception of the United Statesand Yugoslavia, all the countries represented at the meeting had nowdeclared their initial positions. The United States Secretary of Statewas to speak that day, and there was reason to hope that he wouldexpress firm support for the conclusions of the first LondonConference. Some of the smaller countries, including Iran, had beenless firm in their attitude than had been hoped; and, as had beenexpected, proposals for negotiation or mediation were attracting agood deal of support.Mr. Krishna Menon, who after further visits to Cairo andLondon was now in New York, had reduced to writing his proposalsfor an alternative form of settlement. This was based on the conceptof international co-operation, rather than international management:it contained some provisions for arbitration but no sanctions for theenforcement of decisions given at arbitration. It was understoodthat Mr. Menon had discussed this plan with the Egyptian Govern-ment, who had thereafter sent instructions to their representative inNew York.The Lord President, who had seen Mr. Menon while he was inLondon, said that he had discerned certain similarities betweenMr. Menon&apos;s presentation of his proposals and the speech made bythe Egyptian Foreign Minister in the Security Council. Both hadgiven prominence to the concept of international co-operation. Hedoubted whether Mr. Menon&apos;s plan was an independent initiative;he suspected that it had been inspired by the Egyptian Government.The Cabinet were also informed of the progress made towardsthe establishment of the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association. Theexecutive group had now been formed. Proposals had beenformulated for the payment of transit dues to the Association, insteadof to blocked accounts of the Suez Canal Company. The UnitedStates Government were being asked to put forward a resolutioncommending these proposals; and, if they were willing to take theinitiative in doing so, we should be ready to support their resolution.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 11.)
Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)87.   The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Julius Holmes, whowas formerly the United States Minister in London and now heldthe post of Adviser to the United States Secretary of State on NorthAtlantic Council Affairs, had recently undertaken a personal missionto Athens to ascertain whether the Greek Government were readyto modify their attitude towards the Cyprus question.  He had nowreturned with a written statement defining the position of the GreekGovernment.   The salient features of this were three.   First, theywere ready to agree that after a period of three years (which theymight be persuaded to extend to five years) a decision should betaken on the date when the principle of self-determination shouldbe applied to Cyprus.   This decision might be taken by a 3/5thsmajority vote in the North Atlantic Council or by direct agreementbetween Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the elected Government ofCyprus which would contain representatives of both communities inCyprus.   Secondly, they assumed that a liberal constitution, withproportional representation, would be introduced in the Island.Thirdly, they asked that Archbishop Makarios should be given anopportunity to express his views on the constitutional proposals.They had not asked that the Archbishop should be released fromdetention in the Seychelles; and Mr. Holmes believed that, if theycould obtain satisfaction on their first two points, they might beprepared to proceed on these without obtaining the Archbishop&apos;sconcurrence.In discussion it was pointed out that there was little prospectof securing Turkish agreement for any solution which included adefinite date for the application of self-determination to Cyprus.There was general agreement that it would be inexpedient for theUnited Kingdom Government to give any encouragement toproposals which involved the fixing of a definite date for theapplication of self-determination.The Cabinet-Took   note  that,  in   pursuance  of  their  decision of3rd October, the Colonial Policy Committee would shortlybe considering the prospects for further progress towardsconstitutional development in Cyprus.Jordan.(PreviousReference:CM (56) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5.)8.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in viewof the continuing tension on their frontier with Israel, the JordanGovernment had asked Iraq to station troops in Jordan in positionsfrom which they could quickly be deployed in the event of anyIsraeli aggression.  It had been ascertained, through the medium ofthe United States Government, that the Israelis would not treatsuch a movement, if it were restricted to small numbers of troops, asa pretext for a large-scale attack against Jordan. Meanwhile, however,the political situation in Jordan continued to be unstable; and theChief of Staff of the Jordan Army had recently attempted to causedisaffection among Iraqi officers who had visited Jordan for stafftalks. On this account the Iraq Government were not now preparedto do more than send small advance parties to the neighbourhoodof Mafraq, and it was possible that they might altogether decline togive military support to Jordan at the present time.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,9th October, 1956.
