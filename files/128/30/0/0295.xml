3CM. 71 (56)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 235) setting out furtherproposals for savings to be made in Government expenditure duringthe current year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would wish toannounce, soon after Parliament had reassembled, what furtherprogress had been made towards achieving a reduction of  100millions on the Estimates for the current year. The proposals setout in his memorandum, including the additional saving of  5 millionswhich he was seeking in defence expenditure, would give a total ofnearly  19 millions against the balance of  24 millions that had tobe found. He hoped that his colleagues would be able to proposeby the end of the month further savings which would yield theremaining  5 millions. He was concerned, however, at the tendencyfor Government expenditure, particularly on the social services, tocontinue to rise, and he stressed the need for a stricter attitudetowards proposals for new or extended services which involvedadditional expenditure.In discussion of the detailed proposals in CP. (56) 235 thefollowing points were made:  Defence. (a) The Minister of Defence said that the Service Departmentsshould be able to make the economies totalling  4 2 millions setout in paragraph 4 (A) of the memorandum, and he hoped to beable to achieve the further saving of  5 millions which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had requested, making some  9 millions in all.Health Services. (/?) The Minister of Health said that the proposal to raise theprescription charge to Is. an item, which would yield about  5 millionsin a full year, was acceptable to him. If the increased charge wasto come into effect on 1st December it would need to be announcedwithin the next ten days. A corresponding increase in the chargefor drugs to out-patients, yielding about  150,000 in a full year,would also need to be made. He would do his best to achieve areduction of  500,000 in hospital stocks. After a careful examinationof expenditure on the health services he had been unable to findfurther scope for immediate economy.Milk (Retail (c) The Minister of Agriculture said that the decline in thePrice). consumption of milk which had followed the last increase in pricehad exceeded forecasts. On the other hand, the production of milk wassteadily rising. With the prospect of a surplus of milk in the spring,a decision to remove the remaining subsidy on 1st January wouldbe opposed both by the Milk Marketing Board and by the farmers.He would prefer that the price should be increased temporarilyduring the remainder of the winter, and reduced in the spring in orderto encourage consumption during the flush season: the subsidy couldthen be finally abolished in the autumn.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be contentto deal with the milk subsidy on the lines suggested.Milk (Welfare). (d) The point was made that, if the price of welfare milk were tobe raised as proposed, the Government would be charged with thebreach of an undertaking which they had given in February that theremoval of the milk subsidy would not affect the price of school andwelfare milk. Although it remained desirable that a more satisfactoryratio should be established between the prices of welfare and retailmilk, it might be wiser to consider this later as part of a more generalreview of social benefits.Departmental (e) Several Ministers in charge of Departments expressed doubtsTravelling.      about their ability to effect a saving of 10 per cent, in travelling andsubsistence expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was anxious, forreasons of presentation, to be able to include a contribution under this51159 4 b2GovernmentExpenditure.Economies.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 44thConclusions,Minute 11.)
head and he would be content with a nominal saving of 5 per cent.The Ministers concerned undertook to consider whether it would bepracticable to achieve such a saving without loss of efficiency.School Meals. (/) The Minister of Education said that, although no furthersavings on school meals were now proposed, it appeared that thepublic would have been ready to accept earlier in the year an increaseto \s. rather than \0d. Such an increase would still be justified.It was agreed that the question of the charge for school mealscould not easily be reopened so soon after an increase had beenimposed but that the matter should be reconsidered in the followingspring.Social Services. (g) It was pointed out that expenditure on the social services,although tending to increase each year in absolute terms, was in facttaking a decreasing proportion of a national income which was risingmore rapidly.It was agreed that steps should be taken to give further publicityto this fact in order to meet criticism directed against the cost of thesocial services.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (b) to (e)above, the proposals in C.P. (56) 235.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit, for theirconsideration at a meeting in the following week, a draftof the announcement of further economies which heproposed to make in the House of Commons.HousingSubsidies.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Minister of Housing said that the halving of the subsidyfor &quot; general needs &quot; housing, which the Cabinet had approved inthe previous year, had not secured a sufficient reduction in the housingprogrammes of local authorities. A further cut in the subsidy hadbeen foreshadowed, and there was little danger of renewed difficultiesover housing if it were imposed now. He sought the authority of hiscolleagues to announce shortly that the remaining half of the &quot; generalneeds&quot; subsidy would be withdrawn at an early date, withcorresponding adjustments in the subsidies for new flats.The Cabinet-Agreed that the remainder of the subsidy for new housesfor general needs should be withdrawn, and authorised theMinister of Housing to make an announcement to this effectearly in the new session of Parliament.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReferences:CM. (56) 70thConclusions,Minute 1, andCM. (56) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onagricultural policy:  C.P. (56) 237 Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Agriculture.C.P. (56) 238 Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.C.P. (56) 239 Note by the Minister of Agriculture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government&apos;sobjective in entering upon discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions had
5CM. 71 (56)been primarily to eliminate the annual review. It was now clear thatthis objective would not be realised, and that any long-term assuranceswhich the Government offered the farmers would constitute a systemof minimum prices which would be binding on the Government butwould not limit the farmers&apos; freedom in bargaining. In thesecircumstances he doubted whether there was any value to theGovernment in a package deal on this subject, notwithstanding thepolitical importance of giving the farmers a greater sense of security.The Minister of Agriculture said that, at the moment, theGovernment were not succeeding in carrying the farmers with themin their price policy. The discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions hadtherefore been launched with the three-fold objective of increasingconfidence among the farmers generally, of reducing the scope of theannual review, and of eliminating entirely the special reviews. Theproposals which had emerged from these discussions, while not givingthe farmers the simple cost-plus system which they would prefer,would at least assure them that the principles of the Government&apos;sprice policy would be continued for a period of years ahead on adefined basis; and the proposed scheme of capital grants would providefurther evidence of the Government&apos;s concern for the well-being ofagriculture. The result, in terms of annual prices, should be no morecostly to the Exchequer than a continuance of the present system ofannual reviews; and the political benefit which might flow from agreater sense of security among the farmers would be considerable.It would, however, be essential for the Government to obtain from thefarmers a public acknowledgment that the proposals agreed with theFarmers&apos; Unions would suffice to meet the genuine needs ofthe farming community.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Even if the total value of the guarantees were maintainedat 97 per cent, of the preceding year&apos;s level, the figure for individualcommodities might either be reduced to a uniform 95 per cent, or,if this would be too severe to be acceptable to the farmers, bedifferentiated over a range from 95 per cent, to 97 per cent. Thus,the figure for beef and mutton might be 96 per cent, or even 97per cent.; the figure for grains might be 95 per cent. Differentiationof this kind would be less welcome to the farmers than a uniformrate; and it might be less easily reconciled with the pattern of ourtrade negotiations with those countries from which we importedmeat and wheat.  But these were not necessarily decisive objections.(b) There was a case for restricting capital grants, at leastinitially, to a uniform rate of 33^ per cent., although power might betaken to vary this rate on a differential basis, if necessary. On theother hand, a flat rate of only 33J per cent, would increase by nomore than about  55 million the capital expenditure on fixed farmingequipment during the next ten years, an expansion which would fallconsiderably short of what was needed. Moreover, a differentia!grant related to capital expenditure per acre was the only meanswhich could be devised of assisting the small farmer, whom it wasessential to encourage. This consideration was particularly valid inthe case of Northern Ireland.(c) The system of long-term assurances might perhaps beintroduced without immediate legislation; but statutory authoritywould be needed from the outset for the scheme of capital grants.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to give further consideration to the possibilityof introducing a differential system, both for the individualcommodity guarantees and for the scheme of capital grants;and agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting of theCabinet in the following week.
6Suez Canal. 4.   The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the results(Previous of the discussions in the Security Council on the Suez Canal dispute.Reference: In discussion there was general agreement that the outcome ofCM. (56) 70th the proceedings in the Security Council was as favourable, from ourConclusions, point of view, as could have been hoped. The statement of principles,Minute 6.) which had been passed unanimously, covered the substance of thedemands made by the principal users of the Canal. In particular,it was satisfactory that unanimous approval had been given to theproposition that &quot; the operation of the Canal should be insulated fromthe politics of any country.&quot; The declaration that unresolveddisputes between the Suez Canal Company and the Egyptian Govern-ment should be settled by arbitration was also of importance astending to throw doubt on Egypt&apos;s right to nationalise theCompany. The second part of the resolution, though it had beenvetoed by the Soviet Union, had been supported by nine out of theeleven members of the Council. It endorsed the proposals putforward on behalf of the eighteen Powers after the first LondonConference, as consistent with the principles subsequently approvedby the Security Council and designed to secure a peaceful settlementof the dispute. Although it also invited the Egyptian Governmentto put forward alternative proposals, it asked that these should bemade known promptly and that they should be not less effectivethan those of the eighteen Powers. It also recognised the competenceof the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association to receive dues payable byships of its members. Finally, it was to be noted that we hadcontrived to avoid the appointment of any mediator or negotiatingbody, or the tabling of any amendment which might limit our futurefreedom of action.The Cabinet agreed that, in public statements made before andafter the forthcoming reassembly of Parliament, emphasis should belaid on the degree of support which we had obtained in the SecurityCouncil for the stand which we had taken in this dispute. We hadtaken the initiative in referring the matter to the Security Council:we should now be careful to retain that initiative. We should declareour readiness to hold further discussions with the Egyptians, withinthe limits of the second part of the Security Council&apos;s resolution. Weshould stress the fact that the Council had asked the Egyptians toput forward their proposals promptly. And, as this second partof the resolution had been vetoed, we might be well-advised to makeit clear to the Egyptians by some formal communication, the termsof which would need to be agreed with the French Government, thatwe were awaiting their proposals.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the outcome of the proceeds in the SecurityCouncil on the Suez dispute.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to concert with the FrenchGovernment the terms of a communication to theEgyptian Government inviting them to submit withoutdelay their proposals for carrying into effect the principleswhich had been unanimously approved by the SecurityCouncil.(3) Took note that, in a public speech which he was to makeon 20th October, the Foreign Secretary would bring outthe main points which had been stressed in the Cabinet&apos;s. discussion.The Cabinet then considered the general situation in theMiddle East.The Prime Minister said that, when the proceedings in theSecurity Council were completed, he and the Foreign Secretary hadvisited Paris in order to discuss with French Ministers what furthersteps could now be taken towards a settlement of the Suez dispute.They had taken the earliest opportunity to hold these consultations,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
7CM. 71 (56)in view of the increasing tension in the Middle East, &quot;the politicalsituation in Jordan was unstable, and there were signs that Israelmight be preparing to make some military move. If the Israelisattacked Jordan, we should be in a position of very great difficulty.Despite the terms of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950, the Frenchhad made it plain that they would not be able in those circumstancesto assist Jordan; and it was evident that the United StatesGovernment would be most reluctant to intervene. We, on the otherhand, had our separate obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty;but it would be contrary to our interests to act, at this time and alone,in support of Jordan against Israel. Therefore, in his conversationswith the French, he had proceeded on the basis that every possibleeffort should be made to ensure that the Israelis should not at thisstage attack Jordan. If they contemplated any military operationsagainst the Arabs, it would be far better from our point of viewthat they should attack Egypt; and he had reason to believe that,if they made any military move, it would be made in that direction.He had therefore thought it right to make it known to the Israelis,through the French, that in the event of hostilities between Egypt andIsrael the United Kingdom Government would not come to theassistance of Egypt, because Egypt was in breach of a SecurityCouncil resolution and had repudiated Western aid under theTripartite Declaration. He had added, in this message to the Israelis,that different considerations would apply to Jordan, to whom theUnited Kingdom Government had firm Treaty obligations in additionto those under the Tripartite Declaration.The Cabinet should therefore be aware that, while we continuedto seek an agreed settlement of the Suez dispute in pursuance of theresolution of the Security Council, it was possible that the issuemight be brought more rapidly to a head as a result of military actionby Israel against Egypt.It was against this background that he and the Foreign Secretaryhad been considering, in the last few days, the proposal that troopsfrom Iraq should be stationed in Jordan. This movement, if it hadbeen carried out earlier, might have helped to stabilise the politicalsituation in Jordan. The Israelis had, however, chosen to regardit as a potential threat against them, despite the assurances which theyhad been given to the contrary; and partly on this account and partlyperhaps because of pressure from Egypt, the Jordan Governmenthad now asked that the Iraqi troops which had been moved up to thefrontier should not at this stage cross it. In view of the attitudewhich the Israelis had adopted towards these troops movements,we should be accepting a heavy responsibility if we now pressed theGovernment of Iraq or of Jordan to allow the movement to becompleted. On the other hand there was a grave risk that theelections which were to be held in Jordan on 21st October might goin Egypt&apos;s favour, and in that event Jordan might pass wholly underthe influence of Egypt. On balance it had seemed best that Iraqitroops should not move into Jordan at the present time.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s account of theconversations which he and the Foreign Secretary hadhad with French Ministers in Paris on 16th October, andof his observations regarding the existing state of tensionin the Middle East.Hong Kong.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 11.)Kowloon Riots.5. The Foreign Secretary said that a telegram (No. 737) hadbeen despatched on the previous day to H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires inPeking instructing him to rebut in vigorous terms the charge madeby the President of the Chinese Republic that the recent riots inKowloon had been instigated by Chinese Nationalist agents underthe protection of the Hong Kong Government. H.M. Representativehad also been instructed to make it plain that the United Kingdom
8Government had been most unfavourably impressed by the attitudeof the Chinese Republican Government and their Press towardsthese disturbances and had formed the view that, in contrast to theirprofessed desire for friendly relations, the Chinese Government werein fact seeking to make political capital out of the riots.The Prime Minister said that a firm line should be taken with thePresident of the Chinese Republic over this matter and he approvedthe terms of the telegram which had been sent.  The desirability ofa show of naval strength in Hong Kong waters should also be ^&gt;examined.The Cabinet were informed that two aircraft carriers were atpresent within sailing distance of Hong Kong and that, althoughsome reductions were due to be effected in the Hong Kong garrison,no troops would leave before the following spring.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence to examine the possibilityof arranging for the two aircraft carriers now in the FarEast, or other naval vessels, to make an appearance inHong Kong waters.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,18th October, 1956.
