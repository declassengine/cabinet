3CM. 58 (56)Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 57thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the results ofhis discussions with representatives of the United States and FrenchGovernments on the situation created by the decision of the EgyptianGovernment to nationalise the Suez Canal Company. Thesediscussions had been completed on the previous evening. Thecommunique, which had appeared in the Press that morning,contained a satisfactory denunciation of Egypt&apos;s action. He had alsobeen able, within the limits of the authority which the Cabinet hadgiven him on Jst August, to reach agreement on the compositionof the international conference which was now to be convened toconside.- means of placing the Canal under international control. Ithad also been agreed that this conference should be held in London,starting on 16th August, and that it should not last for longer thanone week. It was contemplated that, before the opening of theconference, each of the three Governments should make a confidentialapproach to some of the countries invited to it with which they wereclosely associated, with a view to gaining their support for theprinciple of international control. He had undertaken that theUnited Kingdom Government would make such an approach, notonly to the Commonwealth countries which were to be represented,but also to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. The presentplan was that the conference should be invited to endorse the principleof international control, but should not be encouraged to concernitself with a detailed scheme for the international management ofthe Canal. It was thought that, if a detailed scheme were tabled,the discussions at the conference might be unduly protracted.In discussion the point was made that if, after the conference,the Egyptian Government were asked to do no more than assent tothe principle of international control, they might accept th b principleand then engage in lengthy discussions about its application. Thismight be avoided if they could be confronted, not only with aresolution by the conference in favour of the principle, but with apractical scheme for its application. It might be feasible to workout, in consultation with the French Government, an outline of ascheme of control which could be put to the Egyptian Governmentat the same time as the resolution of the conference. Alternatively,the resolution itself might be so framed as to cover some of the moreimportant elements in the scheme of control.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be glad of anopportunity to discuss these alternatives further with some of hiscolleagues.50285 4The Cabinet (1) Expressed their gratification at the results of the ForeignSecretary&apos;s discussions with representatives of the UnitedStates and French Governments.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to communicate at once with theGovernments of Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistanand Ceylon with a view to securing their support, at theforthcoming international conference, for the principle ofinternational control over the Suez Canal.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make a similar approachto the Governments of Norway, Sweden, Denmark andPortugal.(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider further,with his colleagues on the Egypt Committee, the tacticalpoints which had been raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussionregarding the handling of the international conferenceand the subsequent exchanges with the Government ofEgypt.b 2
4Cabinet.ProcedureduringRecess.2. The Prime Minister said that no regular meetings of theCabinet, or of its Standing Committees, would be held during August.During that period the problem of the Suez Canal would continueto be handled on the Cabinet&apos;s behalf by the Egypt Committee, whichwould meet as required. Any aspect of that problem which was ofspecial importance, and any other urgent Cabinet business, would bedealt with at emergency meetings of the Cabinet, which would besummoned as required and attended by such Ministers as were readilyavailable.The Prime Minister said that Ministers directly concerned withthe work of the Egypt Committee should, as far as possible, remainin or near London during August. Other Ministers need not atpresent make any change in their holiday arrangements. It was rightand necessary that Ministers should take the opportunity to obtainsome rest during the recess, and he would take steps to ensure thatthis was understood by the Press.EconomicPolicy.Controls overBuilding.(PreviousReference:C.C. (52) 61stConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Works (C.P. (56) 166 and 187)on the case for building control as an instrument of economic policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not yet satisfiedthat it would be possible in present circumstances for the Governmentto hold the economy in equilibrium unless, in addition to the fiscaland financial instruments available to them, they had the means ofexercising some measure of direct control over the economy throughthe allocation of materials or the control of investment. By thecontrol exercised through the Capital Issues Committee, theGovernment had recently secured the deferment of  30 millions worthof building. Nevertheless, and in spite of the restriction on credit,the amount spent on public and private building had increasedsignificantly in the first quarter of 1956 as compared with thecorresponding period of the previous year. The cost of the measureswhich we might now have to take to safeguard our position in theEastern Mediterranean would intensify still further the strains towhich the economy was already subject. He proposed to circulatein due course a further memorandum setting out his considered viewson the extent to which powers of direct control over the economywere needed. Meanwhile, he hoped that his colleagues would refrainfrom giving any public undertaking that building control would notbe reimposed.In the course of a preliminary discussion some doubts wereexpressed about the expediency of reintroducing this control. Itsoperation in peace-time would present formidable practicaldifficulties. To be effective, it would have to cover all commercialand private building, above a minimum limit of about  3,000. Ifthe exemption limit was set much higher, the control would tend tobe ineffective. In regard to industrial and commercial building,Ministers would have an invidious responsibility in adjudicatingbetween the competing claims of different firms in different areas.Finally, the building industry was particularly slow to respond todirection, both when a control was imposed and when it was with-drawn. A control over imports, for example, would have a muchmore immediate effect on the economy. The case for reimposingbuilding control should be considered in conjunction with theforthcoming review of commercial policy.The Cabinet were also informed that the policy of restrictingcredit was now beginning to have its effect on the building industry.The order books of the building materials industries had shortenedand the National Consultative Committee, which represented allsides of the building and contracting industry, had reported that asharp reduction in commercial building could be expected within
5CM. 58 (56)the next six months. The building industry itself was concerned atthis prospect. The amount of building carried out by local authoritiesin Scotland in the current year would be only three-quarters of thepeak level reached in 1954The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no statement should be made, in any speecheswhich Ministers might make during the recess, whichmight impair the Government&apos;s freedom to reimposebuilding control.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate in duecourse a memorandum on the need for additional powersof direct control over the economy.Agricultural 4.   The Cabinet were informed that the Agricultural WagesWages. Board had awarded an increase of 6s. a week in the wages of(Previous        agricultural workers.   The effect of this decision on wage claims inReference:      other industries could not yet be foreseen, but it must be theCM. (56) 53rd  Government&apos;s aim to prevent its being used as an argument to justifyConclusions,    further claims, particularly in the engineering industries.  While theMinute 3.)       level of agricultural wages was still comparatively low, the factremained that agricultural workers had now secured two increaseswithin a period of eight months and this might well deter workersin other industries from accepting the need to exercise restraint inwage claims.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,3rd August, 1956.
