3CM. 42 (56)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 21st June there would be a debate on technical education.The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Education would speak forthe Government in this debate; and one of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries for Scotland could, if necessary, speak on the Scottishaspects of the problem.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Lord President said that the Second Reading of theDeath Penalty (Abolition) Bill could not be taken in the House ofLords before 10th July. Unless special steps were taken to expeditethem, the proceedings on the Bill might not be completed beforeParliament rose for the summer recess. He therefore proposed toseek agreement in the House to the unusual course of allowing aninterval of only one week between the Second Reading and theCommittee Stage. On that basis the House might complete theirconsideration of the Bill by 24th July.The Lord President said that he would be glad if arrangementscould be made to enable him to consult with the Ministers mainlyconcerned on the attitude to be adopted by Government spokesmentowards amendments of the Bill which might be moved in the Houseof Lords.The Cabinet Agreed that a Committee of Ministers consisting of:  Lord President,Lord Privy Seal,Lord Chancellor,Home Secretary,Chief Whip,should be appointed to advise on the line to be taken byGovernment spokesmen towards amendments to the DeathPenalty (Abolition) Bill which might be moved in the Houseof Lords.Parliament.SelectCommittee onProcedure.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that, as requested by the Cabineton 17th May, he had given further consideration to the suggestionthat a Select Committee should be appointed to hold a limited enquiryon certain points of Parliamentary procedure. There seemed to begeneral agreement that enquiry should made into the practice ofmoving amendments on going into Committee of Supply on theService Estimates, the numbers required for a quorum and for theclosure in Standing Committees, and the constitution of the ScottishStanding Committee. He recommended, however, that the enquiryshould also cover two other matters, namely, the drafting of FinancialResolutions and the latitude allowed to Private Members, underpresent procedure, to promote Bills imposing a charge on funds forwhich, although they were not Exchequer money, the Governmentwere responsible. The Opposition were critical of the presentprocedure under which, in their view, Financial Resolutions were toonarrowly drawn; and, unless this were included among the points tobe examined, they were likely to press for a more general review ofprocedure.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Government would have an opportunity to set out inevidence before the Select Committee the arguments against anyundue relaxation of the existing procedure in respect of FinancialResolutions.50198 3 B 2
4(b) The special procedure for handling Defence Estimates was asurvival from earlier days when this had been the main item ofGovernment expenditure. The House would welcome similaropportunities to debate other aspects of public expenditure, e.g., theinvestment programmes of the nationalised industries. TheGovernment might consider what might be done to meet this pointwhen the report of the Select Committee was available.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined by the Lord Privy Seal forthe appointment of a Select Committee on certain specifiedpoints of Parliamentary procedure.Industrial 4.   The Minister of Labour said that the maintenance workersDisputes. in the steel industry had refused to accept the wage increase of 1 Is.Steel Industry,   a week which had been granted to the process workers in March.They had also rejected the employers&apos; proposal that the matter shouldbe submitted to arbitration and had imposed a ban on overtime-working. In consequence, the output of steel was falling. Neitherside in the dispute had asked him to intervene and he saw no groundson which he could usefully do so. He was attempting to work out, inconsultation with the National Joint Advisory Council, a code ofconduct designed to regulate restrictive practices by workers. A banon overtime used as pressure in a trade dispute was not, however, arestrictive practice which could be dealt with under such a code evenif it were enforced.fn discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was no sanction in a free economy which could be usedto compel workers who saw advantage in withholding their labour toreturn to work or to work overtime.(b) Nevertheless, it was unfortunate that many trade disputesreceived such little publicity. It would be advantageous if the Ministerof Labour could invite both sides to inform him of the facts of thisdispute, as this would ensure that it received due publicity.The Prime Minister said that this dispute had been responsiblefor a drop of 6 per cent, in steel production in May and the fall inJune would be even greater. This would have a most serious effecton the national economy. In his view the Government shouldconsider what positive steps could be taken to bring home to the publicand to the workers concerned the extent to which industrial disputesof this kind were imperilling the national economy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to take all practicable stepsto ensure that further publicity was given to the economiceffects of a continuance of this dispute in the steel industry.Federation of 5.   The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by theRhodesia and Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary (CP. (56) 141)Nyasaiand. discussing proposals by the Prime Minister of the Federation of(Previous Rhodesia and Nyasaiand for further constitutional advances designedReference: to maintain the comparative status of the Federation within theC.C. (53) 5th Commonwealth in face of the prospective advance of the Gold CoastConclusions, to full self-government.Minute 11.) jne   Commonwealth  Secretary   said   that   these proposalscontemplated that, under legislation to be enacted as soon as possible,
5CM. 42 (56)the Federation should advance without delay to the stage of virtuallyfull self-government. This would be inconsistent with theresponsibilities for the African populations of the Federation which,under the present constitution, were reserved to the United KingdomGovernment and Parliament; but Lord Malvern suggested that thisdifficulty might be overcome by the device of replacing by a treatythe powers now reserved to the United Kingdom. In return for anagreement under which the Federal Government would undertaketo consult us before promulgating measures discriminating againstthe African populations, the United Kingdom Government wouldsurrender their present powers to disallow Federal legislation.Lord Malvern took the view that this would preserve the substance,if not the form, of the present constitutional safeguards for theAfricans, and that his proposals would enable the Federation toqualify for full Commonwealth membership. The prospect that theGold Coast would soon advance to Commonwealth membership wasarousing considerable disquiet in the Federation and, if the Federationcould not achieve further constitutional advance, there was a dangerthat Lord Malvern&apos;s Party would be defeated at the next election andreplaced by a Government with less liberal views on African problems.Nevertheless, in view of the Government&apos;s categorical assurancesthat their responsibilities towards the African populations would notbe surrendered without the agreement of the majority of theinhabitants, it seemed out of the question to take the course whichLord Malvern had proposed. Moreover, it was doubtful whether thefurther measure of self-government contemplated in the proposalswould entitle the Federation to qualify for independent internationalstatus or full Commonwealth membership. The Colonial Secretaryand he had therefore reached the conclusion that, at the present stage,it would not be possible to do more than offer the Federation certainfurther external marks of the status she desired, without theirsubstance.The Colonial Secretary said that he was in full agreement withthe views expressed by the Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet agreed that further constitutional advance for theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the lines proposed by itsPrime Minister would not be practicable. They considered, however,that the offer of the various minor improvements suggested inCP. (56) 141 might serve to exacerbate rather than to relieve thesituation. If they would not be acceptable, it would be better thatthey should not be formally put forward. The constitution of theFederation was due for review between 1960 and 1962 and therewould be an opportunity in the meantime to work towards theimprovement in status which Lord Malvern wished. It was felt thatthe difficulties which his proposals would present should be explainedfully to him with a view to inducing him to regard the constitutionalreview as the proper opportunity for securing further advances in thedirection he desired.In further discussion it was suggested that the British NorthAmerican Act might furnish an analogy which could be invokedto support some suitable arrangement which would obviate thedifficulty of the reserved powers.The suggestion was also made that it might be possible toadvance in the direction Lord Malvern desired by accordingCommonwealth membership to Southern Rhodesia alone. It wasagreed that this possibility should be further examined.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to explain to thePrime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia andNyasaland the reasons why his proposals would notprovide a satisfactory basis for further constitutionaladvance.
6(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the ColonialSecretary to consider the suggestions which had been putforward in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and to report furtherto the Cabinet in the light of the consultation to be heldwith the Prime Minister of the Federation.Trinidad OilCompany.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that representativesof the Trinidad Oil Company had indicated, in a discussion withTreasury officials on the previous day, that all the conditions onwhich the Government would wish to be satisfied before giving theirconsent to the proposed transfer of the British shareholding in theCompany to the Texas Oil Company were likely to prove acceptableto the latter Company. He therefore proposed to make a statementin the House of Commons that afternoon announcing that theGovernment were prepared to approve the proposed transaction andindicating the conditions on which their consent would be given. Inorder to divert pressure for an immediate debate, he would announcethat a White Paper describing the transaction in greater detail wouldbe presented on the following day.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.GovernmentExpenditure.Economies.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (56) 144) reporting the progress so far madetowards the reduction of  100 millions which he hoped to make inGovernment expenditure in the current financial year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with the assistanceof the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Defence and as a result ofmuch detailed discussion with Departments, provisional agreementhad now been reached on cuts in expenditure totalling  65^ millions.In the memorandum now circulated he suggested further cuts total-ling  13^ millions. If all these were finally approved, he would beable on 26th June to make an announcement foreshadowing areduction of  79 millions in Government expenditure during thecurrent year. It was disappointing that he could not yet foresee thefull saving of  100 millions at which he had aimed, and he would beopen to some criticism on that account. It would, however, bereasonable to present this list of savings as a first instalment. Lessthan three months had passed since the beginning of the financialyear; the search for economies would continue; and he could promiseto make a further announcement in the autumn. Ministers had takenin hand a thorough review of long-term defence policy, and thisshould lead to major changes in defence programmes. These would,he hoped, afford substantial relief to the national economy in theyears to come, and some of them might begin to have some effecttowards the end of the current year. On the civil side also it mightbe possible to announce some further savings in the autumn e.g.,through a further increase in the price of milk and possibly a furtherreduction in housing subsidies.The Cabinet considered in turn the particular proposals putforward in CP. (56) 144. In their discussion the following pointswere made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had hoped tofind scope for a greater saving than  34 millions on the Estimates ofthe Service Departments and the Ministry of Supply. He was,however, informed that even this saving might not now be realised.
7CM. 42 (56)The War Office were doubtful whether some of the changes whichthey had decided to make would in fact realise in the current yearas large a saving as they had at first estimated. They thought itmight be necessary on this account to reduce their offer for the currentyear by as much as  7 millions.The Minister of Defence said that he was considering this point,and he still hoped that it might be possible to secure a total savingof  34 millions on defence expenditure in the current year.The Prime Minister said that under this head there was also apossibility of some saving on the bomber programme. Under existingplans some  180 millions were to be spent on this programme. Whilehe was anxious that we should make an effective contribution towardsthe deterrent, he was doubtful whether our economy could sustainexpenditure of this magnitude on this part of the defence programme;and it might be necessary to make some reduction in the front linestrength of the bomber force. This change, if it were made, wouldmainly affect expenditure in future years. There was, however, apossibility of some adjustment in the programme for the productionof Valiant bombers which, if made, would yield a saving in thecurrent financial year.(b) The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped it would provepossible to make some further reductions in defence expenditure.Under the proposals out forward in CP. (56) 144 the social serviceswould, in his judgment, suffer a disproportionate cut. He wouldprefer that the balance should be shifted in their favour, at theexpense of defence.(c) In paragraph 3 of CP. (56) 144 it was suggested that therewas scope for a further cut of  1H millions m the defence expenditureof Civil Departments.Under this head the Home Secretary said that he could notaccept, without further examination, the proposal to save  H millionson mobilisation stocks of civil defence equipment. He believed thatthis would involve substantial compensation payments for thecancellation of contracts already let. A detailed examination wasnow being made and the results would be reported to the Chancellorof the Exchequer without delay.The Minister of Agriculture agreed that a further  6 millionsmight be saved by postponing purchases of food for the strategicstockpile He warned the Cabinet, however, that these stocks wereill-balanced and unevenly distributed; and that, if the risk of majorwar increased, prompt action would need to be taken to improveour position in this respect.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was doubtfulwhether the suggested further saving of  4 millions on strategic stocksof materials could properly be represented as a genuine economy.This was a complicated question of accounting, and he would arrangefor it to be discussed further between his Department and theTreasury.(d) On Civil Defence generally, it was pointed out that the cutnow proposed represented a reduction of 60 per cent, as comparedwith expenditure in the previous year. To the extent that this wouldbe secured by modifying earlier programmes for stockpiling, it wouldnot directly affect the efficiency of the Civil Defence services. Onthe other hand, it was to be remembered that these were voluntaryservices whose efficiency rested largely on the willing co-operation oflocal authorities; and it could not be expected that keenness andefficiency would be maintained if it appeared that the Governmentattached little importance to this part of the country&apos;s defences.Great care would therefore be needed in presenting to the publicwhat might appear to be a drastic change in Civil Defence policy.
8(e) The Foreign Secretary said that the proposed cut of 1J millions on the Estimates of his Department included a reductionof  | million in the subsidy to Jordan. For political reasons hewould prefer that the intention to make this reduction should not beannounced until later in the year. If, therefore, it was necessary thatthis item should be separately shown in revised Estimates, he wouldprefer that it should be held over for the second instalment whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer was proposing to announce in theautumn. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to look furtherinto this point.(/) The saving on the Foreign Office Estimates also took accountof a proposal to increase the passport fee to 305. This change wouldbe made by Order-in-Council. The Foreign Secretary undertook toascertain, and inform the Lord Privy Seal, whether this Order wassubject to Parliamentary approval, either by negative or affirmativeresolution.(g) The Minister of Labour said that the saving of  475,000 onhis Estimate would involve a substantial reduction of staff atEmployment Exchanges. It would become apparent that thestandard of service at the Exchanges was being lowered, at a timewhen there were signs of an increase in the volume of unemployment.This might arouse some criticism; and the process of reducing thesestaffs might have to be reversed if the level of unemployment increasedsubstantially.(h) In the longer term there might be scope for more substantialstaff savings through amalgamation of the local offices of the Ministryof Labour, the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and theAssistance Board. In smaller towns, in particular, it was uneconomicto maintain separate offices for these purposes. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that he would arrange for further enquiry to bemade into this point.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (56) 144 at afurther meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,14th June, 1956.#
