2Sir AnthonyEden.Resignation.The Prime Minister said that he was sorry to have to inform hiscolleagues that he was unable to continue in office. After the restwhich he had taken before Christmas, on medical advice, he hadhoped that his health was sufficiently restored to enable him to carryon for some considerable time. Since then, however, he had feltobliged to take further medical advice, and the four doctors whomhe had consulted had come to the unanimous conclusion that hishealth would no longer enable him to sustain the burden of office asPrime Minister. In these circumstances he had decided that he hadno alternative but to resign. He had informed The Queen of hisintentions when he visited Sandringham on the previous day. Hewould formally submit his resignation to Her Majesty at an audienceat Buckingham Palace later that afternoon.The Prime Minister said that his resignation would carry with itthe resignation of the whole Administration. Other Ministers neednot tender their resignations to The Queen, but they should regardtheir offices as at the disposal of his successor. Meanwhile, theyshould carry on the necessary administration of their Departmentsuntil a new Government was formed. Departmental Ministers whowere not members of the Cabinet, and Ministers of State, would be soinformed at a meeting which he was holding later in the afternoon.Junior Ministers would be similarly informed by letter.The Prime Minister said that it remained for him to express hisregret at the decision which he had been compelled to take. It was agreat grief for him to be parted from his colleagues at this time. Hebelieved that the months ahead, though fraught with difficulties,would also offer great opportunities; and he had hoped to be able tohelp in turning these to good account. He wished his colleagues allgood fortune in the future.The Lord President said that he had learned of this decision withgreat sorrow but, in view of the doctors&apos; report, he could not ask thePrime Minister to reconsider it. For him personally it was a bitterblow to be parted from the Prime Minister after a close politicalfriendship of more than thirty years. During that time they hadpassed through many difficult periods, but they had never beendivided. The Prime Minister had been for all a pattern of courageand integrity. The courage which he had shown during the events ofthe last six months had intensified the affection and admiration inwhich he was held throughout the country. His colleagues who wereleft to carry on his work would be fortified in the years ahead by thememory of his example and leadership.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Prime Minister&apos;s resignationwas not only a severe personal shock: it would also be a seriouspolitical blow for the Conservative Party. All his colleagueswould wish to extend to him their deep sympathy and their sincerehope that he would fully regain his health so that his great gifts mightagain be applied in the service of his country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it grieved him deeplythat his political association with the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons, over more than thirty years, must now be broken.Throughout that time it had been a bond between them that they weresurvivors of the first world war, in which so many of the best of theirgeneration had died. He believed that, when the history of the Suezcrisis came to be written, it would be recognised that the PrimeMinister had been inspired by motives of the highest patriotism. Hiscolleagues, if they followed his example, might be able to turn togood account the opportunities which his policy and action hadcreated.The Prime Minister said that he had reached his decision withthe deepest regret. He was heartened by what had been said. It onlyremained for him to thank his colleagues for their unfailing loyaltyand support throughout his period of office as Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,10th January, 1957.
