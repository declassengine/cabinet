jSuez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 74thConclusions,Minute 1.)*1. The Cabinet were informed that on the previous eveningIsraeli troops had crossed the frontier into Egypt and were advancingin strength towards the Suez Canal. So far they seemed to have metwith little resistance from the Egyptian forces and they had madesubstantial progress. Their main force was reported to have reacheda point half way between the frontier and the Canal, and a smallercontingent was believed to be striking south towards Suez. It seemedevident that a serious threat to the security of the Canal wasdeveloping.The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of France wereexpected to arrive in London later that morning, for consultationson this situation. Drafts had been prepared of notes to beaddressed, on behalf of the two Governments, to the Governments ofEgypt and Israel. The purpose of these notes was to call on bothsides to stop hostilities and to withdraw their forces to a distance often miles from the Canal; and the draft note to the EgyptianGovernment also asked that Anglo-French forces should be allowedto move temporarily into key positions at Port Said, Ismailia andSuez in order to guarantee freedom of transit through the Canal. Itwas proposed that if, at the expiration of twelve hours from thedelivery of these notes, one or both Governments had failed toundertake to comply with the requirements stated in them, Britishand French forces should intervene in order to enforce compliance.The Cabinet approved the terms of these draft notes as a basisfor the forthcoming consultation with French Ministers.The Cabinet next considered the draft of a statement to be madethat afternoon in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister.This draft was also approved, subject to certain minor amendments.Discussion then turned on the attitude which the United StatesGovernment were likely to take towards these developments. TheForeign Secretary said that he had been informed by the United StatesAmbassador in London that the United States Government wereproposing to ask the Security Council to consider urgently aresolution condemning Israel as an aggressor. He had suggested tothe Ambassador that such a resolution would be open to criticism onthe ground that Israel was acting in self-defence; and he hademphasised the assurances which we had received that Israel did notcontemplate any attack on Jordan. He was not certain, however,that the United States Government would be influenced by thesearguments and it was for consideration whether, if the FrenchGovernment agreed, we should attempt to persuade them to supportthe action which we and the French were proposing to take to bringto an end the hostilities between Israel and Egypt. As there had beenlittle fighting so far between Israeli and Egyptian forces, it seemedpossible that our action might be deferred for twenty-four hours; andin that event there would be time to make such an appeal to theUnited States Government.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this suggestion. Even though it was unlikely that the UnitedStates Government would respond to such an appeal, we should doour utmost to reduce the offence to American public opinion whichwas liable to be caused by our notes to Egypt and Israel. Ourreserves of gold and dollars were still falling at a dangerously rapidrate; and, in view of the extent to which we might have to rely onAmerican economic assistance, we could not afford to alienate theUnited States Government more than was absolutely necessary.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the outbreak of hostilities between Israel andEgypt.(2) Approved, subject to the forthcoming consultation with thePrime Minister and the Foreign Minister of France, theterms of notes to be addressed to the Governments of* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.50812 1
4Israel and Egypt calling on them to stop hostilities, towithdraw their forces to a distance of ten miles from theSuez Canal, and to allow Anglo-French forces to occupytemporarily key positions on the Canal.(3) Approved the terms of a statement on the situation to bemade by the Prime Minister in the House of Commonsthat afternoon.(4) Took note with approval of the terms of a message which thePrime Minister was proposing to send to the Presidentof the United States inviting his general support for theaction which was to be taken by the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and France.Broadcasting.The FortnightRule.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Report of theSelect Committee on Broadcasting (Anticipation of Debates).The Chief Whip said that he had ascertained that the leaders ofthe Opposition Parties were in general agreement with the SelectCommittee&apos;s recommendations with the following reservations:  (i) They considered that Party political broadcasts should not besubject to the new rule against anticipation of debate.(ii) They were not in favour of the proposal that a panel ofMembers of the House of Commons should advise the Postmaster-General on any application for relaxation of the new rule. Theywould prefer that the British Broadcasting Corporation should begiven a new directive on the subject of anticipation of debate, andthat no relaxation of this directive should be contemplated.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that theGovernment could accept these stipulations, even though, as a result,they would be endorsing only the main recommendation of the SelectCommittee and would be rejecting most of its subsidiary proposals.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to announce, by a Parliamentarystatement in the next few days, the Government&apos;s decisionon the Report of the Select Committee on Broadcasting(Anticipation of Debates).CoalProduction.Open-CastMining.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P. (56) 232) setting out therecommendations of the Committee of Ministers for improvedcompensation to the occupiers and owners of land used for open-castmining.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reconsideredthe suggestion that the improved terms of compensation, which theCabinet had already accepted in principle, should operate from a dateearlier than the date of their announcement. Retrospection wasobjectionable in principle; but, if the Cabinet considered that a strongcase could be made out for it in this instance, the earliest date whichhe could accept would be 10th May, 1956, i.e., the date when it hadfirst been announced that the Government were consideringimprovements in the scheme of compensation. Retrospection to thisdate would involve an extra cost (to be borne by the National CoalBoard) of  130,000 a year, equivalent to about 0- Id. per ton of coal.The Minister of Agriculture said that in his view an element ofretrospection in this case would do much to secure the goodwill oflandowners and tenants and to eliminate any feeling of injustice andhardship.
5It was the general view of the Cabinet that retrospection mightbe conceded in this particular instance.The Cabinet Agreed that the improved terms of compensation to theoccupiers and owners of land used for open-cast miningshould operate from 10th May, 1956.AgriculturalPolicy.Beef Prices.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 70thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Minister of Agriculture said that he had ascertained thatthe farmers would be satisfied with the supplementary payment ofabout  11 millions which he had been authorised by the Cabinet tooffer in order to bring the average return on fat cattle closer to theguaranteed price of 151 s. per live hundredweight. He soughtauthority from the Cabinet to make the necessary Order, to be debatedthat evening in the House of Commons. He also proposed that, inthe course of that debate, be should announce that the Governmentproposed to modify the future operation of the guarantee system bysubstituting a 4-week basis of calculation for the present 52-weekbasis.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he had noobjection to an Order being made forthwith on the lines which theMinister of Agriculture had indicated, he would like more time inwhich to consider the proposed change in the basis of calculation.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to make an Orderdealing with prices for fat cattle on the basis which he haddescribed.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Agriculture to discuss the proposed change in the basisof calculation used in the guarantee system for fat cattle,on the understanding that the Minister&apos;s proposals shouldbe announced during the debate that evening, if acceptableto the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but otherwise shouldbe referred again to the Cabinet.Australia.Trade Talks.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 6.)15. The President of the Board of Trade said that the discussionswith Australia, which were likely to end within the next week or tendays, had reached the point at which, in return for the Government&apos;soffer to use their best endeavours to secure the import of 750,000 tonsof Australian wheat, the Australians had offered the continuation ofpreferences at rates no higher than 5 per cent, on capital goods (ascompared with 12  per cent, at present) and 10 per cent, on othergoods (as compared with a range of 12^ per cent, to 17  per cent,at present). A rate of 5 per cent, on capital goods was whollyunacceptable; and we should seek to secure agreement on rates of1\ per cent, on capital goods and 10 per cent, on other goods asjustified by our &quot; best endeavours &quot; offer to take 750,000 tons of wheat.But it was probable that Australia would then ask, in addition, fora firm undertaking on our part that we would impose countervailingduties on any wheat which was &quot; dumped &quot; in the United Kingdommarket. We could not give a binding promise of this kind; but,bearing in mind our own interests in relation to the &quot; dumping &quot; ofmanufactured goods in the Australian market, we should be preparedto give the Australian request sympathetic consideration. In view ofthe forthcoming legislation to give the Government powers to imposecountervailing duties against &quot; dumping,&quot; it would be difficult toappear hesitant to use these powers in the case of any commodity,such as wheat, where the fact of subsidy was not in dispute.
6In discussion doubts were expressed about the wisdom ofappearing to accept the Australian argument without reservation. Inview of the political embarrassment of any action which appearedto be holding the price of wheat at an unnecessarily high level, it wassuggested that, if it became necessary to offer the Australians a moreor less firm commitment on the question of &quot; dumping,&quot; they shouldbe asked in return to establish the rate of preference on capital goodsat some figure higher than 1\ per cent., e.g., iO per cent. The Cabinetshould be given a further opportunity of considering the issuesinvolved before a final decision was taken.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to be guided, infurther negotiations with Australia, by the considerationsnoted during their discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate amemorandum on the main issues involved in thesenegotiations, for consideration at an early date.6. The Minister of Housing said that, in his forthcomingannouncement of the Government&apos;s intention to abolish the last  10of the general needs housing subsidy, he proposed to provide that thissubsidy should be continued in respect of one-roomed houses suitablefor occupation by elderly people. Such people were not at presentreceiving a fair share of the new building undertaken by localauthorities; and since one effect of the forthcoming legislation on rentswould be to induce elderly people to move from large houses, it wasdesirable that local authorities should be given some financialencouragement to devote a rather larger portion of their housingprogrammes to the provision of suitable alternative accommodation.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this proposal.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Housing, in announcing theGovernment&apos;s intention to abolish the remaining  10 of thegeneral needs housing subsidy, to indicate that this subsidywould be continued in respect of one-roomed houses suitablefor elderly people.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.,30th October, 1956.HousingSubsidies.(PreviousReference:C.M.
