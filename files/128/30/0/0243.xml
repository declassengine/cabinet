CM. 19 (56)Jordan.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting onthe previous day, he had held a preliminary discussion with some ofhis colleagues on the effect which the dismissal of the Commandantof the Arab Legion was likely to have on our future relations withJordan and on the general situation in the Middle East. Our generalpolicy in the Middle East must be founded on the need to protectour oil interests in Iraq and in the Persian Gulf. The main threatto those interests was the growing influence of Egypt. This we hadsought to counter by strengthening the Bagdad Pact; and there wasno doubt that United States adherence to that Pact would be thegreatest single contribution which could be made towards the easingof our present difficulties in the Middle East.In discussion it was suggested that, if the United StatesGovernment remained unwilling to join the Bagdad Pact, they mightbe persuaded to pursue the alternative course of supporting a policyof greater firmness towards Egypt. Hitherto, they had been hopingthat a friendly policy towards Egypt might lead to a settlement of thedispute between Israel and her Arab neighbours. If, however, Iraq&apos;srelative position in the Arab world could be strengthened either bythe growing strength of the Bagdad Pact or by a reduction of Egypt&apos;sinfluence Iraq might be able to take the lead in bringing about anaccommodation between Israel and the Arab States. This was afurther reason for seeking, in present circumstances, means ofstrengthening Iraq&apos;s position.The Prime Minister said that, at the meeting of Ministers whichhe had held on the previous evening, it had been agreed that our nextmove should be to urge the Government of Iraq to make a directapproach to the Jordan Government about the situation created byKing Hussein&apos;s dismissal of British officers from the Arab Legion.We should indicate to the Iraq Government that we could not beexpected to continue our financial support to Jordan if the reliabilityof the Arab Legion was undermined, and should suggest that thetime might have come for them to take over some of theresponsibilities which we had hitherto assumed in Jordan. He readto the Cabinet the draft of a telegram in this sense which it wasproposed to send to H.M. Ambassador in Bagdad.The Cabinet then discussed the handling of the debate which wasto be held in the House of Commons on the following day arising outof the dismissal of British officers of the Arab Legion. It was pointedout that, in view of the consultations which were now to be held withthe Iraq Government, it would not be possible for Governmentspokesmen in this debate to make any new pronouncement of policyon our future relations with Jordan. It would therefore be preferablethat the debate should range more widely over the general question ofpolicy in the Middle East.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statements, and approvedthe terms of the telegram which was to be sent toH.M. Ambassador at Bagdad instructing him to urgethe Government of Iraq to make a direct approach to theJordan Government on the future of the Arab Legion andthe question of Jordan&apos;s future relations with the UnitedKingdom.Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)*2. The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cypruswas satisfied that there was no prospect of restoring law and orderin the Island while Archbishop Makarios and the Bishop of Kyreniaremained at large there. For some time past the Bishop of Kyreniahad extolled terrorism, advocated bloodshed and incited the youth ofCyprus to violence. More recently, reliable evidence had beenobtained that Archbishop Makarios had himself been deeply* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.49812 3 b 2
4implicated in the campaign of violence launched by the terroristorganisation EOKA. The publishable evidence of their activitieswas summarised in Cyprus telegrams Nos. 489 and 496.The Colonial Secretary said that, now that the Archbishop hadfinally declined to abjure violence and to co-operate in the framingof a constitution, he supported the view of the Governor that boththese clerics should be deported from the Island. Plans had beenmade on the assumption that they would be deported to theSeychelles and confined in a private villa there. A more lenientcourse might, however, be taken in respect of Archbishop Makarios.If, as was likely, he left Cyprus for a visit to Athens, he might berefused re-entry to Cyprus. Alternatively, he might be deportedfrom Cyprus to the United Kingdom. If, however, either of thesealternatives was adopted, there would be no power to restrict hissubsequent movements. These alternatives had been put to theGovernor of Cyprus. His view, reported in Cyprus telegram No. 507,was that there were only two possible courses: (i) to deport theArchbishop to the Seychelles and to detain him there; or (ii) to leavehim at liberty until he took some further action which would provideadditional grounds for deporting him. The Colonial Secretary saidthat, of these two courses, he strongly favoured the first. Hiscolleagues should however recognise that, if this drastic action weretaken, it would reduce the prospect of enlisting moderate Oppositionsupport in the House of Commons for the policy which theGovernment were pursuing in Cyprus.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theColonial Secretary&apos;s view.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to authorise the Governor ofCyprus to arrange for Archbishop Makarios and theBishop of Kyrenia to be deported, at the earliestpracticable opportunity, from Cyprus to the Seychelles.(2) Agreed that advance information of this decision should beconveyed, not more than one hour before action wastaken, to the United States Consul in Cyprus, the StateDepartment in Washington and the United StatesSecretary of State, now in Karachi; and invited theColonial Secretary and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs, respectively, to make arrangements accordingly.The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus wouldshortly be taking action, under the authority given by the Cabineton 23rd January, to jam subversive broadcasts from Athens toCyprus. The apparatus at his disposal would jam .medium-wavetransmissions from Athens, but it now appeared that it would not befully effective against short-wave transmissions. He understood thatit would be technically possible to jam the latter type of transmissionfrom the United Kingdom; but that, if this were done, it wouldbecome known that the operation was being conducted from here.Alternatively, if a delay of about two weeks were accepted,arrangements could be made to jam from Malta these short-wavetransmissions from Athens.The Prime Minister said that it was undesirable that theseoperations should be undertaken from the United Kingdom.Arrangements might, however, be made to undertake them fromMalta, so long as this involved no interference with the reception ofother radio programmes outside Cyprus.The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to arrange for short-wavetransmissions of subversive broadcasts from Athens toCyprus to be jammed from Malta, provided that thisinvolved no interference with the reception of other radioprogrammes outside Cyprus.Broadcastsfrom Athens.(PreviousReference:CM.

5CM. 19 (56)Security in 3.   The Cabinet had before them two Notes by the Secretarythe Public of the Cabinet (CP. (56) 58 and 68) covering (i) the report of theService. Conference of Privy Councillors which had examined the securityConference of procedures in force in the public service; and (ii) a draft of a WhitePrivy Paper summarising the main conclusions of the Conference.Councillors. jne prime Minister recalled that this Conference had been(Previous        convened as a result of the debate in the House of Commons onReference:      7th November, 1955, about the disappearance of two members ofCM. (55) 39th   the Foreign Service.  The Conference had concluded that there wasConclusions.    nothing organically unsound in the security procedures currentlyMinute 1.)       applied in the public service.   They had, however, recommendedcertain changes designed to strengthen the existing system. Thereport of the Conference had been considered by the MinisterialCommittee on Security, who advised that its recommendations shouldbe adopted.It would not be in the public interest to publish the full textof the report or to announce all its recommendations. An under-taking had, however, been given to Parliament that there would be anannouncement of any changes introduced, as a result of the work ofthe Conference, which could properly be made public. TheMinisterial Committee therefore recommended that a White Papershould now be presented to Parliament, in the terms of the draftannexed to CP. (56) 68, summarising the main recommendationsin the report of the Conference.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The White Paper purported to be a summary of a reportpresented by Privy Councillors drawn from both Parties. TheOpposition members of the Conference ought therefore to be givenan opportunity to see the White Paper, before it was presented, andto say whether they regarded it as a fair summary of the report.(b) Some of the recommendations, as presented in summaryform in the White Paper without the supporting arguments containedin the report itself, might excite some public criticism. An examplewas the recommendation, in paragraph 15 of the White Paper, thatan individual living with a wife or husband who was a Communistmight, for that reason alone, have to be removed from secret work.(c) In the report of the Conference the point was made that apublic servant who was a Communist must expect to find that thispolitical.affiliation might prejudice his prospects of promotion. Whilethis was certainly true in relation to higher posts, there were largeareas of the public service in which this consideration would hardlyapply. It was agreed that the reference to this recommendation, inparagraph 13 of the draft White Paper, should be so adjusted as tomake it clear that this situation applied only &quot; in some Departments.&quot;(d) It was agreed that the second sentence in paragraph 16 ofthe draft White Paper should be amended to read: &quot; Thus, in ordernot to imperil sources of information, decisions have sometimes tobe taken without revealing full details of the supporting evidence.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Accepted   the   recommendations   made   in   the report(CP. (56) 58) of the Conference of Privy Councillors onsecurity procedures in the public service.(2) Approved, subject to the amendments noted in paragraphs(c) and id) above, the draft White Paper (CP. (56) 68)summarising the main conclusions of the Conference.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to ascertain whether the Labourmembers of the Conference were content to accept thedraft White Paper as a fair summary of the report &quot;of theConference.(4) Subject to Conclusion (3) above, invited the Prime Ministerto present the White Paper to Parliament.49812 3 b 3
6EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)Balance ofPayments.4. The Cabinet took note of a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (56) 55) covering a report by a Committee ofOfficials on the balance of payments in 1955 and the prospects for1956.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)Consultationswith Industry.5. The Prime Minister said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;sdecision of 22nd February, he had, in company with the Lord PrivySeal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour,held a preliminary meeting with representatives of the Trades UnionCongress (T.U.C.) on the measures which the Government weretaking to remedy the economic situation. At this preliminarymeeting Ministers had confined themselves to explaining the circum-stances which had made these measures necessary. Separatediscussions would now be held with representatives of employers inindustry. Thereafter, a further meeting would be held withrepresentatives of the T.U.C.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.NorthernIrelandParliament:Disqualification,(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. (56) 63) covering the reports of the SelectCommittees which had investigated two further cases ofdisqualification in the Northern Ireland Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the legislation which they had authorised on16th February to deal with the earlier cases of disquali-fication in the Northern Ireland Parliament should nowbe extended so as to cover the two further cases describedin CP. (56) 63.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the reports ofthe Select Committees of the Northern Ireland Parliamentto be presented to the Parliament at Westminster, togetherwith a White Paper in the terms of the draft set out inAnnex A to CP. (56) 63.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement, in the termsof the draft in Annex B to CP. (56) 63, announcing theGovernment&apos;s intention to introduce the legislationauthorised by Conclusion (1) above.Coal 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDistribution Fuel and Power (CP. (56) 61) proposing that an independent enquiryCosts. should be held into the costs of coal distribution.(Previous jne Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Economic PolicyReference:      Committee had endorsed his proposal in principle, but had reservedCM. (56) 8th    for ^ Cabinet&apos;s decision the question whether the committee ofConclusions,    enquiry should include a Trade Union representative or whether theMinute 9.)       enquiry should be conducted by a small independent body whichwould take evidence from the various interests concerned.   It hadbeen suggested that a representative committee might find in favourof the nationalisation of coal distribution.   He himself, however,saw little risk of this; for the General Secretary of the Trades Union
7CM. 19 (56)Congress (T.U.C.) had already agreed that the terms of reference ofthe proposed enquiry should exclude questions relating to theorganisation of the trade; and it could in any event be assumed thatsuggestions for the nationalisation of coal distribution would beopposed by the co-operative societies. On the other hand, therewould be positive advantage in including a representative of theT.U.C. in the committee of enquiry. It was the T.U.C. who hadasked for an enquiry and they had a legitimate interest in thequestion.He proposed that the committee of enquiry should consist ofSir Godfrey Mitchell, as Chairman; Mr. W. E. Parker, anaccountant; Sir Graham Larmor, an industrialist who would alsorepresent the interests of Northern Ireland; Mr. W. J. P. Webber, atrade unionist; and Mrs. Cantwell, representing the consumers.The Cabinet Agreed that an independent committee should be appointedto enquire into the costs of coal distribution; and authorisedthe Minister of Fuel and Power to constitute the Committeeas he proposed.BritishTransportCommission.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (56) 53) on the financial position of the BritishTransport Commission.The Minister of Transport said that, if the Cabinet agreed thatrailway charges should be increased at this stage, he now consideredthat the balance of advantage would lie in raising freight charges by5 per cent, and not by 10 per cent, as he had earlier proposed. TheChairman of the Transport Commission had, however, suggestedthat if the other nationalised industries were ready to follow asimilar policy there was a case for leaving railway rates unchangedfor a further period of six months. During this time he hoped thatsome results would flow from the measures agreed with the railwaystaffs to increase efficiency, and that the Transport Tribunal wouldreach a decision on the Commission&apos;s new scheme of freight charges.Although, in any event, some increase in railway charges would beinevitable at the end of this period, there was some reason to hopethat, as a result of improved efficiency and the greater flexibilitywhich the revised scheme for freight charges would allow, it wouldthen be unnecessary to impose a general increase of as much as10 per cent, on freight charges. If this course were approved, hehimself would urge on the Commission the importance of achievingthe greatest possible efficiency, not merely by improved workingarrangements but also by closing down unremunerative branch lines.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while there must begood grounds for departing from the financial policies which hadbeen introduced to restrain the inflationary trend, he felt that thisproposal should be further considered. Although the Commission&apos;sprospective operating deficit of  38 millions in the current year (afterallowing for a 5 per cent, increase in freight charges) was inflationaryin effect, it was also true that there now seemed to be a better prospectof securing a more efficient nationalised transport industry. Theexisting system of freight charges had hampered the Commissionand had been out of date for many years. Moreover, if a generalincrease of 10 per cent, in freight charges had to be made, it wouldprobably divert some traffic to the roads and the Commission wouldin fact be unable on this account to secure the full financial benefitof such an increase. Meanwhile, the steps taken to promote efficiencywere already having some effect, e.g., in securing economies in trackmaintenance, and it was desirable that nothing should be done todiscourage railway staffs from concentrating on further progress in
8this direction. The railways would not be required to pay increasedprices for coal until 1st July. In all these circumstances it might bejustifiable to take, in respect of the railways, the exceptional coursesuggested by the Minister of Transport.In discussion it was argued that a decision to defer the increasein railway charges would be at variance with the Government&apos;sdisinflationary policy. If charges were not increased, a prospectivedeficit of  55 millions for the current year would be added to theaccumulated deficit of  70 millions. This would mean that therailways were in fact being subsidised on a substantial scale.Moreover, there could be no certainty that the Transport Tribunalwould reach a decision on the new charges scheme within six months:there was little or nothing which the Government could do toaccelerate the hearings before the Tribunal.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that in all thecircumstances the suggestion of a moratorium merited furtherexploration. While there should be no indication that theGovernment were weakening in their disinflationary policy, it wouldbe of great psychological importance in furthering that policy if alead towards stable prices could be given by holding railway chargessteady for a period. The case of the railways clearly presentedexceptional features and it would help to reinforce the effect ofproposals which the Prime Minister had it in mind to place beforethe British Employers&apos; Federation and the Trades Union Congressif it could be said that railway rates would not be raised for thetime being. In this connection the view was expressed that, if chargeswere not to be raised, more definite steps should be taken thanhitherto to explain to the railway staffs and to public opinion theinherent connection between wages, efficiency and charges.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider further the issuesinvolved in postponing for a period of six months anyincrease in the railway charges of the British TransportCommission.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this matter in the lightof a report on the discussions of the Economic PolicyCommittee.Farm 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterPrice of Agriculture (CP. (56) 62) submitting a revised schedule of priceReview. guarantees as the basis for a final settlement of the current review offarm prices.(Previous jne Minister of Agriculture said that it was now clear that theReference: farmers&apos; representatives would not be willing to accept an agreedCM. 56) 17th settlement at any figure representing an increase of less than  3?Conclusions, millions over the total for the previous year. An imposed settlementMinute 10.) would therefore be inevitable. It was proposed that this should bebased on the schedule of guarantees set out in his memorandumrepresenting an increase of some  22 millions or, if it were decidedthat the guaranteed price for milk should be increased by \d. insteadof \d.,  24 millions. Although the production of milk was tendingto increase, he recommended that the higher figure should be offered.The farmers&apos; representatives had claimed an increase of \\d.and would not be satisfied with less than %d., but an increase of \d.would go some way to diminish the resentment at the settlementgenerally which would be felt by the smaller farmers whowere specially dependent on milk production. The farmerswould also dislike the abolition of individual guarantees forfatstock, but the administration of these guarantees was costly
9CM. 19 (56)and the time had come to end them. Finally, he hoped that adetermined effort would now be made to find an effectivesystem of guarantees covering a number of years as a substitute forthe present annual price review. Further progress must be madein this direction if the Government&apos;s agricultural policy was tocommand the confidence of the industry. He accepted, however, theview of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that no promise of thisshould be held out until the Government could see more clearlyhow effect could be given to it.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, although a settlementon the basis of an increase of  22 millions or  24 millions might becriticised as unduly generous at a time when sacrifices werebeing demanded of other sections of the community, there wasa valid case for offering an increase of \d. rather than \d. in thesubsidy for milk in order to gain support in rural areas for theunusual course of imposing a settlement.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Would it not be desirable to introduce in future years adifferential subsidy for milk? A guaranteed price for milk, fixed ata level based on the needs of the small farmer, gave excessive profitsto owners of the larger and more efficient farms. On the other hand,a differential subsidy would help to perpetuate the existence ofuneconomic small farming units and would fail to provide an incentiveto greater efficiency.(b) Northern Ireland farmers, who were at a greater distancefrom their market, would have preferred some improvement in theguarantee for pigs rather than an increase in the subsidy for milk.(c) Although Commonwealth producers would welcome thegreatest possible reduction in the guaranteed price for wheat, it wouldbe impracticable to reduce the guarantee by more than the sum nowproposed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the increase to be offered in the guaranteed pricefor milk should be \d. a gallon.(2) Approved the remaining proposals set out in CP. (56) 62 asa final settlement of the current review of farm prices.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,6th March, 1956.
