CM. 66 (56)Police Pay.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 49thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 209)reporting the outcome of their consultations with local authorityassociations on the question whether provision should be made in theforthcoming legislation on police pay for according retrospectiveeffect to the latest pay award.The Home Secretary said that these consultations had disclosedsome division of opinion. The Association of MunicipalCorporations, together with the Scottish County CouncilsAssociation, had not been prepared to agree that the principle ofretrospection should be extended to a pay award already made.Nevertheless, he did not consider that the Government had any choicebut to give some retrospective effect to the latest award and he wassatisfied that the two Associations which had objected to this wouldnot persist in their opposition.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government&apos;sauthority in urging economy on the local authorities might beweakened if they were able to argue that on this occasion theGovernment had forced them to incur expenditure contrary to theirwishes. It had, however, become inevitable that the latest award tothe police should be made retrospective and he hoped that, in furtherdiscussion, the two Associations concerned could be induced to acceptthe position. The Home Secretary agreed to make furtherrepresentations on these lines to the two Associations.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal put forward in CP. (56) 209.CommercialPolicy.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 65thConclusions,Minute 2.)Colonies.2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the arguments forand against the association of the United Kingdom with a free tradearea in Europe.The Colonial Secretary said that he had already informed anumber of the more important Colonial Governments in confidenceof the scope and purposes of the proposals and, before any finaldecision on them were taken, he would wish to have an opportunityof seeking the considered views of the Colonies as a whole. Heagreed that the plan would be unlikely to cause serious damage tothe trade which they carried on at present with the United Kingdom.Colonial exports of raw materials, such as copper and rubber,enjoyed no preferences in the United Kingdom; and only a fewColonies, such as Malta and Hong Kong, were as yet interested inthe export of manufactures to this market. Hong Kong would findthe prospect of European competition in this market less disturbingthan the recurrent threat of quotas against her goods. The exclusionof agricultural products from the scope of the plan would go someway towards assuaging any fears which Colonial territories wouldentertain in regard to their current trade, and it was essential thatwe should maintain this condition in negotiations.As regards the future, the position was less satisfactory. TheColonies were rapidly becoming industrialised and several of themwould be looking forward to receiving within the next generation theadvantages in the United Kingdom market which would flow, notmerely from the Ottawa Agreements, but from the wider preferentialmargins which they might expect to negotiate if, as many hoped, therestraints in this regard which were at present imposed on us couldbe removed. This prospect would now be denied to the Coloniesand their loyalty, which was bound up with trade, would diminish.Moreover, if the dependent territories of the European Powers50548 2b 2
4concerned decided to join in the proposed association, would it bepossible for us to give the products of our own Colonial territorieseffective protection against the corresponding products of theEuropean dependencies&apos;? The question whether the Colonies shouldor should not join in the association would present serious difficulties.They would, in any event, be closely interested in any proposals onthe lines of those set out in paragraph 7 of C.P. (56) 207 for providingfurther and compensating opportunities for Commonwealth tradewith the United Kingdom.In regard to the plan itself, he considered that, although theUnited Kingdom might not be pursuing irreconcilable objectives inattempting to assume leadership in Europe while remaining thecentre of a powerful Commonwealth, the prospects of success in sucha venture were at best speculative, and we might find that inconcentrating our efforts on advantages in Europe which might notaccrue we lost the more tangible benefits of the Commonwealthconnection.The following points were made in discussing the extent to whichthe plan would affect the economic interests of the Colonies:  (a) To the extent that Europe, under a unified economy, becamemore prosperous it could be expected to provide a better market forColonial as for Commonwealth products generally.{b) The point was reiterated that the preferences system wascrumbling away and that, given this trend, the Colonies could notnow hope to extend it to their advantage.(c) The industrialisation of the Colonies, based on very lowcosts, would present separate problems from those arising in relationeither to the preferences system or to the proposals now underdiscussion. The United Kingdom would be unable to absorbColonial manufactures in large quantities, and Hong Kong could beregarded as an exception only so long as she remained unique. Themanufacturing Colonies would be more concerned to maintain theirtrading advantage against Japan in the United Kingdom, rather thanany advantage they might now have against Europe, and this theywould be able to do.General. The Cabinet then resumed their discussion of the broaderconsiderations which arose in regard to the closer economicassociation of the United Kingdom with Europe. In this part of thediscussion the following views were expressed.The Lord Chancellor said that, in his view, there were convincingarguments for moving into closer economic association with Europe.If we let the opportunity pass, we should be confronted in Europeby a powerful discriminatory bloc dominated by Germany; on theother hand, we could no longer expect, whatever course we mightadopt, to retain the advantages of the preferences system in theCommonwealth. Moreover, it was made clear in the memorandawhich had been prepared that the present proposals represented acontinuation of, rather than the departure from, the policy we hadhitherto followed of a collective approach towards a &quot; one-world &quot;system. And it was a basic feature of the plan that, in parallel witha closer association with Europe, there would be a need for acorrespondingly closer co-operation with the United States and theCommonwealth.But the Government, in deciding to take the course outlined,would be faced in many quarters with opposition and suspicionwhich, formidable in the aggregate, would need to be overcome.Our aims would tend to be misconstrued in the United States; theposition of France in regard to the plan would present difficulties inmore ways than one; in the Commonwealth, Canada, Australia andNew Zealand would be critical or apprehensive of our intentions andthe Asian members would seek to re-negotiate their trade agreements
5CM. 66 (56)with us; at home, problems would arise in regard to those industrieswhich were ill-equipped to meet European competition and therewould be opposition from the trade unions. Within the ConservativeParty the proposals would arouse disquiet in those groups with whichthe Commonwealth connection, the maintenance of full employment,opposition to any form of dirigisme and the fortunes of homeagriculture represented main articles of political faith. He had nodoubt about the wisdom of the course proposed but Ministers oughtto be in a position to meet the criticisms and difficulties which wouldarise from all these quarters before embarking on it. They shouldthen assume the initiative vigorously rather than tentatively, and tothe maximum extent possible the course in view should be representedas a natural development of previous policies.The Lord Privy Seal said that he recognised that these proposalsderived from a well-founded anxiety about the future of the UnitedKingdom economy and that the initiative towards a closer associationwith Europe was designed to avert dangers which could already beforeseen. Nevertheless the proposals, if put into effect, would exposeindustry in the United Kingdom to very great pressure, and he wasconcerned lest this method of subjecting the national economy tonecessary discipline should have the consequence of intensifying thedangers which already beset it. A lengthy process of education wouldbe needed before industry, the trade unions and the nation wouldbe ready to make the adjustments which would be required of them.He agreed that we might be caught at a disadvantage if the EuropeanPowers decided to proceed without us, but he doubted whether theywould be able to reach agreement as quickly as was feared. It hadbeen argued that the proposed initiative would have the effect ofrestoring international confidence in the national economy and insterling, but he was not yet satisfied that this would be the result.In particular, he questioned whether taking into account the stillexcessive current level of imports, the strains which the reserves werealready suffering and the uncertainties arising from the Suez situation the time was ripe to contemplate a further move in the direction oftrade liberalisation. He was especially exercised over the safeguardswhich would be available for sterling during the period in which thefree trade area, and our preponderant position in it, was being builtup. Nevertheless, although he shared the misgivings which had beenexpressed regarding the feasibility of the proposals on politicalgrounds, he agreed that the views of Commonwealth countries shouldnow be sought on these proposals. The Cabinet should not becommitted to any final decision until the problem had again beenreviewed in the light of the reactions of the countries which werenow to be consulted.The Minister of Education said that the plan itself provided themost effective means of carrying conviction to the sterling Common-wealth that we were determined to preserve and safeguard sterling asa currency. The preservation of sterling, which had been the principalobjective of pre-war policies, had been replaced in the post-war periodby the maintenance of full employment as our primary economicpurpose. Informed opinion in the Commonwealth should be able todiscern that we could not embark upon this plan unless we wereprepared to restore the emphasis in our policy from full employmentto the protection of our currency. Nor was it a question of choicebetween safeguarding sterling and maintaining full employment. Wewere at present maintaining full employment at a standard of livingwhich the economy was not earning; it was this which jeopardised thestability of sterling and, under any policy, it could not long continue.In the long run we could only maintain full employment at a standardof living which the economy could earn in free competition overseas;the present proposals would help us to achieve this, as the aggregatepurchasing power of the countries who would be comprised in theplan was rising faster than the purchasing power of the United
6Kingdom alone.   Full employment could not be maintained by theperpetuation of tariffs and quotas.The President of the Board of Trade, commenting on thearguments brought forward in the discussion, made the followingpoints. The attitude of Australia towards the preferences systemderived from a profound change which had developed in the directionof her trading interests. As we ourselves had decided to expand homeagricultural production, so Australia had developed secondary  industries and she was concerned to secure markets for her products.The former pattern of trade no longer suited Australian interests.Canada would have no well-founded cause for complaint, as herbalance of trade with the United Kingdom was already preponder-antly in her favour; she should be concerned to maintain her tradewith us rather than to secure additional advantages as the price ofacquiescence in the plan. As regards the United States, our intentionsmight be misconstrued and criticised by some sections of Americanopinion. But other sections of American opinion, including powerfulvoices in the United States Government, had long been pressing fora greater degree of economic unification in Europe and the associationof the United Kingdom with it, and support from those quarterscould reasonably be expected. He recognised that opposition couldbe expected from the Trades Union Congress; nevertheless, therewould be support among the Labour Opposition for the closerassociation of this country with Europe. He did not think that theproposals would entail the need for more dirigiste powers over theeconomy than would be required in any event. This was a complexissue and the need for such powers would have to be examined on itsmerits.The Lord President said that a division of the world into twogroups had been evolving. In a military sense, the balance betweenthese two groups was at present held by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation. The economic balance should properly consist of thesame alignment of forces and we should reflect carefully beforelinking ourselves with a grouping which did not include the UnitedStates and Canada. He agreed nevertheless that the views ofCommonwealth countries should be sought on these proposals,although this consultation in itself and the knowledge that the UnitedKingdom had been giving consideration to a closer association withEurope would have some effect on the future of Commonwealthrelations, whether or not we ultimately decided to go forward withthe plan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the fact must befaced that the United Kingdom had declined in relative economicpower in comparison with the other large economic units nowdominating the world. The basis of industrial production must belarge enough to carry the overheads which modern industrialtechniques made necessary, and the home market was now relativelytoo small to provide this. The time had therefore come when, as atother periods in our history, a new basis must be found on which oureconomic power could be restored and maintained. Correspondingly,we must avoid, as an exporting country, finding ourselves at a seriousdisadvantage in comparison with a rival exporting bloc in Europe.The plan should therefore be presented to Commonwealth countries,not as an academic speculation but as a considered plan to preserveand strengthen sterling in the long term, to provide a more securemarket for Commonwealth agricultural products and to makepossible the creation of adequate investment capital from theresources of the old world for the needs and benefit of the new. Ourdecision whether to proceed with the plan would be influenced by theattitude of the Commonwealth countries, but they should be invited tto consider the consequences for them if, without some such policy, ^the United Kingdom gradually declined as an economic force.
7CM. 66 (56)The prospects of being able to proceed with the plan now gavecause for concern, however, for other reasons. It had always beenassumed that it would expose sterling to new strains in the short term.Sterling was now already exposed to even more serious dangerbecause of the disturbance to confidence caused by the dispute overthe Suez Canal, and a decision on whether to proceed with the plancould not now be taken until the future course of this dispute couldbe more clearly foreseen. In the meantime the question must behandled, in discussion with Commonwealth countries and otherwise,in such a way as to leave the position open for several weeks. Inthis period discussions in Paris should be confined to the factual andtechnical aspects of the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that wewere confronted with a dilemma.  An economic plan based on theCommonwealth connection would no doubt have been preferable,and the Secretary of State for Scotland had expressed to himmisgivings about the risks to the Conservative Party in appearing toabandon traditional policies based on maintaining the solidarity of theEnglish-speaking peoples in favour of closer union with Europeannations.  But there was little prospect of devising a policy based onthe Commonwealth connection; the Australians appeared to bedetermined in their pursuit of their present commercial objectivesand both Australia and New Zealand were bound to be attracted, ifonly for reasons of defence, towards an increasingly close associationwith the United States.  The attitude of the Asian members of theCommonwealth towards the British connection was uncertain andthey diverged from us on many matters.  Unless, therefore, we werecapable, acting alone, of meeting formidable European competitionin oversea markets, there seemed no alternative but to base our policyon the proposed plan for closer association with Europe, or somesuitable variant or extension of it.  The French Prime Minister hadrecently asked whether we might be prepared to revive the offer ofcommon citizenship made in 1940 and we had now to consider whatreply should be given to this enquiry. There might prove to be scopefor a closer association in military, financial and economic affairswhich would make the two countries a powerful partnership. Thisquestion should now be examined urgently by officials in order thatMinisters could give consideration to the terms of our reply before hehimself visited Paris later that month. In addition, thought might begiven to possible extensions of the Commonwealth union to includecountries in Europe, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and theScandinavian countries, which might be prepared to join such anassociation.   In his opinion, although the Conservative Party hadtraditionally been a Commonwealth party, the younger generationwere conscious of a need for new policies and might prove responsiveto an initiative in these directions.The Cabinet (1) Confirmed their earlier decision that the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade shouldbe authorised to explain and discuss the proposalsoutlined in CP. (56) 208 with Commonwealth FinanceMinisters during the forthcoming meetings in Washington.(2) Agreed that a final decision on the question whether or notto proceed with these proposals must now depend on thecourse of the Suez Canal dispute and that, in any event,no final decision could be taken until there had beenfurther opportunity for reflection on the points made inthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the views of other Common-wealth countries were known.(3) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officialsto examine urgently the possible scope for collaborationwith France in military, financial, economic and othermatters in the light of representations recently receivedfrom the French Prime Minister.
83. The Colonial Secretary said that three men now lying undersentence of death in Cyprus had failed in their application for leaveto appeal to the Privy Council against their sentences. It now restedwith the Governor of Cyprus to decide whether he should recommendthat the prerogative of mercy should be exercised in their favour.Two of the men had been convicted of murder: the third had beenconvicted of attempt to murder. It was possible that the Governormight recommend clemency, at least in this third case.The Cabinet-Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,18th September, 1956.Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM.
