(56) 44thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that, at the Prime Minister&apos;srequest, he had concerted with the Chairman of the ConservativeParty arrangements for securing that adequate publicity was given,through Ministerial speeches, to the main features of Governmentpolicy at the present juncture. For this purpose the Chairman wouldhimself approach Ministers who were not members of the Cabinetand Junior Ministers. It would, however, be preferable that anynecessary approaches to members of the Cabinet should be madeby a Minister; and the Prime Minister had invited him to undertakethis duty.The Cabinet-Approved the arrangements, described by the Lord PrivySeal, for securing better publicity for Government policythrough the medium of Ministerial speeches.3.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda:  CP. (56) 214: by the Lord Chancellor, summarising theadvantages and disadvantages of introducing a Government Billamending the law of murder;CP. (56) 215 : by the Home Secretary, covering the draft of sucha Bill; andCP. (56) 218: by the Home Secretary and Secretary of Statefor Scotland, drawing attention to certain defects in the DeathPenalty (Abolition) Bill introduced by Mr. S. Silverman, M.P., andpointing out that, if this Bill went forward in the next session ofParliament, these defects would need to be remedied by &quot; scheduled &quot;amendments under the Parliament Act procedure or by immediatesubsequent legislation.The Lord Chancellor said that, on the merits of the matter, thebalance of advantage lay, in his judgment, on the side of introducinga Government measure on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56)215. This would enable the Government to regain the initiative inthis controversy and to resume their rightful responsibility for leadingParliament on a matter which directly affected the preservation oflaw and order. The Bill which had been prepared represented amiddle course which, he believed, reflected majority opinionthroughout the country.In support of this course the following arguments wereadvanced: (a) The attitude which the House of Commons had adoptedtowards this question did not fairly reflect the state of public opinionin the country. There was good reason to believe that majorityopinion in the country, while favouring some amendment of thelaw of murder, did not wish the death penalty to be wholly abolished.The Government therefore had a duty to bring forward a compromisemeasure; for, unless they did so, it was to be expected that the Death50567 b 2CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)
Penalty (Abolition) Bill would be enacted in the next session underthe Parliament Act procedure.(b) It was true that on a free vote the House of Commons had,by a small majority, declared in favour of the abolition of the deathpenalty. Since then, however, powerful support for a middle coursehad been voiced by responsible leaders of public opinion. Thiscreated a new situation of which the Government should takeaccount.(c) The Home Secretary said that, up to now, he had been ableto find grounds, on the merits of each case, for recommending thereprieve of all persons who had been sentenced to death since theHouse of Commons had declared itself in favour of the abolition ofthe death penalty; but he would be in great difficulty if a caseoccurred in which, under the existing law, he did not feel justifiedin advising clemency. It was important that the present uncertaintyabout the future state of the law on this subject should be determinedas soon as possible.(d) The Cabinet were informed that, from informal soundingswhich had been taken, it seemed reasonable to assume thatamong those Conservative Members who had previously supportedMr. Silverman&apos;s Bill there would be a sufficient measure of supportfor a Government Bill on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56)215 to ensure its passage through the House of Commons. It seemedlikely that most of these Members would vote in favour of such aBill and would refrain from supporting amendments designed to turnit into an abolition measure. Once such a Bill had been passed, itseemed unlikely that, if a Private Member&apos;s Bill for the completeabolition of the death penalty were presented in the same session, itwould command sufficient support to enable it to be passed into law.(e) It was to be expected that the Opposition would allege thatthe Government were under an obligation to accept the decision ofthe House of Commons and allow the Death Penalty (Abolition) Billto be passed into law under the Parliament Act. In fact, theGovernment were not committed to that course, and they would notbe guilty of any breach of faith if they brought forward a compromisemeasure on the lines now proposed. They could, however, blunt thisOpposition criticism by undertaking that, if the Death Penalty(Abolition) Bill were again introduced by a Private Member, theywould not block it or seek to secure its defeat by the use of theGovernment Whip. They could also undertake that, if this Bill wereintroduced under the ten-minute rule, time would be found for aSecond Reading debate. In either event the Bill could not comeforward before January 1957. By then, the Government measureshould have made good progress, if indeed it had not been passedinto law; and in that event it might be expected that the DeathPenalty (Abolition) Bill would, even on a free vote, be defeated.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (/) The Colonial Secretary said that the criminal law currently inforce in the United Kingdom extended automatically to five Colonialterritories. In other Colonies, however, local legislation would beneeded to adjust the criminal law to accord with that in force in theUnited Kingdom. In some of these Colonies it would not beappropriate for the local law to follow precisely the lines of the draftBill annexed to CP. (56) 215. Colonial laws would have to accordwith local circumstances. While he would have preferred that the lawrelating to capital punishment should have been the same throughoutthe United Kingdom and Colonies, he was satisfied that some localvariation was inevitable.(g) In order to avoid anticipation of the Queen&apos;s Speech, noannouncement of the Government&apos;s intention to introduce legislationon this subject should be made before the Opening of Parliament.The responsible Ministers should, in particular, avoid any disclosureof the Government&apos;s intention in the debates on this subject whichwere to take place at the Conservative Party Conference.
5CM. 67 (56)(h) Members of the Government would be expected to vote insupport of a Government measure on the lines now proposed. Onany amendment designed to convert it into a measure for the abolitionof capital punishment, they would be expected either to vote againstthe amendment or to refrain from voting.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government should introduce, in the nextsession of Parliament, a Bill to amend the law of murder onthe lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56) 215.BritishTransportCommission.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(CP. (56) 210) reporting the conclusions reached by the Committee ofMinisters which had examined under his Chairmanship the proposalsof the British Transport Commission for the rehabilitation of therailways and covering a draft White Paper announcing the Govern-ment&apos;s policy in this matter. The Cabinet also had before them anote by the Minister of Transport (CP. (56) 211) coveringa memorandum by the Transport Commission explaining theirscheme and the financial results to be expected of it.The Lord Chancellor said that the Transport Commission hadput forward a comprehensive scheme for transforming the railwaysinto a sound and profitable enterprise by modernising equipment andmethods, increasing productivity, eliminating unprofitable servicesand adopting a more flexible charging policy. As a result of thisscheme, which would take approximately fifteen years to achieve itsfull effect, the railways would begin to be profitable by about 1961and would be expected to yield a net surplus of some  50 millions ayear by 1970. The Scheme would require new capital investment ona large scale. The Ministerial Committee, having examined thescheme closely, were satisfied that the Commission had framed aconvincing plan for rehabilitating the railways and that, subject tosuitable reservations, the Government should give it general approvalin a White Paper. In the early years of reorganisation the railwayswould continue to incur deficits for which special financial provisionwould need to be made. It was proposed that this deficit should besegregated into a special account and that the Transport Commissionshould be empowered to cover both the deficit and the interest on itby borrowing. It was also proposed that they should be empoweredto capitalise to a limited extent the interest on new capital investmentuntil such time as that investment became remunerative.The Minister of Transport said that the proposed scheme was nota purely theoretical forecast; it was based on a realistic appraisal ofthe results to be expected from the further extension of newtechniques and developments in regard to productivity which werealready in operation. If it became clear in the years ahead that thescheme was failing to fulfil the expectations entertained of it, it wouldbe open to the Government to consider what alternative policy shouldbe adopted: it was not intended that the Government should actuallysponsor the present scheme or endorse it in detail.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that, although a schemeof the kind proposed must necessarily be somewhat speculative, theTreasury were satisfied that the present proposals offered a reasonableprospect of enabling the railways to pay their way. It had beennecessary to ensure that the financial arrangements for the scheme,and for covering the deficits of the earlier years, should not appear tointroduce any element of subsidy; the proposals which had beenworked out avoided this without involving any illegitimate methodsof financing a scheme of this type.50567 c
6The Cabinet (1) Authorised the publication, subject to any further draftingamendments which might be found necessary, of the draftWhite Paper annexed to C.P. (56) 210, giving generalendorsement to the British Transport Commission&apos;sscheme for the rehabilitation of the railways.(2) Authorised the Minister of Transport to put in hand thepreparation of the legislation which would be needed insupport of this scheme.5. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the results ofthe Second London Conference on the Suez Canal dispute. Theproject for the formation of a Suez Canal Users&apos; Association had metwith a somewhat mixed reception. Several of the countriesrepresented at the Conference lacked either the power or the will topay to the proposed Association the dues for transit of the Canal; andfor this reason the project for a Users&apos; Association had emerged fromthe Conference in a less effective form than had originally beenenvisaged. Even so, the Association would have some value, as ameans of continuing co-operation between the main users of theCanal, and it was proposed to proceed at once with its appointment.A further conference for this purpose would be opened in London on1st October. Its first steps would be to select an executive group ofseven countries, to appoint an Administrator and to decide where theheadquarters of the organisation should be established. The furtherdevelopment of the Association would turn largely on the futurecourse of the dispute.In this part of the discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The United States Government had now indicated that, ifdesired, they would be willing to cease paying to the new CanalAuthority transit dues in respect of ships under the United Statesflag, and to do what they could to secure that the same course wasfollowed in respect of ships owned by United States companies butsailing under Panamanian or Liberian flags. It was agreed that,subject to French concurrence, the United States Government shouldbe pressed to follow this course.(b) The Egyptian public seemed to be unaware that the newCanal Authority was now receiving less than half of the transit duesin respect of ships passing through the Suez Canal.(c) Further publicity should be given, in the Middle East, to thefact that surveys were already being made with a view to theconstruction of an oil pipeline from Iraq to Turkey.id) Few British ships had been diverted round the Cape. Sofar as British shipping was concerned, the policy was still beingfollowed of presenting as many ships as possible for transit throughthe Canal. Up to date, however, the new Canal Authority had beenable to handle the traffic without undue delay. They were meetingwith some success in recruiting non-Egyptian pilots. But underbad weather conditions, which might occur shortly, the operationof the Canal might be expected to become less efficient.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion then turned on the forthcomingproceedings in the Security Council. In this part of the discussionthe following points were raised:  (e) The Foreign Secretary said that after the end of the SecondLondon Conference the Prime Minister and he had decided thatreference to the Security Council should no longer be delayed, andthe United Kingdom and French Governments had asked that thesituation should be considered at an early meeting of the Council.(/) The Foreign Secretary said that, thereafter, the EgyptianGovernment had also asked that the Security Council should considerSuez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)
7 CM. 67 (56)the matter on the basis that the military measures taken by the UnitedKingdom and France constituted a threat to peace. In his judgment,it would be unwise to dispute, on procedural grounds, the inscriptionof this Egyptian request on the Council&apos;s Agenda: it would be betterto allow both items to be inscribed on the Agenda and to meet theEgyptian case with arguments of substance rather than of procedure.(g) The Cabinet were informed of the terms of the resolutionwhich it was proposed to put forward in the Security Council. Thiswould reaffirm the right of free navigation through the Suez Canal;would call on Egypt to restore to the users of the Canal their rightsunder the Convention of 1888; would endorse the declaration ofprinciples made by the representatives of eighteen Powers at theFirst London Conference; and would call on the EgyptianGovernment to accept a settlement in accordance with thoseprinciples and meanwhile to co-operate with the Suez Canal Users&apos;Association. Steps were being taken to secure the support of theUnited States and French Governments for a resolution in theseterms. There was reason to hope that a resolution on theselines would be carried in the Security Council by a majority of ninevotes to two. On some of the amendments which were likely to bemoved, however, it would be difficult to secure so large a majority.There would, in particular, be strong support for amendments callingfor negotiation in some form. It was important that, before themeeting began, agreement should be reached with the FrenchGovernment on the form of negotiation which would be mostacceptable.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion then turned on the discussions withFrench Ministers which were to be held during the forthcoming visitof the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to Paris.The Prime Minister said that the two Governments could readilyagree to stand firm on the principle that control over the Suez Canalcould not be allowed to pass into the hands of a single Government,and that means must be found of establishing an internationalsystem   which   would   provide   adequate   guarantees   for freenavigation through the Canal in the future.    He hoped that theFrench Ministers could also be persuaded that it would not bepossible to reject at the Security Council all suggestions for furthernegotiation between the parties to the dispute, and that agreementcould be reached with them on the least objectionable form whichsuch a negotiation might take.  He expected, however, to be pressedby French Ministers to undertake that, if the proceedings at theSecurity Council were inconclusive, immediate recourse would behad to force.  On this point it was agreed, after discussion, that theFrench Ministers should be urged to accept a statement to the effectthat, if it became clear that the United Nations were powerless toenforce respect for international obligations, we should not be contentto stand aside and see them flouted; that in the last resort it mightbecome our duty to take whatever steps were necessary, includingforce, to ensure that such obligations would be respected; and thaiwe were resolved, and prepared, to discharge that duty if need arose.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the arrangements proposed for establishingthe Suez Canal Users&apos; Association.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider, in consultation withthe Foreign Office, how publicity could best be given, inEgypt and elsewhere in the Middle East, to the pointsnoted in (b) and (c) above.(3) Agreed that no attempt should be made to contest, onprocedural grounds, the inscription on the SecurityCouncil&apos;s Agenda of Egypt&apos;s request that the Councilshould consider the Suez Canal dispute.
8(4) Approved the terms of the resolution which it was proposedto put forward at the Security Council on behalf of theGovernments of the United Kingdom and France.(5) Approved the general line which the Prime Minister wasproposing to take in his forthcoming discussions withFrench Ministers in Paris.Anglo-FrenchRelations.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet were informed that, in pursuance of thesuggestion made at their meeting on 18th September, considerationhad now been given to the possible scope for some form of closerassociation between the United Kingdom and France in political,military and economic matters. A study of the various possibilitieshad been carried out by officials of the Departments most directlyconcerned, and the results of this study had been considered by asmall group of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Lord PrivvSeal. The broad conclusion had emerged that there would be noadvantage to this country at the present time in accepting any formof organic association with France alone; and that the best way ofmeeting the initiative which French Ministers had taken in thismatter would be to turn it in the direction of a wider associationbetween all the countries of Western Europe.The Cabinet considered a draft statement on this question,designed for incorporation in the communique which would be issuedat the end of the discussions which the Prime Minister and the ForeignSecretary were to have in their forthcoming visit to Paris. Thisreaffirmed the identity of aim and community of interest of the Frenchand British peoples; recalled the action taken by both countries sincethe war to strengthen political, military and economic co-operationbetween the countries of Europe; and expressed the intention of thetwo Governments to continue in this course and to study the furtherforms which this co-operation might take with a view to concertingjoint policies within the Western European Union and through otheragencies. It also stressed the importance of the work which wasbeing undertaken in the Organisation for European EconomicCo-operation (O.E.E.C.) to consider possible methods of associationbetween the six Brussels Powers and the other members of O.E.E.C.,and expressed the determination of the two Governments to ensurethat constructive results should flow from these initiatives.The Cabinet-Approved this draft statement on Anglo-French co-operation and agreed that, subject to the concurrence ofFrench Ministers, it might be included in the communiqueto be issued at the end of the forthcoming talks in Paris.Malta.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 51stConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (56) 205) covering and endorsing a note by theChiefs of Staff on the strategic importance of Malta.The advice tendered by the Chiefs of Staff was that the loss offacilities in Egypt and the Levant had enhanced the strategic valueof Malta, which was likely to increase rather than decrease in theforeseeable future. Although other bases were available in theMediterranean, at Gibraltar and in Cyprus and Libya, there was nosingle base which was capable of meeting all the requirements ofthe three Services. Our tenure in Libya was uncertain and theinfluence which could be exerted from Gibraltar over the MiddleEast as a whole was limited. In view of the extent to which Britishstrategic interests still centred on the Mediterranean it was stillimportant that Malta should be retained as a maritime base.The Cabinet-Took note of the report annexed to CP. (56) 205.
9CM. 67 (56)Oversea 8.   The Prime Minister said that he continued to be dissatisfiedBroadcasting, with the conduct of the oversea services of the British Broadcasting(Previous Corporation, and he considered that the whole basis of the existingReference: arrangements should be reviewed.  He proposed that the Lord PrivyCM. (56) 47th Seal should undertake such a review.Conclusions,Minute 1.) The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Committee ofMinisters under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal toreview the present arrangements for oversea broadcasting.House ofLords.Reform.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 55thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the LordPresident&apos;s proposals for reform of the House of Lords.The Lord President recalled that, in their earlier discussion, someof his colleagues had expressed misgivings about the proposal thatthe hereditary element in a reformed House of Lords should bechosen by a Selection Committee composed of Members of the Houseitself. Certain alternative courses had been suggested as a means ofmeeting the objections which were likely to be raised to this proposal.He had carefully considered these various alternatives, with theassistance of a committee of officials, but in his opinion the argumentswere conclusively against adopting any of them. If this view wereaccepted, there were two questions for decision: whether to proceedwith the reform of the House of Lords in the forthcoming session,or to defer the matter for a further period; and whether to proceedwith the shorter or the longer of the two Bills which the Cabinet hadpreviously considered. On the first of these questions, he was stillof the opinion that reform was urgently needed and should not awaita further Parliament. On the second, he would, for the personalreasons which he had already expressed to his colleagues, find itdifficult to associate himself with the more limited measure of reform.There remained the question of allowances for Peers. He wasready to recommend to the House of Lords proposals which theChancellor of the Exchequer had put to him for the payment of adaily expense allowance to Peers attending the House. No date hadyet been agreed for such an allowance to come into effect. The needfor some allowances for Peers had now become at least as urgent asthe need for reform. He would now be prepared to have bothmatters dealt with simultaneously, although he would prefer that ascheme of expense allowances should, if possible, be put intooperation before any proposals for reform were put into effect.The Cabinet first considered whether, in view of the prospect ofdifficult and contentious legislation on capital punishment and rentrestriction, it would be practicable to proceed with proposals for thereform of the House of Lords in the forthcoming session. Theaddition of House of Lords reform might make it necessary to defermuch departmental legislation. If proposals for reform were notcarried through until late in the lifetime of the present Parliamentthere was a risk that the subject would cause controversy in thefollowing General Election. But might it not be possible safely todefer action until the session of 1957-58? The Lord Privy Sea!undertook to give further consideration to this question inconnection with the preparation of the legislative programme andThe Queen&apos;s Speech for the forthcoming session.In a brief discussion of the relative advantages of the morecomprehensive and the more limited schemes of reform differingviews were expressed.It was argued, as regards the comprehensive scheme, that noproposals would be acceptable to public opinion which involved thepermanent retention of 200 hereditary Peers in the Legislature.
10While public opinion might continue to acquiesce in the existence ofthe House of Lords in its present traditional form, any proposal toperpetuate hereditary Peers in Parliament by election from amongtheir number would be interpreted as serving to strengthen thehereditary principle and would arouse all the latent hostility tohereditary right. The proposal to confine reform to the power tocreate life Peers was more in harmony with a period in which it washeld that merit rather than birth was the right qualification for officeand responsibility. Furthermore, the more comprehensive measurewould compel the Opposition to define and declare their policy inregard to a second chamber and total abolition would be certain tobe their aim.On the other hand the view was strongly expressed that aConservative Government would be ill-advised to come out infavour of the abolition of the hereditary principle in the House ofLords. It was also argued that it would be mistaken to put forwarda scheme of reform which made no provision for eliminating theinfluence of &quot; backwoodsmen &quot; on the work of the upper House.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a latermeeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th September, 1956.
