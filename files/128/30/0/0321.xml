Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 96thConclusions,Minute 1.)Prisoners ofwar.Casualties.3 CM. 97 (56)1. The Minister of Defence said that the Commander-in-Chiefof the Anglo-French force in Port Said had in his custody 250 Egyptianprisoners of war and was being asked, in addition, to take over fromthe French some fifty Egyptian naval prisoners now in Jibuti. Heproposed to transfer these prisoners of war to the Commander of theUnited Nations force, who would presumably repatriate themforthwith. It was for consideration whether these prisoners shouldbe handed over until we had some guarantee that the contractors&apos;employees in the Canal Zone Base would be repatriated at the sametime.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to arrange that Egyptian prisoners ofwar would be surrendered only against a guarantee ofrepatriation for all the employees of the War Officecontractors.The Minister of Defence said that the head of the NorwegianRed Cross had now declined to conduct an independent investigationinto the number of civilian casualties resulting from the Anglo-French military operation against Egypt. It was urgentlynecessary to find some alternative means of conducting such anenquiry before the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force from PortSaid. If this were not done, we should have no convincing answerto the tendentious accounts which the Egyptian Government wouldpublish as soon as the Anglo-French force had left Egypt.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the difficulty ofarranging for an enquiry to be carried out in the time now availableby an individual of international standing (e.g., a representativechosen from the Secretariat of the United Nations) it might bepreferable to have an enquiry made by some independent Britishsubject of standing. It was agreed that, in the limited time nowremaining, the latter course might be wiser. The individual chosenfor this task should be invited to arrange for the Commander-in-Chiefof the Allied Force and the Commander of the United Nations Forceto be kept closely in touch with his investigation.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to ascertain whether Sir EdwinHerbert would be willing to undertake an enquiry into thecasualties resulting from the Anglo-French militaryoperation against Egypt.Clearance ofthe Canal.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had been greatlyconcerned to learn that the agreement with the United Nations,whereby British equipment would be used to expedite the clearanceof the Canal, did not apparently extend to the employment of Britishnaval crews. He saw no great difficulty in putting the crews ofH.M. ships into civilian clothes, if this would suffice to meet therequirements of the United Nations; but he could not contemplatethe transfer of British naval vessels to United Nations commandwithout their crews, and if there was no possibility of compromise onthis point he could see no alternative to withdrawing our ships as wellas their crews. He would himself be visiting the Eastern Mediter-ranean during the next week, and it was for consideration whether heshould not take that opportunity to make this point clear to GeneralWheeler, who had been placed in command of the United Nationssalvage operation.In discussion it was suggested that we should seek to reachagreement with General Wheeler on an arrangement which wouldpermit the employment of British naval crews for the clearance of51077 2 b 2
4the remainder of the Suez Canal. This approach to General Wheelershould be made initially by negotiation between the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Force, the Commander of the United NationsForce and General Wheeler.The Cabinet (3) Endorsed the view that H.M. ships should not be transferred,without their crews, to the command of the UnitedNations for the purpose of clearing the Suez Canal.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence to instruct the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Force to seek agreement with theCommander of the United Nations Force and GeneralWheeler on the employment of British naval crews for thispurpose.Commonwealth jfie Secretary of State for War said that he had received a reportCemetery at that the Egyptians had desecrated the Commonwealth cemetery atSuez- Suez, which they were using for the purpose of a car park.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to request the Governmentof Switzerland, as the Protecting Power, to address aprotest to the Egyptian Government against the desecra-tion of the Commonwealth cemetery at Suez.Middle East. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the next monthly paymentJordan. of  800,000 to Jordan under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty would shortlyfall due. The Government of Jordan had not yet abrogated theTreaty; they had merely proposed that negotiations should begin forits termination. These negotiations might, however, result in a newTreaty. In these circumstances it would be unwise to take any stepwhich might prejudice the forthcoming discussions or compel theGovernment of Jordan to turn to the Soviet Union for financialassistance. He therefore proposed that the next instalment of subsidyshould be paid. He recommended, however, that we should for thetime being hold up our answer to the request of the Government ofJordan for a development loan of  250,000 for the building of roads.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Itwas, however, suggested that the military value of agreements suchas the Anglo-Jordan Treaty had been shown to be less than we hadhoped and could be expected to decline still further in future. Thewhole of our policy in the Middle East should now be urgentlyre-examined; and it might well emerge from such a review that itwould be wiser henceforward to rely on financial subventions to theArab countries rather than on the maintenance of bases in theirterritories.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the next monthly instalment of subsidy under theAnglo-Jordan Treaty should be paid when it fell due, tothe amount of  800,000.(2) Agreed that no action should be taken for the time being onthe request from the Government of Jordan for adevelopment loan of  250,000 for the building of roads.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to circulate memoranda on thepending negotiations about the Anglo-Jordan Treaty, andon our future policy in the Middle East generally^including the redeployment of our forces in that area.
5CM. 97 (56)The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of developments, itwould be desirable to accede to the request of the Government of theLebanon for the supply of twenty Charioteer tanks. The book valueof these tanks was admittedly considerable, but they were surplus toour own requirements and there was a strong case, on merits, formaking them available to the Lebanon. Our action might be quotedby the Soviet Union as a precedent which justified their own actionin supplying arms to Syria. But they would continue to make armsavailable to Syria in any event; and, as we were ourselves anxious tobe able to maintain the supply of arms to Iraq, it was in our interestto interpret the United Nations resolution, which enjoined membercountries to refrain from introducing military goods into the area ofhostilities, as applying only to Egypt and Israel.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that twenty Charioteer tanks should be madeavailable to the Government of the Lebanon.The Foreign Secretary said that the Ruler of Bahrain hadrecently arrested, on a charge of treason, five members of the NationalLiberation Committee. He had now asked Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for help in detaining these prisoners in safe custody.The Colonial Secretary suggested that it might be possible toaccommodate these prisoners in St. Helena.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Colonial Secretary to investigate urgently thepossibility of accommodating in St. Helena the fiveprisoners for whom the Ruler of Bahrain wished toprovide safe custody.Arms for theLebanon.UnitedKingdomForces inGermany.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 46thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (56) 269) discussing the tactics to bepursued at the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council onthe level of United Kingdom forces to be maintained in Germany.The Minister of Defence said that our land forces in Germanyconsisted at present of four Divisions (two Infantry and twoArmoured) and a Brigade in Berlin; and their cost in Deutschmarkswas about  56 millions a year. The Second Tactical Air Forceconsisted at present of 466 aircraft and cost about  12 millions a yearin Deutschmarks. It was clear that we should find it impossible tosupport indefinitely the burden of forces of this size, coupled with aconstantly growing expenditure on their equipment. He hadascertained, by informal discussions with the military authorities inN.A.T.O., that some reduction in the size of our contribution toN.A.T.O. forces would be acceptable from the point of view ofmilitary efficiency; and his own view was that a reduction of 25 percent, of present Deutschmark costs which would reduce our landforces to two Divisions and an Armoured Brigade Group (in additionto the Berlin Brigade) and the Second Tactical Air Force to266 aircraft would be defensible in terms of strategic planning. Amore drastic cut such as would result from a decision to reduceDeutschmark costs by 50 per cent., would inflict severe damage on thebalance and composition of N.A.T.O. forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was content to seekno further reduction in Deutschmark costs during the remainder ofthe current financial year. But, in the light of the growing realisationthat the country could not afford to sustain indefinitely defenceexpenditure of the order of  1,500 millions a year, we must certainlyendeavour to reduce the Deutschmark costs by at least 50 per cent, hiBahrain.
the next financial year. We might overcome the difficulty ofreconciling a reduction of this order with our commitment under theParis Agreements to maintain four Divisions and the Second TacticalAir Force in Europe if we emphasised that there was a growingtendency, for military reasons, to reduce the size of a standardDivision and that we could, therefore, continue to honour ourcommitment if we maintained four Divisions of reduced size.In discussion the view was expressed that we should seek tosecure a rather greater reduction in the Deutschmark costs, even to#the extent of eliminating them entirely. On the other hand, it wouldbe unwise to give the United States any grounds for supposing thatwe did not intend to continue to make a fully effective contribution toN.A.T.O. The United States Government were probablydisillusioned about the ability of the United Nations to maintainpeace, and were likely henceforward to extend their interest inN.A.T.O. as the best means of ensuring political stability in WesternEurope. We should give them the maximum support we could inthis purpose. It would be difficult to invoke directly the provision inthe Pans Agreements, whereby we were entitled to invite N.A.T.O.to review the financial conditions on which our formations weremaintained in Europe if the maintenance of those formations threwtoo great a strain on our external finances. Nevertheless, ourapproach to the subject in the forthcoming meeting of the MinisterialCouncil of N.A.T.O. should be based primarily on the strain to whichour balance of payments was at present subject; and a reduction inthe number of the troops which we maintained in Europe should benegotiated separately, by reference to those purely militaryconsiderations which, as the Minister of Defence had alreadyascertained informally, might be accepted by N.A.T.O as adequatejustification for this purpose.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the ForeignSecretary and the Minister of Defence to be guided, at theforthcoming meeting of the Ministerial Council of N.A.T.O.,by the points made in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th December, 1956.
