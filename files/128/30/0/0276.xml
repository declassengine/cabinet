OnMinute 6) &apos;    the otner hand, tank production at the Royal Ordnance Factory,Dalmuir, might have to be closed down in September unless therewas by then a good prospect of a firm order from Germany. Inthese circumstances it was agreed that the Minister of Supply shouldsee the German Ambassador in London and impress on him theurgency of securing an early decision regarding the supply ofCenturion tanks to the German Army.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Supply to take this matter up withthe German Ambassador in London on the lines agreed intheir discussion.2. The suggestion was made that, in the course of the debateon foreign affairs which was now proceeding in the House ofCommons, the Foreign Secretary might make some reference to theGovernment&apos;s determination to further the economic developmentof the countries which were members of the Bagdad Pact. Now thatthe Government had withdrawn their offer of assistance towardsthe construction of the Aswan Dam, it would be timely to stress theirreadiness to give assistance to friendly countries in the Middle East.The Opposition were likely to take the line that all assistance tounder-developed countries should be channelled through the UnitedNations: it was important that the Government should retain fullfreedom to give aid, on a bilateral basis, to their Allies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was about topropose the appointment of a Ministerial Committee to weigh thecompeting claims on our limited resources for economic aid tocountries overseas. Meanwhile, he was content that it should be saidthat such resources as we could make available would be appliedfor the benefit of countries which were in alliance with us and werenot seeking to place an excessive strain on their economy; and itmight be added that we should, in particular, consider what furtherhelp we could give in developing the economic side of the BagdadPact. In this our help could most conveniently be given in the formof technical assistance.The Cabinet Agreed that the Foreign Secretary, in the debate on foreignaffairs in the House of Commons that afternoon, shouldrefer in the terms suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer to the possibility of further technical assistancefor under-developed countries which were members of theBagdad Pact.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReference:C-M. (56) 40thinclusions,Minute 14.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (56) 177) covering the report of a Committee ofMinisters on the long-term assurances and guarantees to be given tofarmers. They also had before them a further memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 181) recommending that, inview of the need for a comprehensive re-examination of ourcommercial policy, the Government should avoid committing them-selves too deeply in regard to long-term assurances in the currentdiscussions with the farmers&apos; representatives.50251 1b 2Bagdad Pact.
4The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government werenow confronted with the problem of finding a basis on which toreconcile a highly subsidised system of home agriculture with anexport trade with countries overseas whose trade with us dependedon our providing a market for their agricultural products. Theywere also confronted with the need to appraise the relativeimportance of Commonwealth trade, in view of the initiative takenby Australia, and of our trade with Europe, in view of the proposalsfor a common market in Europe. The attitude adopted towardseither Commonwealth or European trade would have a close bearingon agricultural policy and the assurances which could be offered tothe farmers. It was desirable that at least provisional conclusions onthese three problems should be reached before the CommonwealthFinance Ministers met in Washington late in September. He there-fore proposed that during August the Economic Policy Committee,appropriately constituted, should carry out a comprehensiveexamination of our commercial policy with a view to submittingpreliminary conclusions to the Cabinet early in September.In the meantime he recommended that the forthcoming talkswith the farmers should concentrate, during the initial stages, on thediscussion of a long-term basis for minimum price guarantees forindividual commodities and a scheme of grants for capital improve-ments, and that the question of undertakings relating to the total valueof support for agriculture should be mentioned only in general terms.In particular, he was anxious to avoid taking any step which mightfurther prejudice the Government&apos;s freedom in regard to wheat.The Minister of Agriculture said that, although the Governmentwere fully committed to exploring the question of long-termassurances with the farmers&apos; representatives and must show readinessto make some progress in this, no difficulty would arise in following,during the initial stages, the line which the Chancellor of theExchequer had proposed. He had therefore amended the instructions(Appendix 2 to CP. (56) 177) to the officials who would be conductingthe talks: these now referred in entirely non-committal terms to thepossible methods of devising an undertaking which related to thetotal value of support for agriculture. It was to be hoped that, afterthe first round of discussion, the farmers&apos; representatives wouldthemselves put forward proposals on this subject.The Minister said that he was also concerned about the creditfacilities available to farmers. He had had it in mind to propose anindependent enquiry into this, but he recognised that this might beinappropriate at a time when the Government were seeking to imposegeneral restrictions on credit. The forthcoming discussions with thefarmers&apos; representatives would provide a convenient opportunity forexploring this question initially, and he might bring it before theCabinet again in the autumn.In discussion the point was made that while, for the reasons putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, there should be somedelay in formulating a comprehensive scheme of long-term guaranteesfor farmers, the settlement of this problem could not be postponedindefinitely. The farmers had come to regard a system of long-termguarantees as the most satisfactory means of affording support foragriculture and they would lose confidence in the Government sintentions if progress towards this were unduly delayed.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequerthat the Economic Policy Committee should carry  uurgently a comprehensive review of commercial policy-(2) Endorsed the proposals in CP. (56) 181 for handling thequestion of long-term assurances for agriculture in tne,first stages of the forthcoming talks with the farmersrepresentatives, and approved the instructions to official
5CM. 52 (56)set out in Appendix 2 of CP. (56) 177 as revised by theMinister of Agriculture.(3) Took note that the question of credit facilities for farmerswould also be considered during these talks.4. The Cabinet were informed that Ministers had succeeded insecuring, with some difficulty, their immediate and limited objectivesin the first stage of the trade talks with the Australian Prime Ministerand the Minister of Trade (Mr. McEwen) which had been completedin the previous week. A public statement, based on the draft whichthe Cabinet had considered at their previous meeting, had beenadopted for issue on 3rd August, when Mr. McEwen was due to leaveEurope. A Committee of Ministers, supported by an inter-depart-mental committee of officials, had been set up to prepare for thefurther discussions which were to take place, possibly betweenofficials, in September. The official committee were devotingthemselves, in the first instance, to the further examination of themethods which might be employed to give Australia the assurancesshe sought in regard to wheat, and it was hoped that privatediscussion of this problem with the milling industry would be openedin the following week.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Oxford Roads. 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHousing and Local Government (CP. (56) 185) on the variousproposals for the construction of new roads to relieve trafficcongestion in the centre of Oxford.The Minister of Housing, after summarising the earlier historyof this controversy, said that the time had now come when he mustgive a positive lead towards a settlement of the problem. At anearlier stage he had himself suggested to the City authorities that theyshould devise alternative routes for inner relief roads which mightescape some of the objections raised to the original proposal for aroad across Christ Church Meadow; but it was now clear that thealternative plan which they had put forward was even moreobjectionable to the University authorities than the original proposal.There was no doubt that the beauty of Oxford was marred by theincreasing congestion of traffic through the University area, and thatremedial action was urgently required. After much considerationhe had come to the conclusion that the right course was to constructa relief road across the north side of Christ Church Meadow andthereafter to close Magdalen&apos; Bridge to wheeled traffic.In discussion it was suggested that, before this drastic step wastaken, time might be allowed to complete the outer ring of by-passroads round Oxford and to develop the provision of shops andcinemas in Cowley. The first of these expedients would divert muchof the through traffic now passing through Oxford. The secondwould reduce the need for Cowlev residents to visit the centre of theCity.In reply it was argued that it would be some years before theouter roads could be completed. Even then, the problem of the localtraffic would remain. Even when more shops and cinemas had beenbuilt in Cowley, there would still be a substantial traffic from Cowleyinto Oxford, e.g., to the more popular shops and to the railwaystation. It would scarcely be feasible to shut Cowley residents offfrom Oxford by closing Magdalen Bridge. It was too much to hopethat the two communities could now be transformed, by artificialAustralia.Trade Talks.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)
6means, into separate towns. If, however, a single relief road werebuilt across Christ Church Meadow it would be justifiable to closeMagdalen Bridge to wheeled traffic and thus to secure relativetranquillity for the main part of the University precinct. Theconstruction of this road across the northern end of the Meadowwould involve much less loss of amenity than the original proposalto build it nearer the Isis. Plans were also under consideration forcontinuing this road into Beaumont Street instead of allowing it toend in a round-about at the top of Broad Stret.After a prolonged discussion the Cabinet decided that urgentaction ought now to be taken to relieve traffic congestion in the centreof Oxford and agreed, with regret, that of the various alternativecourses the least objectionable was that of constructing a relief roadacross the northern end of Christ Church Meadow.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto inform the Oxford City Council that, in his opinion andthat of the Minister of Transport, the best means of relievingtraffic congestion in the centre of Oxford was to build aroad across the northern end of Christ Church Meadow onthe understanding that, once this road was opened,Magdalen Bridge would be closed to wheeled traffic.LocalGovernmentReorganisation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The. Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHousing and Local Government (CP. (56) 176) covering the draft ofa White Paper on Local Government Organisation in England andWales.The Minister of Housing said that it had been announced inThe Queen&apos;s Speech at the beginning of the session that the Govern-ment were considering the question of local government organisationwith a view to introducing legislation on this subject. It was nowover a year since the discussions with the local authority associa-tions, the outcome of which was reflected in the proposals in the draftWhite Paper, and he was being constantly pressed in Parliament tostate when the Government&apos;s views on the matter would be, madeknown. The Government would be open to criticism, both at theannual conferences of the local authority associations in Septemberand at the Conservative Party Conference, if the White Paper hadnot been published before the recess. The draft had been approvedby a Committee of Ministers under the Chairmanship of the LordPrivy Seal. As, however, serious difficulties were now being encoun-tered in the parallel review of local government finance, it would benecessary to modify the paragraphs in the present draft which referredto finance. Subject to this, he sought the Cabinet&apos;s authority topresent the White Paper before Parliament rose for the recess.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) It was already clear that no time could be found in the nextsession of Parliament for legislation on local government organisation.From the Parliamentary point of view, therefore, it would be moreconvenient if the publication of the White Paper could be postponed.On the other hand, the Government&apos;s views had been long awaitedand the substantial measure of agreement which had been reachedwith the local authority associations would not endure if publicationwere deferred.(b) In view of the difficulties which could be foreseen in regardto local government finance, it would be preferable that the WhitePaper should contain no passage on this subject. The title of thedraft should be amended to show that the White Paper was concernedonly with local government organisation in terms of the boundaries
7CM. 52 (56)and status of local government units and it should be made clear ina note that local government finance would be treated separately.Subject to the approval of the Lord Privy Seal, the question of localgovernment functions, on which agreement had not yet been reached,might be treated similarly.(c) It was agreed that paragraph 53 of the draft should beamended to give an assurance that, in cases of reorganisation affectingnon-county boroughs, &quot; provision should be made, whereverpossible &quot; for the identity and perhaps certain of the dignities of theborough to be preserved in the new unit.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion andto the approval of the Lord Privy Seal on the point recordedin paragraph (b) above, the draft White Paper annexed toCP. (56) 176; and, subject to any views expressed by theLord Privy Seal, authorised the Minister of Housing andLocal Government to present it to Parliament before thebeginning of the summer recess.Economic 7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofStatistics.        the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (C.P. (56) 183)covering the draft of a Parliamentary statement on economicstatistics.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had foreshadowedin his Budget Speech his intention to make arrangements to extendthe range and volume of economic statistics available to the Govern-ment. Although, with the full co-operation of industry, a numberof important improvements had been made in recent years, furtherinformation was still necessary to provide the Government with up-to-date knowledge of changes in the economic situation. The main newproposal was that the distributive and service trades should berequired, under powers provided by the Statistics of Trade Act, 1947,to furnish information of movements in stocks and investment.Steps would also be taken to improve the information available inregard to industrial development, the current trend of profits,international transactions and personal incomes. The President ofthe Board of Trade was arranging to discuss these proposals duringthe next few days with the industries concerned, including thoseaffected by the use of compulsory powers, and he sought the authorityof the Cabinet to make an announcement in Parliament in thefollowing week.The Cabinet were in agreement with this proposal.The Minister of Works said that he had conveyed to theChancellor of the Exchequer suggestions for improving, especially inregard to contracts, the statistics which were available regarding thebuilding industry.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make anannouncement in Parliament in the following week on thelines of the draft annexed to C.P. (56) 183.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,24th July, 1956.
