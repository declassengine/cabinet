3CM. 22 (56)Export ofArms.India.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 9thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Defence (CP. (56) 79)reporting further developments in the negotiations for the supply ofCanberra aircraft to the Indian Air Force.The Indian Government had asked for a further 20 fully-equipped Canberra bombers to be delivered by the middle of 1957 inaddition to the 63 Canberras which had already been offered. If thisrequest were met, there would be delays in deliveries of Canberras tothe Royal Air Force and in the build-up of the Canberra force inSecond Tactical Air Force. The firm would have to buy back9 aircraft from the Royal Air Force, with the result that one of theexisting Canberra squadrons in Bomber Command would be closeddown. For some months in 1957 the Royal Air Force would be shortof the special navigational equipment, which would affect theoperational efficiency of the Canberra force, and there would be noreserve of the special bomber sight for the &quot; V &quot; bombers. Deliveriesof these equipments to Australia would also be delayed. Finally, thesupply of these Canberras to India would preclude any early deliveriesof these aircraft to Pakistan, should a request be made, and a possibleorder from Venezuela for Canberra B.8 aircraft would also beprejudiced.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, despite the concessionswhich we had already made, there were indications that the IndianGovernment were still thinking of purchasing some Russian IL.28bombers. The issue, therefore, was whether in the circumstancesthe considerable sacrifices involved in meeting the latest Indianrequest were justified.There was general agreement that, if the Indian Governmentcould thereby be prevented from buying Russian aircraft, theconsequences of meeting the Indian request for Canberra bomberson the lines proposed in CP. (56) 79 would be acceptable. It nowseemed unlikely that there would be any order for Canberras fromVenezuela. There should not be undue difficulty with the PakistanGovernment over the supply of Canberras to India, in spite of thefact that the Pakistan Air Force at present had no modern bombers;for Pakistan was satisfied with her position as a member of theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation and the Bagdad Pact and anybomber requirements which she might put forward could probablybe met from the United States. The Australian Government shouldalso be ready to accept the delay in the deliveries of navigational andbombing equipment to them. The main difficulty would be to obtainfrom the Indian Government any firm assurance that they wouldfollow a consistent policy of equipping their Air Force with Britishaircraft and would not buy aircraft from Russia at any time in thefuture. Such an assurance might seem to the Indians to beinconsistent with their policy of non-alignment. They might also beinfluenced by a fear that the Western Powers would be unreliablesources of supply in the event of war with Pakistan. In puttingforward the proposed maximum offer, we should therefore makeplain to the Indian Government the nature and extent of the sacrificesinvolved in meeting their latest request for Canberra bombers andshould seek the most explicit assurance we could obtain that theIndian Government intended to base the equipment of their Air Forceon the pattern of the Royal Air Force. If they were not preparedto give a satisfactory assurance on this point, they should be told thatthere was no justification for giving the Indian Air Force priorityover the requirements of the Royal Air Force and other overseascustomers.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The production line for Canberras in Northern Ireland hadbeen closed down. Any expansion of production to meet the Indianorder would have to take place at the English Electric factory inEngland.49919 2 B 2
4(b) If the delivery dates required by the Indians were to be met,the English Electric Company would need to start ordering materialsat once.(c) Although Mr. Nehru had said that, if Russian aircraft werebought, Russian technicians would not be allowed to stay in Indiafor more than a fortnight, a much longer period would in fact beneeded to enable the Indian Air Force to learn to operate thebombers. The continued presence of Russian technicians in Indiawould raise security problems.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, with reference toparagraph 7 (b) of CP. (56) 79, that the question of any increase inthe Air Estimates in future years on account of the delay in theprovision of Canberras for the Royal Air Force could only besettled when firm Estimates for the particular year were beingconsidered.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the point noted in paragraph (d) above,the proposals in CP. (56) 79 for meeting the latest requestfrom the Indian Government for Canberra aircraft.(2) Agreed that this offer should be conditional on the IndianGovernment&apos;s giving a satisfactory assurance of theirintention to equip the Indian Air Force on the same linesas the Royal Air Force.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Defence, to prepare a communication tothe Indian Government on the lines agreed in discussionand to submit it for the Prime Minister&apos;s approval.Jordan.(PreviousReference:CM. (56)21ConclusionsMinute 1.)st2. The Prime Minister said that he and some of his colleagueshad held a further meeting with Sir Alec Kirkbride on the previousday. At this meeting final approval had been given to the termsof a personal message which Sir Alec was to deliver to King Hussein,on his return to Jordan (Foreign Office telegram to Amman No. 458).It had also been agreed that it would be inexpedient for the ForeignSecretary to visit Amman during his present tour of the Middle East;and he had been advised accordingly. A meeting between the Kingof Iraq and the King of Jordan had been arranged and would takeplace on the following day.The Prime Minister said that some further progress had alsobeen made in working out proposals on the future role of Britishofficers in Jordan. An outline plan had been drawn up for theformation of a British Military Mission with the Arab Legion, andH.M. Ambassador at Amman would put this proposal to the JordanGovernment as part of the negotiations which he had been authorisedto undertake.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statements.Israel.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) saidthat, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 9th March, it had beenascertained that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s forthcoming visit to Israelcould not follow the pattern set by the United States Secretary ofState. Since the latter&apos;s visit, the Office of the Israeli Foreign Ministerhad been transferred from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It thereforeseemed inevitable that the Foreign Secretary should call on boththe Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Israel in Jerusalem.He had been advised to issue a public statement thereafter to makeit plain that this did not imply recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s
5CM. 22 (56)capital. The Government of Israel were being warned that sucha statement would be made.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.Broadcasting.The FortnightRule.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that he had discussed with thePostmaster-General and the Chief Whip what evidence he shouldgive to the Select Committee which was examining the operationof the rule restricting broadcasts on subjects about to be debatedin Parliament. Though he would reserve the final decision of theGovernment on this question, he thought he should make someconstructive suggestion to the Select Committee. He was disposedto suggest that the prohibition should in future extend from the dayon which the business was first announced in Parliament until theday after it had been debated there.In discussion it was pointed out that this suggestion wouldinvolve something less than a 7-day rule. In respect of businessannounced on a Thursday for debate early in the following week,the prohibition would extend for only 4 or 5 days. Might there notbe occasions on which it would be desirable to restrict for a longerperiod broadcasts on matters which were to be the subject offorthcoming Parliamentary debate?The Lord Privy Seal said that this point would be partly metif his proposal were made to apply, not merely to business announcedon a Thursday for the following week, but also to any other businesswhich might be announced for debate on some more distant date.The fact was that it was unpractical to define this restriction in termsof a stated number of days, without regard to the extent of publicknowledge about the nature of forthcoming Parliamentary business.The only workable method was to relate the rule to Governmentbusiness which had already been announced.The Cabinet Approved the line which the Lord Privy Seal proposed totake in evidence before the Select Committee which wasconsidering the operation of the rule restricting broadcastson subjects about to be debated in Parliament.Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Lord Privy Seal said that he had taken soundings withthe Executive of the 1922 Committee about the possibility ofimproving the remuneration of Members of Parliament. Theythought that there might now be a sufficient measure of agreementamong Government supporters in the House of Commons to enablethe Government to make progress with a plan for dealingsimultaneously with sessional allowances of members of the Houseof Commons, salaries of junior Ministers and expense allowances forPeers. Their attitude would turn largely on the prospects of securinga rapid settlement of these three problems: what they most wishedto avoid was prolonged discussion, and wrangling between theParties, on these matters.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the possibility of taking early action todeal simultaneously with sessional allowances of Membersof the House of Commons, salaries of junior Ministers andexpense allowances for Peers.
6Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 19thConclusions,Minute 2.)Broadcastsfrom Athens.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 19thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet approved the terms of a Government motionto be tabled as a basis for the forthcoming debate on Cyprus inthe House of Commons on 14th March.The Prime Minister said that he had been considering asuggestion that the Turkish Government might now make somepublic statement on the breakdown in the discussions withArchbishop Makarios. He had at first thought it would be unwiseto encourage this. On reflection, however, he was now inclined tothink that it would be helpful if the Turkish Government wouldsay publicly that in their view the United Kingdom Governmenthad gone to the extreme limit of concession in their negotiationswith the Archbishop.In discussion it was suggested that the Turkish Governmentmight also be willing to add that it was plain, from the course ofthe negotiations, that the Archbishop&apos;s object had been to sethimself up as the sole authority with whom the future ofconstitutional development in Cyprus should be discussed.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor a message to be sent to H.M. Ambassador at Ankara inthe sense proposed by the Prime Minister and the Ministerof State.*The Colonial Secretary said that he had so far refrained fromacting on the authority given to him by the Cabinet on 6th Marchto arrange for short-wave transmissions of subversive broadcaststo Cyprus to be jammed from Malta. There was some doubtwhether a complete assurance could be given that jamming fromMalta would involve no interference with the reception of otherradio programmes outside Cyprus. His main reason was, however,that the Governor, on being consulted, took the view that the PrimeMinister of Malta should be told what was proposed before anyaction was taken. It seemed probable that Mr. Mintoff, who wasnow in London, would make this the occasion for putting forwardsome further constitutional demand. In these circumstances hewould himself prefer that any action to supplement jamming fromCyprus should be undertaken in the United Kingdom rather thanin Malta.The Prime Minister said that on reflection he also agreed thatit was undesirable that these operations should be undertaken fromMalta.The Postmaster-General said that, of the various alternativesopen, the preferable course on technical grounds was to carry outthe bulk of the jamming from Cyprus but to supplement this fromthe United Kingdom. Action from here would involve the provisionof additional aerials, which might take about one week, and possiblysome diversion of commercial radio services. It might, however,be possible to make use of Service channels for this purpose. Hesuggested that a single technical expert should be entrusted with thetask of studying the problem as a whole and making an effectiveplan. This last suggestion was approved in principle, on the under-standing that effective arrangements would be made for Ministerialsupervision of the political aspects of the problem.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Postmaster-Generalto discuss, with representatives of the Service Departments,plans for supplementing from the United Kingdom thejamming which was now being undertaken in Cyprus ofsubversive broadcasts from Athens to Cyprus.* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.
7CM. 22 (56)BritishTransportCommission.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 19thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 74) reporting the views ofthe Economic Policy Committee on the suggestion that increases inrailway charges should be postponed for six months.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the strict applicationof the Government&apos;s present economic policies would requireapproval of the full increases proposed by the British TransportCommission, totalling  37 millions a year. Any departure from thisorthodox line would have to be justified by the argument that itwould provide an incentive for the achievement of economies throughmore efficient working and better relations in the industry. It wouldnot be possible to justify on those grounds a decision to make noincrease at all in railway charges at the present time. The EconomicPolicy Committee had therefore considered two alternativepossibilities. The first would be to allow the Commission to makethe increases in passenger fares which had already been authorised,or could be made without further application to the TransportTribunal, but to defer all other increases for a period of six months.This would increase the revenue of the Commission by  7   7 millionsin a full year. The second would be to allow the Commission, inaddition to the increases in passenger fares, to make half theirproposed increases for freight charges while still postponing theincreases for season tickets and early morning fares. This arrange-ment would also be subject to review after six months and wouldbring in about  24-3 millions in a full year. The Committeeconsidered that the gap between the Commission&apos;s proposals and thefirst alternative was still too large to be covered by any possibleeconomies and had therefore come to the conclusion that the secondalternative was preferable. This arrangement would provide theCommission and the Unions with a realistic goal in planning forimproved efficiency, particularly as the Commission&apos;s new freightcharges scheme should come into operation later in the year.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The reduction of the Commission&apos;s proposals for freightincreases from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent, might not greatly affect thenet increase in revenue, since with the higher increase in freightcharges there would have been a greater loss in traffic.(h) A 5 per cent, increase in freight charges would add aboutone-sixth of 1 per cent, to manufacturing costs in this country. Fromthe point of view of industry it would be preferable to make thisincrease now, rather than to defer it for six months, since it wouldbe readily apparent that a further increase in freight charges was nowrequired.(c) It was essential to improve efficiency and workingarrangements on the railways in view of the substantial programmeof capital expenditure proposed for the next 10 to 15 years.id) The increase of  24 3 millions proposed in the secondalternative was almost exactly equivalent to the amount of the recentincrease in the Commission&apos;s wage bill. In public announcementsabout the increases in the railway charges it should be made clearthat the Commission&apos;s full request for increased revenue had notbeen met because the Government were looking to the Commissionand the Unions to meet some of the increased costs by improvedefficiency.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the British Transport Commission should beauthorised to make the increases in passenger fares whichhad already been authorised or could be made withoutfurther application to the Transport Tribunal, and halftheir proposed increases in freight charges, but to
8postpone for six months the proposed increases for seasontickets and early morning fares.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the BritishTransport Commission of the decision recorded inConclusion (1) above and, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to make an announcement Min Parliament about the increased railway charges on the Wgeneral lines which had been indicated in the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion.NationalisedIndustries.CapitalFinance.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 75) proposing changes in thearrangements for meeting the capital requirements of the nationalisedindustries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, under presentarrangements, the nationalised industries, except the National CoalBoard, borrowed from the banks and subsequently funded their debtby issues of stock. It was proposed that in future they should meettheir capital needs by borrowing from the Exchequer.  If this wereapproved, a provision for this purpose would be included in thenext Finance Bill. This change would not in itself reduce the burdenon the economy of the capital requirements of the nationalisedindustries, for the sums needed would still have to be raised; and atfirst sight it might appear a retrogressive step to increase the rangeof liabilities for which the Exchequer assumed direct responsibility.It would also be seen to be contrary to the recommendation of theHerbert Committee on the Electricity Supply Industry, which hadconsidered that the industry should be required to borrow on themarket on the strength of its own credit. But such a recommendationcould not at present be carried out in respect of any of the nationalisedindustries.  The public boards were unable to raise loans on theirown credit; their issues of stock had therefore to be guaranteed bythe Treasury; and, to the extent that these issues were not fullytaken up, they were financed by Treasury Bills.  By either method offinancing, the capital requirements of the public boards added tothe floating debt.  But the public boards, when they had exhaustedthe credit available from the banks, were at present forced to haverecourse to the market at times which were frequently unfavourableand, as these issues were financed ultimately by Treasury Bills, thefloating debt tended to elude control. The proposed new arrangementwould not merely restore a greater measure of control over thefloating debt but might pave the way for the funding on a medium-term basis of some of the borrowings of the public boards.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The change proposed would cause some disquiet amongGovernment supporters who were anxious that the policy should beadopted of requiring the nationalised industries to borrow on theirown credit and had welcomed the recommendation of the HerbertCommittee to this effect. Moreover, the proposed new method offinancing could be expected to lead to an increased deficit &quot; belowthe line &quot; in the Budget. The interpretation which might be given tothis in financial circles abroad might prove damaging to sterling.For these reasons the new powers to be taken should be limited to thecapital requirements of the public boards for a period of perhaps twoyears. It would be undesirable to take permanent powers for sucha purpose.(b) There would be criticism of the apparent inconsistencybetween the treatment accorded to the nationalised industries and tothe local authorities, who had recently been required to go to the
9CM. 22 (56)market for their capital requirements. The two were not, however,strictly comparable. The local authorities needed capital in smallerand more manageable amounts and they could in fact borrow on thesecurity of their rateable value. Moreover, the smaller localauthorities still had recourse to the Exchequer through the PublicWoiks Loans Board.(c) The public were not generally aware of the extent to whichinvestment in the nationalised industries had been based onGovernment credit. In order to avoid damage to public credit, careshould be taken to link the announcement of this decision with thedetermination of the Government to encourage saving in order tofinance investment.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a)and (c) above, the proposals put forward by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in C.P. (56) 75.Malta.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 12.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ColonialSecretary (C.P. (56) 76) reporting the conclusions reached by theColonial Policy Committee in their further examination of the reportof the Round Table Conference on Malta.The Colonial Secretary said that he now recommended that thissubject should be debated by the Parliament at Westminster beforethe Easter recess. The debate should be held on a Governmentmotion accepting the main recommendations of the report andmaking particular reference to safeguards for Roman Catholicinterests in Malta. A draft motion on these lines was set out inAnnex B of C.P. (56) 76. If this recommendation were approved,a brief factual White Paper would be issued for the assistance ofMembers in the debate; and the Prime Minister of Malta, who wasnow in London, would be informed of the course of policy whichthe Government proposed to pursue. If in this debate the Parliamentat Westminster endorsed the main recommendations of the RoundTable Conference, two further steps would need to be taken beforethey could be brought into operation. First, some accommodationmust be reached between the Maltese Government and the RomanCatholic Church in Malta. Secondly, the Maltese people must begiven a further opportunity, at a general election, to make a clearand unmistakable declaration in favour of the recommendations ofthe Conference. If the Cabinet approved this suggested programmeof action, the Lord Chancellor and he would, in the first instance,attend a meeting of the 1922 Committee for the purpose of explainingthe Government&apos;s attitude towards the report of the Conference andthe action they proposed to take to give effect to it.Discussion showed that some Ministers doubted whetherGovernment supporters in the House of Commons could bepersuaded to support a programme of action on these lines. It wasdoubtful whether there had ever been a majority of Governmentsupporters in favour of the principle of Maltese representation atWestminster; and it was probable that in recent weeks opinion hadhardened against this principle. The Conservative Party were notyet ready to give whole-hearted support to a motion in the termsproposed by the Colonial Secretary in Annex B of C.P. (56) 76. If itwas necessary that they should vote in favour of such a motion, moretime would be needed to prepare the way for it. It was also arguablethat further progress should be made in Malta itself before the49919 2c
10Parliament at Westminster were asked to record a definite vote infavour of the principle of integration. It would at least be reasonablethat, before this was done, further efforts should have been made tofind an accommodation between the Maltese Government and theRoman Catholic Church in Malta.On the other hand it was represented that, if there were a furthersubstantial delay, the position in Malta would get out of hand.Feeling between the political parties in Malta was very bitter, andthe situation was already deteriorating. It would be mostunfortunate if the Prime Minister became so much discouraged as toabandon his support of the findings of the Round Table Conferenceand to revive his earlier suggestions that Malta should become anindependent State in treaty relation with the United Kingdom. TheMaltese Government now attached less relative importance to theeconomic recommendations of the Conference: the constitutionalrecommendations had become for them a matter of prestige. TheUnited Kingdom Government would be assuming a graveresponsibility if, at a time when nationalist parties in various parts ofthe Colonial Empire were trying to break the British connection, theyrejected an offer of closer association with this country made by anIsland which had voluntarily joined us in the Napoleonic war andhad stood loyally by us in both the world wars of the twentiethcentury.In further discussion it was recognised that, in view of the stateof opinion among Government supporters in the House of Commons,it would not yet be practicable to hold a debate on a Governmentmotion in the terms of the draft set out in Annex B of CP. (56) 76.There were, however, alternatives which might be adopted. TheGovernment could arrange for a debate to be held without tablingany motion; the Colonial Secretary could state his provisional viewon the recommendations in the report, without finally committing theGovernment. If the reaction of the House of Commons had beengenerally favourable, the Government might then proceed with theremaining steps proposed in CP. (56) 76. Alternatively they could,after an interval of two or three days, make a formal announcementin Parliament of the decision which they had taken in the light of thedebate; and this, if challenged, could be put to a division. Or, again,the debate might be held on a Government motion to the -generaleffect that the House &quot; encouraged Her Majesty&apos;s Government toproceed with measures to implement the recommendations of thereport of the Round Table Conference, subject to the House beingsatisfied that to do so would be in accordance with the clear andunmistakable wishes of the Maltese people.&quot; If this last course werefollowed, it might be preferable to avoid the words &quot; clear andunmistakable wishes of the Maltese people,&quot; which had been usedin the report of the Conference in reference to the results of thereferendum. It would not be the Government&apos;s purpose to suggestthat a second referendum should be held, but rather that the finalviews of the Maltese people should be ascertained by a generalelection.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Colonial Secretary, to prepare in thelight of their discussion the draft of a Government motionon the basis of which the House of Commons coulddebate, before the Easter recess, the report of the RoundTable Conference on Malta.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at theirmeeting on 15th March.(3) Iavited the Lord Chancellor and the Colonial Secretary tomake arrangements which would enable them to discussthis matter informally with the 1922 Committee on theevening of 15th March.
11CM. 22 (56)China.ParliamentaryDelegation.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (56) 65) discussingwhether the United Kingdom should accept an invitation, receivedfrom the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs, for a Parliamentarydelegation from this country to pay a visit to China.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs recommended, for thereasons indicated in his memorandum, that this invitation should bedeclined, on the grounds of the practical difficulties involved.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs toadvise the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker to decline thisinvitation on the basis suggested in paragraph 7of CP. (56) 65.Hong Kong.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 3.)ChineseNationalistAircraft.11. The Prime Minister recalled that the Defence Committeeand the Colonial Policy Committee had on various occasionsconsidered what action should be taken in respect of a ChineseNationalist aircraft which had been chased by Chinese Communistsand had taken refuge in Hong Kong. It had finally been agreed, afterthe pilot and the aircraft had been detained in Hong Kong for morethan six weeks, that both should be allowed to return to Formosa on the understanding that it would be publicly stated that, if in futureHong Kong&apos;s facilities were again abused in this way, the Hong KongGovernment would hold themselves free to take whatever action theydeemed necessary to deal with such abuses. In the event, however,the pilot had declined to fly the aircraft from Hong Kong to Formosa.Arrangements had now been made for him to travel to Formosa byship. The Governor of Hong Kong proposed that the aircraft shouldalso be returned by sea to Formosa.The Prime Minister said that he was doubtful whether it wasnecessary that special steps should be taken to return this aircraft tothe Nationalist authorities. This would certainly give offence to theCommunists. Would it not be possible to leave the aircraft where itwas on the airfield?The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor would prefer tobe finally rid of this embarrassment. It was his proposal that theBritish authorities should do no more than dismantle the aircraft andhave it crated. The Nationalist authorities would be left to make allthe arrangements for its transport to Formosa and to defray the cost.The Cabinet Took note that the pilot of this Chinese Nationalist aircrafthad now left Hong Kong, and agreed that the Governormight be authorised to make arrangements, as he proposed,for returning the aircraft to the Nationalist authorities inFormosa.Farm Price 12.   The Minister of Agriculture said that it was now clear thatReview. an agreed settlement of the current review of farm prices could not bereached unless the Government were prepared to concede an increaseof %\d. a gallon in the guaranteed price for milk and an increase of305. in the subsidy for calves. There were, however, degrees ofdisagreement. If the Government were prepared to give guaranteestotalling some  25i millions, the National Farmers&apos; Union hadintimated that they would be ready to indicate publicly that, in view49919 2 D .(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 21stConclusions,Minute 2.)
12of the present economic situation, there had been no disagreement onthe aggregate figure and disagreement only on its composition. Hehimself thought that a settlement on this basis would be welcomed byGovernment supporters, who were specially concerned with theinterests of the small farmer. There was, for example, a case forwaiving, at an estimated cost of about  1-6 millions, the nominal cutof 6d. in the pig subsidy, especially as substantial cuts in this subsidyhad been made in each of the two previous years. He would then lay vgreater emphasis in the White Paper on the need for increasedefficiency in pig farming and would include a warning that the presentlevel of subsidy could not continue indefinitely.The Cabinet saw no grounds for making, in respect of milk, pigsor eggs, any further adjustments in the guaranteed prices whichwould not be justified on economic grounds. Discussion turned onthe question whether the Government should insist on a settlementon the basis of the aggregate figure of  24 millions which they hadpreviously approved or whether they should raise the total to 25| millions made up, not in the manner proposed by the farmers,but by additions which the Government could justify on economicgrounds.Some Ministers still considered that a settlement of  24 millionsshould be imposed. There would be advantage in setting theprecedent of resisting this final attempt to secure a marginal improve-ment in the Government&apos;s offer. Other Ministers feared that theremight be some decline in agricultural production in the forthcomingyear and this would not be in the national interest in presentcircumstances. Taking into account the fact that the farmers&apos;representatives had opened the negotiations with proposals amountingto  41 millions, the Government would be imposing a settlement forall practical purposes at a figure of  25  millions. It was agreed,therefore, that the negotiations should be concluded on this basis butthat the increase in the calf subsidy should be confined to bull calves.Some further assistance, within a figure of  25  millions, might alsobe given in respect of silage pits.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Agriculture, subject to theconditions agreed in their discussion, to conclude thecurrent review of farm prices on the basis of a settlement of 25^ millions.AdenProtectorate.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 4.)13. The Cabinet were informed that, at a meeting on theprevious day, the Colonial Policy Committee had discussed a proposalby the Colonial Secretary that the Governor of Aden should beauthorised to open collective discussions with the Rulers of thevarious States in the Protectorate with a view to promoting constitu-tional development in the direction of a Federation or Federations.The Committee had agreed on the terms in which the possibility offederation should be broached to the Rulers, if any approach to themwas to be made. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs had,however, argued that no suggestion should be made at the presenttime of constitutional development in the Protectorate. He fearedthat such a move would give offence to the Yemen and to SaudiArabia, and might cause those countries to increase their efforts tostir up trouble in the Protectorate. In view of the many problemswhich were engaging our attention in other parts of the Middle East,it would be a mistake to take any step which might precipitate furthertrouble. The Colonial Secretary, on the other hand, thought thatthis step, far from increasing the risk of trouble, might have the effect

Both the Yemen and Saudi Arabia were alreadytrying to detach States in the Protectorate from the British allegiance,and the plan for federation was designed to encourage the States toresist those advances. The Governor had already had somepreliminary talks with the Sultan of Lahej, and was due to hold aconference with all the Rulers on 17th March. If this meeting werenow postponed at the last moment, we should give an impression ofindecision which our enemies would be quick to exploit. The othermembers of the Committee had supported the Colonial Secretary&apos;sview.The Prime Minister said that this matter had been reported tohim because of the failure to reach agreement at the Colonial PolicyCommittee. On balance he favoured the view taken by the majorityof the Committee.The Cabinet accepted this view.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to authorise the Governorof Aden to open discussions with the local Rulers on futureconstitutional development in the Protectorate, on the basisapproved by the Colonial Policy Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,13th March, 1956.
