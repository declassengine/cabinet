3 CM. 1 (56)The Cabinet. I.   The Prime Minister said that, at this first meeting of theCabinet following the recent Ministerial changes, he wishedparticularly to extend a welcome to those of his colleagues who werejoining the Cabinet for the first time.Sale of Surplus 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of his discussionsWar Materials,  on the previous day with the Leader of the Labour Opposition aboutthe shipment of surplus war materials to the Middle East. TheOpposition had not questioned the Government&apos;s policy of main-taining a balance in the supply of arms to Israel and the adjacentArab States. The main issue was the control of surplus war materialswhich might be purchased by private dealers. Licences were requiredfor the export of such surplus stores, and requests for licencesamounted to several thousand a week.   There had been difficultyin controlling the ultimate destination of these stores once they hadleft this country.   It had been made clear in the statements issuedto the Press that the issue of export licences had been suspended assoon as the Government became aware that some of the surpluswar material was being re-exported to undesirable destinations, andlicences were now only issued if the foreign Government concernedaccepted responsibility for ensuring that any war surplus storespurchased by a dealer in that country were not re-exported in a formin which they could be used as weapons of war.   In his view theexport of surplus Valentine tanks from Belgium to Egypt which hadgiven rise to the recent publicity would in practice have little effecton the position in the Middle East, since Israel was known to haveacquired a considerable number of surplus Sherman tanks. TheOpposition had asked that Parliament should be recalled a day earlierso that there could be a debate on the question of arms suppliesbefore he and the Foreign Secretary left for America.  The questionof a general debate on foreign affairs had also been mentioned, butit would clearly be undesirable for any such debate to take placeimmediately   before   the   forthcoming   meeting   with PresidentEisenhower.  A more limited debate on arms supplies would be lessembarrassing, but it might be difficult to avoid, even in that debate,a general review of the Middle East position.  The Opposition hadalso asked for a White Paper to be issued about the sales of surpluswar materials.   The Leader of the Liberal Party had, however,informed him that he was opposed both to the recall of Parliamentand a debate on arms supplies.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that, although itwould be useful to issue a White Paper about the disposal of surpluswar materials, it would be inadvisable to have a debate on this matterbefore the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary left forWashington. It was agreed that a reply in the following terms shouldbe made to the Leader of the Labour Opposition (i) The Govern-ment proposed to issue a White Paper giving the facts of thesituation and previous practice; (ii) in view of the action which theGovernment had already taken to deal with the matter they did notthink that there was any need to ask for the recall of Parliamentat an earlier date; and (iii) the question of holding a debate couldbe further discussed through the usual channels when there had beentime to consider the White Paper.The Cabinet then discussed the scope of the White Paper andthe following points were made:  {a) The White Paper should explain the arrangements forcontrolling exports of surplus war materials generally, not only tothe Middle East, and should refer to the volume of trade involved.About  750 millions had been realised by sales of surplus warmaterials since the end of the war. The White Paper should includea table showing the value of sales of surplus equipment in each yearsince 1945.49596 12
4(b) It would be contrary to established practice to reveal detailsof Government to Government sales of arms to foreign countries.Only the sales of surplus war material should therefore be mentioned.(c) The White Paper should emphasise the steps which theGovernment had already taken to control the export and re-exportof surplus war materials. The existing licences for the export oftanks had been withdrawn and the remaining export licences alreadyissued were being reviewed.(d) In view of the large number of Departments involved in thearrangements for controlling sales of surplus war materials oneDepartment should be made responsible for co-ordinating thepreparation of the White Paper. The most suitable Departmentwould appear to be the Foreign Office and it would be desirablefor a Junior Minister to supervise the work.(e) It would be desirable to publish the White Paper beforeParliament reassembled, but in view of the time it would inevitablytake to prepare the necessary material, no undertaking about thedate of publication could be given.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was due to meet the LobbyCorrespondents that evening and he would be asked about theGovernment&apos;s reply to the requests made by the Labour Opposition.He would propose merely to refer to the recent press statements andto say that the Government did not propose to ask for the early recallof Parliament, but would be issuing a White Paper about the saleof surplus war materials.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the reply to be given to the Leaderof the Labour Opposition as recorded at (i), (ii) and (iii)above.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) to supervisethe preparation of the White Paper on the disposal ofsurplus war materials.Middle East.Supply of Arms.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 34thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that on 2nd December theDefence Committee had agreed to release to Israel three Mosquitoaircraft, six Meteor day-fighters, forty 25-pounder guns and 200half-track vehicles. Shortly after this decision had been taken,Israel had made an attack on Syria and his predecessor had decidedthat in these circumstances the release of this equipment to Israelfor the time being could not be justified. A resolution condemningIsrael&apos;s attack would come before the Security Council on 11th or12th January. It was clear that the ban on the release of thisequipment to Israel should be maintained until this resolution hadbeen debated, but the United Kingdom Representative at the UnitedNations had suggested that he should broach with the United StatesRepresentative the question of extending the embargo on thisequipment for a period of perhaps three months after the resolutionhad been passed.In discussion it was pointed out that in comparison with theUnited States the United Kingdom supplied a very limited amountof arms to Israel. It was not for us to take the initiative in suggestingsuch a continued embargo and we should be placed in an anomalousposition if the initiative were not accepted. If the Americans them-selves suggested action of this kind our Representative should reportback.
5CM. 1 (56)The Prime Minister said that in order to maintain the balanceof arms supplies to Middle East countries any further orders ofequipment for Egypt should also be delayed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the ban imposed on the supply of certain armsto Israel should be continued until the Security Councilhad considered the Resolution before them condemningIsrael&apos;s recent attack on Syria.(2) Decided that no initiative should be taken to raise with theUnited States Government the question of continuingsuch an embargo after this date, but that we should beprepared to consider the matter further if the UnitedStates were themselves to raise this question.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for such delay inthe delivery of arms to Egypt as might be necessarv tomaintain the balance between Israel and Egypt in&apos;thesupply of arms.Railways.SafetyPrecautions.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (55) 213) about recent railway accidentsand methods of improving safety on the railways.The Minister of Transport said that 25 people had been killedand 256 injured in seven recent railway accidents. During 1955 thenumber of deaths in railway accidents had been 59 compared with15 in the previous year and with yearly averages of 61 for the period1946-50 and 63 for the period 1951-54. Full technical enquirieswere being held on all the recent accidents and the findings wouldbe published; preliminary investigations had indicated that, with oneminor exception, all the accidents had been due to human errors bysignalmen or drivers. There was no quick short-term solution tothe problem of improving railway safety. The best hope lay inpressing on with the modernisation plan and in improving workingrelations throughout the railway industry. He proposed to givespecial attention to this second objective. At a meeting which hehad had on the previous day with the British Transport Commissionthe need for better co-operation between all sides of the industry hadappeared to be generally recognised. Adjustments were also requiredin the railway wages structure to give greater recognition to skill andresponsibility. The Transport Commission were aware of this need,but it would take time to achieve any substantial improvement in faceof the opposition of the railway unions. If another serious incidentshould occur it would be necessary to arrange for a full-scale externalinquiry into the working of the railways. One unfortunate result ofsuch an enquiry would be to reveal that the Transport Commissionwere not at present paying enough to recruit and retain the requirednumber of skilled men. Unless there was another serious accidenthe would not propose to make any further statement, but wouldcontinue to look for a solution through private consultations with theTransport Commission and the Unions.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be unfortunate to have to make any statementabout alterations in the railways wages structure at this time in viewof the large claims which the Unions were putting forward.49596 1 B 3
6(b) In the event of any further enquiries it should be stated thatthe Minister of Transport was in close touch with the BritishTransport Commission and the Unions on the question of methodsto ensure railway safety.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Ministerof Transport.Heroin. 5.   The Cabinet reviewed their decision to impose a ban on the(Previous manufacture of heroin in this country in the light of the advice fromReference: the Law Officers that the powers provided in the Dangerous DrugsCM. (55) 46th Act, 1951, could not properly be used for this purpose and that freshConclusions, legislation would be necessary if such a ban were to be imposed.Minute 4.) The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary(CP. (55) 206).The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The legislative programme for the current session was alreadycongested and it would not be possible to provide time for freshlegislation on this matter during the remainder of the session. Norcould there be any assurance, in view of the controversy which hadbeen aroused, that legislation could be enacted before 1st January,1957, when the manufacturing licences would fall due for renewal.It was very doubtful whether the necessary legislation could becarried through the House of Lords.(b) In the period since the Standing Medical Advisory Committee(S.M.A.C.) had advised that heroin was no longer an indispensabledrug in the treatment of illness, it had become apparent that themedical profession itself was, in fact, fundamentally divided on thequestion. It appeared, moreover, that one or two members of theS.M.A.C. would now retract the advice which they &quot;had originallygiven. These developments could not be ignored. There weregrounds for believing that general practitioners in rural areas stillconsidered heroin to be indispensable in the treatment of the finalstages of incurable cancer.(c) Heroin was manufactured in this country by two firms onlyand it would be possible, by arrangement with these firms, to restrictthe manufacture of this drug to the quantities actually required forour own medical consumption and scientific use. In addition, underthe powers provided in the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951, the exportof heroin could be banned entirely. These steps would result ina significant drop in the total quantity of heroin manufactured here.Because of the great number of countries banning the import ofheroin, licensed exports from this country were already in factinsignificant and had amounted to no more than 52 ounces in 1955.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would not be justifi-able in these circumstances to promote legislation to enforce a ban onthe manufacture of heroin. It was agreed that the Home Secretaryshould make a statement in Parliament at an appropriate opportunityto the effect that, in view of the legal advice which had been obtainedand bearing in mind the views expressed both inside and outsideParliament on the desirability of banning heroin, the Governmenthad decided that for the present they could best collaborate in theinternational effort to eliminate the abuse of this drug by restricting itsmanufacture in the United Kingdom to the quantities actually neededfor medical and scientific use in this country.
7CM. 1 (56)The Foreign Secretary said that a statement on these lines wouldcreate no embarrassment in our relations with other countriesIt was also agreed that, if such a statement were made, it wouldnot be necessary to lay a White Paper on the subject of heroin.The Cabinet H) Agreed that, for the present, powers should not be soughtthrough new legislation to impose a ban on the manufac-ture of heroin in this country, but that steps should betaken to restrict manufacture to the quantities actuallyrequired for domestic medical and scientific use.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to make a statement to this effectin the House of Commons at a suitable opportunity.Teachers&apos;Superannuation.(PreviousReferences:CM. (55) 46thConclusions,Minute 2, andCM. (55) 47thConclusionsMinute 1.)6. The Cabinet considered whether it would be justifiable, bothon merits and in order to facilitate the further progress of theTeachers&apos; (Superannuation) Bill (i) to postpone until 1st April, 1957,the date on which the teachers would first be required to pay a 6 percent, rate of contribution, and (ii) to introduce a separate scheme forpensions for widows and orphans of teachers.The Minister of Education said that, as regards the first of thesepossible courses, his hand might already have been forced by theaction of the local authorities. The teachers, who were certain as aresult of the next review by the Burnham Committee to gain a salaryaward to come into effect on 1st April, 1957, had claimed a generalinterim increase of 10 per cent, from 1st April, 1956. The localauthorities had offered an increase of 5 per cent, which the teachershad rejected. It could have been argued that by doing so the teachershad in effect deprived themselves of valid grounds for continuing toresist a 1 per cent, increase in their superannuation contribution, hadit not been that they had taken this course on the recommendation ofa representative of the local authorities, who had advised them toreject an interim salary award on the ground that acceptance mightprejudice their claim before the Burnham Committee. In thesecircumstances he felt that he might have no alternative but to giveway on the question of postponing for a year the date on which theteachers would be required to pay the higher rate of contribution.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were disposed to agree that,in spite of the evidence that a majority of Government supporterswho concerned themselves with educational matters were opposed topostponing the date on which the increased rate of contribution wouldcome into effect, there might now be no alternative but to offer thisconcession. There would be an immediate saving to the Exchequerin doing so, for the Exchequer contribution to a 5 per cent, increasein salary would be substantially greater than the receipts from a 1 percent, increase in contribution. But the concession would mean thata sum of  15- 20 millions, to be paid out over the course of years,would have to be added to the estimated deficit of  294 millionswhich the superannuation account would have accumulated bv1st April, 1956.On the second question, The Minister of Education said that theteachers had a strong case in equity for more favourable provisionfor pensions for their dependants. The cost of such a scheme wouldrequire a contribution equal to 2-2$ per cent, of a teacher&apos;s salary,to be shared equally between the teachers and the local authorities.The teachers were apparently prepared to participate in a scheme, butonly on condition that their contribution should form part of the6 per cent, superannuation contribution which was already demandedof them. The introduction of such a scheme would, however, entailwidespread repercussions in other fields, notably the Public HealthService, and these would take time to examine.
8The Chancellor of the Exchequer, endorsing this view, said thatthe practicability, cost and repercussions of such a scheme wouldrequire much further consideration. An actuarial examination ofthe matter was already in progress but this would take time tocomplete. Moreover, a pledge had been given to the local authoritiesin 1953 that their liabilities in this general field would not beincreased. It was important that, to avoid any misunderstanding, theGovernment should make it clear, whatever decision might be takenon the 6 per cent, contribution, that the question of pensions for *dependants was a complex problem on which no early decision could \be expected.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no additional provision could be made for thetime being for pensions for teachers&apos; dependants, andinvited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Education to continue their discussions on this matterand to report to the Cabinet in due course.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to consider further, inconsultation with the Prime Minister, the question ofpostponing the date on which teachers would be requiredto pay an increased rate of superannuation contributionand to report to the Cabinet.Betting,Lotteries andGaming.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Home Secretary said that, for the reasons given in hismemorandum, he considered that the time had now come to makepreparations to introduce legislation to give effect to the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission which had reported in 1951-Although there had been little active response to an approach whichhis predecessor had made to the Leaders of the Opposition Parties,there was little doubt that the recommendations of the RoyalCommission were generally acceptable to all Parties. There had beenfrom time to time, and most recently in the debate on 25th Novemberon the Second Reading of a Private Member&apos;s Bill to legalise smalllotteries and gaming parties, unfavourable comment from both sidesof the House on the Government&apos;s failure to introduce legislation togive effect to the major recommendations of the Royal Commission-The existing law on off-the-course betting could not be generallyenforced and the attempt to enforce an unpopular law divertedpolicemen from more important duties and created opportunities forcorruption in the police forces. The Chairman of the Commissionhad gone to the length of publicly criticising the Government forfailing to take action on a unanimous report. On all counts, therefore,it was desirable to bring in legislation on this subject. Thepreparations were in fact well advanced and, if the Cabinet agreed thatlegislation should be introduced as soon as possible and authorisedhim to make a statement to that effect, he did not think it would benecessary to reconstitute the Committee of Ministers which hadpreviously considered this matter.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thisproposal. It was pointed out that a Motion to call attention to thereport of the Royal Commission had been put down for debate inthe House of Lords on 8th February and that it would be desirable Jfor the Home Secretary to make a statement of the Government&apos;sintentions in the House of Commons before that date.
9CM. 1 (56)The Cabinet U) Approved the proposal in CP. (55) 204 that preparationsshould be made to introduce in the next session ofParliament legislation to give effect to the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries andGaming.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to make an announcement of theGovernment&apos;s intentions on this matter in the House ofCommons before 8th February.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4.)8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (55) 202) on capital punishment.The Home Secretary said that he had set out fully the argumentsfor and against capital punishment as it was important that theGovernment should decide on the line to be taken in the debate whichwas due to take place when Parliament reassembled. Herecommended that capital punishment should not be abolished, butthat a more extensive use should be made of the Prerogative of Mercy.If this line were to be taken, the Government should put down amotion which avoided the direct issue of abolition.The Lord Chancellor said that in his view the most importantarguments in favour of the retention of capital punishment were thosegiven in paragraphs 15, 16 and 18 of the Home Secretary&apos;s paper.Although there could be no statistical proof, the retention of the deathpenalty must have some deterrent influence. This deterrent was ofmost value in its effect on professional criminals who, if capitalpunishment were abolished, would be more likely to carry arms. Itwould also be wrong to abolish capital punishment at a time whencrimes of violence were continuing to increase. He suggested that theGovernment spokesman in the debate should therefore elaborate thearguments against abolishing the death penalty. As the motion wouldpresumably be subject to a free vote, there might well be a majorityin favour of abolition in the House of Commons. The House ofLords would, however, almost certainly reject any proposal to abolishcapital punishment. If the majority in the Commons was small, theGovernment could maintain that the balance of public opinion didnot justify steps being taken to over-rule the House of Lords. On theother hand, if there were a large majority in the Commons, theGovernment might have to accept that as evidence that public opinionwas overwhelmingly in favour of abolition.As regards the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, it would bedifficult to define with any precision, in a statement designed to satisfythe House of Commons on this point, how the different considerationswhich were taken into account might in future be accorded enhancedweight. It was already the normal practice to consider every possiblepoint in favour of a condemned man. In any event, it would beunconstitutional to attempt to analyse in this way the factors whichwere taken into account in considering the exercise of this RoyalPrerogative.In discussion it was agreed that there were strong arguments bothfor and against the abolition of capital punishment. But, althoughexperience in other countries where capital punishment had beenabolished had not shown any sudden increase in the number ofmurders, it would be intolerable if, in consequence of the abolition ofcapital punishment in this country where circumstances were different,professional criminals took to carrying firearms and the police had tobe armed. It was the opinion of the Cabinet that capital punishmentshould be retained.
10There was general agreement with the view expressed by the LordChancellor that it was both inadvisable and impracticable to attemptin the debate to make detailed references to the manner in which thePrerogative of Mercy would in future be exercised.Some doubt was expressed whether it would be possible to avoidthe direct issue of abolition in the debate since, whatever motion theGovernment put down, an amendment could be moved in favour ofabolition.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the general line to be taken by the Governmentspokesmen in the forthcoming debates on capitalpunishment should be that proposed by the LordChancellor.(2) Agreed to resume consideration of the terms of the motion forthe debate on capital punishment at a later meeting.German WarCriminals.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 28thConclusions,Minute 11.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (55) 214) recommending that steps should be taken toset up a Four-Power judicial board to review the sentences of the fiveremaining major German war criminals.The Foreign Secretary said that there were grounds for believingthat the Russians might, in order to influence German opinion, takethe initiative in suggesting that the sentences of these five criminalsshould be reconsidered. It was desirable to forestall any such moveand there were, in addition, arguments in equity which were set outin his memorandum for reviewing these cases. Although there wasstill public feeling in this country against the major German warcriminals, only Doenitz was likely to prove troublesome on release,and his sentence would in any event expire on 1st October, 1956.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out in CP. (55) 214.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,3rd January, 1956.
