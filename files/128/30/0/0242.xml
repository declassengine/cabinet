3CM. 18 (56)Cyprus. 1.   The Cabinet considered the terms of a statement which the(Previous        Colonial Secretary was proposing to make in the House of CommonsReference:      that afternoon on the results of the discussions which had been heldCM. (56) 17th over the past five months with Archbishop Makarios.Conclusions, .Minute 5.) * he Colonial Secretary said that, despite all the efforts whichhad been made to remove his suspicions, Archbishop Makarios hadfinally declined to accept the Government&apos;s statements of their policyas a basis on which he could promise his co-operation. The threeissues on which the discussions had finally broken down were:(i) the Archbishop&apos;s insistence that the proposed amnesty should beextended to cover those involved in crimes of violence against theperson or the illegal possession of arms, ammunition or explosives;(ii) his demand that, in advance of any recommendation by theConstitutional Commissioner, the principle of a Greek-Cypriotmajority should be accepted; and (hi) his unwillingness to agree thatthe timing of the transfer of responsibility for internal security shouldbe left to the discretion of the Governor. It should not be difficultto show that the attitude adopted by the Archbishop on each of thesepoints was unreasonable. Towards the end of the discussions therehad been little room for doubt that he had not wished to reach anagreement.The Prime Minister said that he fully agreed with this view.The Government were certainly entitled to the support of Westernpublic opinion for the stand which they had taken on these issues.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be important to bring it out clearly that the Govern-ment had not been opposed to an amnesty as such, but only to itsextension to persons convicted of crimes involving violence. Itwould also be desirable to explain the Government&apos;s reasons for notaccepting Archbishop Makarios&apos; demands on the two otheroutstanding issues. The Press could be given a lead on these pointsduring the Press conferences which the Colonial Secretary washolding later in the day.(b) Archbishop Makarios had stated that all the concessionsduring the discussions had been made by the Ethnarchy. Thecorrespondence to be published in the White Paper would, however,show the extent of the concessions which had been made by theUnited Kingdom.(c) There was good reason to believe that the Archbishop hadsupported the terrorist activities in Cyprus in order to promote hispolitical aims.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the statement on Cyprus which wasto be made by the Colonial Secretary in the House ofCommons that afternoon.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for a similar statementto be made in the House of Lords on 6th March.Jordan.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet reviewed the situation created by the summarydismissal of the Commandant of the Arab Legion and certain otherBritish officers of the Legion.The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee hadconsidered this question at their meeting on 2nd March. They hadagreed that he should send a personal message to the King ofJordan pointing out that this precipitate action was a severe blowto the confidence on which good relations between the two countries49812 2b 2
4were based and that, if no positive action were taken to remedy thesituation, the consequences might be disastrous for Anglo-Jordanianco-operation in the future. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government were tobe able to give Jordan their continued support, they must be in aposition to produce positive evidence of Jordan&apos;s sincere attachmentto British friendship and to the Anglo-Jordan Treaty. The minimumwhich would suffice was that, as a proof of his regard for ourfriendship and for the Treaty, the King should at once make a publicstatement confirming the remaining British officers of the ArabLegion in their posts and expressing his confidence in them. Theresponse to this message had been unsatisfactory. The statementissued on behalf of the King had gone no further than to say thatJordan respected her obligations under the Treaty, and that Britishofficers in the Arab Legion were &quot; carrying out their duties as expertsand trainers of the Legion.&quot; A statement had also been issued bythe Prime Minister of Jordan to the effect that British officers nowworking with the Arab Legion would be retained in the work andservices which they were carrying out, and that in their capacity asofficers in the service of the King of Jordan they &quot;enjoyed the sameconfidence and trust which their fellow-officers enjoyed.&quot; Thesestatements were quite inadequate to restore public confidence in thegood faith and friendship of the King and Government of Jordan.Two questions therefore confronted the Cabinet the future ofBritish officers serving with the Arab Legion, and the wider questionof our future relations with Jordan. Of these the first was the moreimmediate, and a statement would have to be made on it in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.In discussion it was agreed that British officers holding executivecommands in the Arab Legion could not be expected to continue inpositions of responsibility without authority. The Jordan Govern-ment should therefore be asked to arrange for these officers to berelieved of their commands. Those on the Active List of the BritishArmy should be recalled to this country: the future of those servingunder contract with the Jordan Government should at once bediscussed with that Government. Other British officers in the Legion,who were not holding executive commands, had been told to continueto carry out their duties pending further instructions. The Cabinetagreed that a statement to the foregoing effect might hold the positionfor the time being. They recognised that any statement foreshadow-ing a more comprehensive withdrawal of British officers from Jordanmight have the effect of imperilling the safety of their dependants inJordan.On the wider issues of our future relations with Jordan, theCabinet agreed that more time was needed for reflection before anypublic statement was made. H.M. Ambassador at Amman hadsuggested, in his telegram No. 335 of 4th March, that the actiontaken against General Glubb might have been directed only againsthim personally, and that the manner of his dismissal might have beendue to the awe in which he had come to be held in Jordan. Onthat hypothesis it was not necessary to assume that this action wasintended as a blow against British influence in Jordan generally andthat the whole basis for mutual confidence and friendship betweenthe United Kingdom and Jordan had been destroyed. On the otherhand, it was difficult to see how British officers could now maintaineffective control over the Arab Legion. Without that control, theLegion was likely to disintegrate; and, without the Legion, Jordanwould eventually pass under the domination of neighbouring ArabStates. We should be powerless to prevent that development: themost that we could hope would be to delay it. In these circumstancesit might be better that such military and financial resources as wecould devote to the support of our interests in the Middle Eastshould be applied in strengthening our positions elsewhere -in Iraqand in the Persian Gulf.   In this connection the Prime Minister
5CM. 18 (56)informed the Cabinet of a personal message which he had sent toPresident Eisenhower suggesting that this was the moment to givefurther support to the Bagdad Pact and emphasising, once again, theadvantages of United States adherence to that pact.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statementin the House of Commons that afternoon about theposition of British officers in the Arab Legion on the linesagreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to instructH.M. Ambassador at Amman to make a formal requestto the Jordan Government that all British officers holdingexecutive commands in the Arab Legion should at oncebe relieved of their commands, and that those of themwho were on the Active List of the British Army shouldbe given facilities to leave Jordan.(3) Agreed to resume, at an early meeting, their discussion ofthe effect of these events on future relations with Jordanand on the general situation in the Middle East.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,5th March, 1956.
