3CM. 65 (56)1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of thepreparations which had been made for further diplomaticconsultations in regard to the Suez Canal dispute. With theagreement of the United States and French Governments it wasproposed that the Foreign Ministers of the eighteen countries whichhad endorsed the proposals formulated at the London Conferencein August should be invited to convene again in London on19th September. The purpose of this further conference would beto hear the report of Mr. Menzies&apos; mission, to consider what actionshould be taken in the light of the Egyptian Government&apos;s rejectionof the London proposals and, in particular, to reach agreement ona plan for the operation of the Suez Canal by an association of usercountries. The proposals for negotiations contained in the EgyptianGovernment&apos;s memorandum of 10th September would also be beforethe conference. This conference would be preceded by a tripartitemeeting of the United Kingdom, United States and French ForeignMinisters on 18th September.The Cabinet-Approved the arrangements which the Foreign Secretaryhad outlined for further diplomatic consultations on theSuez Canal dispute.Commercial 2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of commercial policyPolicy. and had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of the(Previous        Exchequer (CP. (56) 208) covering a summary memorandum ofReference:      proposals known as &quot;Plan G &quot; for the association of the UnitedCM. (56) 57th Kingdom with a new free trade area which might eventually embraceConclusions,    the majority of countries in Western Europe.  They also had beforeMinute 7.)      them a memorandum by the Commonwealth Secretary (CP. (56) 207)reviewing the implications of such a policy for the future of theCommonwealth connection. The Cabinet were invited, at that stage,to agree that an initial attempt should be made to ascertain thereactions of Commonwealth countries to a plan of this nature atthe forthcoming meeting of Finance Ministers in Washington. Thematter would then be submitted to the Cabinet in October forfurther consideration in the light of the attitude taken by otherCommonwealth Governments.The President of the Board of Trade said that it had been theaim of our commercial policy to secure the advantages of liberaltrade practices in the world at large while retaining the benefit of thepreferences system within the Commonwealth. This policy was nowunder pressure and we could no longer expect to continue to enjoythe best of both worlds. Australia had taken the initiative in seekinga review of the preferences system and New Zealand would followher lead. In Europe, there was little doubt that the efforts of France,Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries to form a customs unionwould achieve at least partial success, although they might fail toattain their ultimate objective. We might soon be confronted inEurope by a powerful discriminatory economic bloc, dominated byGermany and developing into a formidable base for Germancompetition in our markets overseas. There was no prospect of ourbeing able to pursue our traditional policies undisturbed and theproposals in Plan G had been devised to turn the developments inEurope to the advantage of the United Kingdom and of theCommonwealth as a whole.The proposed free trade area would be based on the progressiveremoval over a ten-year period of all tariffs (except revenue tariffs)and other trade restrictions between member countries. Theto associated countries would, however, retain their present freedom,subject to any international obligations, in regard to tariffs andrestrictions against countries outside the group, and there would beSuez Canal(PreviousReference:CM.

4safeguards for balance of payments difficulties. In entering theassociation we should make it an absolute condition that agriculturaland horticultural products were permanently excluded from the scopeof the agreement, and we should remain free to continue the systemof agricultural preferences and free entry for Commonwealthproducts.Association with Europe, on the basis proposed, would provideUnited Kingdom industry with a unified market of the size whichmodern technical developments demanded. The proposals forachieving this would place the United Kingdom for the first timein a combination equal in scale to the other two great trading unitsof the world, viz., the United States and the Soviet Union. Thisstep would reverse the trend towards the Balkanisation of marketsand the fragmentation of economic power in Europe. Moreover,at the present time but not later, we could enter such a combinationon our own terms. It must be recognised that, as a member of suchan association, United Kingdom industry would be confronted withmore intense competition from Europe in the home market. Attimes of disequilibrium the Government would need to be promptand effective in applying remedial measures. But these prospectscould not be avoided by remaining aloof from the proposedfederation; and our economy would not survive for long if ourindustries could not compete on level terms with Europe and theGovernment were not prepared to take the necessary steps to ensureequilibrium at times of stress. As British exporters could not, in anyevent, escape a competitive struggle with EuroDean industry, it wouldbe contrary to our interests to reject the advantages offered by aunified mass market.The political difficulties which the plan would present should notbe discounted, but he was satisfied that the proposals would beendorsed by leading opinion in industry and by a substantial bodyof Government supporters.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were impressed by thearguments in support of a new economic initiative on these lines,and conscious of the limited scope for an alternative policy whichwould offer the prospect of economic security in the longer term.Although a commercial policy based on the Commonwealthconnection would be much to be preferred, the conditions for sucha policy no longer existed. The preferences system was alreadycrumbling away, and there was no hope of re-invigorating it, as theUnited Kingdom market could not absorb much more of the primaryproducts of the Commonwealth. The United Kingdom had nowbecome tco small an economic unit and if we did not attach ourselvesto Europe we should be drawn inevitably, as a minor partner, intothe sphere of influence of the United States. The capacity to investwas even more important in the modern world than the ability totrade. Commonwealth countries were already being attracted to theUnited States as a source of investment capital. The economicunification of much of Western Europe would create a new sourceof investment capital for overseas development which might beexpected to flow out to Commonwealth countries through Londonunder our management. Already many of the larger developmentschemes in countries overseas could only be undertaken by firmsjoined in consortia; the creation of a free trade area would create theconditions in which European firms would have further scope for this.The danger must be foreseen, however, of a free trade area beingdominated by the Germans and if we entered into such an associationwe should do so with a determination to assume the leadership of it.This, indeed, was now our best means of ensuring our continuingstatus as a Great Power. The strengthening of the United Kingdomin this way would enhance the security and strength of theCommonwealth and the proposed free trade area would providenot only an additional market for those Commonwealth productswhich we could not absorb but a source of new funds for
5CM. 65 (56)Commonwealth development. In putting the proposals to otherCommonwealth countries the emphasis should be on these points.Politically, Europe was groping towards a new cohesion. If theeconomic basis of the plan was sound, the moment was ripe for theUnited Kingdom to assume a more vigorous leadership in Europeand, through this, to exercise an effective influence over the directionof West German policy.Nevertheless, misgivings must be entertained on many countsabout proposals which represented a unique departure in Britishpolicy. Many aspects of the proposals would need further reflectionand the Commonwealth attitude would need to be more certainly 1established. In this part of the discussion the following points weremade:  (a) Although association with a free trade area would have asalutary and, from the long-term point of view, valuable effect onthe competitive ability of United Kingdom industry, it would, in theshort term, endanger the maintenance of full employment. Thecondition of maintaining full employment within the proposed areawould be a ready mobility of labour from one country to another. Butthe full collaboration of the Trade Unions had yet to be obtained inregard to the mobility of labour from declining to expanding industrieseven in this country. The Trade Unions would be quick to see theconsequences of the plan for those industries, such as cotton andmotor-cars, which would be severely hit by competition; and itsadvantages would appear to them more nebulous. With a fixedtime-tabie for the removal of restrictions the consequences, in termsof redundancy in weak industries, would become quickly apparent.It would not therefore be an easy task for the Government to convincethe Trades Union Congress that the plan would be to their ultimateadvantage.(b) As regards agriculture, it would be a condition of the planthat we should be free to maintain present levels of home output.But our prospects of raising the levels of home output would hence-forward be circumscribed. The farming industry would resent thisand any concessions which might need to be offered to Europeanagricultural producers would have to be made at the expense ofnon-Commonwealth suppliers such as Argentina. Our entry intoa free trade area might thus seem inconsistent with the commitmentswe had undertaken in regard to the &quot; one world &quot; approach for trade.In any event, it was not yet clear whether it would on balance be toour economic advantage to relax in favour of Europe our connectionswith markets such as Argentina. Until this point could be established,judgment on the proposals should be reserved.(c) Our ability to maintain the momentum of the collectiveapproach had been frustrated by the burden of excessive imports anda reluctance to take the necessary remedial measures to restoreequilibrium. The tendency to import too much might well increaseif we entered a free trade area and, in face of German competition,it would be necessary to apply remedial measures more promptlyand vigorously than we had been prepared to do previously. TheGovernment must be satisfied that the necessary steps would in factprove practicable and would be acceptable to the nation. Indeed,the risk of excessive imports was so considerable that a mors definiteassurance would be needed on the prospects of the plan providingproportionately greater export opportunities before a final judgmentcould be formed on it.id) It had always been held that a regional system would needto be strongly protected against external pressure and free todiscriminate against countries outside the group. The plan acceptedthe need for powers to discriminate in this manner and we mightwell need to have recourse to these powers to safeguard the balanceof payments. We acted as the banker for the sterling Commonwealth,and Commonwealth countries with balances here might feel disquietat  the risks to sterling which  the proposals  might involve.
6Commonwealth countries should be informed of the powers tosafeguard the balance of payments which would be available to us,and paragraph 6 of the draft letter to Commonwealth FinanceMinisters annexed to C.P. (56) 208 should be amended accordingly.(e) It was unlikely that the plan could be carried out unless theGovernment possessed dirigiste powers over the economy to anextent which might be unacceptable to Government supporters. Theplan, in any event, would fail to attract Government supporters unlessthey could be convinced that it would strengthen the Commonwealth  and the Commonwealth connection.The Cabinet considered the probable attitude of otherCommonwealth countries towards proposals for the closer economicassociation of the United Kingdom with Europe and the followingviews were expressed:  (/) Powerful centrifugal tendencies were now at work in theCommonwealth. The association had held together because themaintenance of the Commonwealth connection had been the leadingprinciple in United Kingdom policy. There would inevitably be aweakening of Commonwealth links as Commonwealth countriesrealised that we were turning towards Europe with a view to assumingthe leadership of a different association of nations. It was essential,therefore, to be convinced of the economic benefits which wouldflow from the plan in comparison with the risk of weakening theCommonwealth connection. Our determination to maintain theCommonwealth link should be given greater emphasis in paragraph 3of the proposed letter to Commonwealth Finance Ministers.(g) There was little we could do to increase the opportunitiesfor trade with the Commonwealth. The proposals in C.P. (56) 207with regard to wheat and meat did not extend beyond our obligationsunder the Ottawa Agreements. There was little, if any, scope forgiving Commonwealth suppliers of fruit and other products furtherprotection in our market. On the other hand, the market formanufactures which Commonwealth suppliers enjoyed in the UnitedKingdom and which would be at risk under the new proposals,represented only a negligible proportion of their total market here.Against this, Commonwealth countries would foresee the loss of apotential United Kingdom market for manufactures which theymight hope to develop.(/?) The Commonwealth Secretary said that, as the UnitedKingdom turned to Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand with whom we had had the firmest bonds must be expected to turnincreasingly towards the United States. Indeed, the United States,disquieted by the formation of a regional group in Europe, wouldpossibly make efforts to attract them. If, therefore, it was decidedthat these proposals were in our economic interest, every effort mustbe made to convince Commonwealth countries that the plan, bystrengthening the United Kingdom, would strengthen them. ButCommonwealth countries would not be convinced by this argumentalone, for they would see how vulnerable under the plan our balanceof payments would be in the short term. The status of the UnitedKingdom as a world Power depended on her position as head of theCommonwealth. In adopting an expansionist policy towards Europewe must therefore be prepared and able to pursue a correspondingpolicy towards Commonwealth trade. This would entail a positiveand far-reaching plan for trade in Commonwealth agriculturalproducts without which the support of the Commonwealth could notbe expected. Until such proposals were formulated he must reservehis position.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the arguments forand against proceeding with the plan were evenly balanced. Furthercareful reflection would be necessary before a final decision could be Zreached.   This must depend in part on the attitude taken up by
7CM. 65 (56)Commonwealth countries. Neither of the two major political partiesnow had a well-founded or coherent economic policy. This theplan would provide; but it would also involve the need for makingmore rapid and effective adjustments than we had hitherto achievedin our internal policies and, once it had been put into effect, everyeconomic ill, whether inescapable or not, would be attributed to it.Nevertheless, our economy could not be sustained indefinitely on thebasis of a protected and insulated market and the plan would openthe way to those competitive pressures which would force theeconomy to become efficient. It would be necessary to reach a finaldecision on the matter before the end of the year in order to declareour attitude towards the proposals for a European Common Marketin the discussions which were due to take place in the Organisationfor European Economic Co-operation in Paris. If we had no definiteattitude to declare, that in itself would imply our decision.The Cabinet decided to hold a further discussion of the plan ata meeting in the following week. Meanwhile they agreed in principlethat a preliminary discussion of these proposals should take place inWashington at the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth FinanceMinisters.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting in thefollowing week.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to despatch toCommonwealth Finance Ministers letters in the terms ofthe draft set out in Annex II of CP. (56) 208, subject tothe minor amendments approved in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Nth September, 1956.
