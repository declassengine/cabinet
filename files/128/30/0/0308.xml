Trend.50816 3ContentsSuez Canal.
The Cabinet reviewed the situation in the Suez Canal area. Intheir discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Prime Minister of Australia had suggested that it wouldbe useful if an official statement were issued by the United KingdomGovernment, for distribution to other members of the Commonwealthand perhaps more widely, about the extent to which Egypt hadwantonly sabotaged the Suez Canal. He had also suggested that afuller understanding of our case by other members of the Common-wealth would be advanced by a clear statement of our objectives inthe area of the Canal and the Middle East, and of the methods bywhich we proposed to try to achieve a comprehensive settlement ofthe outstanding problems of that region.(b) It was suggested that it would be an advantage if the UnitedNations force in Egypt could include some aircraft equipped forphotographic reconnaissance. This would help to bring it home topublic opinion in Egypt and the neighbouring States that they werebeing kept under surveillance. It was important that aerialreconnaissance by the Anglo-French force should be brought to anend as rapidly as possible now that the United Nations force wasbeginning to take up position in Egypt.(c) It should be made clear to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations that we were not as yet committed to a time-tablefor the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force. The ForeignSecretary, who was attending the General Assembly of the UnitedNations, had already been informed that, while we were prepared toaccept a withdrawal phased in relation to (i) the arrival of the UnitedNations force, (n) arrangements for the clearing of the Canal, and(iii) arrangements for a definitive settlement of the future of theCanal, we were not prepared to agree to a total withdrawal on thestrength of a mere assurance that, after our troops had left the Canala beginning would be made with its clearance and with thenegotiation of a definitive settlement of its future. In his reply theForeign Secretary had suggested that the choice lay between threepossible courses of action (i) That we should not accept more than token withdrawals ofour troops until the Canal had been cleared and a firm agreementhad been reached about its future administration.(ii) That we should not accept more than token withdrawals ofour troops until an agreement had been made about the clearance ofthe Canal and negotiations had been begun about its futureadministration.(iii) That we should accept withdrawal of our troops as theywere replaced by United Nations troops, provided that progress wasbeing made towards agreement about the clearance of the Canal andits future administration, and on the understanding that the UnitedNations force would remain until these two matters had beensettled.The Foreign Secretary had suggested that he should deferexploring these possibilities further with the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations until the latter had returned from his discussions withthe Egyptian Government in Cairo. There was, however, some riskthat if our minimum stipulations about the terms on which the Anglo-French force would be withdrawn were not made clear to theSecretary-General forthwith, he might commit himself in Cairo tosome arrangement with the Egyptian Government which would fallshort of those stipulations. It was agreed that the Foreign Secretaryshould be reminded of the importance which the Cabinet attached tothese considerations,id) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the attitude ofthe United States Government towards the problem of supplementingEurope&apos;s supplies of oil was still uncertain. They had asked that thisquestion should in future be handled in the Organisation forEuropean Economic Co-operation by a Committee with a SwissChairman; and they had suggested that this would be of assistance
3 CM. 84 (56)to them in reactivating the committee on emergency oil supplies inWashington. He had accepted this arrangement in the hope that itwould lead to the early resumption of work by the emergencycommittee in Washington.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would remind theForeign Secretary of the importance of ensuring that theSecretary-General of the United Nations was fully aware,during his discussions with the Egyptian Government inCairo, of the minimum conditions on which we should beprepared to withdraw the Anglo-French force from theSuez Canal.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the AlliedCommander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French forces in Egyptto be instructed that no further reconnaissance flightsshould be made over Egypt and neighbouring territoriesunless they were specifically authorised by Ministers orwere urgently necessary to safeguard the security of hisforces.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,17th November, 1956.
