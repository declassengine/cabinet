CM. 74 (56)Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 73rdConclusions,Minute 7.)*1.   The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the Suez Canalsituation.The Prime Minister recalled that, at the time of the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion on 18th October, there had been reason to believe that theissue might be brought rapidly to a head as a result of military actionby Israel against Egypt.   Later, on 23rd October, he had informedthe Cabinet that it no longer seemed likely that Israel would alonelaunch a full-scale attack against Egypt. It now appeared, however,that the Israelis were, after all, advancing their military preparationswith a view to making an attack on Egypt. They evidently felt thatthe ambitions of Colonel Nasser&apos;s Government threatened theircontinued existence as an independent State and that they could notafford to wait for others to curb his expansionist policies. TheCabinet must therefore consider the situation which was likely toarise if hostilities broke out between Israel and Egypt and must judgewhether it would necessitate Anglo-French intervention in this area.The French Government were strongly of the view that interventionwould be justified in order to limit the hostilities and that for thispurpose it would be right to launch the military operation againstEgypt which had already been mounted. Indeed, it was possible thatif we declined to join them they would take military action alone orin conjunction with Israel. In these circumstances the Prime Ministersuggested that, if Israel launched a full-scale military operationagainst Egypt, the Governments of the United Kingdom and Franceshould at once call on both parties to stop hostilities and to withdrawtheir forces to a distance of ten miles from the Canal; and that itshould at the same time be made clear that, if one or bothGovernments failed to undertake within twelve hours to comply withthese requirements, British and French forces would intervene inorder to enforce compliance. Israel might well undertake to complywith such a demand.    If Egypt also complied, Colonel Nasser&apos;sprestige would be fatally undermined.  If she failed to comply, therewould be ample justification for Anglo-French military action againstEgypt in order to safeguard the Canal. We must face the risk that weshould be accused of collusion with Israel. But this charge was liableto be brought against us in any event; for it could now be assumedthat, if an Anglo-French operation were undertaken against Egypt,we should be unable to prevent the Israelis from launching a parallelattack themselves; and it was preferable that we should be seen to beholding the balance between Israel and Egypt rather than appear tobe accepting Israeli co-operation in an attack on Egypt alone.The Foreign Secretary supported the suggestion put forward bythe Prime Minister. He believed that, unless prompt action weretaken to check Colonel Nasser&apos;s ambitions, our position would beundermined throughout the Middle East. The situation in Jordanhad already deteriorated seriously. In Syria we had reason to believethat there was Russian equipment sufficient for two divisions. InLibya a conspiracy against the existing regime was far advanced, withaid from Egypt. And in Iraq the Egyptians were doing all they couldto undermine the authority of Nuri&apos;s Government. Our influencethroughout the Middle East was gravely threatened. It was true that,from the point of view of opinion throughout the Arab States, Israel&apos;sintervention in our dispute with Egypt would be unfortunate. Butthere seemed to be little prospect of any other early opportunity forbringing this issue to a head.In discussion the following arguments were advanced in supportof the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister:  (a) Our action would be defensible in international law; forwe should be intervening to prevent interference with the free flowof traffic through the Canal, which was an international necessity.51159 7* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.b 2
4We should be entitled to use whatever force was necessary for thatpurpose, and the degree of force used could match the extent of theopposition encountered. The United States had acted in conformitywith these principles on many occasions in the last hundred years.(b) A crisis in the Middle East could not now be long delayed.Even if we decided to pursue negotiations with the Egyptians weshould still feel it necessary to maintain our military precautions inthe Eastern Mediterranean, partly in order to enable us to negotiatefrom strength, but also in order to be ready to deal with the morewidespread disorder and conflict which seemed likely to break out.If, for these reasons, force might ultimately have to be used, wouldit not be used more effectively and with more limited damage if weacted promptly now when an Anglo-French operation was alreadymounted?On the other hand, doubts were expressed on the followinggrounds:  (c) Our action would cause offence to the United States Govern-ment and might do lasting damage to Anglo-American relations.There was no prospect of securing the support or approval of theUnited States Government. If, however, it became necessary tolaunch the Anglo-French operation, they should be notified of thedecision and of the reasons which had impelled us to take it.id) In inviting the two sides to withdraw their forces to adistance of ten miles from the Canal, we should not appear to beholding the balance evenly between Israel and Egypt. For we shouldbe asking the Egyptians to withdraw still further within theirterritory, while leaving the Israel forces on Egyptian soil well inadvance of their own frontier.(e) We could be charged with failure to comply with ourobligations under the Tripartite Declaration. For Egypt had notformally released us from those obligations.(/) In seeking to separate the two belligerents we should bepurporting to undertake an international function without the specificauthority of the United Nations. If we followed the course proposed,our request to the two belligerents should immediately be notifiedto the United Nations.After further discussion, the Cabinet Agreed in principle that, in the event of an Israeli attackon Egypt, the Government should join with the FrenchGovernment in calling on the two belligerents to stophostilities and withdraw their forces to a distance of tenmiles from the Canal; and should warn both belligerentsthat, if either or both of them failed to undertake withintwelve hours to comply with these requirements, Britishand French forces would intervene in order to enforcecompliance.War Pensions.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C.P. (56) 249) and the Minister of Pensions(C.P. (56) 245) on the proposal that additional allowances should bepaid to certain classes of war pensioner.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was reluctant toaccept even a limited improvement in the War Pensions Scheme ifthere was a risk that it would lead to pressure for a correspondingimprovement of benefits under the National Insurance Scheme andthereafter to pressure for an increase in the basic rate of war pensionsOn the other hand, if a relatively small concession could be expectedto hold the position for some time, he would not press his objection.
5CM. 74 (56)The Minister of Pensions said that the two types of warpensioner whose claims were urgent were the ageing war pensionerand the very seriously disabled pensioner. He had contrived to deferaction even on these claims for some time. But it was now becomingknown that he had completed his discussions with the medicalprofession, which had been his reason for postponing a decision, andhe could not withhold an announcement much longer. The chargewhich war pensions imposed on the Exchequer was, in any event, adiminishing charge; and this provided additional justification forthe limited concessions proposed, which would only partially offsetthe natural decline in the cost of the pensions scheme as a whole.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The great body of war pensioners had found employmentmore easily after the 1939-45 war than after the 1914-18 war. Aconcession which would benefit mainly those pensioners who, byreason of age or disability, had been unable to obtain employmentwould be fair, and its limitation to these types of pensioner would bedefensible.(b) Nevertheless, an announcement of these concessionssimultaneously with the further economies in Governmentexpenditure which were about to be disclosed would be liable tobe misunderstood; and any statement of the Government&apos;sintentions towards pensioners should, if possible, be deferred for ashort time.The Cabinet-CD Endorsed in principle the proposals of the Minister ofPensions.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to consult the Cabinet ata later date on the timing of his announcement.Broadcasting:The FortmightRule.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPrivy Seal (CP. (56) 248) to which was appended the Report of theSelect Committee on Broadcasting (Anticipation of Debates).The Lord Privy Seal said that, unless the Cabinet were in favourof abolishing altogether the rule against anticipation of debate, hewould propose that the recommendations of the Select Committeeshould be accepted with the following modifications:  (i) The new rule should not apply either to Budget broadcastsor to Ministerial broadcasts.(ii) The principle that the Postmaster-General should havediscretion to vary the rule and that he should be advised by a smallpanel, appointed by the House of Commons, could be accepted;but in order to avoid any impression that the Government wereseeking to encroach upon the independence of the British Broad-casting Corporation (B.B.C.) it might be preferable that the initiativein setting in motion the machinery for the exercise of the Postmaster-General&apos;s discretion should lie with the broadcasting authoritiesthemselves.In discussion there was general agreement that some limit onanticipation of debate should, in principle, be preserved. But doubtswere expressed about the desirability of giving the Postmaster-General discretion in applying the restriction and about thepracticability of an advisory panel on the lines suggested. It wasprobable that the B.B.C. themselves would prefer to dispense with
6any arrangements of this kind, and merely to be given a new directiveon the basis of which they would exercise their own judgment inparticular cases.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed in principle the recommendations of the SelectCommittee on Broadcasting (Anticipation of Debates),subject to the exclusion from the new rule of Budgetbroadcasts and Ministerial broadcasts.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to discuss the recommendationsof the Select Committee with the leaders of the OppositionParties and to ascertain, in particular, their views on theproposal that a panel of Members of the House ofCommons should advise the Postmaster-General on anyapplication for relaxation of the new rule; and to reportto the Cabinet the result of these discussions.The Queen&apos;s 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy SealSpeeches. (C.P. (56) 250) covering a second revised draft of The Queen&apos;s SpeechOpening of on the Opening of Parliament.Parliament. jn discussion various detailed amendments of the draft Speech(Previous were suggested and adopted.  It was noted that the precise wordingReference: of the reference to the Suez Canal dispute would need to be settledCM. (56) 72nd nearer the date on which the Speech would be delivered.Conclusions,Minute 5.) The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate a further reviseddraft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament incorporating the amendments agreed in theirdiscussion.(2) Authorised the Prime Minister, in consultation with the LordPrivy Seal, to settle in due course the final text of the draftSpeech and to submit it for Her Majesty&apos;s approval.Bagdad PactOrganisation.Privileges andImmunities.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (C.P. (56) 236) seeking authority to negotiate with the othermember Governments of the Bagdad Pact Organisation, and withthe United States Government, an agreement on the privileges andimmunities to be accorded to that Organisation.It was stated in the memorandum that the Council andCommittees of the Bagdad Pact Organisation were unlikely to meetfrequently in the United Kingdom and that the extent of diplomaticprivilege and immunity in this country would not be significantlywidened by extending these privileges to the Pact Organisation. Itwas in our interest to promote the efficient functioning of theOrganisation and there would be no justification for withholdingfrom it the immunities accorded to Western European Union and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C.P. (56) 236.
7 C.M. 74 (56)Nuclear 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignWeapons Tests. Secretary and the Minister of Defence (C.P. (56) 243) setting out a(Previous proposed basis for negotiation with the Governments of the UnitedReference: States and the Soviet Union with a view to reaching internationalC.M. (56) 51st   agreement to impose some limitation on tests of nuclear weapons.Conclusions. jne Minister of Defence said that it would be necessary to ensureMinute 6.) tnat any SyStem Qf limitation which might be adopted would notrestrict our freedom to carry out the tests which were planned totake place in the following year. Nevertheless, it was true that if testscontinued to be made without regulation they would, over a period ofyears, become a danger to human life. Public opinion was disturbedat this possibility, and we should take whatever steps we could toreduce the risks. A declaration by the Governments of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union that they wouldlimit the fission yield of their tests to an agreed maximum level wouldbe a step in the right direction and would commit the Powersconcerned to the principle of limitation. It was thereforerecommended that discussions should be opened with the UnitedStates Government, as soon as possible after the Presidential Election,with a view to securing their collaboration in a joint approach to theSoviet Union with a proposal under which each of the three Powerswould undertake to limit the fission yield of test explosions to amaximum of 5 megatons a year. Such a limitation would not hamperus in carrying out the tests which we ourselves had in mind.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement that aninitiative should be taken on the lines proposed. If, however, testswere to continue indefinitely, subject only to a maximum limit offission yield of 15 megatons for the three Powers combined, radio-active fall-out would have reached dangerous proportions within thenext generation. An agreement which imposed no greater limitationon radio-active fall-out would be thought to be of little value. Amaximum limit in the region of 12 megatons a year would be moresatisfactory; and, as there seemed little need for the United Kingdomto seek exact parity in this matter with the United States and theSoviet Union, the proportions of 4:4: 3 might offer the prospect of anagreement which would achieve a more stringent limitation on radio-active fall-out of 11 megatons a year.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defenceto consider whether the proposals in C.P. (56) 243 could berevised on the lines suggested in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,and to report to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,25th October, 1956.
