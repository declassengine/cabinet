3CM. 50 (56)1. The Cabinet were informed that the proposal to exportland-rover vehicles from the United Kingdom to China had beenconsidered by the Co-ordinating Committee in Paris during theprevious week. The United States representatives had opposed it:the Canadians and the Japanese had expressed no view on it: allthe other members of the Committee had supported it, and it wasevident that many of them would regard it as a precedent which theywould feel free to invoke to justify the development of their owntrade with China. Negotiations with the firm concerned had nowbeen in progress for six weeks and there was a serious risk that if afirst order covering 151 vehicles were not approved by 19th Julyit would be lost, and that the prospects of completing the negotiationsfor an additional 200 vehicles and of securing further orderssubsequently would be jeopardised. On the other hand, the grantof a licence for the export of these vehicles would be criticised inthe United States Congress and, if it were announced before Congressrose at the end of July, might have serious effects on our relationswith the United States.In discussion it was recognised that, in view of the currentunemployment in the motor industry, it would be difficult to justifya refusal to authorise the export of some of these vehicles to China.Although this item still figured formally on the quantitative restrictionlist for Soviet countries, it had been decided some months previouslythat the members of the Co-ordinating Committee should be freeto supply these vehicles in quantities they thought reasonable tocountries in the Soviet bloc, on the condition that they reported theiractions to the Committee subsequently. It had already been madeclear to the United States Government that we were not at presentproposing to extend our trade with China beyond those items whichcould freely be supplied to Soviet countries, and it was unlikely thatthe further reiteration of this intention would weigh with them. Butthe initial order for 151 land-rovers was substantially less than thetotal order for 350 vehicles of which the United States Governmenthad been informed and, in view of our important long-term interestin the Chinese market for agricultural vehicles, there would be abalance of advantage in authorising the supply of this firstconsignment. This would be more easily represented as a trialorder, in order to meet the susceptibilities of United States opinion,if in further negotiation the number could be reduced to perhaps80 or 100 vehicles.Separate negotiations which were also in progress for the supplyof 50 tractors had not yet reached an advanced stage. It was agreedthat the firm concerned should be informed that the Governmentwould examine favourably the possibility of licensing the supply ofthese tractors but that no decision could be taken for some weeks.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an export licence should be given to the RoverCompany for the supply to China of an initial order ofnot more than 151, and preferably of some smallernumber of, land-rover vehicles.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedStates Government to be informed of this decision.2. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment were likely to share our view that the offer of financial aidfor the building of the High Dam at Aswan should now be withdrawn.He would circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet on the means ofpresenting such a decision to the Egyptian Government. It wouldprobably be best to indicate to the Egyptians that, in view oftheir commitments for expenditure on armaments and militaryinstallations, the two Governments had been forced to the conclusion50234 1 B 2East/WestTrade.China.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)0Egypt.High Dam atAswan.(PreviousReference:        CM. (56) 37th&quot; Conclusions,Minute 8.)
4that the financing of the Dam, even with the assistance which hadbeen proposed, would be beyond Egypt&apos;s resources. This mightwell lead to a deterioration in our relations with Egypt with possiblyserious consequences for our trade.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Legislative 3.   The Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the contentProgramme: of the legislative programme for the 1956-57 session. They had1956-57 Session, before them the following memoranda:  C.P. (56) 162: by the Lord Privy Seal, reporting the results ofa review, made by the Future Legislation Committee, ofthe legislation which might be included in the programmefor the forthcoming session.C.P. (56) 164: by the Minister of Fuel and Power, on the needfor legislation to reorganise the electricity industry.C.P. (56) 163: by the Home Secretary, on the Betting andGaming Bill.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The shape of the legislative programme for the forthcomingsession would depend to some extent on the question whether theCabinet decided to proceed with the reform of the House of Lords.On the other hand, the scheme of reform which was now incontemplation was likely to occupy less legislative time than hadpreviously been assumed.(b) As a result of developments which had taken place sincethe circulation of C.P. (56) 162, some changes would need to be madein the two lists of Bills annexed thereto. Thus, the Bill on Police Payshould now be transferred from List B to List A, and a Bill onCapital Punishment should be added to List A.(c) The Bills included in List A were already too numerous.As time went on it was likely that other Bills, which could not nowbe foreseen, would have to be added to the programme. There,were,therefore, strong grounds for considering whether some of the majorBills listed in paragraph 6 of C.P. (56) 162 should not be postponeduntil a later session.(d) The Home Secretary said that, if he had to choose betweenthem, he would prefer to postpone the Betting and Gaming Billand to proceed with the Shops (Closing Hours) Bill.(e) The Minister of Housing said that he hoped that the Cabinetwould decide to adhere to their earlier decision that the RentRestriction Bill should be introduced early in the forthcoming session.The Cabinet agreed that, if this legislation was to be enacted duringthe present Parliament, it was advisable that it should be introducedearly in the 1956-57 session.(/) The Minister of Housing said that he was now doubtfulwhether it would be possible to proceed in the forthcoming sessionwith legislation on the reorganisation of local government. It might*however, be necessary to introduce in that session legislation dealingwith local government finance.(g) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that in his judgmentthe Government would be exposed to some criticism if they delaysthe introduction of legislation to give effect to the recommendationof the Herbert Committee on the reorganisation of the electrici .industry.
5CM. 50 (56)The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume, at a meeting in the following week, theirdiscussion of the legislative programme for the 1956-57session.(2) Agreed that, without prejudice to their decisions on the finalcontent of the programme, preparatory work should beput in hand on Bills included in the Lists annexed toCP. (56) 162.%AgriculturalWages.(PreviousReference:C-M. (56) 44thConclusions,Minute 12.)4- The Minister of Agriculture said that, in accordance withthe Cabinet&apos;s decision of 19th June, he had made it clear to theNational Farmers&apos; Union that, if the current wage claim resultedin an increase in agricultural wages, it was not to be assumed that aspecial review of agricultural prices would be held or, if it were, thatthere would be full recoupment of the additional costs resulting fromthe wage increase. The workers in the industry were now seeking torepresent this as an attempt on the part of the Government tointervene in the settlement of a wages claim. This view was likelyto be advanced in the House of Commons in comments on theanswers which he was due to give to Parliamentary Questions on19th July, and the point might become a matter of politicalcontroversy in Parliament. He proposed to take the line that theintimation which he had given to the National Farmers&apos; Union couldnot properly be regarded as an intervention by the Government inthe current wages claim.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Ministerof Agriculture.ustnai 5    j)xe Minister of Labour said that a strike had now beenISPutes. called for 23rd July in protest against the recent dismissals by theprevious British Motor Corporation.  This date would coincide with theReference: beginning of the firm&apos;s annual holidays, and it seemed doubtiulC-M. (56) 45th whether the strike would be effective.   There was no question of^elusions, reinstating the men who had been dismissed from their employment,Minute u.) and the only practical issue was whether they could receive someMotor industry furtrier monetary compensation.   On this the Corporation might&apos; now be more ready to accept some compromise.e Industry. There was a threat of a more serious situation in the iron andsteel industry. There was some prospect that the ban on overtimemight be lifted while the Court of Enquiry was sitting. But it wasnot certain that the Court&apos;s report would provide an effective meansof determining the dispute between the two Unions concerned. Theproduction men in the industry would be strongly opposed to anysuggestion that they should join with the maintenance men in thenegotiation of wage claims. Strong feelings had been aroused withinthe industry, and it might be some time before the differences betweenthe Unions could be composed.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.
6CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 48thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Lord Chancellor made an interim report on the workof the Committee which the Cabinet had appointed on 11th Julyto consider the possibility of framing a Government measure toamend the law of murder so as to restrict the scope of capitalpunishment. The Committee were satisfied that it would bepracticable to frame legislation amending the law of murder inrelation to suicide pacts, provocation, constructive malice anddiminished responsibility, but they did not believe that this limitedreform would command a sufficient measure of support among thoseConservative Members of Parliament who favoured the abolitionof the death penalty. For this purpose they thought it would benecessary to propose that capital punishment should in future bereserved for a limited number of specified categories of murder;and they believed that it would be practicable to frame amendinglegislation on that basis. They hoped to be able to submit moredetailed proposals on those lines for consideration by the Cabineton 19th July. Thereafter, if the Cabinet approved, the Chief Whipcould take such informal soundings among Government supportersas were necessary to enable him to judge whether a policy of thiskind would command sufficient support in the Commons to enablea Government Bill to be carried and to ensure the defeat of anyfurther Private Member&apos;s Bill providing for the complete abolitionof the death penalty. It was hoped that, in the light of thesesoundings, the Prime Minister might be in a position to make anannouncement of the Government&apos;s intentions before Parliamentrose for the summer recess.The Cabinet Took note of this interim report by the Lord Chancellorand agreed to resume their discussion of this question attheir meeting on 19th July.Cabinet Offices, S.W.I,17th July, 1956.
