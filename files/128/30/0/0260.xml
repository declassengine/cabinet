3CM. 36 (56)EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at the meetingwhich Ministers had held with them on 10th May, the representativesof the Trades Union Congress had adopted a reasonably constructiveattitude towards the problem of rising prices. The communiqueissued after the meeting had contained some of the points includedin the draft statement annexed to his memorandum CP. (56) 118.It had, however, attracted less attention in the Press than he hadhoped. He suggested that some further action should now be takento ensure that the Government&apos;s policy in this matter was morewidely understood.In discussion there was general support for this suggestion.Resolutions in favour of new wage increases would be on the agendaof the forthcoming conferences of various trade unions, and it wasdesirable that further steps should be taken to strengthen the handsof those moderate trade union leaders whose influence was likely tobe cast in favour of a policy of restraint. A firm leading article inThe Times newspaper would be helpful, and arrangements should alsobe made for the Central Office of Information to put out suitablesupporting information.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for anapproach to be made to The Times newspaper with a viewto securing further prominence for the Government&apos;spolicy in regard to rising prices.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the Central Officeof Information to seek publicity for additional materialbearing on this policy.Bahrain.(PreviousReferences :CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 2, andCM. (56) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that thepeople of Bahrain were showing increasing distrust of Sir CharlesBelgrave, the adviser to the Ruler of Bahrain, and the risk could notbe ignored that the Ruler might eventually be compelled by the forceof local public opinion to dispense with his services. Our first aimmust therefore be to find a potential successor who could act as hisdeputy and be ready to succeed him as soon as the Ruler was readyto make a change. Meanwhile, further efforts should be made tostrengthen the police in Bahrain: it was hoped that the ColonialOffice might be able to help by providing some suitable officers fromColonial police forces. . .The Cabinet reaffirmed their decision of 17th April that the firststep would be to select a suitable man who would serve as anassistant to Sir Charles Belgrave and would be capable of replacinghim at a later stage. Meanwhile, however, the Ruler&apos;s confidence inus should not be shaken by any premature disclosure of ourintentions. The next step would be to persuade Sir Charles Belgrave,who had already signified his agreement in principle, to accept thisman as an assistant. The third stage would be to broach with theRuler, when the new man had won his confidence, the suggestion thathe should take over all the duties of Sir Charles Belgrave&apos;s post. Inthe meantime we must continue to lend full support to the Ruler andhis present adviser.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was unlikely that additional police could be obtained fromColonial territories, which were already relying on help from theUnited Kingdom. The transfer of policemen from Iraq to Bahrainmight possibly be accelerated.49992 2b 2
4(b) The situation in Bahrain illustrated the need for a reserveof capable officers who would be available as need arose forappointment as advisers to the Shaikhdoms in the Persian Gulf.Former officers of the Sudan Service might still be available to formthe nucleus of such a reserve.The Cabinet Reaffirmed their decision of 17th April that the ForeignSecretary should submit, for the Prime Minister&apos;s earlyconsideration, a list of suitable candidates for appointmentas assistant to Sir Charles Belgrave.BritishSomaliland.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence (C.P. (56) 109) covering a memorandum by the Chiefs ofStaff on the strategic value of British Somaliland.The Minister of Defence said that the memorandum had beenprepared in response to the request made by the Cabinet at theirmeeting on 29th March. The Chiefs of Staff took the view that thestrategic importance of the Somaliland Protectorate had increasedas a result of recent events in the Middle East. If self-governmentwere eventually to be conceded to the Protectorate we should seek tosecure by formal agreement certain minimum strategic rights,including the right to station forces and to use and develop ports andanchorages, rights of over-flying and air staging, and concessionscovering the production and transport of oil and minerals.The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Kenya wasconcerned at the potential threat to Kenya which would arise if Egyptwere able to dominate the Horn of Africa after the Italians hadwithdrawn from Somalia when their trusteeship came to an endin 1960.In discussion it was suggested that, in the light of theseconsiderations, it would be preferable that Italy should not withdrawfrom Somalia in 1960. The Italians were, however, anxious to berelieved of the financial burden of this trusteeship and it was in anyevent doubtful whether it would be possible for them to secure anextension of the period of their trusteeship. Nevertheless there werepowerful arguments for preserving the status quo in this area and thepossibility of Italy&apos;s continuing to exercise trusteeship for a furtherperiod after 1960 should be further explored.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the memorandum annexed to C.P. (56) 109.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider what prospect theremight be of securing an extension of Italian trusteeshipfor Somalia.Prince of 4.   The Lord Chancellor said that, as requested by the CabinetHanover.        on 8th May, he had considered in consultation with the Home(Previous        Secretary and the Attorney-General whether an appeal should beReference:      made to the House of Lords against the judgment of the Court ofCM. (56) 34th  Appeal on the claim of Prince Ernst of Hanover to British nationality.Conclusions,    In reaching their decision on this question the Cabinet wouldMinute l.)      doubtless wish to have the Attorney&apos;s estimate of his prospects ofconducting a successful appeal, and for this reason he suggested thatthe Cabinet should postpone their final decision until an occasionon which the Attorney could be present in person. Meanwhile,however, if the appeal was to go forward, formal notice of appeal
5CM. 36 (56)must be lodged that day. This was unlikely to attract publicity andwould not commit the Government finally to proceeding with theappeal.The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion on the advantages anddisadvantages of appealing against the decision of the Court ofAppeal. They agreed that they should not take a final decision onthis point without hearing the views of the Attorney-General. If,however, the formal notice of appeal was not lodged that day, theiropportunity of deciding in favour of making an appeal would be lost.They therefore concluded that, despite the possibility that this mightattract some publicity, the formal notice of appeal should be lodged.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Attorney-General to lodge formal notice ofappeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on theclaim of Prince Ernst of Hanover to British nationality.(2) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of thequestion whether they should proceed further with thisappeal.Disarmament.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)49992 25. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 117) reviewing the Government&apos;s policy ondisarmament.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that at a PressConference that morning the Foreign Office spokesman would beexpected to comment on the Soviet Government&apos;s announcement,made on the previous day, of their unilateral decision to reduce theirarmed forces by 1,200,000 men over the next twelve months. Hesuggested that, in commenting on this announcement, the ForeignOffice spokesman should follow the line indicated in paragraph 12of CP. (56) 117.The Prime Minister said that it was in principle undesirablethat statements of policy should be made at Press Conferencesconducted by officials. On a matter of this importance it was certainlypreferable that the Government&apos;s attitude should be explained byMinisters in Parliament. Apart from this he was doubtful whetherour public response to this Soviet initiative should follow the lineindicated in paragraph 12 of CP. (56) 117. The Soviet initiativeshould be welcomed, even though it made no contribution towardsa solution of the problems of international control of disarmamentor of international agreement on the limitation of armed forces. Thiswas not an occasion for engaging in a battle of propaganda with theSoviet Union: that attitude woud be inconsistent with our professedintention of seeking to improve Anglo-Soviet relations.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the decision of the Soviet Government to makea substantial further reduction in the size of the Sovietarmed forces.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangethat, at the Foreign Office Press Conference that morning,official comment on this announcement would follow thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in the course of thediscussion.(3) Agreed to consider at their next meeting the proposals putforward in CP. (56) 117 on future policy in respect ofdisarmament.b 3
6CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet discussed what line should be taken byGovernment spokesmen on the main amendments to be debatedwhen the Committee Stage of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill wasresumed in the House of Commons on the following day.They first considered the proposal that the Bill should not extendto Scotland. They recognised that it would be illogical that thedeath penalty should remain in force on one side of the border andnot on the other, and they agreed that this point should be broughtout in the debate. There was, however, a strong feeling amonginfluential Scottish supporters of the Government that the Bill shouldnot extend to Scotland. On this account it was agreed that membersof the Government who felt unable to vote against this amendmentmight abstain from voting in the division.The Cabinet then considered the amendments to be moved bySir Hugh Lucas-Tooth, M.P., which would have the effect of retainingthe death penalty for a murder done in the course of committing acrime of violence and for a second conviction of murder. Theseamendments would afford some protection for police officers andprison warders, and on this account it would be difficult for theHome Secretary to avoid expressing some sympathy with theirobjects. On the other hand they would import the concept of&quot; degrees of murder,&quot; to which the Government had hitherto beenopposed; and they were open to the criticism that deliberate murder,e.g., by poisoning, was generally regarded as a more despicable crimethan murder resulting from an act of violence. Even so, it wouldbe open to Government spokesmen, by virtue of the Government&apos;sspecial responsibility for law and order, to express sympathy withthe object of amendments which were designed to afford some degreeof special protection for policemen and prison warders. While thedecision would be left to a free vote of the House, it would beconvenient if members of the Government could vote in support ofthese amendments.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Government spokesmen, in the further proceed-ings on the Committee Stage of the Death Penalty(Abolition) Bill, to be guided by the views expressed intheir discussion.(2) Agreed that members of the Government should be free toabstain from voting on the amendment restricting theapplication of the Bill to England and Wales but should,if possible, vote in support of the amendments designedto retain the death penalty for a murder done in thecourse of committing a crime of violence and for a secondconviction of murder.Singapore.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The Colonial Secretary said that a critical stage had nowbeen reached in the Conference on constitutional development inSingapore. The crucial issue was that of control over internalsecurity in conditions short of an extreme emergency. He hadinsisted that the United Kingdom must retain a reserve power tolegislate by Order in Council on matters affecting defence, externalrelations or internal security, though he had conceded that, if theUnited Kingdom retained a majority on the Defence and SecurityCouncil, such action would only be taken on the basis of a reportfrom the Council. The Singapore Delegation were not prepared toaccept this situation unless (i) the action was based, not merely on areport, but on a recommendation from the Council and (ii) theChairman of the Council was, not a representative of the UnitedKingdom Government, but a Malay nominated by the Chief Ministerof the Federation of Malaya. It was possible that the Delegationmight be persuaded to agree that the nomination of the Chairmanshould be subject to the approval of the United Kingdom Govern-ment.   But, even so, the Governor (who would be known in future
7CM. 36 (56)as High Commissioner) would be merely a member of the Counciland as such would have insufficient authority; and the UnitedKingdom Government would have inadequate powers of securingday-to-day control over the police or over internal security generally.The Colonial Secretary said that, in his view, this was not a positionwhich we could accept. He was therefore disposed to allow theConference to break down on this issue. The alternative was toadjourn the Conference for ten days in the hope that in the intervalwiser counsels might prevail among the Singapore Delegation.In discussion there was general agreement that the Delegation&apos;slatest proposals on internal security could not be accepted. Controlover internal security was essential to the discharge of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s defence responsibilities in Singapore. Those respon-sibilities extended beyond Singapore itself, and beyond theFederation of Malaya; and they could not be adequately safe-guarded unless a representative of the United Kingdom Governmentexercised, as Chairman of the Defence and Security Council, effectivepowers of control over internal security in Singapore. If theConference broke down on this issue, our attitude could be explainedand justified and we should have the support of the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand.In further discussion the following par&apos;icular points weremade:  (a) From the point of view of our relations with Malaya it mightbe inconvenient that we should appear to be rejecting a proposal thatthe Chairman of the Defence and Security Council should benominated by the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya. Onthe other hand it was likely that the Chief Minister would be unwillingto accept the responsibility of making such a nomination. Discreetenquiries were being made with a view to ascertaining whether hewould in fact have been unwilling to do so.(b) Provided that the composition of the Defence and SecurityCouncil were satisfactory, there would be no objection to acceptingthe suggestion that the exercise of reserve powers by the UnitedKingdom Government should be dependent on a recommendationby the Council.(c) It would also be possible to accept a provision that, in theevent of disagreement between the United Kingdom Governmentand the Government of Singapore on the question whether particularlegislation encroached upon the reserve powers of the former, a finaldecision should rest with the Privy Council.The Cabinet then considered whether there would be advantagein proposing a short adjournment of the Conference. Failure ofthe Conference was likely to be followed by political controversyin this country and serious disorder in Singapore. These conse-quences might have to be faced, but the Government must be in aposition to say that every reasonable effort had been made to secureagreement at the Conference. On the other hand, there would belittle point in deferring a breakdown if it were clear that there wouldbe no better prospect of securing an acceptable agreement after anadjournment. It was recognised that the Colonial Secretary wouldbe in the best position to judge, when the Conference was resumedlater in the day, whether there would be advantage in seeking anadjournment.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should reject the latestproposals of the Singapore Delegation on the control ofinternal security in Singapore.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to decide in his discretion,whether the Conference should be allowed to break downat once on this issue or whether an acceptable agreementwas more likely to be reached after a short adjournment.
88. The Cabinet considered two telegrams from Aden (Nos. 300and 302) suggesting that an early public statement should be made onthe political future of the Colony.The Colonial Secretary said that this proposal was made as aresult of consultations in Aden between the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, the Governor, the Air OfficerCommanding and the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Air Forces.The purpose of such a statement would be to check the demands ofcertain local political parties for further constitutional advance, tostrengthen the hands of the moderate party, and to counter thepropaganda which was being conducted by Egypt, Saudi Arabiaand Yemen against the British position in the Aden Protectorate.It would be made clear in the statement that in view of Aden&apos;sstrategic and economic importance within the Commonwealth, theUnited Kingdom Government could not foresee the possibility ofany fundamental relaxation of their responsibility for the Colony.It would also be made plain that, while further advance might comein due course, the degree and pace of constitutional developmentmust depend on the sense of responsibility displayed by the peopleand their leaders.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to certain drafting amendments suggestedin the discussion, the proposed statement on the politicalfuture of Aden.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to authorise the ParliamentaryUnder-Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs to make astatement in these terms in the course of his presentvisit to Aden.Flour- 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCohen Report. Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and theMinister of Health (CP. (56) 120) on the Report of the Cohen Panelwhich had been appointed to advise the Government on thecomposition of flour.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Cohen Panel hadadvised in effect that whiter flour of a lower rate of extraction towhich the essential nutrients had been added artificially was notnutritionally inferior to flour of higher extraction. The Home AffairsCommittee had agreed, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, that thePanel&apos;s advice should be accepted, that their report should bepublished and that the regulations governing the composition of flourshould require the essential nutrients to be present in flour, byaddition if necessary, but should not specify a particular rate ofextraction. The subject was one on which experts held differingviews and the publication of the Panel&apos;s report would provoke ademand for the publication of the evidence on which it was based.The Government could not themselves assume responsibility forpublishing the evidence, but there was no reason why expertwitnesses should not publish their evidence if they wished to do so.He thought it preferable, however, that this authority should be giveninformally rather than in the course of a statement announcing thepolicy on flour extraction.The Lord President said that the Medical Research Council,who did not themselves accept the Panel&apos;s conclusions, had advisedhim that the Government&apos;s decision would be criticised in medicalcircles. There was no doubt that the evidence given before the Panelwould have to be published; and he would prefer that, in order toavoid creating the impression that the Government had yielded topressure, the necessary authority for its publication were includedin the forthcoming statement of policy.Aden.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 9.)
9CM. 36 (56)The Cabinet agreed that authority to publish the evidence shouldbe given either in the text of the statement or in reply to a Supple-mentary Question. They agreed, however, that further considerationshould be given to the terms of the proposed announcement on thispoint.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 7(i) and (ii)of CP. (56) 120.(2) Agreed that authority should be given, either in the forth-coming announcement of Government policy in regardto flour composition or in reply to a SupplementaryQuestion, for witnesses before the Cohen Panel to publishtheir evidence if they so desirea; and invited the LordPrivy Seal to settle, in consultation with the LordPresident and the Minister of Agriculture, the preciseterms in which this authority should be given.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th May, 1956.
