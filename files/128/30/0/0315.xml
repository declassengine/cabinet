3CM. 91 (56)EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 85thConclusions,Minute 5.)*1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that duringNovember there had been a serious drain on our reserves of goldand dollars. The first two quarters of the year had been periods ofrecovery: we had gained $157 millions in the first quarter and$108 millions in the second. In the third quarter there had been anet loss of $57 millions, in spite of substantial accruals from the saleof Trinidad Oil and other sources. In October there had been a lossof $84 millions. In November, the final net loss which would beannounced was likely to be about $270 millions. In the third weekof the month alone we had lost over $100 millions. This was clearlydue to confidence factors. The most likely explanation was that alack of confidence in European currencies generally, due to nervous-ness about war or sustained economic difficulties, had given rise to amovement out of those currencies into dollars or Swiss francs viasterling. The announcement of the November figures, which mustbe made not later than 4th December, would shake confidence insterling still further, and would be a severe shock to the stability ofthe sterling area. These effects could only be mitigated if it werepossible, when the announcement was made, to indicate plainly theGovernment&apos;s intention to take firm measures to remedy thesituation. The Chancellor said that these measures fell under threeheads. First, he wished to be able to say that we were at onceproceeding to exercise our drawing rights in the InternationalMonetary Fund and to seek dollar loans against the collateralsecurity of Government-held stocks. Secondly, it must be apparentthat we were taking effective steps to repair the breach in our politicalrelations with the United States Government. The forecast of ourbalance of payments for the first half of 1957 showed a probabledeterioration of about  200 millions, largely on account of theexpected difficulties over oil supplies; and, unless those difficultiescould be mitigated by closer political collaboration with the UnitedStates, there might also be a serious fall in the level of employmentand production in this country. Thirdly, some measures forstrengthening our domestic economy should also be announced atthe same time. It was not enough that we should seek to overcomeour difficulties merely by borrowing dollars: it must also be apparentthat we were ready to accept some measure of sacrifice at home. TheChancellor indicated to the Cabinet some of the alternativepossibilities under this head which he had considered. Of these hethought that the most appropriate in present circumstances was toimpose an additional duty of Is. a gallon on petrol, with a rebate forpetrol used by public service passenger vehicles. This would yieldabout  100 millions in a full year: its effect on industry would notbe severe: the rebate which he suggested would have the effect ofavoiding any consequential increase in the cost-of-living index: and,more generally, the increased duty would support and reinforce theother measures which were being taken to reduce consumption ofpetroleum products.The Cabinet recognised the gravity of the situation disclosed bythis statement, and agreed that urgent action must be taken toremedy it. They supported the measures which the Chancellorproposed to take to this end. In particular, they endorsed his viewthat the Government should not appear to be seeking to meet thesituation solely by borrowing dollars, and that supplementary actionshould be taken at the same time to strengthen the national economy.Of the possible alternatives under this head they agreed that theproposed increase in the petrol duty would be the most appropriateat the present time.J0910  1The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor ofExchequer on the deterioration in our balancepayments.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.b 2theof
4(2) Approved in principle the measures which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer proposed to take to remedy this situation.(3) Agreed that final decisions on the Chancellor&apos;s proposalsshould be taken at their meeting on 3rd December.Suez Canal. 2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Suez Canal(Previous situation.Reference *CM. (56) 90th The Foreign Secretary said that the French Foreign Minister wasConclusions.) proposing to come to London for consultation during the afternoonof 30th November: it had proved impossible to arrange for earlierconsultation with him. Final decisions could not be announceduntil those consultations had been completed. It was thereforeproposed that an interim statement should be made in the House ofCommons that afternoon, and that the announcement of theGovernment&apos;s final decision should be deferred until 3rd December.A draft of the statement which he proposed to make that afternoonwas contained in Foreign Office telegram No. 2338 to New York,which had been repeated to Paris.In discussion some misgivings were expressed about thecommunication of this draft statement to H.M. Representatives inNew York and Paris. From New York telegram No. 1465 it appearedthat the Secretary-General of the United Nations had been given tounderstand that the Anglo-French forces were likely to be withdrawnfrom Port Said by the middle of December and that he had alreadycommunicated this information to the Egyptian Foreign Minister.Moreover, H.M. Ambassador in Washington had been authorised(Foreign Office telegram No. 5612 to Washington) to inform theState Department that we had it in mind to announce that our forcesin Port Said would be withdrawn within fourteen days. Thesecommunications seemed to imply that the Cabinet were alreadycommitted to a policy of immediate withdrawal which they haddiscussed, but had not finally adopted, at their meeting on theprevious evening.The Foreign Secretary said that, before leaving New York, hehad already informed the Secretary-General of the United Nationsthat the withdrawal of the Anglo-French forces, if authorised, couldbe completed within fifteen days; but he had made it clear that,before authorising the withdrawal to begin, his Cabinet colleagueswould need to be satisfied that their essential requirements had been,or would be, met. It was clearly understood, both in New York andin Paris, that the draft of his proposed statement was a proposalwhich he was discussing with his colleagues, not a decision whichthey had approved. As regards telegram No. 5612 to Washington,no action had yet been taken on this, and there was ample time inwhich to send contrary or delaying instructions. Thus, the Cabinet&apos;sfreedom of decision had in no way been prejudiced by the necessarypreparatory action which he had taken.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion then turned on the terms of the draftstatement set out in Foreign Office telegram No. 2338 to New York.This summarised the course of the recent discussions in the UnitedNations and, after setting out the understandings reached in respectof the size and composition of the United Nations force, the clearanceof the Canal, the basis on which negotiations on the future operationof the Canal might be resumed and the prospects of securing along-term settlement of the outstanding problems of the MiddleEast, concluded by stating our intention to concert with the FrenchGovernment a definite programme for the withdrawal of the Anglo-French forces from Egypt. Discussion showed that it was the generalview of the Cabinet that, if a lengthy statement on these lines weremade before a final decision was announced, the Government&apos;s
5CM. 91 (56)position in Parliament would be seriously weakened. It could notat present be claimed that, in return for our withdrawal, we hadsecured firm guarantees that our requirements would be met. Inrespect of the clearance of the Canal, in particular, we were not in aposition to give a firm assurance that work would begin before ourwithdrawal was complete or that use would be made of the salvageresources which we had readily available. These were points towhich Government supporters had attached special importance.Moreover, it was doubtful whether a statement which so clearlyforeshadowed an early decision to withdraw from Port Said shouldbe made in advance of the forthcoming consultations with the FrenchGovernment. If the plan was to make an interim statement thatafternoon, and to announce a final decision on 3rd December, it waspreferable that the first statement should deal primarily with facts,rather than policy, and should expose the smallest possible flank forcriticism. It might contain the latest information about the size andcomposition of the United Nations force and about the treatment ofBritish subjects in Egypt; but its main point should be that finaldecisions on future policy could not be taken without furtherconsultation with the French Government and further elucidation ofthe plans and intentions of the United Nations. If the immediateParliamentary situation could be held in this way, a fuller and moreconsidered statement of policy could be made in Parliament on3rd December. This would provide a valuable opportunity, overthe week-end, for addressing to the United States Government andCommonwealth Governments explanations and representationsdesigned to secure their endorsement and support of the decisionsto be announced on 3rd December.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make an interim statementin the House of Commons that afternoon on the linesapproved in their discussion.(2) Agreed that, in the light of the consultations to be held withthe French Foreign Minister on the following day, finaldecisions on future policy should be taken at a meetingof the Cabinet to be held on 1st December.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.A debate on the situation in the Middle East would be held on5th and 6th December.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,29th November, 1956.
