3CM. 32 (56)NationalisedIndustries.ParliamentaryControl.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Lord Privy Seal said that a Committee of Ministersunder his Chairmanship had considered possible means of enablingParliament to exercise a further measure of control over the conductof the nationalised industries. On balance they favoured a schemeby which the existing Select Committee of the House of Commonswould be reconstituted as a smaller body of eleven members withrelatively narrow terms of reference empowering them to study theannual reports and accounts of the Boards of nationalised industriesand to call for persons, papers and records. They would not beconcerned with the future policy of the Boards, and the accountabilityof Ministers to Parliament would not therefore be prejudiced. Theseproposals were acceptable to the Chairman of the present SelectCommittee. In view of the concern expressed by Governmentsupporters it was desirable that the proposed arrangements shouldbe announced early in the following week, before the debate on theSecond Reading of the Coal Industry Bill.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to submit a memorandum, forconsideration at their next meeting, outlining his proposalsfor increased Parliamentary control over the conduct of thenationalised industries.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Second Reading of the Finance Bill would be taken on9th May. It was hoped that the Committee Stage of the RestrictiveTrade Practices Bill would be concluded during the week.The Family Allowances Bill should be introduced before theWhitsun recess, on a date to be settled in consultation between theLord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.RestrictiveTradePractices Bill.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 26thConclusions,Minute 4.)Crown Privilege3. The Lord Chancellor said that Mr. J. E. S. Simon, M.P.,had tabled an amendment to the Restrictive Trade Practices Billwhich would have the effect that the question of Crown privilege inrespect of documentary or oral evidence in proceedings before theRestrictive Practices Court would be determined, unless nationalsecurity was involved, by the Court and not by the responsibleMinister. A Committee of Officials under the Treasury Solicitorhad been reviewing the question of Crown privilege and their reportwas now ready. Mr. Simon had been informed that the Governmentwere examining the matter and, while he had not been prepared towithdraw his amendment, he had agreed to defer it until the ReportStage of the Bill. It would be necessary, therefore, for theGovernment to make a statement on this matter before the ReportStage was reached and the conclusions of the Official Committeewould need to be studied urgently.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a Cabinet Committeeto consider this report on Crown privilege and to submittheir recommendations to the Cabinet.Jordan. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Foreign Secretary (CP. (56) 106) reporting that the Jordan GovernmentReference- had asked for written assurances of the intention of the UnitedCM (56)25th Kingdom Government to give aid to Jordan in the event of an act ofConclusions aggression by Israel.  The Cabinet&apos;s authority was sought to give toMinute 2) the Jordan Government the written assurances set out in the Annex49937 2 Q 2
4to CP. (56) 106. These defined the action which the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to take in certain contingencies whichmight threaten the security of Jordan.The Cabinet were informed that this proposal had the supportof the Chiefs of Staff and was in accord with plans for possiblemilitary action in Jordan which had recently been approved by theDefence Committee. If the Cabinet agreed that a communication inthese terms might be made to the Jordan Government, the ForeignSecretary would determine the most suitable time for making it. Itmight be appropriate that it should be delivered during, orimmediately after, the forthcoming meeting of the Anglo-JordanJoint Defence Board.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to communicate to theJordan Government, at his discretion, the written assurancesset out in the Annex to CP. (56) 106.Cancer of 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lordthe Lung.       Privy Seal (CP. (56) 111) reporting the conclusions reached by the(Previous        Committee of Ministers which had been asked by the Cabinet toReference :      consider whether the Government should now take a definite line onCM. (56) 30th   the relation between smoking and cancer of the lung.Conclusions, The Committee recommended that the Government&apos;s role in thisMinute 7.) matter should be to ensure that all relevant information was madeavailable to the public. They should avoid committing themselves toassuming any further responsibility. The Minister of Health wouldbe obliged to make a statement in Parliament; but this should rest,without comment, on the views of the medical experts and shouldhold the balance evenly between alarming public opinionunnecessarily and dismissing the whole question as unimportant.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith these conclusions and with the tone of the draft statementannexed to CP. (56) 111. Two amendments of the draft were,however, suggested:  (a) In paragraph 2 of the draft the total number of deaths fromcancer should be given, as well as those from cancer of the lung.(b) In paragraph 4 of the draft it would be sufficient to say thatthe Government would take such steps as were necessary to ensurethat the public were kept informed of all relevant information as andwhen it became available.The Cabinet (1) Approved the conclusions set out in CP. (56) 111.(2) Authorised the Minister of Health to make a statement inthe House of Commons in the terms of the draft annexedto CP. (56) 111 subject to the amendments noted inparagraphs (a) and (b) above.Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 27thConclusions.Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (56) 108) covering a memorandum which hadbeen prepared as a basis for discussion of the project for dealingsimultaneously with the remuneration of Members of the House ofCommons, salaries of junior Ministers and expense allowances forPeers.The Lord Privy Seal said that, unless the Government took anearly initiative in this matter, the Labour Opposition in the House ofCommons would press publicly for an increase in Members&apos; salaries
5CM. 32 (56)and would propose that this question should be made the subject ofan independent enquiry. The Government would be in someembarrassment if they delayed much longer an increase in the salariesof junior Ministers, which was long overdue. There was, therefore,much to be said for proceeding simultaneously with all three projectsduring the current session: by this means it might be possible toprevent them from becoming the subject of further controversybetween the Parties. On the other hand, he must warn the Cabinetthat this project would not be popular with Government supporters,either in the House of Commons or in the country.The Prime Minister said that on merits there were good groundsfor improving the remuneration of Members and junior Ministersand introducing expense allowances for Peers; and he would beprepared, if necessary, to defend such action against criticism fromGovernment supporters. He was more concerned, however, aboutthe effect which this action might have on the Government&apos;s attemptsto secure a period of stability in wages and prices. The general levelof wages had now risen by six points, compared with a rise of onlytwo points in the cost-of-living index; and Ministers would be onstrong ground in calling on employers and workers, as they proposedto do, to co-operate with the Government in working for a period ofstability. In the struggle to check inflation, and perhaps in industrialrelations generally, they faced a very critical period; and he fearedthat early action to improve the salaries of Ministers and Membersof Parliament might prejudice the attempt which they were about tomake to secure the full co-operation of industry in this period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he shared the PrimeMinister&apos;s view. The wages situation was certainly critical. Govern-ment action to increase the salaries of Members and Ministers mightwell start a fresh round of wage claims. It could hardly fail toprejudice the Government&apos;s attempt to persuade others to exerciserestraint.In discussion it was generally recognised that the most urgentneed was to secure some improvement in the remuneration of juniorMinisters. On this there was full agreement between the Parties, andfor some time now there had been a widespread understanding thatearly action would be taken. Further delay would give rise to keendisappointment and some hardship. This, however, was the one partof the project that required legislation; and legislation could not beintroduced without provoking discussion, and possibly controversybetween the Parties, on the other two connected questions. More-over, from the point of view of repercussions on industrial wages, itwas an increase in salaries which was most dangerous; and it wouldbe possible to improve the position of Members and Peers withoutincreasing salaries. This suggested that, if some immediate actionwas necessary, it might take the form of increasing the sessionalallowances for Members, introducing a scheme of expense allowancesfor Peers and enabling junior Ministers to draw the whole of theParliamentary salary. It was recognised, however, that such ascheme would be open to two objections, viz., that the concession tojunior Ministers would still require legislation and that it would notbenefit junior Ministers who were Peers. For these and otherreasons the balance of opinion in the Cabinet lay against anycompromise plan on these lines.In further discussion it was generally agreed that in all thecircumstances it would be preferable to postpone for the time beingthe project for increasing the salaries of Members and juniorMinisters and introducing a system of expense allowances for Peers.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that he should inform the LabourOpposition that the Government had reached this conclusion, withregret, owing to the difficulties of the economic situation. On thatbasis the Opposition leaders might perhaps be persuaded to accept
6it with a good grace, though they would doubtless make some publicprotest and might table a motion proposing some form ofindependent enquiry into the remuneration of Members. At thisstage he would like to reserve his opinion on the latter point: in hisconversations with Opposition leaders it would be bad tactics for himto reject that suggestion out of hand. If, however, the matter cameto be debated in the House, the Government would have to take adefinite line: it would be unwise to leave that issue to a free vote.Meanwhile, he would like to make two concessions to the Oppositionin respect of the Members&apos; Fund. He proposed that there should besome Exchequer contribution to the Fund, and that Members shouldbe entitled to tax relief in respect of their contributions to it.The Cabinet (1) Decided not to proceed further, for the present, with theproject for improving the remuneration of Members ofParliament, increasing the salaries of junior Ministers andintroducing a system of expense allowances for Peers.(2) Agreed in principle that some Exchequer contribution shouldbe made to the Members&apos; Fund, and that Membersshould be entitled to tax relief in respect of theircontributions to the Fund.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whetherany improvement in the remuneration of junior Ministers,whether Peers or Members of the House of Commons,could be secured without legislation by tax relief inrespect of expenses incurred in the performance of theirduties.(4) Took note that, in the light of Conclusions (1) and (2) above,the Lord Privy Seal would communicate further with theOpposition Leaders in the House of Commons, andwould report the result of his discussions to the Cabinet.Coal Prices. 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of(Previous Fuel and Power (CP. (56) 103) recommending that the price of coalReference :     should be raised by an average of 6s. a ton.C.C. (55) 22nd It was stated in the memorandum that the wage settlementConclusions. reached in February would have the effect of increasing the wagesMinute 5.) bill by  40 millions in 1956 and  60 millions in 1957. There was noimmediate prospect of increased productivity; and, if the price ofcoal were not increased to absorb these additional costs, theaccumulated deficit of the National Coal Board, which amounted to 37 millions in 1955, would rise to  102 millions by the end of 1957.If this was to be avoided a further increase in the price of coal wasinevitable. The increase of 8 per cent, which was now proposedwould lead to consequential increases in the prices of electricity, gas,steel, railway transport and domestic coal, and eventually to a slightrise in the cost of living.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The capital investment already made in the coal industry wasnot yet yielding fruit because many of the development projects hadstill to be completed.(b) The unsettled situation in the Middle East was leading someindustrialists to adopt a more cautious attitude towards convertingtheir plants to the use of oil. This tendency should be discouraged.(c) The increased cost of coal would lead to pressure for a higherrate of subsidy from the operators of coal-burning trawlers. Thiswould have to be considered on its merits when the time came.The Cabinet-Authorised the increase in the price of coal proposed inCP. (56) 103.
7CM. 32 (56)CommonwealthMembership.Gold Coast.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Colonial Secretary said that the Prime Minister of theGold Coast had now accepted his view that, in view of the differenceswhich had developed in the Gold Coast on the constitutional issue,the further stages of constitutional advance should not be broughtinto operation until the peoples of the Gold Coast had demonstrated,in a general election, their support for the constitutional plan.Dr. Nkrumah had, however, suggested that an announcement to thiseffect should be made, not by him, but by a spokesman of theUnited Kingdom Government. The Colonial Secretary said that,from his point of view, this course was to be preferred. He thereforeproposed to make such an announcement in the House of Commonson 10th or 11th May. In this announcement he would go on to makeit clear that, if Dr. Nkrumah won the election on the constitutionalissue and if the constitutional proposals were accepted thereafter bya reasonable majority of the newly-elected legislative assembly, theUnited Kingdom Government would be prepared to declare a firmdate by which the Gold Coast might expect to attain independencewithin the Commonwealth.In reply to questions, the Colonial Secretary said that theGeneral Election in the Gold Coast would not take place before theforthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers: it waslikely to be held in July. The statement which he was proposing tomake reflected a delay, rather than an acceleration, in the progressof the Gold Coast towards independence. This delay was due inpart to the reluctance of the Ashanti tribes to accept a unitary formof constitution. British rule had, however, imposed an artificial unityon the Gold Coast for many years past and he did not think it wouldhave been practicable at this stage to operate a federal system.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the announcement which theColonial Secretary proposed to make in the House ofCommons on constitutional development in the Gold Coast.Tangier.(PreviousReference :C.C. (52) 35thConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Prime Minister said that there were clear indicationsthat the independent Government of Morocco would shortly demandthe termination of the international regime in Tangier. Our interestswould be satisfied if a free port were established at Tangier, with itsown police under a European officer. The Foreign Office, Treasury,Board of Trade and Chiefs of Staff were all agreed that, if this couldbe secured, there would be no special advantage to the UnitedKingdom in preserving the international status of Tangier. It wastherefore proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tangiershould at once be instructed to take this line if a Moroccan demandfor the return of Tangier came before the Committee of Control.The Governments of the interested Powers would at the same timebe informed that we intended to take this line in the Committee. TheMoroccan Government would also be told of our attitude.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals put before them by the PrimeMinister; and invited him to authorise the despatch ofinstructions in this sense to Her Majesty&apos;s Consul-Generalat Tangier and to arrange for the interested Governments tobe informed.Cabinet Office, S.W. I.3rd May, 1956.
