 JJC.M. 100 (56)Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 99thConclusions.Minute 3.)Clearance ofthe Canal.J. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Foreign Secretary hadnow sent a message to the Secretary-General of the United Nations(Paris telegram No. 465) commenting vigorously on the unsatisfactorysituation which appeared to be developing at Port Said andemphasising that, if the clearance of the Canal were substantiallydelayed by reason of an unco-operative attitude on the part of theCommander of the United Nations salvage fleet, General Wheeler,towards the use of British resources, great resentment would be feltagainst the United Nations.The same point had been forcefully made to the United StatesAmbassador in London, who had undertaken to urge the UnitedStates Secretary of State to press the Secretary-General once againto clarify the position, ft appeared, from New York telegramNo. 1668, that the Secretary-General was already in touch withGeneral Wheeler in an endeavour to correct the latter&apos;s apparentmisunderstanding of his instructions.Thus, there were grounds for hoping that we might still securethe use of British resources for the clearance of the Canal. Butthere could be no certainty on this point, and opinion amongthe Government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons wasbecoming critical of the situation which appeared to be developing.It was for consideration whether any other action could be taken toreinforce the representations which the Foreign Secretary had alreadymade to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although it would not be possible to delay the completionof the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force from Port Said beyondthe date of 22nd December which had now been agreed with theFrench Government, public opinion would only accept thiswithdrawal if some appropriate action had been taken by the UnitedNations to secure the utmost speed in clearing the Canal. For thispurpose we might ourselves table a fresh resolution in the GeneralAssembly. On the other hand we could not be certain that such aresolution would be passed against the probable opposition of theAfro-Asian States.(b) If it were made clear to the Governments of theScandinavian countries, both in their respective capitals and at theUnited Nations, that a refusal by the United Nations to employBritish resources for the clearance of the Canal would approximatelydouble the time taken by the clearance operation, they wouldprobably support our representations to the Secretary-General.The Cabinet (I) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (CommanderNoble) to inform the Foreign Secretary of the points madein their discussion, and to suggest to him that he shouldarrange for further consideration to be given to thepossibility of tabling a new resolution in the GeneralAssembly about the clearance of the Canal, andmobilising the support of the Governments of theScandinavian countries for the representations which hehad already made to the Secretary-General.Prisoners of The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Defence, said thatWar. further consideration had confirmed that the choice lay betweentransferring our Egyptian prisoners of war to the Commander of theUnited Nations force or removing them from Egypt to Cyprus. Therewas no other military base to which they could conveniently beremoved; and it had been ascertained that, while the Governor ofCyprus would be reluctant to accommodate these prisoners in theIsland, he would be prepared to accept them in the absence of anyalternative solution.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Commander Noble)said that, in terms of legal status, the War Office contractors&apos; staffs51078 2 b 2
4were undoubtedly civilians, and that we should therefore have nocase for seeking to negotiate their release against the transfer of ourEgyptian prisoners of war. But it was proposed that, even if wehanded over the prisoners of war unconditionally, we should retainthe most senior of them until the Egyptians returned the Britishofficer whom they had recently kidnapped in Port Said.Discussion showed that the Cabinet remained unconvinced ofthe wisdom of handing over our Egyptian prisoners of war, with no aguarantee of any corresponding release of our own nationals. It wasagreed that, despite the urgency which attached to this matter, thefinal decision must await the Prime Minister&apos;s return. In themeantime preliminary preparations for the reception of the prisonersin Cyprus should be put in hand.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to resume their discussion of the disposal of ourEgyptian prisoners of war after the return of the PrimeMinister.(3) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theColonies to arrange for preliminary preparations to bemade in Cyprus for the reception of the Egyptianprisoners of war, without prejudice to the Cabinet&apos;s finaldecision.Malaya.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 11.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C.P. (56) 279) about a proposal, put forward byMalayan Ministers, that the Federation of Malaya, on attaining fullself-government, should retain the right of appeal to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council but that the advice of the JudicialCommittee should be tendered not to The Queen but to the newHead of State in Malaya.The Lord Chancellor said that this proposal would need to beexamined very carefully. The new State of Malaya would sufferjuridically if it did not retain the right of appeal to the JudicialCommittee, as India and Pakistan had already discovered by theirown experience. On the other hand it was arguable whether it wouldbe consistent with constitutional propriety that the advice of theJudicial Committee should be made available not to the Head ofthe Commonwealth but to the Head of another State within theCommonwealth. In particular, the implications of such a develop-ment in relation to other Commonwealth countries, particularly thoseColonial Territories which were now advancing towards fullself-government, would need to be considered.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee of Ministers consisting of Lord PresidentLord ChancellorCommonwealth SecretaryColonial SecretaryPay mas ter-G ener alAttorney-Generalto consider the proposal that the Federation of Malaya, onattaining full self-government, should retain the right ofappeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council butthat the advice of the Judicial Committee should betendered not to The Queen but to the new Head of Statein Malaya.
5CM. 100 (56)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (CP. (56) 280) covering a report by a Sub-Committee ofthe Home Affairs Committee and a memorandum by the LordChancellor on the renewed application by the ManchesterCorporation to be allowed to build 12,000 houses on agriculturalland at Lymm in Cheshire.The Lord Chancellor said that on a reasonable basis of0 calculation Manchester would have, during the period 1961-71,about 18,000 sites available for houses; and that, if the rate of buildingduring this period was 3,000 houses a year, sufficient sites would beavailable until 1967. Until more progress had been made in utilisingthese sites he did not think it would be justifiable to alienate 3,000acres of the best farming land; and he therefore proposed that theposition should be re-examined in a few years&apos; time, during whichinterval efforts should be made to find an alternative solution.The Minister of Housing said that the 18,000 sites could not infact be relied upon. It was very unlikely that Macclesfield would beready to facilitate the building of 4,500 houses for Manchester&apos;sneeds; experience had shown that the scope for further developmentin urban areas reasonably close to Manchester was liable to beexaggerated; and the assumption that a certain number of sites couldbe found within the city itself did not take sufficient account of thefact that these sites were already occupied by slum properties, theinhabitants of which would need to be re-housed. Since it wasimpracticable to transfer Manchester&apos;s excess population and industryto remoter towns, there was no alternative to the development of anew large site if the urgent needs of Manchester were to be met.The rejection of the Corporation&apos;s proposal to develop the site atLymm would, therefore, clearly imply that slum clearance had beensubordinated to the interests of agriculture. The Government,however, had stressed their determination to press forward withslum clearance as an argument justifying the abolition of the generalhousing subsidy. If, therefore, the Cabinet felt unable to accept theCorporation&apos;s proposal, he could only recommend that the issueshould again be submitted to a public enquiry, in the light of whicha decision could be taken at a later date.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Government hadpubliclv committed themselves to the policy of preserving first-classagricultural land from further development. The agriculturalcommunity regarded the present proposal as a test case of thefirmness of the Government&apos;s intentions in the matter. Further-more, the site at Lymm, when developed, might well become merelya dormitory of Manchester, so that the expressed intention of theManchester Corporation to re-house their surplus populationelsewhere would not in fact be carried out.In discussion the view was expressed that Manchester shouldapproach the problem by increasing the present density ratio ofbuilding in order to make more efficient and economical use of thesites already available. Moreover, the needs of Manchester for slumclearance had by no means the highest priority among the largercities. Doubts were also expressed about the ability of theManchester Corporation to build at the rate of 3,000 houses a year, afigure which they had not achieved hitherto.The Minister of Housing said that, in his view, none of thesearguments was valid. An increase in the density ratio would haveonly a marginal effect; an order of priority among cities in regard tore-housing was doubtfully consistent with the importance which theGovernment had publicly and repeatedly attached to slum clearance;and he had no doubt that, if the the Manchester Corporation wereenabled to plan sufficiently far ahead by being given the necessaryassurance that adequate sites would be available, they would be ableto achieve a rate of building of at least 3,000 houses a year.HousingPolicy.Manchester.
6the Lord Privy Seal said that the discussion showed that theCabinet considered that a case had not been made out for taking adecision in favour of Manchester at the present time. Such adecision would cause great disquiet among Government supportersand among the agricultural community. A further public enquirywould weaken the incentive to the Manchester Corporation to seekany alternative solution, since they would concentrate their efforts onjustifying their case before the enquiry. It was in any case premature mto reopen an issue which had already been exhaustively examined  within the last few years; and a decision to disallow Manchester&apos;sapplication for the time being could be justified on this ground. Thisdecision could not, however, be easily reconciled with theGovernment&apos;s policy on slum clearance and the terms of theannouncement would need careful consideration.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the renewed application by the ManchesterCorporation to develop an agricultural site for building atLymm in Cheshire should be rejected.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to circulate the text of hisproposed announcement on this subject.New ZealandHouse inLondon.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 47thConclusions,Minute 11.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C.P. (56) 276) about the application by theGovernment of New Zealand for the consent of the Commissionersof Crown Lands to a design for the new New Zealand House to bebuilt on the site of the Carlton Hotel.The Minister of Agriculture said that a decision on this questionwas now urgent. The Government of New Zealand, who would takepossession of the site in January, were anxious that work shouldproceed as rapidly as possible. Moreover, the Commissioners ofCrown Lands would hand over their responsibility for the CrownEstate to the new Board of Crown Estate Commissioners on thefollowing day, and it was preferable that the decision on thisparticular issue should have been taken before the new Board cameinto existence.Of the three designs by Professor Matthew for the proposedbuilding, design A had met with criticism from the Commissionersof Crown Lands and the Royal Fine Art Commission. It had nowbeen discarded by general agreement. Of the remaining alternativedesigns B and C, the former was more acceptable to theCommissioners of Crown Lands, but the New Zealand Governmenthad expressed a strong preference for design C. The Fine ArtCommission had expressed objection to the height of both buildings,but preferred design B to design C. Both designs had recently beenmade public and had evoked no criticism in terms of either theirheight or their design. In principle, therefore, we were now virtuallycommitted to a high building in the contemporary idiom which wascommon to all three designs, and the only issue was the choicebetween design B and design C.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Works said that he was directly concerned byreason of his responsibility for Royal Palaces and Parks. He did notthink that a very tall building on this site was appropriate and, if itwere practicable to oppose this conception in principle, he would wishto do so. If, however, it was thought that the overriding need wasto avoid friction with the New Zealand Government on this matter,he was reluctantly prepared to acquiesce in design C.
7CM. 100 (56)(b) We were entitled to represent to the New ZealandGovernment that design B remained the better design in the opinionof the Commissioners of Crown Lands and the Fine ArtCommission. But it would be undesirable to insist on this pointagainst the opposition of the New Zealand Government; and, if theymaintained their preference for design C, we should not press ourcontrary view to the point of provoking friction between NewZealand and ourselves.(c) The details of the design and the materials used in constructionwere no less important than the height and general shape of thebuilding. The views of the Planning Committee of the LondonCounty Council had still to be obtained. There was no reason toexpect that Committee&apos;s reaction to be unfavourable; but, if planningapproval in principle was given, it should be left to the planningauthorities to agree with the architect and the New ZealandGovernment the details of the final design and the materials to beemployed.(d) On the other hand the New Zealand Government claimedthat, while the terms of their lease of the Carlton Hotel required themto obtain the assent of the Commissioners of Crown Lands to thedesign of any building which they might erect on that site, they wereexempt, as an independent Government, from any other planningrequirement. It would not, therefore, be possible to make ouragreement to the project conditional on their accepting anystipulations which we chose to make about the details of the designand the materials to be employed. These questions would best bedealt with by the Ministers to whom the Board of Crown EstateCommissioners would henceforward be responsible, in consultation,as necessary, with the Minister of Housing and the Minister ofWorks.The Cabinet (1) Invited   the   Minister   oi   Agriculture   to   instruct theCommissioners of Crown Lands to inform the NewZealand Government, subject to the concurrence of theLondon County Council, that the Commissioners wouldconsent to the construction, on the site of the CarltonHotel, of a building of the type desired by the NewZealand Government, within a limit of 210 ft. of height.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State forScotland, as the Ministers to whom the Board of CrownEstate Commissioners would henceforward be responsible,to keep under review the negotiation with the NewZealand Government of the final details of the design tobe adopted and the materials to be employed.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,13th December, 1956.
