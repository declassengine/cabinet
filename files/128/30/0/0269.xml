3CM. 45 (56)Cyprus. 1.   xhe Cabinet were informed that no further indication had(Previous yet been received of the views of the United States and TurkishReference: Governments on our latest proposals for constitutional developmentCM. (56) 44th in Cyprus. It was, however, desirable that the Governor&apos;s return toConclusions, Cyprus should not be unduly delayed; and, when he had left London,Minute 5.) some statement would be expected on the results of the consultationsheld during his visit. It was therefore proposed that an interimannouncement should be made on the following lines:  The United Kingdom Government would press ahead with theframing of a constitution for Cyprus: Lord Radcliffe would startwork at once on this, as Constitutional Commissioner, and it washoped that he would be able at an early stage to bring intoconsultation representatives of the Greek and Turkish communitiesin Cyprus. It was the Government&apos;s intention that the constitutionthus evolved should be brought into effect as soon as possible,provided that law and order in the island had been fully restored.As regards self-determination for Cyprus, the United KingdomGovernment had already accepted the principle: proposals regardingits application had been formulated: these concerned other Powersbesides the United Kingdom, but the Government hoped that itwould be possible to make a statement on them at an early date.In discussion attention was drawn to the dangers of making atthis stage any public statement that new proposals were underdiscussion with other interested Governments. These proposals hadnot yet been communicated to the Greek Government. Moreover,the views of the United States and Turkish Governments had notyet been received. Reactions in Turkey might be violent, and itwould be unfortunate if Turkish feelings were exacerbated by anypremature statement in this country. If, therefore, any interimstatement were to be made in Parliament on the lines suggested, itwould be preferable that the concluding passage should be v/ordedon the following lines:  &quot; As regards self-determination for Cyprus, as the House knows,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already accepted the principle.Advantage has been taken of the visit of the Governor, Field-MarshalSir John Harding, to work out proposals regarding its application.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not yet in a position to make astatement on these but hope to be able to do so at an early date.&quot;In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that theGovernor of Cyprus was not proposing to leave London until theevening of the following day. It was possible that before then somefurther indication might have been received of the views of the UnitedStates and Turkish Governments. The form of any interim statementcould therefore be considered further at a meeting of the ColonialPolicy Committee on the following day. No statement need be madein Parliament before Monday, 25th June.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Policy Committee to give furtherconsideration, at a meeting on the following day, to the formof an interim statement on the future course of Governmentpolicy in Cyprus.ariiamem. 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill would be completed on26th June. Later in the week it was hoped to take the Report Stageand Third Reading of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Bill andof the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.50202 3 B 2
4The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, on the former ofthese Bills, there might be some difficulty over a new clause which hehad tabled regarding the rating of unoccupied premises. On theGovernment side a few Scottish Members who objected to thisproposal were seeking to persuade their English colleagues to jointhem in voting against it. There was, however, no reason to supposethat the Labour Opposition would vote against it, and the clause waslikely to be carried. The Lord Privy Seal undertook to consider howbest to secure a sufficient body of Conservative support for thisproposal on the Report Stage of the Bill.TechnologicalEducation.ImperialCollege ofScience.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that a means had now been devisedof ending the controversy over the plans for the new building of theImperial College of Science. It was now proposed, as a compromise,that the Collcutt tower should be incorporated in the new building.This solution was acceptable to the Royal Fine Arts Commission.Progress in the construction of the new building would not be delayed.Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, he proposed to make an announce-ment to this effect in the debate on technical education which was tobe held in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to announce in the House ofCommons that day the Government&apos;s decision that theCollcutt tower should be incorporated in the new buildingof the Imperial College of Science.EconomicSituation.Meetings withRepresentativesof Employersand Workers.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Prime Minister said that a meeting with representativesof the nationalised industries was to be held on 26th June, in the seriesof meetings on the economic situation which Ministers were holdingwith representatives of employers and workers. Now that theElectricity Authority and the Coal Board had announced theirintention to avoid for a period any further increases in the prices ofelectricity and coal, he suggested that this meeting should be speedilyfollowed by another meeting with representatives of the nationalisedindustries and private industry at which further pressure could bebrought to bear on the latter to co-operate in securing a period ofstability in prices. This further meeting might be held on 29th June.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Road TrafficBill.(PreviousReference:C.C. (54) 90thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Minister of Transport said that the Committee Stage ofthe Road Traffic Bill was due to be taken in the House of Lords on2nd July. Clause 1 of the Bill empowered him to require thecompulsory testing of private motor vehicles and authorised the useof accredited garages for this purpose. This latter provision wasnecessary, if the clause was to become operative, as official testingstations would not be available in sufficient numbers; and theOpposition in the House of Commons had finally accepted the needto make use of private garages for this work. The House of Lordshad, however, accepted on the earlier Bill in 1954 an amendment byLord Lucas prohibiting the use of private garages for this purpose;and Lord Lucas had now given notice that he intended to table asimilar amendment to the present Bill. In view of the change ofopinion in the House of Commons, the Government would beseriously embarrassed if the House of Lords accepted thisamendment.
5CM. &quot;45 (56)The Commonwealth Secretary said that there had also been achange of opinion in the House of Lords and he doubted whetherLord Lucas would be able to carry his amendment. ^The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Ma,ta- 6.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Prime Minister of(Previous        Malta, who was now in London, was asking for measures of economicReference:      assistance which would amount to  8 millions in the coming financialCM. (56) 34th  year.  It was possible that he could be persuaded to accept modifiedConclusions,    proposals totalling only  6 millions.   It had however been assumedMinute 4.)       throughout the proceedings of the Round Table Conference onMalta, that Malta&apos;s need for economic aid from the United Kingdomwould not exceed a level of between  4 millions and  5 millions ayear.  He therefore proposed to take the line that he could not gobeyond that limit.  Mr. Mintoff would be dissatisfied with this reply,and might be able to enlist some support from members of the LabourOpposition in the House of Commons.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to inform the PrimeMinister of Malta that Exchequer assistance to Malta couldnot exceed the limits envisaged in the report of the RoundTable Conference on Malta.Germany.Support Costs.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that, as his colleagues were aware,negotiations had been proceeding for some time about thecontribution which the German Government were to make in thecoming financial year towards the cost of British forces in Germany.It was now evident that we had no prospect of obtaining a largercontribution than  35 millions. An agreement on this figure might,however, be accompanied by conditions requiring the Germans toplace specified orders for military equipment in this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that there was noadvantage in continuing these negotiations in the hope of obtaining alarger financial contribution. If, however, satisfactory assuranceswere obtained about the purchase of equipment in this country, hehoped that some reference to this would be included in the publicstatement on the results of the negotiations. It would be convenientif this statement were made by the Minister of Defence.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to conclude an agreementby which the German Government would in the comingfinancial year contribute  35 millions towards the cost ofBritish forces in Germany.(2) Agreed that the terms of the settlement made with theGerman Government on this question should be given inthe House of Commons by the Minister of Defence.Llbva- 8.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister of Libya(Previous had now defined his request for further financial aid from the UnitedReference: Kingdom. He was asking for an increase of t\ million in the currentCM. (56) 44th year and  1 million in the following year; and he was also seeking ourConclusions, financial assistance in carrying out his project for increasing theMinute 4.) strength of Libya&apos;s military forces.  For the current year he wouldprobably accept an offer of another  | million. His demands for the
6following year might be met by offering to bring forward by one yearthe quinquennial review which was due to be held in 1958, and byundertaking to consider in 1957 the whole problem of Libya&apos;s needsover the next six years. As regards the expansion of Libya&apos;s militaryforces, we must clearly avoid becoming committed to the supply ofexpensive equipment: it might be enough to say that we agreed inprinciple that there should be some increase in Libya&apos;s militarystrength and to suggest that detailed proposals for this purpose shouldreceive expert examination.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the Exchequersubsidy towards the Libyan budget might be increased in the currentfinancial year by million. He also agreed that we should offer toundertake in 1957 a general review of the financial assistance to begiven to Libya over the six years 1957-63. He suggested that weshould make a further offer to examine Libya&apos;s development plan inconsultation with representatives of the Governments of the UnitedStates and Libya. We should be careful to avoid at the present timeany fresh commitment for financial assistance towards the expansionof Libya&apos;s military forces.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue his negotiationswith the Prime Minister of Libya within the limits suggestedin the discussion by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Training 9.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingFacilities for Minute The Foreign Secretary suggested that further thought shouldForeign be given to the possibility of providing increased facilities for trainingStudents. officers of the armed forces of allied and associated countries overwhom we were anxious to exert a continuing influence. At presentwe could provide only 180 places in our various training establish-ments to meet the needs of all oversea candidates, including thosefrom Commonwealth countries. A relatively small expenditure onextending these facilities might bring us greater benefit than thelarger sums now incurred in providing these countries with militaryequipment.In discussion similar arguments were advanced in favour ofincreasing the number of places for oversea students in technicalinstitutions and universities in this country, and furthering theteaching of English in oversea countries.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for thesesuggestions to be taken into consideration by the inter-departmental Committees which were preparing materialfor a Ministerial review of Government policy in the MiddleEast and in Eastern Asia.10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C.P. (56) 147) recommending that the Government shouldnot accept a Recommendation (No. 98) of the International LabourConference, 1954, on the subject of holidays with pay and shouldissue a White Paper, on the lines set out in the Annex to theCM. (56) 27th memorandum, explaining the reasons for this decision.Conclusions, Discussion showed that there was general agreement in themu e .) Cabinet that this Recommendation should not be accepted. It was,Holidays with however, suggested that the Government&apos;s decision, and the reasonsPav- for it, might be sufficiently explained in a written answer to aParliamentary Question rather than by presentation of a White Paper.InternationalLabourOrganisation.(Previous
7CM. 45 (56)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Recommendation No. 98 of the InternationalLabour Conference. 1954, on holidays with pay, shouldnot be accepted by the United Kingdom Government.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Labour, whetherthis decision could not be announced in a written answerto a Parliamentary Question rather than by presentationi of a White Paper.IndustrialDisputes.Steel Industry.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4.)11. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour said that10,000 of the maintenance men in the steel industry were maintainingthe ban on overtime and 3,500 had come out on strike. This wasresulting in a loss of output of 30,000 tons of steel a week. Theemployers were still willing to agree to arbitration and to applyretrospectively any award made at arbitration; and the Minister ofLabour was unwilling to weaken their position by interveningformally in the dispute. His Department were, however, keeping inclose touch with each side, and there were signs that some sectionsof the workers were weakening in their support for the dispute.Since the Cabinet&apos;s last meeting steps had been taken to give publicityto the facts of the dispute. The Iron and Steel Board were alsotaking steps to secure that its economic effects were made known.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.White FishSubsidy.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 46thConclusions,Minute 7.)12. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture (C.P. (56) 149) seeking decisions on the future of thewhite fish subsidy.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the statutoryauthority for this subsidy would need to be renewed before March1958; and in the meantime it would be necessary to obtain, beforethe House of Commons rose for the summer recess, Parliamentaryapproval for the administration of the subsidy in the forthcoming year.The main question for decision was whether the subsidy paymentsfor the next year should be fixed at a level which would approximatelymaintain the present rate of replacement of steam vessels by motorvessels in the middle-waters fleet with a view to bringing the subsidyto an end in 1963. The Treasury would prefer that the subsidyshould be discontinued in 1961; but he considered that a more rapidrate of replacement would have a serious effect on the fishing industryand on employment in it.The Minister of Agriculture said that scrapping was alreadytaking place at a satisfactory rate: it had risen over the last five yearsfrom 50 to 80 vessels a year and in the current year might rise to100 vessels. The purposes of the subsidy were being fulfilled asrapidly as could be expected and it would be an error to force thespeed of scrapping too rapidly. Because of limited capacity in theshipyards, motor vessels (which were perhaps twice as efficient assteam trawlers) would not be available at a rate of more than 30 ayear in the next two years. The loss of as many as 150 steam vesselseach year would not merely lead to a reduction in supplies of goodquality fish but would have serious effects on the ancillary trades.This, combined with the loss of fishermen to other employment,might well affect supplies of fish in the longer term. A decision wasneeded urgently as discussions would have to be held with theindustry before a scheme for the forthcoming year could be laidbefore Parliament.
8The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like to havean opportunity to consider these issues more fully, but would beready to discuss them with the Ministers concerned in the course ofthe next few days.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) As a result of the current review of defence policy, somefurther shipyard capacity might become available for the building ofmotor trawlers.(b) There was already a prospect of serious congestion inlegislative business in the next session of Parliament. It would bepreferable, therefore, that legislation to extend the white fish subsidyshould if possible be deferred until early in the following session.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider thequestions raised in CP. (56) 149, in consultation with theMinisters responsible for fishery, and to report theirconclusions to the Cabinet at their next meeting.Police Pay. 13.   The Home Secretary said that the recent negotiations onpolice pay had lasted for six months and the police were pressing thatthe award granted in December should be made retrospective to theprevious June. The arbitrators had themselves recommended thatit should be made retrospective to September. The pay of the policewas, however, regulated by an Act of 1919 which contained noprovision for retrospection, and the request could not be met withoutamending legislation. He was not in favour of conceding the presentclaim, which would cost  2 millions. For the future, however, hewould be glad if the procedure for pay awards to the police could bebrought into line with that applicable to teachers&apos; pay. This wouldallow of a degree of restrospection, though it would be less than thatenjoyed by prison officers and civil servants. Subject therefore to theCabinet&apos;s views he proposed to announce (in reply to a ParliamentaryQuestion which was to be put to him that afternoon by Mr. ChuterEde, M.P.) that, while the Government had no power to concede thisparticular claim to retrospection, they viewed the general questionwith some sympathy and were considering what steps might be takento resolve the difficulty.The Lord Privy Seal said that this problem had been consideredby a Committee of Ministers under his Chairmanship. Theysupported the proposal which the Home Secretary had put to theCabinet.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary to reply in the terms outlinedto a Parliamentary Question that day on the subject ofpolice pay.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to report to them the results ofthe examination which was being made into the possibilityof introducing amending legislation on this subject.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,21st June, 1956.
