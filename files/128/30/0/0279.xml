3CM. 55 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that, during the debates on theConsolidated Fund Bill on 1st August, the Opposition wished todiscuss the situation arising from the attempt of the EgyptianGovernment to seize control of the Suez Canal. This would be ashort debate, lasting not more than two hours.The Lord President said that it was undesirable that a matterof this kind should be debated simultaneously in the two Houses. If,therefore, the House of Lords desired to discuss this situation, theirdebate would have to be held on 2nd August.House of Lords. 2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Lord President&apos;sReform.        proposals for the reform of the House of Lords.(Previous Thg Lord President said that he had given further thought toCnT56)53 d  these in tne nSnt oi tne Cabmet&apos;s discussion on 26th July. The main. .( n ra objection tnen rajseci to the comprehensive plan of reform outlined^onciusions, jn cp (56) ]g9 was tnat the hereditary Peers who were to sit asPeers of Parliament would be selected by the House of Lords itself.He had considered other methods of limiting the role of the hereditaryPeers in the Second Chamber, but he could think of none whichwas not open to even greater objection. His further considerationof the problem had served to confirm his earlier conclusion that thereal choice lay between the alternatives set out in C.P. (56) 189, viz.,the comprehensive plan of reform outlined in that memorandumor alternatively, a simple Bill conferring power to create life Peers.The second of these courses was, however, one which he could notconscientiously recommend. He was strongly of the opinion thatno measure of reform should be undertaken which did not includesome limitation of the right of hereditary Peers to participate inthe work of the Second Chamber; he had made it publicly knownon more than one occasion that this was his view; and it would beimpossible for him to ask the House of Lords to pass a measure ofreform which was limited to a power to create life Peers.The Lord President said that in these circumstances the Cabinetmight wish to have further time in which to consider what coursethey should follow. His immediate difficulty was that he hadundertaken to discuss the matter with some of the Conservative Peersbefore Parliament rose for the summer recess and he was due tosee them that afternoon. He suggested that he might take thatopportunity of ascertaining their views on the comprehensive planof reform outlined in C.P. (56) 189, putting it forward as a possibleplan for which he had not yet obtained the approval of his Cabinetcolleagues.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should consider thisproblem further during the recess. Any Ministers who had specificsuggestions to offer might submit them in writing to the LordPresident. Meanwhile he thought that the Lord President might,as he proposed, ascertain informally what measure of support therewas likely to be, among Conservative Peers, for a comprehensiveplan of reform on the lines indicated in C.P. (56) 189.In discussion it was suggested that, if it were decided to proceedwith that plan in the forthcoming session, the resolution setting outthe details of the plan could be debated in the House of Lords inthe opening days of that session while the House of Commons wascompleting its Debate on the Address. This course would have theadvantage that the dates of the Prorogation and of the Opening ofthe new session could be announced, according to precedent, beforeParliament rose for the summer recess. Its disadvantage was thatthe Government would not be able to announce in The Queen&apos;s50285 1 b 2
4Speech a firm intention to introduce legislation for the reform ofthe House of Lords: they would not be able to do more than promiseto lay before Parliament proposals on this subject. There was generalagreement that in all the circumstances this disadvantage would haveto be accepted.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume, at their meetings during the summerrecess, their consideration of the Lord President&apos;sproposals for the reform of the House of Lords.(2) Authorised the Lord President to ascertain informally whatmeasure of support there would be among ConservativePeers for a comprehensive plan of reform on the linesindicated in CP. (56) 189.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 53rdConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Prime Minister said that the enquiries which the ChiefWhip had been making among Government supporters had not beencarried far enough to enable him to form a reliable estimate of theprospects of enacting, against the votes of the Opposition Parties, aGovernment measure amending the law of murder on the generallines indicated in CP. (56) 186. He himself was increasinglyimpressed by the strong feelings held by those Governmentsupporters who favoured abolition of the death penalty. Even if itwere possible to carry the Government measure which was nowenvisaged, he feared that the issue of abolition would be raised eitherby an amendment on that Bill or by the subsequent introductionof a Private Member&apos;s Bill providing for total abolition; and strongfeelings would be aroused in the House of Commons if theGovernment sought to defeat either of those attempts by the useof the Government Whip.In discussion it was argued that, while their might be a smallmajority in the House of Commons in favour of the total abolitionof the death penalty, there was reason to believe that in the countryas a whole a majority of public opinion would be in favour ofretaining capital punishment for a limited range of murders on thelines suggested in CP. (56) 186. The Government would lose thesympathy of a substantial body of moderate opinion if they failedto take the opportunity of regaining the initiative by introducinga measure on those lines. The point was also made that .theGovernment must expect to find themselves in continuingembarrassment if they failed to assume responsibility, as aGovernment, for a matter which so closely affected the preservationof law and order. They could not continue indefinitely to leave sucha matter to be decided by a free vote of the House of Commons:they would eventually be obliged to decide either to accept theabolition of the death penalty or to insist that it should be retainedfor a limited range of murders.It was, however, agreed that, in view of Parliament&apos;spreoccupation with the international situation, it was now lessimportant that the Government should announce their intentions inthis matter before the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no announcement need be made before thesummer recess of the Government&apos;s intentions in regardto the law relating to capital punishment.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question duringthe course of the summer recess.
5CM. 55 (56)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (CP. (56) 188) regarding the provision to be made forcapital expenditure on hospitals in the financial year 1958-59.The Minister of Health said that a provision of  10 millions,as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed, for the repair andrenovation of existing hospitals in 1958-59 would involve a seriousdelay in the programme of modernisation which had been putforward early in the previous year. Conditions, especially in mentalhospitals, were deplorable and he was satisfied that the programmeof modernisation could not be retarded without risk of a breakdownin the hospital service. He had already sought to make offsettingeconomies elsewhere in the National Health Service; but the risingexpenditure on the hospital service reflected the rise in the costs ofgoods and services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not hisintention to make an issue of the figure of  1 million which was nowin dispute. But his colleagues should be aware that the cost of theNational Health Service would amount to some  580 millions inthe current year and that expenditure on this scale must help toperpetuate inflation unless steps could be taken to reduce it.The Cabinet agreed that the rising cost of the National HealthService gave cause for serious concern. Even though the hospitalbuilding programme could not be further curtailed, there might bescope for savings elsewhere in the Health Service. With risingpersonal incomes, it might be justifiable to curtail some of theseservices, or to require a higher proportion of the cost to be paid bythe patient. This was one of the subjects to be examined in thecourse of the review of civil expenditure which was to be held inthe autumn.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the proposal made in paragraph 6 of CP. (56) 188.NationalHealthService.CapitalExpenditureon Hospitals.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 6th^Conclusions,Minute 2.)CoalProduction. Pen-castMining.(PreviousReferences:^ M. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 9, and -M- (56) 46th&gt;-0nclusions.Minute 10.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 194) reporting therecommendations of the Committee of Ministers which had beenappointed to formulate a revised policy for the mining of open-castcoal.It was proposed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should beauthorised to announce on a suitable occasion that the productionof open-cast coal was expected to continue at a high level for atleast ten years, and that more generous compensation should be paidboth to landlords and to tenants. An average annual output of12-6 million tons a year was now contemplated over the period1957-65, but special considerations would apply to the two yearsimmediately ahead, and the total output for the years 1957 and 1958taken together would be between 23^ and 25   6 million tons. It wasnot proposed that any new legislation regarding the use of land foropen-cast mining should be introduced in the near future except aspart of legislation dealing comprehensively with the disposal of theemergency powers relating to land.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith these proposals. The following points were made:  (a) The proposals would be more acceptable to farmers if theannouncement of the Government&apos;s intentions to continue open-castmining for ten more years were closely linked to a promise ofadditional compensation.
6The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the rate ofcompensation should be such as would persuade farmers to accept theuse of land for open-cast mining. From the financial and foreignexchange points of view, even the best agricultural land was morevaluable as a source of coal than as a source of food.(b) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, as Scotlandhad only a very small proportion of first-class agricultural land, hehad felt obliged to reserve his position regarding the use of high-gradeagricultural land in East Lothian for open-cast mining. {(c) It was agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power would notapproach the local authorities concerned with regard to the use foropen-cast mining of the seven sites in Yorkshire, mentioned inparagraph 4 of CP. (56) 194, until he had discussed the matter furtherwith the Minister of Housing.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the proposals in C.P. (56) 194.RentRestriction.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 47thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the suggestion thatit might be necessary for them to reconsider their earlier decisionto proceed with legislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts, inview of the intention which the Labour Party had announced tonationalise rented property when they were next returned to power.It was the view of the Cabinet, after further discussion of thisquestion, that their decision of 26th April should be confirmed. Notmerely did the Rent Restriction Acts bear inequitably on landlords,with the result that property was not kept in proper repair, but theyled to injustices as between tenants and reduced the number ofhouses available for renting. It was right that the Governmentshould take steps to remedy a state of affairs which tended to impairthe mobility of labour; and they should not be deterred from thiscourse by the fact that the Opposition had declared their intentionto pursue a policy which would not be compatible with it. TheGovernment were being urged by their supporters to take action onthe lines proposed, and it had been established that such action wouldbe endorsed by the Housing Committee of the Conservative Party-The point was made, however, that the new valuation for ratingwhich was due to come into effect in 1961 was likely to increase therate burden falling on tenants. It was undesirable that tenants shouldbe called upon, in quick succession, to pay increased rates as wellas higher rents. The Committee of Ministers which was nowreviewing local government finance should consider how this mightbe avoided. It was also noted that some difficulties could be expectedto arise in the immediate application of the proposed new legislationon rents to Scotland, where a general revaluation of house propertywould be in progress until 1961.The Cabinet (1) Confirmed their decision of 26th April that legislation toamend the Rent Restriction Acts should be given Prl ? ^in the legislative programme for the forthcoming sessiof Parliament.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the CommitteeMinisters which was reviewing local government finanto consider, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, wproposed consequences of the forthcoming revaluatifor rating as they would affect the private tenant.
Film Policy.(PreviousReference:C.C. (53) 15thConclusions,Minute 8.)7 CM. 55 (56)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 193) on the question ofcontinued financial assistance to the film-producing industry in thiscountry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if an adequate supplyof British films was not forthcoming, there would be a loss of 7-8 millions in foreign exchange, due to a decline in export earningsand the cost of importing additional American films. The film-producing industry would continue to need financial assistance forthis purpose. It was not proposed to make further advances frompublic funds to the National Film Finance Corporation, but it wouldbe necessary to write off the advances of  3-7 millions which hadalready been made. Financial assistance was also afforded to theproducing industry from the proceeds of a levy on the gross receiptsof film exhibitors. This levy served the purpose of a tariff onimported films and, as no satisfactory alternative means of protectingthe home industry could be devised, it would have to be continued.The exhibitors were, however, unwilling that the levy should becontinued on a voluntary basis, and it was proposed to seek statutoryauthority for it. The legislation to give effect to this proposal wouldbe contentious and the Economic Policy Committee, who hadconsidered the matter, had felt some doubts about it; but thePresident of the Board of Trade and he could see no alternative courseof action.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in order to avoida decline in the production of films because of doubts about theGovernment&apos;s intentions, he wished to announce before Parl:amentrose for the summer recess that legislation would be introduced toput the levy on a statutory basis. It would not be enough toannounce in general terms that the producing industry would continueto receive financial assistance.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 193.(2) Authorised, subject to their eventual decision on thecomposition of the legislative programme for theforthcoming session, the preparation of a Bill to give effectto these proposals for the consideration of the LegislationCommittee.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,31st July, 1956.
