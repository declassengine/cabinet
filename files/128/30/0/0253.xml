3CM. 29 (56)Parliament. 1   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was proposed that the House should devote one day in thatweek to the Committee Stage of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.This would enable the Government to assess the attitude of theHouse to the amendments which had been tabled, and to determinetheir tactics in handling the remainder of the Committee Stage.House ofCommonsDisqualification,Mid-UlsterDivision.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet were reminded that it was over four monthssince Mr. Charles Beattie had been found to be disqualified as aMember of Parliament and the issue of a writ for a new electionin the Mid-Ulster Division should not be further delayed. Effortsto persuade the Unionist Party in Mid-Ulster to nominate anothercandidate had proved unsuccessful. Unless an independent Unionistcandidate came forward, the election would resolve itself into acontest between Mr. Thomas Mitchell, who was serving a prisonsentence, and another Nationalist candidate. Indeed, it wasconceivable that Mr. Mitchell might be returned unopposed.The Cabinet agreed that, although this position wasunsatisfactory, there was no alternative but to all &gt;w the electionto go forward. The Ulster Unionists had taken the view that it wasor balance desirable to allow the election to be fought betweenthe Sinn Feiners and the Nationalists and there was somejustification for their reluctance to nominate a candidate.The Cabinet Agreed that a writ should now be issued for a new electionin the Mid-Ulster Division, and that no further pressureshould be exerted on the Mid-Ulster Unionist Party tonominate a candidate in this election.Education.BurnhamCommittee.3. The Cabinet were informed that the Chairman of theBurnham Committee had been advised by his doctors to take nofurther part in the current review of teachers&apos; salaries which theCommittee were conducting. These negotiations had now reacheda difficult stage and it was an awkward moment at which to makea new permanent appointment, especially if the new Chairman wasto be a man who had been active in Party politics. On the otherhand, as the issues with which the Committee were dealing hadbecome a matter of political controversy, it was not desirable thatthe negotiations should be completed under the Chairmanship of anofficial of the Ministry of Education acting as a substitute. In thesecircumstances the best course would be to appoint a suitableindependent person to act temporarily as Chairman until the currentreview was completed.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Education to discuss with theMinister of Labour and report to the Prime Minister on thechoice of a suitable independent person to act temporarilyas Chairman of the Burnham Committee until theCommittee had completed their current review of teachers&apos;salaries.4.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 98) on the political situation in Bahrain.The Foreign Secretary said that since 1954 a group of middle-c.M. (56) 23rd dass Bahrainis calling themselves the High Executive Committee hadconclusions,    been agitating for a more liberal form of government. Their demandsMinute l.)      were moderate and were not at present directed against British49936 3 g 2Bahrain.(PreviousReference :
4interests in Bahrain. The Ruler was, however, stubbornly opposed toconstitutional reform, and he was supported in his view by his adviser,Sir Charles Belgrave. This was a dangerous situation which mightwell turn to our disadvantage. For, unless some of their morereasonable requests were met, the reformers were likely to putforward more extreme demands; and, if they continued to befrustrated, their distrust of Sir Charles Belgrave might develop intogeneral opposition to British influence and interests in Bahrain. SirCharles Belgrave had held this position for thirty years, but he hadnow lost the confidence of most of his British assistants and of manyof the people in London who had interests in the Persian Gulf. TheForeign Secretary therefore recommended that appropriate stepsshould be taken to secure his retirement and that, with this in view,he and the Ruler should be induced to accept the appointment of asuitable British assistant who could be trained to take his place.In discussion it was recognised that the abrupt departure of SirCharles Belgrave from Bahrain following closely on the dismissal ofGeneral Glubb from a somewhat similar position in Jordan- wouldbe a blow to British prestige in the Middle East. The change musttherefore be so arranged as to give the impression that Sir CharlesBelgrave was retiring of his own volition in order to give way to ayounger man. Nothing would be lost by getting a suitable person intoposition as a deputy, so that he might at a convenient opportunitysucceed to the senior post. Much would turn, however, on the choiceof a person of suitable quality and experience. The first step wouldbe to see what candidates were available for this position, and toconsider how the Ruler and Sir Charles Belgrave could best bepersuaded to make such an appointment.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals put forward by theForeign Secretary in C.P. (56) 98.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare, and discuss withthe Prime Minister, a list of the suitable candidates forappointment as assistant to Sir Charles Belgrave inBahrain, and to consider how best to secure that such anappointment was made by the Ruler.Singapore.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 25thConclusions.Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C.P. (56) 97) outlining the course which heproposed to follow in the forthcoming conference on constitutionaldevelopment in Singapore, and a report by the Chiefs of Staff(D.C. (56) 8) on the strategic aspects of this problem.The Colonial Secretary said one of the difficulties in the forth-coming discussions was the insecure position of the Chief Minister,Mr. Marshall, whose Government had only a bare majority of theelected members in the Assembly. In a conversation with a memberof the British Embassy staff in Cairo on his way to London,Mr. Marshall was reported to have said that the talks might wellbreak down on the question of internal security arrangements andthat such a breakdown would not be without its advantages, since herecognised the danger of the Communists gaining control inSingapore and regarded imperialism as preferable to Communism.In the event of a breakdown of the Conference it was important thatwe should be able to defend to world opinion the proposals whichwe had put forward. We should, therefore, be ready to go someway to meet the demands of the Singapore Delegation. Inparagraph 15 of his memorandum he had outlined the proposalswhich he was prepared to make. The most important of these wasthe means of retaining adequate control over internal security. Theproposal of the Singapore Delegation was that internal securityshould be transferred from the Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister,
5CM. 29 (56)and that a Defence Council, consisting of four United Kingdomrepresentatives and four representatives of the Government ofSingapore, should be established under the Chairmanship of theGovernor. The Governor would not, however, have a casting vote,so that in effect the Singapore representatives would be able to vetoany proposal which came before the Council. It was impossible toaccept this proposal and he had, therefore, set out in paragraph 15 (vi)an alternative plan. Under this, the control of the police would betransferred from the Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister, but therewould be a Defence Council, under the Governor, comprising someof the elected Ministers, a Deputy Governor (the present ChiefSecretary), local Service Chiefs and the Commissioner of Police, whichwould be responsible for discussing as a joint responsibility suchquestions of external affairs and defence as affected the localGovernment and the operational aspects of internal security. TheGovernor would have reserve powers enabling him to take commandin internal security matters whenever he saw fit and to call in troops.The Commissioner of Police would have direct access at all times tothe Governor, who would be responsible for senior police appoint-ments until a genuinely independent Police Service Commission withexecutive powers had been appointed.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff saia that the views ofthe Chiefs of Staff on the strategic aspects of this problem were setout in D.C (56) 8. They wished to emphasise two points. First,Singapore could not achieve independence except through federationwith Malaya. Singapore was too small and too vulnerable to main-tain a separate existence, and there was a serious risk that it wouldturn into a Communist satellite. Secondly, our control over internalsecurity in Singapore should not be abandoned until we were satisfiedthat Singapore had raised and trained adequate police and militaryforces to prevent the Communists gaining control. It would beunwise to rely on Mr. Marshall&apos;s claim that the Government ofSingapore would be able to raise adequate local forces within a shortperiod; for such local forces were unlikely to be efficient. There hadalready been a perceptible deterioration in the morale of theSingapore police force during the last six months: if it deterioratedfurther, greater use would have to be made of British troops inrestoring law and order. The local Commanders-in-Chief consideredthat we should retain administrative control of the police, but thatthe elected Ministers should be more closely associated with policeactivities.(b) Singapore was becoming increasingly important as a navalbase. For financial reasons it would probably be necessary toamalgamate the Far East and the East Indies Fleets, and Singaporewas the only base from which the combined theatres of operationcould be adequately covered.(c) The present Commissioner of Police in Singapore was infavour of the proposed transfer of responsibility for the police fromthe Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister in order to make theelected Ministers accept more responsibility for the police. Underthe present arrangements the elected Ministers could dissociatethemselves from any unpopular police action.(d) A policy of increased Malayanisation of the police inSingapore had already been approved. Under the proposals of theColonial Secretary the Governor would, however, retain the powerto appoint all senior police officers until an independent PoliceService Commission had been established. A similar arrangementwas being adopted in Malaya. It should be possible to ensure thatthe Commission was not subject to pressure from elected Ministers.(e) Under the proposals in paragraph 15 (vi) as at present draftedthe Governor would only have reserve powers to intervene in internalsecurity matters in an emergency. It would be preferable that theproposed Defence Council should be empowered to deal effectively at
6all times with such aspects of internal security as might affect thedefence interests of the United Kingdom and other CommonwealthGovernments.(/) The future of Singapore was of importance to the Common-wealth as a whole and particularly to Australia and New Zealand.It might be desirable that Australia and New Zealand should berepresented on the proposed Defence Council. This possibilitycould be kept open by providing that the Council should includeService chiefs of Commonwealth forces in the area.The Cabinet-CD Took note of the views of the Chiefs of Staff as set out inD.C. (56) 8 and stated in the course of discussion.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with the LordPresident, the Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary ofState for War, the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofDefence, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, toamend the proposals for the future control of internalsecurity in Singapore (paragraph 15 (vi) of CP. (56) 97)on the lines indicated in the discussion.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to obtain the views of theCommissioner-General, South-East Asia, and of theBritish Defence Co-ordinating Committee, Far East, onthe amended version of paragraph 15 (vi) of CP. (56) 97.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary similarly to obtain theviews of the Australian and New Zealand Governmentson the amended proposals.(5) Agreed to resume at their next meeting their discussion of thecourse to be followed at the forthcoming conference onconstitutional development in Singapore.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,17th April, 1956
