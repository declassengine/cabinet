3 CM. 26 (56)Somalia and 1.   The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theBritish Foreign Secretary and Colonial Secretary (CP. (56) 84) on futureSomaliland. policy towards an independent Somalia, and a memorandum by the(Previous Colonial Secretary (CP. (56) 89) on the future of British Somaliland.ReferenceC.C. (55) 80th Trie Cabinet first discussed the proposals in CP. (56) 84 on theConclusions,    future of an independent Somalia.   They were informed that theMinute 2.) &apos;     Egyptians were showing increased interest in this area and that largenumbers of Egyptian teachers had recently been brought into it.If, after attaining independence, Somalia fell under Egyptianinfluence, this would represent a direct threat to the security ofKenya; and, if Egyptian influence also extended to the Sudan, thesecurity of all British territories in East Africa would be threatened.If Somalia was to be kept under Western influence, she would needfinancial assistance and technical help from the West. The Cabinetagreed that this could not be provided by the United Kingdom alone.If we accepted any fresh commitments in this area, we must do soin association with other Powers. If a consortium of Western Powerscould be established for this purpose, Ethiopia should logically beassociated with it.   This, however, would be unacceptable to&apos; theSomalis.  With a view to improving relations between Ethiopia andthe Somalis and, more immediately, for the benefit of BritishSomaliland, our first aim should be to seek a solution of the problemof Somali grazing rights in the Haud.    For this purpose it wassuggested that Ethiopia might be asked to cede the Haud to BritishSomaliland in return for a cash payment of not less than  5 millionsand certain other concessions set out in paragraph 9 of CP. (56) 84.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Foreign Secretary said that he was making enquiriesabout the reported increase in the numbers of Egyptians who werebeing brought into Somalia, as teachers and in other positions. Ifthe facts justified such an approach, he would make representationsabout this to the Italian Government.(h) It was doubtful whether the Ethiopian Government would bewilling to entertain the suggestion that they should voluntarily cedea portion of their territory. On the other hand, if the offer weremade and refused, we should at least be able to inform the Somalisthat we had made this effort on their behalf.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was far fromsatisfied that we should be justified in making any cash payment forthe cession of this territory. Even if the Ethiopians were willing toconsider the possibility, they were likely to ask for substantiallymore than the minimum figure of  5 millions which was mentionedin CP. (56) 84. Whatever the sum, we should have to pay it in goldor dollars; and in present circumstances he would be most reluctantto accept such a commitment.In discussion it was argued that, if the whole of this area fellunder the influence of hostile Powers, we should face a much heaviercommitment in safeguarding the security of other British possessionsin East Africa. It was, however, suggested that the Ethiopians mightbe willing to accept compensation in kind, instead of cash. Theywere beginning to show interest in sea power; and they might bewilling to accept, at least in part payment, some of the warships whichwe were now keeping in the lowest class of reserve.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that this memorandum unfolded large possibilities, which couldonly be approached by stages. The Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Dodds-Parker) was shortly under-taking a mission to Ethiopia during which he would be discussingthe question of Somali-Ethiopian relations. In the course of hisnegotiations he might tentatively explore the possibility of a cession49935 3 b 2
4of territory to British Somaliland. He could not be authorised at thisstage to offer any cash payment; but he might, if opportunity offered,canvass the possibility that the Ethiopians might accept somewarships in return for a cession of territory. The Prime Ministeradded that he would himself send a personal message to the Emperorof Ethiopia seeking his co-operation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give instructions to theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Mr. Dodds-Parker) along the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister in summing up the discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would send, throughMr. Dodds-Parker, a personal message to the Emperorof Ethiopia inviting his co-operatiomThe Cabinet then discussed the proposals in C.P. (56) 89 on thefuture of British Somaliland.The Colonial Secretary said that he hoped the Cabinet wouldagree that the Governor of British Somaliland should be authorisedto make a statement to the Somali leaders on the lines indicated inparagraph 9 of C.P. (56) 89. In reply to questions he said that theGovernor would not b&apos;e drawn into discussion of the date by whichBritish Somaliland might expect to achieve self-government: it wouldbe made clear in the statement that the United Kingdom Governmentwere not at present prepared to lay down any definite time-table ofconstitutional development. He also confirmed that there should beno occasion for any public announcement in this country about thefuture course of constitutional development in British Somaliland.In further discussion the point was made that the nature andbasis of constitutional development in the Protectorate would turnto some extent on the strategic value of the Protectorate to the Britishposition in this part of the world.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (4) below, the Governorof British Somaliland might be authorised to make astatement on the lines indicated in paragraph 9 ofC.P. (56) 89.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange that, before anysuch statement was made, the French Government wereconsulted and the Governments of Italy and Ethiopiawere informed.(5) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the Chiefs ofStaff to submit an appreciation of the strategic value ofBritish Somaliland to the British position in this area.2. The Prime Minister said that he had been consideringwhether he should give a broadcast talk on television a few daysbefore the visit of the Soviet leaders to this country. He thought itmight be useful, for the purpose of guiding public opinion, if hetook such an opportunity to put the visit in its proper context. Thiswould, of course, be a Ministerial broadcast, not a Party politicalbroadcast. He was anxious to establish the convention thatMinisterial broadcasts could be made on television: the BritishBroadcasting Corporation were willing that such a convention shouldbe established: and this might be a suitable subject on which tomake a start.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be 0advantageous to establish the principle that Ministerial broadcastsBroadcasting.MinisterialBroadcasts.
5CM. 26 (56)could be made on television, and that this would be a convenientopportunity to do so if the Prime Minister were satisfied that, onthe merits, a talk on foreign affairs could with advantage be broadcastshortly before the visit of the Soviet leaders. On this latter pointthe Prime Minister would doubtless prefer to take his final decisiona little nearer the time.The Cabinet _ (1) Agreed that it was desirable in principle that a conventionW should be established that Ministerial broadcasts couldbe made by television as well as sound broadcasting.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would decide, in the lightof their discussion, whether the first such broadcast shouldbe made by him shortly before the visit of the Sovietleaders to this country.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (56) 90) summarising the course of the strikeof the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers at Birkenhead.The Minister of Labour said that this strike was particularlysignificant in two respects, ft illustrated the weakness of the TradesUnion Congress in exercising authority over their constituentorganisations. It also illustrated the tenacity with which workersin trades that were declining because of technical developmentsfought to resist encroachment on their traditional sphere of employ-ment. Earlier in the day he had made a statement on the strike inParliament on the lines of the draft annexed to his memorandum,and he had been supported by Opposition leaders in recommendingthat work should be resumed forthwith and that the dispute shouldbe settled through the established procedure. After the Easter recesshe would discuss with the National Joint Advisory Committee forIndustry what further action might be taken to avoid the repetitionof such a situation, and he would report to the Cabinet the resultsof those consultations.The Cabinet were in agreement with the course proposed by theMinister, fn discussion it was pointed out that this strike hadcontinued because of the local influence of Communist leaders, andit was suggested that the Minister should take appropriate steps toensure that this was more generally known.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP. (56) 91) covering a memorandum by officials oncertain difficulties which were likely to arise in completing thedenationalisation of the iron and steel industry if the RestrictivePractices Bill was to apply to that industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the denationalisationof steel had proceeded on the assumption that the &quot; Industry Fund,&quot;a device for averaging the price of foreign and domestic supplies ofiron ore, would continue to exist. This Fund served an importantpurpose in the industry; but, if it were to be subject to the RestrictivePractices Court, it might well be impracticable to complete thedenationalisation of steel by disposing of the two remaining largeundertakings.  Moreover, the Government would be exposed to theIndustrialDisputes.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 12thConclusions,Minute 4.)Shipbuilding.RestrictivePracticesBiU.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)Iron and SteelIndustry.
6charge of a breach of faith in connection with the conditions of saleon which two-thirds of the industry had already been denationalised.These consequences had not been put to the Cabinet when they haddecided, on 14th February, that the iron and steel industry shouldbe brought within the scope of the Restrictive Practices Bill. He feltthat some compromise solution must now be sought.The President of the Board of Trade said that he did not fullyshare the view of the Chairman of the Iron and Steel Holding andRealisation Agency that uncertainty about the conditions whichgoverned the price of the industry&apos;s raw material would in itself makeit impossible to sell the two remaining companies. There could beno certainty that the industry would continue to operate the Fund,as some companies were opposed to it. If, however, the Chairmanof the Realisation Agency adhered to his view, the difficulty mightbe surmounted by putting the Industry Fund on a statutory basisunder sections J1 and 13 of the Iron and Steel Act, 1953. This wouldremove it from the jurisdiction of the Restrictive Practices Court.The Cabinet agreed that a compromise should be sought, alongthe lines suggested by the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to consider, in consultation with theChairman of the Iron and Steel Board and the Chairman ofthe Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency, whetherthe Industry Fund of the iron and steel industry could notbe placed on a statutory basis in such a manner as to removeit from the jurisdiction of the Restrictive Practices Court.Civil Service.RoyalCommission.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on4th January the Cabinet had indicated their general approval of therecommendations made by the Royal Commission on the Civil Serviceand had agreed that the Official Side of the National Whitley Councilshould enter into negotiations on them with the Staff Side. Thesenegotiations had now been completed. Agreement had been reachedon all points. Since, however, the recommendations had beenrelated to conditions in outside employment as at July, 1955, andsince outside rates of remuneration had improved since then, it hadbeen necessary to negotiate an addition of 5+ per cent., limited tosalaries below  1,600 a year, in order to preserve the relation withconditions in outside employment. As a result, the cost of therecommendations for the Civil Service, excluding Post Office workers,would now be  14 millions, and the addition to wages of Post Officeworkers would be  11 millions. The total annual cost of salariesand wages in the Civil Service as a whole was about  400 millions.The Chancellor said that this forthcoming increase in salariesmade it all the more important that no time should be lost in givingfull effect to the Government&apos;s announced policy of reducing thenumbers employed in the Civil Service.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Malta.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 25thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Prime Minister said that on 28th March he hadannounced in the House of Commons, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;sdecision of 27th March, that the Government would proceed in duecourse with legislation giving effect to the recommendations of theRound Table Conference on Malta. He had made it clear that thepart of the Bill which related to the representation of Malta in the
7CM. (26) 56Parliament at Westminster would be brought into operation only ifand when the Maltese people had shown their desire for it in a generalelection. Members of the Labour Opposition had sought to construethis part of his statement as implying that the Bill would not bepassed into law until after a further election had been held in Malta.This was not in fact his intention. He contemplated that thelegislation would be so framed that one Part of it, dealing withMaltese representation at Westminster, could be brought intooperation, whether by Order in Council or by other means, at a dateto be determined after the passage of the Act.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,29th March, 1956.
