.1CM. 99 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. A debate on theeconomic situation would be held on 20th December, and it wasagreed that the Minister of Labour and the Economic Secretary,Treasury, should be the Government spokesmen.The House was expected to rise for the Christmas recess on21st December.Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 98thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a revised draft (CP. (56) 281)of the proposed statement of policy in regard to constitutionaladvance in Cyprus.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Prime Minister, to whom asummary of the statement had been telegraphed, had expressed con-cern about the reference to partition. He had suggested that, ifpartition had to be contemplated, it should provide a share of theIsland for ourselves as well as for the Greeks and Turks. Meanwhile,the Foreign Secretary had reported from Paris that pressure wasmounting to have the problem of Cyprus discussed by the NorthAtlantic Council. The Foreign Secretary was resisting this; but hethought it would now be to our advantage to make the proposedstatement of policy before the Christmas recess. On the other handthe Opposition had intimated that they were concerned to discuss,before the House rose, no more than the recent security regulationswhich had been introduced in Cyprus, and were not intending to pressfor a general debate.The Lord President said that the proposed statement, as revised,made no mention of a plebiscite; and the passage which set out theconditions which must be satisfied before self-determination could beconsidered had been revised in such a way as to put the prospect ofpartition into a more accurate perspective. The Foreign Secretary&apos;sreport reinforced the case for making the statement before the recess.But the prospect of partition, once it had been disclosed, would beliable to dominate discussion thereafter and to exert an undueinfluence on the future course of events. Partition ought not to bementioned unless the Government were prepared, howeverreluctantlv. to contemplate it as a reality; and further considerationshould be given to the possibility of discussing our intentions withthe Greeks and Turks in terms which included no direct reference topartition.The Colonial Secretary said that a partition of Cyprus into threeparts, rather than two, need not be excluded. But the question ofpartition would not arise until the Island was no longer needed as abase and, when that stage had been reached, a tripartite divisionwould be unnecessary. The prospect of partition as a possibleultimate solution, would, however, give the Turks an effective vetoagainst Enosis; and the Turks would not even acquiesce in ourproposals if this possibility were not foreshadowed. It did not followthat partition would become an inevitable solution. The choice ofthis alternative would not be put to the Cypriot population beforethey had been invited to remain under British sovereignty; and, withthe help of the new constitution, they might well express such apreference.Meanwhile, the postponement of a statement would notcontribute towards a solution of the present problem. The situationin Cyprus would deteriorate, the Government would be heldresponsible for the further casualties which would undoubtedlyoccur, and they would be charged with lack of initiative. It wouldtherefore be to our disadvantage to defer a statement until thequestion of Cyprus was about to be debated in the United Nations.The Government would, moreover, be in an embarrassing positionin the debate in Parliament in the following week if, in attemptingto defend the exceptionally severe security regulations, they wereunable to reveal the existence of any more constructive policy.51078 1 b 2
4For all these reasons he urged that Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report andthe proposed statement should be published before the Christmasrecess, and that consultations with the Greeks and Turks should takeplace immediately. H.M. Ambassadors in both Greece and Turkeyhad advised that the prospect of collaboration from bothGovernments-would be increased if he himself were to visit theircapitals for these consultations and, with his colleagues&apos; approval,he proposed to leave on the following day. He would accept nodefinite commitment in regard to partition, and would represent thepolicy set out in the proposed statement as merely the lines on whichthe Government were at present thinking.Further discussion showed that the Cabinet were agreed thatthe balance of advantage lay in making a statement of policy on thelines proposed before Parliament rose for the recess. On the questionof partition it was not possible at present to foresee a time when weshould have no strategic interest in Cyprus; and, while it might betheoretically possible to partition the Island in such a way that weretained control of no more than a military base, this solution wasimpracticable in the light of our need to enjoy, in addition, adequateport facilities at Famagusta (which would lie in the Turkish sector)and to maintain an early warning system covering the whole Island.Nevertheless, it was now urgently necessary to make a furtherattempt to resolve the problems of Cyprus, and even the limitedcollaboration of the Greeks and the Turks, on which the successof our efforts must depend, could not be secured if the prospect ofultimate partition was withheld.   It was essential that we shouldretain the initiative, in view of the risk that we might later appear,if we deferred action now, to have been forced into making anadvance as a result of international pressure.The Cabinet considered whether it was expedient that a CabinetMinister should visit Greece and Turkey, especially in view of theattitude which Greece had hitherto adopted towards the Cyprusproblem. Our proposals might meet with a rebuff, which would bemore damaging if they had been presented by a Minister than ifdiscussions had been conducted through diplomatic channels. Onthe other hand, this opportunity for a settlement might not recur,and both our Ambassadors had strongly advised that theconsultations should be conducted by the Colonial Secretary.It was agreed that copies of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report should bemade available, when these consultations were taking place, to theUnited States Ambassadors in London, Athens and Ankara, to theUnited States Consul-General in Cyprus, and to the HighCommissioners in London of the older Commonwealth countries.It was also agreed that copies of the report should be made availableto Opposition leaders during the current week.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle, subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s laterapproval and to the outcome of consultations with theGreek and Turkish Governments, that Lord Radcliffe&apos;sreport on a constitution for Cyprus should be publishedin the following week, together&apos;with a statement of policyon the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56) 281.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to visit Athens andAnkara forthwith for the necessary consultations.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 98thConclusions,Minute 3.)Withdrawal ofAnglo-Frenchforce.3. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Foreign Secretary hadreported from Paris that the French Government had again refusedto accept a date earlier than 22nd December for the completion ofthe withdrawal of the Anglo-French force from Port Said. Thisextension of the process of withdrawal beyond the date of completionwhich we ourselves had provisionally fixed carried certain risks fromthe military point of view; and it was also liable to expose us tocriticism from the United States Government that we had nothonoured the understanding on this subject, on the strength of which
5C.M. 99 (56)they had given us their support in the International Monetary Fund.Nevertheless, it appeared impossible to dissuade the FrenchGovernment from the course which they proposed to follow; and,since it was not practicable for us to differ from them on this point,there was no alternative to accepting 22nd December as the finaldate for the completion of the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Defence,to instruct the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forcethat the withdrawal from Port Said should not becompleted until 22nd December.Clearance of jhe Lord Privy Seal said that the Foreign Secretary wasthe Canal. disturbed by the apparent lack of progress in clearing the Canal andwas proposing to send the Secretary-General of the United Nationsa telegram reminding him vigorously of the understanding on thissubject which we regarded ourselves as having reached with hirn.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The fact that the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force wasnow to be prolonged by several days might be turned to advantagein this connection.(b) There were indications that the Secretary-General himselfwas not satisfied with the attitude of General Wheeler towards theclearance of the Canal; and a firmly worded telegram from theForeign Secretary might, therefore, reach him at an opportunemoment.(c) General Wheeler was reported to have agreed with theEgyptian Government that clearance of the rest of the Canal wouldnot begin until the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force wascomplete. If this report was correct, it represented a clear breachof our understanding with the Secretary-General that clearancewould proceed as rapidly as was technically possible, without regardto other considerations.id) The most reliable estimate which was possible at presentsuggested that the time required to clear the Canal, if only theresources at the disposal of the United Nations were used, wouldbe approximately double the time required if those resources weresupplemented by our own salvage fleet. This point should be putforcefully to the Secretary-General. It was also for considerationwhether, in order to accelerate the process of clearance, we shouldput the crews of our naval vessels in civilian clothes and offer toaccept representatives of the United Nations as observers on boardthese ships as a guarantee of our good faith.(e) Unless the obstacles in the way of British participation inthe further clearance of the Canal could be overcome, we might becompelled to withdraw our salvage vessels and their crews entirely.Alternatively, we should represent to the Secretary-General that, inthe light of what appeared to be a breach of our clear understandingwith him about the clearance of the Canal, we had no choice butto reconsider our whole policy towards the United Nations.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to informthe Foreign Secretary of the points made in theirdiscussion, as material which he might use at hisdiscretion to strengthen the message which he proposedto send to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.Prisoners of J he Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Defence, said that itWar- was now urgently necessary to decide whether we would hand overour Egyptian prisoners of war to the Commander of the UnitedNations force or remove them from Egypt, possibly to Cyprus, inorder to negotiate their surrender against the release and repatriationof the War Office contractors&apos; staffs now interned in Egypt.
6In discussion the following points were made:  (/) We had no legal justification for retaining prisoners of warafter hostilities had ceased, and it would be unwise to try to bargaintheir release against a corresponding release of our own nationals.The Secretary-General of the United Nations was already pressingthe Egyptian Government to repatriate the War Office contractors&apos;staffs, and he should be encouraged to maintain this pressure  independently of any action on our part as regards our Egyptianprisoners of war.(g) On the other hand it would not be possible to defend topublic opinion in this country an arrangement whereby wesurrendered our own prisoners of war, while leaving the War Officecontractors&apos; staffs in the hands of the Egyptian Government as abargaining counter which they would undoubtedly employ in allthe various negotiations which lay ahead.(A) The Governor of Cyprus foresaw considerable difficulty inaccommodating Egyptian prisoners of war in Cyprus.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to resume, at their next meeting, consideration ofthe treatment of our Egyptian prisoners of war.(4) Invited the Colonial Secretary to investigate further thepossibility of transferring the Egyptian prisoners of warto Cyprus, if the Cabinet should decide to retain theseprisoners under our control.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,12th December, 1956.
