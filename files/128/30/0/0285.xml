CM. 61 (56)Suez Canal 1.   The Foreign Secretary reported the progress made in the(Previous        international conference on the Suez Canal.Reference *CM. (56) 60th      I* now seemed likely that 18 of the 22 countries representedConclusions,    at the conference would support the statement of principles tabledMinute l) &apos;    hy the United States Delegation. These countries would then appointa committee of five to explain the purposes and objectives of thestatement to the Egyptians and to ascertain whether they wouldagree to negotiate a new treaty on the basis of these principles. The. committee would consist of representatives of Ethiopia, Iran, SwedenP and the United States, under the chairmanship of Mr. Menzies. Thedecision to appoint this committee would not, in form, be a decisionof the conference; but it would be recorded in the proceedings ofthe conference that this action was to be taken on behalf of the18 countries which had supported the statement of principles. Theproceedings of the conference could then be concluded by the issueof a suitable communique, which might make it plain that four ofthe countries represented would have preferred a different course ofaction.On this basis the conference might be brought to an end thatafternoon. The committee of five would then meet and arrangefor the immediate despatch of the statement of principles to theEgyptian Government. Their next task would be to ascertainwhether the Egyptians desired a meeting and, if so, where it couldbe held. It was recognised that it would be undesirable that sucha meeting should be held in Cairo: a neutral capital, such as Rome,was to be preferred.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Secretary ofState was hoping to leave London on the following day. Beforehe left, however, he was willing to discuss the action which mightbe taken if the statement of principles was rejected outright by theEgyptian Government. He wished, in the first instance, to discussthis question with representatives of the United Kingdom andFrance; but he was willing that some of its aspects should beconsidered thereafter at a wider meeting attended by representativesof other countries which might be in a position to bring pressureto bear on the Egyptian Government. No indication had yet beengiven of the attitude which the United States Government wouldtake if the statement of principles were rejected by Egypt; but, asthey had themselves sponsored the statement and had played so largea part in securing its adoption by a majority of the conference, itseemed reasonable to assume that they would continue to do theirutmost to bring about a settlement in conformity with the statement.In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion the following points were raised:  (a) If the Egyptians accepted the offer of a meeting with theproposed committee of five, one of the matters on which they werelikely to ask for further explanation was the reference, in thepreamble to the statement, to the payment of just and faircompensation to Egypt for the use of the Canal. Some work onthis had been done by officials of the United Kingdom Government,and an estimate had been made of the amount which might beavailable, from the revenues of the Canal, both for payments toEgypt and for compensation to the Suez Canal Company.Mr. Menzies might find it useful to have the results of this workfor use in any discussions which he might have with the Egyptians.The Secretary of the Cabinet was authorised to send a copy of thereport (E.C (56) 32) to Mr. Menzies.lb) The Suez Canal Company had suggested that the time hadnow come to advise their pilots to withdraw their services. TheMinister of Transport said that he hoped the Company would bedissuaded from giving this advice. If it were given and followed,traffic through the Canal would be substantially reduced. Thiswould have a double disadvantage: the blame for the interruptionof traffic through the Canal would be attributed to the Governments
4of the United Kingdom and France; and the interruption wouldinvolve us in a serious loss of oil supplies, apart from its generaleffects on our commercial interests. He considered that theGovernment should themselves retain the discretion to decide whenthe foreign pilots should be withdrawn from the Canal. Meanwhile,he suggested that any British pilots now on leave who were willingtemporarily to return to their duties should be encouraged to do soso as to relieve colleagues whose leave was already overdue.In discussion the view was expressed that, if the Egyptians^declined to negotiate a new treaty on the basis of the statement o9principles adopted at the international conference, it would bereasonable that those pilots who were unwilling to serve under thenew Authority should leave their employment. That being so, itwould be inexpedient to encourage pilots now on leave to return totheir employment. It would, however, be useful if the committeeof five could take an early opportunity of issuing a statementon this point. This might recall that British and French employeesof the Suez Canal Company had been asked by their Governmentsto remain at their posts until the end of the international conference.It could go on to say that, after consulting those Governments, thecommittee now asked these employees to continue to carry out theirduties while the committee were conducting their consultations withthe Egyptian Government.The Prime Minister, at the end of the discussion, expressed theCabinet&apos;s gratitude to Mr. Menzies for the valuable part which hehad played in the conference and for the further help which he hadundertaken to give in presenting the conclusions of the conferenceto the Egyptian Government. The Cabinet could look forward tothe next stage with much greater confidence now that they knewthat he would preside over the committee which would handle it.The Prime Minister and Mr. Menzies also expressed theirappreciation of the skill and patience shown by the Foreign Secretaryin guiding, as Chairman, the proceedings of the internationalconference.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement, and of thepoints raised in the ensuing discussion.2. In the light of the discussion recorded in the precedingMinute the Cabinet resumed their consideration of the timing of ameeting of Parliament to review the Suez situation.There was general agreement that, as there was now a possibilityof early discussions with the Egyptian Government, it would beinexpedient for Parliament to meet as early as 28th August. Indeed,there would be disadvantages in convening Parliament before it wasknown what attitude the Egyptians would take towards theconclusions of the international conference. It was difficult at presentto see how the situation would develop, and the question of recallingParliament would need to be kept under review from day to day.The Cabinet Authorised the Egypt Committee to decide, on their behalf,when Parliament should be convened to review the Suezsituation.Parliament(PreviousReference :CM.
