3CM. 98 (56)Cypras.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 70thConclusions,Minute 7.)C1.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda:  CP. (56) 264: by the Colonial Secretary covering LordRadcliffe&apos;s report on future constitutional development inCyprus;CP. (56) 272: by the Colonial Secretary commenting on LordRadcliffe&apos;s proposals and recommending their adoption;CP. (56) 273: by the Secretary of the Cabinet covering a draft,prepared by the Colonial Policy Committee, of a statementof Government policy in regard to further constitutionaladvance in Cyprus.The Lord President said that the Colonial Policy Committee,who had studied Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report, had been greatly impressedby the skill with which he had contrived to achieve a balance betweenmajority and minority interests in Cyprus. They recommended thatthe report should be accepted and an undertaking given to put itinto effect as soon as conditions would allow. In the announcementof policy which would be made on the publication of the report itwas proposed to foreshadow the possibility that it might ultimatelybe necessary to resort to partition when self-determination eventuallycame to be applied. This had caused the Committee much concern.They had, however, been satisfied there was no prospect of securingGreek acquiescence in the introduction of the new constitution unlesssome further statement were made on self-determination, and thatTurkish acquiescence could not be secured unless some referencewas made to the eventual possibility of partition.The Committee had also felt that it would be inappropriate ina statement of Government policy to refer to further consultationswith Archbishop Makarios. The intention to hold these consultationscould more suitably be disclosed in reply to supplementary Questions.The Colonial Secretary said that he had now reached agreementwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the two points which theColonial Policy Committee had been unable to resolve. First, ithad been agreed that Cyprus should contribute out of her ownrevenues a specified sum, related to her contribution in 1954, towardsthe cost of the police services and that the balance of the cost wouldbe borne by the Exchequer. Secondly, it had been agreed that theGovernment of Cyprus should be required by precept to contributeabout  150,000 annually towards the cost of intercommunaleducation, and that the Exchequer would then make a contributiontowards capital costs and any increase in current charges.Discussion showed that the Cabinet shared the misgivings feltby the Colonial Policy Committee about the need to foreshadowat this stage, in a statement concerned primarily with the introductionof representative institutions in Cyprus, the ultimate possibility ofpartitioning the Island.  The following points were made:- (a) A reference in the proposed statement to a &quot; right&quot; ofself-determination, combined with the mention of partition, mightbe turned to mischievous account in reviving the question of theIrish Settlement. It was agreed that the phrasing of the statementshould be re-examined from this point of view. It might be sufficientto indicate that, when the time came, the Government would beguided by their view that the principle of self-determination shouldbe applied in a manner which would ensure that self-determinationwas enjoyed by Turkish Cypriots no less than by Greek Cypriots.(b) Partition might well prove to be the only ultimate solution.The Government might, however, find themselves in an anomalousposition if they attempted to pursue a policy of constitutional advancewhich was subject from the beginning to the condition that the Islandmight eventually be partitioned against the wishes of the majority ofthe inhabitants.51077 3 b 2
4(c) The Chiefs of Staff had advised that the Island would needto remain under a unified sovereignty so long as it was required asa military base and the possibility of partition could not, therefore,arise until this period had come to an end.(d) Some doubt was expressed about the expediency of givingat this stage an undertaking to submit the question of self-deter-mination to a plebiscite. It was pointed out, in reply, that on thisquestion the Cypriot population as a whole might express a different ^view from that of their elected representatives. Moreover, a wreference to a plebiscite would do much to attract the support ofpublic opinion in Greece.The Cabinet next considered, in the light of the doubts raisedin their discussion, whether it would be practicable to carry out thenecessary consultations with the Greek and Turkish Governmentsand to make a further statement of policy on Cyprus before theChristmas recess.The Lord Privy Seal said that discussion had shewn the need fortime for further reflection on this matter. The drafting of theproposed statement should also be reconsidered. He foresawParliamentary difficulty in making this statement of policy beforethe Christmas recess. In any event the Government could notproceed in a matter of this importance without giving the PrimeMinister an opportunity to consider it on his return.The Colonial Secretary said that he accepted the need for furthertime for consideration, and the consultations which he was proposingto have with the Greek and Turkish Governments would have tobe delayed accordingly. Nevertheless, of the various courses ofaction open to the Government, it would not in his view be possibleto publish Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report without an accompanyingstatement of policy. He must continue to press for an early decisionin the hope that a statement could be made before the House rose.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Policy Committee to re-examine, in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, the draft statementannexed to C.P. (56) 273 and, in particular, the eighthand ninth paragraphs dealing with self-determination andpartition.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting on thefollowing day.Singapore.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C.P. (56) 274) covering a memorandum by the ColonialSecretary on constitutional development in Singapore, and a note bythe Colonial Secretary (C.P. (56) 277) on certain points of detailarising from his memorandum.The Colonial Secretary said that the Chief Minister of Singaporewould shortly be visiting London to discuss arrangements for aconference early in the following year on the future constitution ofSingapore. The Chief Minister had already shown that his approachto this problem was more statesmanlike than that of his predecessor,and there were strong arguments in favour of seeking to reach apolitical settlement with him. The essence of such a settlementwould be the offer made to the Government of Singapore in thepreceding April, subject to amendment in two respects:  (i) We should no longer seek to retain direct powers ofintervention in internal affairs, provided that satisfactory machinerywas established for consultation between the local Government and
5C.M. 98 (56)representatives of the United Kingdom Government on internalsecurity matters and that our own security and intelligence require-ments were adequately met. For this purpose an Internal SecurityCouncil would be established, on which the United Kingdom wouldbe represented. As originally conceived, this Council did notcomprise any spokesman of the Federation of Malaya; but the ChiefMinister had now revived an earlier proposal that the Federationshould have a representative on the Council, with a casting vote.The Governor of Singapore was opposed to this suggestion; but itmight be unwise to reject it outright, since representation of theFederation on the Council would probably strengthen our owncontrol over the internal security of Singapore.(ii) The Chief Minister attached great importance to the proposalthat The Queen&apos;s Representative under the new constitution shouldbe a local personage of standing. Although such an appointmentwould be unprecedented at the present stage of constitutionaldevelopment in Singapore, an imaginative concession on this pointmight prove to be the key to a new and stable arrangement. Itwould, however, be essential that the representative of the UnitedKingdom, who would no longer be The Queen&apos;s Representative,should remain in close touch with the local Government, should beproperly consulted on matters affecting external affairs and defence(which would be reserved to the United Kingdom) and should havestatutory power to suspend the constitution and to assumeresponsibility for the Government.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The new constitution would be in effect a dyarchy, overwhich The Queen&apos;s Representative would preside in a purelyceremonial capacity. There was, however, no precedent tor anarrangement whereby, in the event of its becoming necessary tosuspend the constitution, the power to take this step and to call forthe support of British troops would be vested, not in The Queen sRepresentative (who would normally be also the Commander-in-Chief), but in a representative of the United Kingdom Governmentwho would himself be the head of only one side of the dyarchy Theconstitutional implications of such an arrangement needed furtherconsideration.(b) Since it was proposed that, under any agreement with theGovernment of Singapore, we should retain the naval base under ourown control, it was for consideration whether the base should notbe entirely excluded from the scope of the agreement. On the otherhand, if we attempted to maintain an enclave ol purely Britishterritory within a Colony which would henceforward enjoy a largemeasure of self-government, the rest of the Colony might be givenan impetus to withdraw from the Commonwealth.(c) Although preliminary discussions with the Chief Minister ofSingapore should proceed on the lines suggested, the Cabinet shouldbe given a further opportunity to consider the issues involved beforeany final decision was taken.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for further con-sideration to be given to the constitutional implicationsof the proposed arrangement whereby The Queen&apos;sRepresentative in Singapore would be a local personage,while the representative of the United KingdomGovernment would be required to discharge a numberof important duties including, if necessary, the suspensionof the constitution.(2) Invited  the  Colonial  Secretary to  be guided, in hisforthcoming consultations with the Chief Minister of
6Singapore, by the considerations which had emergedduring their discussion, and to report further to theCabinet before the Government were finally committedto the policy to be pursued at the conference on theconstitution of Singapore in the following year.Suez Canal. 3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the situation in w(Previous        the Suez Canal area.c M%?&lt;s&gt;Q7 h The Minister  f Slate f r Foreign Affairs {Lord Reading) saidCM (56) 97th that tjje Secretary-General of the United Nations was now proposingConclusions, (teiegram No. 1631 from New York) that the Allied salvage fleetMmute l.) should continue, under United Nations auspices, to complete thetask of clearing Port Said; that six of our heavy lifting craft shouldthereafter be used, with non-British crews, to begin clearing theCanal to the south of the area which we occupied; and that the restof our salvage fleet should be held in reserve (e.g., at Cyprus) incase General Wheeler, who had been placed in command of theUnited Nations salvage operation, subsequently found that he neededfurther resources for this purpose.At the same time the Foreign Secretary had warned the UnitedStates Secretary of State (Paris telegram No. 457) that progress onclearance of the Canal appeared to be very slow and that, since wecould not leave our salvage ships at Port Said without their crewswhen the Anglo-French troops left Egypt, we should have to beginwithdrawing them by 12th December if no satisfactory arrangementsfor their use had been made by then.There thus appeared to be some risk that, if we adhered to ourintention of beginning to move our salvage vessels from Port Saidon 12th December, we might prejudice the negotiations for theiremployment which were now proceeding both in Washington andin Paris. It was for consideration whether the withdrawal of thesevessels should not be delayed for some days.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The withdrawal of our salvage fleet had been timed to beginon 12th December since the operation would extend over five orsix days, and it was desirable that it should be completed not laterthan the date (provisionally fixed for 18th December) on which thelast units of the Anglo-French force would leave Egypt. On theother hand, it was not essential that the two operations shouldcoincide in time, since we had already offered to make our salvagefleet available to the United Nations for clearance of the Canal,provided that the United Nations accepted responsibility for theirprotection and that they continued to be operated by their owncrews.(b) On the basis of the best estimate which we could make inthe absence of facilities for direct inspection of that section of theCanal which remained blocked, it was thought that, if the UnitedNations did not employ our salvage fleet, the clearance of the Canalwould take between one and two months longer than it would ifour own ships were fully employed for this purpose. This pointshould be put forcefully to General Wheeler by the officer in chargeof the Anglo-French salvage fleet.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (LordReading) to inform the Foreign Secretary that, while wewere still unable to authorise the transfer of our salvageships to United Nations command without their crews, we ^were prepared to postpone for a short time the date on ^which the withdrawal of these ships was due to begin,
7CM. 98 (56)in the hope that the political negotiations now proceedingat the United Nations and the technical discussions whichwere about to start at Port Said would produce anacceptable arrangement for the employment of our shipsand crews, under United Nations auspices, in the clearanceof the rest of the Suez Canal.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 96thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Financial Secretary, Treasury, informed the Cabinetthat satisfactory arrangements had been made to enable theGovernment to draw dollars from the International Monetary Fundup to the full amount of their quota of $1,300 millions. There wouldbe an immediate drawing of about $561 millions; and, in addition,there would be a standby arrangement by which the equivalent ofabout $738 millions in foreign currencies could be bought fromthe Fund with sterling at any time during the next twelve months.Our application to the Fund had been received in a friendly spirit,and had commanded strong support from the United Statesrepresentative. The Egyptian representative had abstained fromvoting on it, but no vote had been cast against it.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Export of Arms.Argentina.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty, said that theArgentine Navy were anxious to buy from us an aircraft carrierof the Glory class. The Admiralty could make such a vessel availableand were anxious to sell it. The political and economicconsiderations were in favour of this transaction. The strategicissues involved were perhaps more open to argument, for theacquisition of this carrier might increase the power of Argentina tothreaten our bases in Antarctica. On the other hand, if we declinedto sell the carrier on this account, it was likely that the Argentineswould be able to obtain one without difficulty from the UnitedStates. The balance of the argument therefore seemed to he on theside of proceeding with the sale.The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Office and theTreasury supported this proposal.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in view of their interestin the Antarctic, the Governments of Australia and New Zealandshould be informed in advance of this proposal.The Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusion (2) below, authorised the First Lordof the Admiralty to proceed with the sale of an aircraftcarrier of the Glory class to the Argentine Navy.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for advanceinformation about this sale, and the reasons for it, tobe communicated to the Governments of Australia andNew Zealand.
b&apos;Broadcasting.The FortnightRule.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet were informed that no further progress hadbeen made towards an agreement with the Opposition Parties onthe application of the rules designed to prevent anticipation ofParliamentary debate in programmes broadcast by the BritishBroadcasting Corporation or the Independent Television Authority.Opinion on this question within the Labour Party seemed still to bedivided.The Postmaster-General suggested that in these circumstancesit might be preferable to seek an assurance from all the broadcastingauthorities that, if the Government suspended the existing rule foran experimental period of six months, they would, by the exerciseof their own discretion, do their utmost to avoid anticipation ofParliamentary debate. He believed that this problem could behandled more effectively by the discretion of the broadcastingauthorities than by the application of a hard and fast rule.In discussion it was suggested that, if the rule were oncesuspended, it would be difficult to reimpose it. Some doubts werealso expressed about the expediency of relying on the discretion ofprogramme companies operating under the Independent TelevisionAuthority.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would like to ascertain, in thefirst instance, whether the Opposition Parties were willing to agreethat the experiment suggested by the Postmaster-General should betried. If they were not prepared to consent to this, he would be infavour of substituting a 7-day rule for the existing 14-day rule.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to ascertain the viewsof the Opposition Parties on the suggestion put forward bythe Postmaster-General in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.l,11th December, 1956.
