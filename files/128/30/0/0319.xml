3 CM. 95 (56)Economic * 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the drain on theSituation. reserves of gold and dollars was now seen to be even more serious(Previous than when the Cabinet had discussed the matter on 29th November.Reference: At the end of November the reserves had fallen to a figure just belowCM. (56) 91st $2,000 millions; and the payment during December of $180 millionsConclusions, on account of the American loan and $70 millions in respect of ourMinute 1.) debt to the European Payments Union implied that a net loss of atleast $300 millions for that month couid already be foreseen. Nofundamental improvement in the situation could be expected unlesswe succeeded in re-establishing normal political relations with theUnited States, in mobilising our dollar resources by exercising ourdrawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and invoking thewaiver clause in the American Loan Agreement, and also in adoptingappropriate internal policies. He had now received a message fromthe Secretary to the United States Treasury which gave grounds formore optimism about our ability to invoke the waiver clause than wehad felt hitherto, and he proposed to refer to this possibility in hisstatement on 4th December.External borrowing must be reinforced by internal restraint.Although the cut in oil supplies would lead to some unemploymentand short-time working, with a corresponding loss of earnings,production would rise less rapidly than incomes and consumerdemand, with the risk of a renewal of inflationary pressure. Hetherefore proposed to announce in his statement on 4th December anincrease of Is. a gallon in the duty on petrol and oil, together withsome further restriction of credit and hire-purchase facilities, whichhe would discuss with the President of the Board of Trade. It wouldnot be sufficient, in his opinion, to relate these deflationary measuresdirectly to the oil shortage, and to confine action to an increase inthe petrol tax.The Cabinet agreed that the duty on petrol and oil should beraised by Is. a gallon. Some disquiet was expressed, however, at theprospect that this would lead to an early and substantia! rise inpassenger fares, which would provoke fresh wage claims and furtherweaken the disinflationary policy. Nevertheless, it was felt that itwould not be practicable to differentiate between passenger and otherroad transport. The shortage was most acute in the type of fuel usedby road passenger transport. Moreover, a differential rate of duty,once introduced, would not be easily withdrawn and, if it continued,the structure of the duty as a whole might be jeopardised.The motoring and road transport communities would, however,consider that they had been singled out to carry an undue proportionof the burden. The increase in the duty would be seen as an attemptto divert traffic to the railways, with consequent loss to the roadinterests. For these reasons it was desirable that, in presenting theincrease in this duty, emphasis should be laid less on the financialsituation than on the need to conserve oil supplies. For the samereason it should be made clear that the increase in the duty was atemporary measure for the period of the emergency.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while he was notaverse in principle from further curtailment of credit trading, hefelt that restrictions had already been carried as far as was realistic.They could not be intensified in relation to the motor-car, motor-cycleand cycle industries without creating serious unemployment, and itwould be undesirable to impose more severe terms on the hire-purchase of furniture. Thus, consumer durable goods was the onlyfield in which further restrictions could be applied. If control overcredit was to be tightened, a more radical and comprehensiveapproach should, in his view, be adopted.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be unwise toindicate too precisely at this stage the nature of any further measureswhich the Government might have in mind in order to reduce* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.50911 2
4purchasing power. It was not yet certain that the consequences ofthe Suez crisis and the interruption in the flow of oil supplies wouldprove inflationary rather than deflationary in effect. It might,therefore, be preferable to phrase any statement on this subject inmore general terms to the effect that the Government would nothesitate to introduce further fiscal measures should circumstancesdemand them.Further consideration should also be given to the possibility ofassisting industry in maintaining exports by mobilising shippingresources. Naval vessels might even be made available for this task.This would depend, in the first instance, on the speed with whichships requisitioned for the recent military operations could bereleased. A number of tank-landing craft had been brought intoservice for these operations, and these might be made available,together with other suitable naval vessels, to supplement commercialshipping as soon as they could be released.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was essential that the steps takenshould be adequate to meet the situation. In the light of the bestestimate of the balance of payments which could be made at thepresent time, it would be necessary to curtail internal demand to theextent of some  200 millions. Although the increase in the petrolduty would yield an additional  100 millions in a full year, a furthersubstantial reduction of demand would probably be needed. TheCabinet should give further consideration, at their next meeting, tothe question whether, at this stage, the Government should indicatein specific terms their plans for securing this further reduction.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the revenue duty on oil should be increasedduring the period of the present emergency by Is. a gallonfrom 4th December.(2) Agreed to give further consideration to the desirability ofintensifying the restrictions on hire-purchase transactions,and of making a specific announcement at this stage of theGovernment&apos;s proposals for securing a further curtail-ment of purchasing power.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare a draftof the statement on economic measures which he proposedto make in the House of Commons on 4th December,taking into account the points made in their discussion.(4) Invited the Minister of Transport to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence and the First Lord of theAdmiralty, what steps might be taken to afford specialassistance to the export trade by expediting the release ofrequisitioned ships, and by making available suitable navalvessels for commercial service.Oil Prices. *2.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C.P. (56) 270) covering a memorandum by officials onthe effect on oil prices of the interruption of supplies through theSuez Canal and the Syrian pipeline.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the cost of bringingoil to the United Kingdom had risen significantly because of thehigher freight charges involved in bringing oil round the Cape, a sharprise in tanker rates, and the higher prices which had to be paid forabnormal purchases of oil in the Western Hemisphere. In addition,the cut which had had to be imposed in supplies would now resultin a proportionate rise in the distributing costs of the oil companiesand the overhead costs of the filling stations. It would therefore be* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
5C.M. 95 (56)necessary for the oil companies to raise the prices of oil productsby amounts varying from 3d. to 5d. a gallon. The companies wereanxious to announce these increases on 3rd December, but they mightwish, in the circumstances, to be able to say that they were taking thisaction with the concurrence of the Government. The Governmentclearly could not disclaim all responsibility, and it was thereforeproposed that the oil companies should be authorised to make anannouncement in such terms. The announcement would make it clearthat the increased prices were directly related to the abnormalcircumstances and were not expected to be permanent.The Cabinet were in agreement that the commercial need for animmediate rise in the price of oil products must be accepted, and thatthe oil companies should be authorised to make their announcementin the terms proposed by the Minister of Fuel and Power. It wasundesirable, however, that two important announcements affectingthe price of oil should be made on successive days, and the oilcompanies should be asked to defer their announcement until4th December when it would coincide with the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s statement on the petrol tax.The Cabinet (1) Accepted the proposal of the oil companies that thecommercial price of oil should be increased by themaximum amounts specified in C.P. (56) 270.(2) Agreed that the oil companies should be asked to defer theirannouncement of this increase until 4th December.Suez Canal. 3.   The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the statement(Previous to the made by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons onReference: 3rd December. They had before them an alternative draft of theC.M. (56) 94th opening paragraphs of this statement, prepared by the Minister ofConclusions.)   Education. They also had before them the final version of the draft,prepared by the French Foreign Minister, of an Anglo-Frenchdeclaration of policy.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be desirable that some reference should be made,either in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement or separately, to thearrangements for the reception in this country of British nationalsevicted from Egypt.(b) The statement should not over-emphasise our dependenceon the supply of oil from the Middle East or the political support ofthe Arab States.(c) On the other hand it should recognise, with appreciation, thedeclaration by the United States Government that they would supportthe United Nations in resisting any attempt to introduce externalforces into the area of hostilities or to impede the United Nationsforce.(d) The declaration of our intention to withdraw the Anglo-French force from Port Said should be made in the body of thestatement, which should end on the positive note of successfulachievement of our original objectives. These objectives shouldbe clearly defined.(e) It should be made clear that it was our understanding thatthe United Nations force would remain in Egypt until its functionswere fulfilled, and that the duration of its stay would not bedetermined by the Egyptian Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be glad to considerany further amendments to the text which members of the Cabinetmight communicate to him. Thereafter, he proposed to send thedraft to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and to inform
6him that a statement to this effect would be made in the House ofCommons on 3rd December. It was particularly important that theSecretary-General should be aware of the wording of that passagein the statement which dealt with the clearance of the Suez Canaland of the proposal that, while the withdrawal of the Anglo-Frenchforce should proceed without delay, the precise timing of theoperation should be decided by the Commander-in-Chief inconsultation with the Commander of the United Nations force. Ifthe Secretary-General was unable to accept our interpretation of theunderstandings which we regarded ourselves as having reached withhim on these points, a new situation would arise which the Cabinetwould have to consider.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to revise the draft statementin the light of their discussion and of any furtheramendments which might be suggested, and to circulateit for further consideration at a subsequent meeting.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to communicate the drafttext to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, andto inform him that a statement on those lines would bemade in the House of Commons on 3rd December.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, after consultation with theForeign Secretary, to instruct the Commander-in-Chief ofthe Anglo-French force that, as soon as the statementhad been made, he should seek to open discussions withthe Commander of the United Nations force about theorderly withdrawal of our troops, on the basis that thisoperation should be completed as rapidly as possiblebut might need to be suspended at any point for politicalor other reasons.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion on 3rd December.Cabinet Office, S.W.l,1st December, 1956.
