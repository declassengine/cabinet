3C.M. 96 (56)Suez Canal. J.   The Cabinet had before them a revised draft of the statement(Previous       to be made by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons thatReference: day.C.M (56) 95th The Cabinet considered the draft statement paragraph byConclusions, paragraph. In discussion various amendments were proposed andMinute 3.)      adopted, and the following points were made (a) The Foreign Secretary said that the substance of thepassages in the draft which dealt with the clearance of the Canal, itsfuture administration and the withdrawal of the Anglo-French forcehad been communicated to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations.  The Secretary-General had suggested an alternative formof words for the reference to the clearance of the Canal which, whilerather less specific than our own wording, could be added to the textof the statement as an amplification of our understanding of theposition.   He had re-emphasised that his intention was to put theclearance operation on a technical basis, which would permit the useof British equipment and probably, at a rather later stage, Britishpersonnel.    He had also taken note of our objection to theestablishment of a fixed date for the withdrawal of the Anglo-Frenchforce, but felt that he could accept this on the understanding that,as soon as the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement had been made, he him-self would issue to the Commander of the United Nations force aninstruction drawing his attention to &quot; the need to ensure that thisforce should be in a position to assume responsibility in the PortSaid area by the middle of the month.&quot;(h) As regards the resumption of negotiations on the futureadministration of the Canal, the Foreign Secretary said it had not yetbeen possible to reach agreement on the question whether the state-ment should include mention of the principles set out in theEighteen-Power Resolution adopted by the London Conference inAugust. The French Government were particularly concerned thatthese principles should be recognised as one of the bases on whichnegotiations would take place: but we, for our part, would becontent to make no overt reference to them if other means ofproviding equivalent guarantees could be devised. It was agreed thatthis matter must be left to the discretion of the Foreign Secretary. Ifno reference to the Ekhteen-Power proposals were included in thedraft statement, it might be possible to mention them in thesubsequent debate.(c) The Lord Privy Seal said that the United States Governmenthad now made it clear, both in Washington and in London, that, assoon as an announcement had been made in the House of Commonsforeshadowing the definite withdrawal of our troops from Egypt, thePresident of the United States intended to make an encouragingstatement about the problems of the Suez Canal and economicassistance to the United Kingdom. This was subject to the proviso,however, that we had announced a specific date by which thewithdrawal of our troops would be completed. The United StatesAmbassador had been informed that it was our intention to removethe Anglo-French troops without delay or equivocation; that therewere sound reasons, both political and military, why it was notpracticable to announce a definite date for the completion of thisoperation: and that these reasons had been conveyed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Egyptian Foreign Minister andthe United States Representative at the United Nations withoutevoking their dissent. He proposed to instruct H.M. Ambassador atWashington to repeat these points to the United States Government.(d) It was agreed that there was no need to include in theproposed statement any passages containing assurances to meet thefear that the Egyptian Government might seek to discriminateagainst British and French ships in the matter of free passage throughthe Suez Canal, on the ground that a state of war existed betweenEgypt and the United Kingdom and France. If this point was raisedit could be answered satisfactorily in debate.50911 3 b 2
4(e) It was also agreed that the proposed statement should suggestthat the United Nations should henceforward assume responsibilityfor the Gaza Strip and that Israel should withdraw from this area.It was understood that neither Israel nor Egypt was concerned topossess this territory, but that Israel, for strategic reasons, could notcontemplate its reoccupation by Egypt. So far as Israel wasconcerned, a statement on the lines proposed would not beunexpected; and it would help to improve our relations with Iraq- %if) The Minister of Defence said that, once the furtherwithdrawal of our troops had begun, the Commander-in-Chief wouldbe unable to mount, without reinforcement, any offensive action fromPort Said.At the end of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion the Lord Privy Seal saidthat he had thought it right to inform the Prime Minister of thesubstance of the statement which the Foreign Secretary was proposingto make in the House of Commons. During the Cabinet&apos;s meetinghe had received a reply in which the Prime Minister stated that theCabinet would have his full support in the decision which theyproposed to take. He had, however, indicated that he attachedimportance to our being able to make it clear, if possible, that theAnglo-French salvage resources would be used by the United Nationsin the clearance of the Suez Canal, and that the subsequentnegotiations about the future administration of the Canal would haveregard to the principles embodied in the Eighteen-Power Resolutionadopted by the London Conference in August.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that day, in the terms agreed in theirdiscussion, setting out the Government&apos;s policy in regardto recent developments in the Middle East and theirintentions with regard to the withdrawal of theAnglo-French force.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to despatch a telegram toWashington, on the lines agreed in their discussion,explaining to the United States Government the reasonswhy a definite date for the withdrawal of our forces couldnot be fixed.(3) Took note of the point recorded in paragraph (/) above.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReferenceCM. (56)Conclusions,Minute 1.)*2. The Cabinet had before them the draft of a statement onthe economic situation to be made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in the House of Commons on 4th December.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of the1 latest information about the attitude of the United StatesGovernment, he would be able to speak more firmly about hisproposals to use our dollar securities as collateral for borrowing andto invoke the waiver clause in the American Loan Agreement. Hehad now received an assurance that support would be forthcomingfrom the United States for the former purpose and that, as regardsthe waiver, the United States Government were prepared to submitthe question to Congress &quot; with the definite recommendation thatan appropriate modification of the present language be made tocarry out the spirit of the original intention.&quot;The Chancellor said that he was still of the opinion that externalborrowing should be supported by internal measures. For thispurpose he would like, in his statement, to announce an increase ofIs. in the duty on oil, to refer to some tightening of the control ofhire purchase transactions, and to indicate in general terms that some* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
5 CM. 96 (56)further fiscal action might be needed in the near future. Thealternative course would be a statement which, while emphasisingthe severe drain on our reserves of gold and dollars in recent weeks,would reject the remedy of additional taxation and would rest ona general indication of the Government&apos;s intention to maintain astrict control over public expenditure.In discussion there was general agreement that a statementannouncing no measures of additional taxation would be regardedas insufficient evidence of the Government&apos;s determination to dealfirmly with the economic consequences of the Suez crisis. On theother hand, some disquiet was expressed about the proposedadditional duty on oil and the intensification of hire purpose control,if these were not supported by a precise announcement of additionalfiscal action designed to effect a more significant reduction ofpurchasing power throughout the community. The tightening ofthe control over hire purchase, which must inevitably be confinedto capital goods and consumer durable goods, would have relativelylittle effect on the economy by comparison with the politicalopposition which it would arouse and the harm which it might inflicton the metal-using industries, in which signs of unemployment werealready appearing. The tax on oil would be an additional burdenon the motor industry at a time when its prospects were unpromising.It was doubtful whether, in a period in which transport was likelyto be a greater obstacle to our export trade than production, itwould be wise to increase the duty on oil. It was also doubtfulwhether the inevitable increase in passenger fares could be preventedfrom stimulating fresh wage claims, which might lead todisproportionate industrial unrest.It was argued, on the other hand, that a statement of theGovernment&apos;s economic policy which included no new measure oftaxation at all would have to be couched in such general terms thatthe Government&apos;s intentions would not be clear and the resultantuncertainty would be very damaging. The additional duty on oilcould, and should, be justified by reference, not to the needs of therevenue, but to the scarcity of oil. It should be presented as atemporary measure, designed to correspond with an emergency whichwas expected to be of limited duration. This presentation shouldreduce, to some extent, the risk of popular demand for the exemptionof public passenger transport from the additional duty. If, however,pressure for such an exemption developed on a significant scale, itwould be necessary to consider what concession, if any, could bemade to it.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Confirmed their earlier decision that the duty on oil shouldbe increased by Is. per gallon.(2) Agreed that no steps should be taken, for the time being, tointensify the control over hire purchase transactions.(3) Subject to admendment in the light of Conclusion (2) above,approved the statement which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to make in the House of Commonson the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,4th December, 1956.
