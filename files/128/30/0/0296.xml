3CM. 72 (56)The Queen&apos;sSpeeches.Prorogation ofParliament.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PrivySeal (CP. (56) 241) covering a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speechon the Prorogation of Parliament.The Cabinet approved the revised draft of the Speech, subjectto an amendment accepted in their discussion and to further changesin phrasing which the Lord Privy Seal sought leave to make. It wasnoted that the text of the passage on the Suez Canal dispute would befinally settled in the light of further developments before the Speechwas delivered.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate in due course a finaldraft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation ofParliament.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to submit this final draft for HerMajesty&apos;s approval.2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion on reform of the HouseLords.The Lord Chancellor said that he had discussed with membersand supporters of the Government in the House of Lords thepossibility of prescribing in the Bill that equal representation shouldbe provided for the principal political Parties on the Committee ofSelection. This proposal had proved unacceptable, mainly on theground that the result would be seen to be a Committee heavilyweighted in favour of the Conservative Party. He had thereforesuggested two possible alternatives. First, a mandatory provision inthe Bill, requiring the Selection Committee to be so constituted as toprovide for the principal political Parties representation proportionalto the votes cast in their favour at the last previous General Election.Second, a more general stipulation that the Committee should includethe Lord Chairman of Committees and the Leaders of the principalpolitical Parties represented in the House; that it should consist, as toone-sixth of its membership, of Peers not identified with any politicalParty; and that the House of Lords, in constituting the balance of theCommittee, should have regard to the desirability of ensuringrepresentation of the political Parties corresponding to their respectivestrengths in the country. Of these alternatives, the latter had provedmore acceptable than the former to the Government&apos;s supporters inthe House of Lords.He had also considered whether the Government need reviewtheir earlier decision to allow the &quot; swamping &quot; power to lapse. Itwas certainly true that, if the number of members of the House ofLords (whether hereditary Peers or life Peers) were fixed withindefined limits, the Upper House would be better placed to thwartthe will of the House of Commons. If the Cabinet considered thatthis risk was a serious objection to the Bill in its present form, itwould be possible, by amendment of the text, to retain the&quot; swamping &quot; power but to provide that it should only be exercisedin defined circumstances, e.g., if the House of Commons passed anappropriate resolution in two successive Sessions. On the otherhand, the risk which this amendment would be designed to avert wasan unreal risk in modern conditions of Government; and to makespecific provision against it in the Bill would be to subordinate theHouse of Lords, more explicitly than was perhaps desirable, to theGovernment in the House of Commons. Moreover, the amendmentwhereby the House, in constituting the Committee of Selection, wouldbe required to have regard to the desirability of providing properrepresentation for the main political Parties might well be regarded51159 5 b 2House of LordsReform.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 69thConclusions,Minute 4.)
4as sufficient evidence that the House of Lords would remain prepared,in the last resort, to accept the will of the people as expressed in theHouse of Commons.Subsequent discussion showed that, in spite of the improvementwhich, it was generally agreed, would be effected by the amendmentprescribing the composition of the Committee of Selection, severalMembers of the Cabinet were, for the following reasons, doubtfulabout the wisdom of proceeding with the Bill at the present time (a) The reaction of the Government&apos;s own supporters in theHouse of Commons was uncertain. Many of them considered thatthe House of Lords was working well enough as it was. There wasalso an element of rivalry between the two Houses, and someGovernment supporters in the House of Commons might prefer tomake no change in the present composition of the Upper House. Itwas therefore desirable that, before the Government committed them-selves finally to the introduction of this Bill, they should take stepsto satisfy themselves that it would command the support ofConservative Members of the House of Commons.(b) The Bill would be liable to be regarded as a limited attackon the hereditary principle; and once this attack was launched, itsrepercussions were unpredictable.(c) At the same time, the Bill could be interpreted as an attemptto reinvigorate the House of Lords; and popular opinion might wellbe suspicious of any reform of this kind. The Labour Party might,indeed, be driven to press for the outright abolition of the UpperHouse, however little the country as a whole might wish for so drastica step.(d) The Bill would make heavy demands on Parliamentary time.For this reason alone it might be desirable to defer it till a laterSession, provided that the problem of securing adequate remunerationfor members of the Upper House could, by some means, be solvedin the interval.The Lord President said that, after taking full account of all thedoubts which had been expressed, he remained firmly of the opinionthat the next Session would provide the last opportunity for reformof the House of Lords in the present Parliament perhaps, indeed,the last opportunity for moderate and rational reform which wouldever occur. The basic principles of the Government&apos;s Bill,particularly the selection of Peers on their personal merits, werereasonable and defensible; and the scheme as a whole was sounderthan any of the alternatives which had been considered in earlieryears.The Bill would be made more acceptable to the House ofCommons by the amendment providing for proper representation ofthe principal political Parties on the Committee of Selection,although this amendment should preferably be expressed in generalterms and not be linked with the votes cast at a General Election.But he thought it unnecessary and undesirable to introduce a furtheramendment to retain the &quot; swamping&quot; power. Now that thesuspensory veto of the Upper House had been reduced to twelvemonths, the risk against which the &quot; swamping &quot; power was designedto provide had become academic; and any provision to retain thatpower carried with it the further disadvantage that, once the numbersof the Peers in the two categories had been disturbed, the balancedcharacter of the scheme as a whole would suffer a distortion whichnothing but the lapse of time would remedy.The risks entailed by the Bill were clear; but they should not beexaggerated. The Government&apos;s proposals might well excitecontroversy about the hereditary principle as a whole. But if, forthis reason, reform were to be postponed, it would be postponed forever. Equally, the reception of the Bill in the House of Commonscould not be guaranteed, and confidential soundings of the Govern-ment&apos;s own supporters in the Lower House should certainly be made.
5CM. 72 (56)But it must be recognised that there had at no time been a positivedemand in the House of Commons for reform of the House of Lords,mainly because the body of opinion in the House of Commons whichwas most in favour of reform had hesitated to deal with the problemfor fear of provoking a popular demand for outright abolition of theUpper House. But if reform were, in fact, tackled courageously andefficiently, it would thereafter be more, rather than less, difficult forthose elements in the House of Commons which favoured abolitionto find a valid justification for their campaign.For these reasons he adhered to his view that the comprehensiveBill was a measure which he should earnestly invite his colleagues toendorse. The shorter Bill, which merely reversed the Wensleydalejudgment, would do nothing to effect genuine reform of the UpperHouse; indeed, it would perpetuate a Tory majority in that Housemore blatantly than the comprehensive measure. The only realalternative to proceeding with the comprehensive Bill would,therefore, be to abandon entirely the proposals for reform. But theinevitable result would be the progressive decay of the House ofLords to a point at which it would cease altogether to provide anyscope for the exercise of political talent. This was not a coursewhich he could reconcile with his conscience. He had led theConservative Party in the House of Lords, in office and in Opposition,for the last fifteen years, and he was prominently identified with theprinciple of comprehensive reform. If, at this stage, the proposalswhich the Government had been considering for many months werefinally abandoned, his personal position would become extremelydifficult.Further discussion showed that there was general agreement inthe Cabinet that The Queen&apos;s Speech should contain some referenceto the Government&apos;s intention to proceed with reform of the Houseof Lords, if time permitted. But the words used should not finallycommit the Government to early action, least of all at the openingof the new Session when the Government&apos;s attention was likely to befully engaged on matters of even graver national importance. Inthe interval, confidential soundings should be taken of theGovernment&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons; and the resultof these soundings should be taken into account in the Cabinet&apos;s finaldecision on the timing of introduction of the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange that The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament should include areference, in general terms, to the Government&apos;s intentionto introduce, during the course of the next Session,proposals for the reform of the composition of the Houseof Lords.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip to ascertain,by confidential soundings, the reaction of the Govern-ment&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons to theamended proposals.MigrationPolicy.(PreviousReference:C.C. (51) 20thConclusions,Minute 10.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (CP. (56) 240) seeking authority forlegislation to extend for a further period the Empire SettlementAct, 1952.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Empire SettlementActs were now used only for assisted passages to Australia and forthe emigration of children.  Full use was not therefore made of the
6funds available under the Acts. It was indeed open to questionwhether it was any longer appropriate that one independentCommonwealth country should subsidise emigration to the others;but it would provoke widespread misunderstanding and disquiet ifthe Empire Settlement Acts were allowed to lapse. If this view wereaccepted, it remained for decision whether the Acts should berenewed for a longer or a shorter period and whether, as the fundswere by no means being fully used, the opportunity should be takento reduce the financial provision available to assist emigration.Discussion showed that the Cabinet felt no doubt about theexpediency of extending the Empire Settlement Acts. The Actsmight, however, be extended for five rather than fifteen years. Asregards the limit of expenditure, it was true that annual disburse-ments were unlikely to reach the figure of  \\ millions authorisedby the earlier Acts; but it would be inexpedient, as well asunnecessary, to reduce the statutory limit.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C.P. (56) 240.(2) Authorised   the   Commonwealth   Secretary   to preparelegislation, for introduction in the forthcoming session,to extend the Empire Settlement Acts for a further periodof five years without reducing the maximum limit ofexpenditure under the existing Acts.LegislativeProgramme,1956-57.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 69thConclusions.Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the legislativeprogramme for the 1956-57 session.The Colonial Secretary said that, contrary to any impressionthat he might have given in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, all theindications pointed to the need for constitutional legislation affectingMalaya in the next session of Parliament. Furthermore, if thenegotiations now in progress with the Maltese Government reacheda successful conclusion earlier than was at present expected, it wouldbe unwise to defer legislation on Malta until the following session.Both the Malaya and Malta Bills should therefore have a contingentplace in the programme.The Lord Privy Seal said that the demands of the programme,as it had emerged, would considerably exceed the Parliamentary timeavailable for legislation. The programme would now include majorlegislation on capital punishment, the electricity industry, rents,import duties and the reform of the House of Lords, together witha lengthy measure dealing with shops. There seemed little prospectthat any of the less important Bills listed in Groups A and B ofC.P. (56) 233 could be deferred, and an additional Bill might nowbe needed to give effect to the Government&apos;s intentions with regardto capital grants for agriculture. He thought there was no alternativebut to accept the programme as it stood and to endeavour to get itthrough.The Cabinet-Approved the legislative programme set out in C.P. (56) 233,including Bills dealing with the reform of the House ofLords, the electricity industry, and also, if required, Billsdealing with constitutional development in Malaya andMalta.
7CM. 72 (56)The Queen&apos;sSpeeches.Opening ofParliament.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 69thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Seal(CP. (56) 242) covering a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech onthe Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet considered the draft paragraph by paragraph. TheLord Privy Seal undertook to give further thought to the draftingof certain passages, in consultation with the Ministers immediatelyconcerned, and to circulate a further revised draft to the Cabinetfor their consideration at a meeting later that week.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate for theirconsideration a further revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speechon the Opening of Parliament.Suez Canal. *6.   The Prime Minister recalled that, when the Cabinet had(Previous last discussed the Suez situation on 18th October, there had beenReference: reason to believe that the issue might be brought rapidly to a headCM. (56) 71st as a result of military action by Israel against Egypt. It now seemedConclusions, unlikely that the Israelis would launch a full-scale attack againstMinute 4.) Egypt. The United Kingdom and French Governments were thusconfronted with the choice between an early military operation ora relatively prolonged negotiation. If the second course werefollowed, neither we nor the French could hope to maintain ourmilitary preparations in their present state of readiness on our sidesome of the reservists would have to be released, some of therequisitioned merchant ships would have to be released forcommercial trading and others would have to be reloaded and ourposition of negotiating from strength would to some extent beimpaired. The French Government were seriously concerned atthis possibility and were disposed to favour early military action.They had recently received special provocation from Egypt, throughthe capture of a ship conveying arms from Egypt to the rebel forcesin Algeria, and they might regard this as a sufficient ground formilitary action against Egypt. They would not, however, be in aposition to take such action effectively unless we gave them facilitiesto operate from Cyprus, and it was possible that they might pressus to grant those facilities.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the EgyptianGovernment were now ready to put forward, in response to thesecond part of the Security Council resolution, alternative proposalsfor the future control of the Suez Canal. It was unlikely that thesewould provide all the safeguards which we thought necessary; but,in the opinion of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, theywould afford a basis for renewed discussions. The Foreign Secretarysaid that he would not exclude the possibility that we might be ableto reach, by negotiation with the Egyptians, a settlement which wouldgive us the substance of our demand for effective internationalsupervision of the Canal. There were, however, three seriousobjections to a policy of seeking a settlement by negotiation. First,it now seemed clear that the French Government would not givetheir full co-operation in such a policy. Secondly, it was evidentthat some relaxation of our military preparations would have tobe made and to that extent we should weaken our negotiatingposition. Thirdly, he saw no prospect of reaching such a settlementas would diminish Colonel Nasser&apos;s influence throughout the MiddleEast.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
8The Prime Minister said that grave decisions would have to betaken by the Cabinet in the course of the next few days. For thepresent, however, the discussion could not be carried further untilthe attitude of the French Government was more clearly known.The French Foreign Minister had been asked to come over to Londonfor consultations that evening; and the result of those consultationswould be reported to the Cabinet on the following day.The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary, and agreed to resume theirdiscussion at a meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1956.
