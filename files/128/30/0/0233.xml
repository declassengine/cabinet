3CM. 9 (56)Nigeria. 1.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet of the substanceRoyal Visit.     of a report which he had received from The Queen&apos;s Private Secretaryon the progress of the tour which Her Majesty and H.R.H. The Dukeof Edinburgh were making in Nigeria.The Colonial Secretary said that, in memory of her visit, TheQueen had been graciously pleased to give permission for the NigeriaRegiment to assume the title &quot; The Queen&apos;s Own Nigeria Regiment.&quot;The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Export ofAnns.India.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;sconclusion of 31st January, the Prime Minister had been asked tourge President Eisenhower to waive any security objections which theUnited States authorities might have to the inclusion of specialisedbombing equipment in the Canberra aircraft which the EnglishElectric Company were seeking to sell to the Indian Air Force. ThePrime Minister had taken this matter up with the President and hadreceived from him an assurance that no security objection would beraised by the United States authorities to the inclusion of thisequipment in Canberra aircraft delivered to the Indian Air Force.This concession should be of substantial help to the English ElectricCompany in their efforts to conclude this contract.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was not yet in a position tomake a firm statement about the business for Thursday,16th February. Alternative subjects for debate on that day werecapital punishment or the economic situation. The choice betweenthese alternatives must, however, be reserved for final decision bythe Prime Minister after his return.The Cabinet Agreed that in these circumstances the Lord Privy Sealshould say, in his Statement on Business on the followingday, that the business for 16th February would beannounced later.House ofCommonsDisqualification.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)495984. The Cabinet considered what course should be followed inParliament in connection with the further stages of the House ofCommons Disqualification Bill in view of the difficulties which hadarisen in defining the scope of offices of profit under ihe Crown.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was now clear that the first partof the Bill, which was concerned with the definition of offices of profitunder the Crown, would need to be drastically re-cast. He thereforeinvited the Cabinet to consider whether the whole Bill, and notmerely the controversial Clause 6 containing provisions relating toCrown contracts, should not be referred to a Select Committee forexamination. In that event it was most unlikely that the Bill couldbe enacted in the current session; but, after discussion with the HomeSecretary, the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary,Treasury, he had come to the conclusion that this would be the mostsatisfactory course to adopt.-3 b 2
4The Attorney-General, supporting this view, said that in thediscussion in the House of Commons on the previous day of themotion approving the recommendations of the Select Committee onthe case of Mr. Charles Beattie, there had been a widespread demand,to which he had promised consideration, that the problem ofdefinition should be referred to a Select Committee. Although thiswould result in further delay, for which the Government would becriticised, he had no doubt that it was the right course to follow.The Cabinet Agreed that the House of Commons Disqualification Billshould be referred to a Select Committee of the House ofCommons; and authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make anearly announcement to this effect.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet were informed that the Labour Opposition hadnow tabled a motion proposing that capital punishment, as a penaltyfor murder, should be abandoned for an experimental period. Asthis motion was already on the Order Paper, it would be called by theSpeaker as the basis for the forthcoming debate in preference to anymotion which might subsequently be tabled by back-benchsupporters of the Government. If, therefore, the final speech beforethe division was to be made from the Government side of the House,it was now necessary that the debate should be held on the basis of aGovernment motion. This, in fact, was the course preferred by amajority of Government supporters, who had indicated that theywould welcome a firm lead by the Government. Since the Cabinet&apos;slast discussion on 31st January, it had become clear that manyGovernment supporters who had previously been disposed to favourabolition of the death penalty would be willing to vote in favour of itsretention if the Government had given a clear indication of theirintention to legislate on the secondary recommendations made bythe Royal Commission on Capital Punishment and by the Committeeof the Inns of Court Conservative and Unionist Society.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed that the forthcomingdebate on this subject should be held on a Government motion. Onthe form of this motion, and on the statements to be made byMinisters speaking in support of it, the following points wereraised:  (a) Government supporters would be more likely to vote infavour of the motion if it emphasised the need for legislation toamend the law defining the crime of murder. The motion shouldnot, however, be so phrased as to imply that the death penalty wouldbe abandoned when that amending legislation had been passed.(h) The motion should relate to capital punishment as thepenalty for murder. The House need not be invited to express anyopinion on the retention of capital punishment as a penalty fortreason, piracy or arson in dockyards.(c) The amendment of the law defining the crime of murderwould present formidable legal difficulties. The Governmentspokesmen in the debate should therefore be guarded in their state-ments about the content of this legislation. It could be said that, indetermining its content, the Government would take account ofsuggestions made in the debate. It would, however, be necessary forthe Government to give a definite assurance that this legislationwould contain provisions designed to narrow existing law onconstructive malice and provocation.(d) It seemed unlikely that the projected legislation need extendto Scotland. The doctrine of diminished responsibility alreadyoperated in Scotland, by virtue of the common law. If it weredecided to include in this legislation the provisions necessary in orderto enable the Government to ratify the Geneva Convention, those
5CM. 9 (56)particular provisions would have to extend to Scotland. It was not,however, necessary to reach a decision, or to make an announcement,on this point at the present stage.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the forthcoming debate on capital punishmentin the House of Commons should be held on the basis ofa Government motion inviting the House to declare that,while the death penalty should be retained, the lawdefining the crime of murder should be amended.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to settle the terms of thismotion, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, theHome Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Law Officers.(3) Reaffirmed their earlier decision that in the division on thismotion back-bench supporters of the Government shouldbe allowed a free vote but members of the Governmentshould not be free to vote against the motion.(4) Took note that the Lord Privy Seal would invite the PrimeMinister to decide whether the concluding speech onbehalf of the Government in this debate should be madeby a senior member of the Cabinet or by a Law Officer.National 6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorinsurance of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 29) and the Minister of PensionsScheme. (CP. (56) 28) on the recommendations in the report of the NationalWidows&apos; Insurance Advisory Committee on widows&apos; benefits and on theBenefits. related question of the 10s. a week pension for widows.(Previous The Minister of Pensions said that these questions had beenReference:      considered by the Home Affairs Committee and by a group ofCM. (56) 8th    Ministers under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal. TheConclusions,    three main recommendations of the Advisory Committee were thatMinute 5.)       the allowances paid in respect of widows&apos; children should besubstantially increased, that the age at which a widow would continueherself to be entitled to a pension after her children had ceased toqualify for allowances should be raised from forty to fifty, and thatthe qualifying period of marriage should be reduced from ten yearsto three.   It was also recommended in this connection that the&quot; linking rule,&quot; which permitted two periods of marriage separatedby widowhood of less than three years&apos; duration to be aggregated inarriving at the qualifying period, should be retained.As regards the first recommendation, he proposed, with theconcurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to raise by 5s. to16s. 6d. the weekly payment for each child of a widow. There wouldbe some criticism of the second recommendation, which wouldwithdraw from women who might be widowed in the future a benefitwhich now existed and would be retained by all existing widows nowentitled to it. The need to retain the &quot; linking rule &quot; was perhapsquestionable if the qualifying period were to be reduced to threeyears. But the Advisory Committee had urged that theirrecommendations should be considered as a whole, and he endorsedtheir view on this point. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, heproposed to announce in Parliament shortly, in the terms of thedraft annexed to his memorandum, that the Government acceptedthese recommendations.It had been hoped that the Advisory Committee would alsosubmit a recommendation on the \0s. basic pension for widows, butthey had decided that it lay outside their terms of reference. Thispension was a survival from the earlier National Insurance Schemeand was admittedly an anachronism. But, while there was no logicalcase for increasing the rate of this pension, there was a strong politicaland emotional case for doing so. He recommended that the problem
6should be resolved by awarding an increase of 5s. to existingbeneficiaries and by making no new issues of this pension after a dateto be fixed. Although this would entail consequential increases insome other pensions at a cost of  150,000, he did not think it wouldgive rise to pressure for an increase in the non-contributory old-agepension.The Cabinet agreed that the recommendations of the AdvisoryCommittee should be adopted. They were informed that theproposal to raise children&apos;s allowances by 5s. would entail increasesin the allowances for the widows of policemen and firemen whoserates of benefit were related to those provided under the NationalInsurance Scheme.The Cabinet then turned to discussion of the \0s. a week pensionfor widows.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the increase proposedby the Minister of Pensions would cost  2 millions in itself and wouldbe likely to entail corresponding increases in other pensions. Hesaw no case for increasing a pension which derived from a period inwhich the state of widowhood as such was deemed to merit financialsupport, irrespective of need This was no longer in accordance withsocial policy. He agreed, however, on further reflection, that itwould not be practicable both to refrain from increasing the rate ofthis pension and to announce that there would be no new issues of it.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in view of the public interest inthis matter and the expectations which had been aroused bystatements that it was under consideration by the AdvisoryCommittee, further consideration would need to be given to it. Theannouncement of further measures to deal with the economicsituation might create a more favourable atmosphere for asatisfactory solution of the problem. Meanwhile, it would be helpfulif the Minister of Pensions were to circulate a memorandum settingout a representative selection of public statements made on thisquestion by members of the Government and their supporters.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations on widows&apos; benefits of theNational Insurance Advisory Committee as summarisedin CP. (56) 28, and authorised the Minister of Pensions,subject to Conclusion (2) below, to make at theappropriate time an announcement of the Government&apos;sintentions in the matter in the terms of the draft annexedto his memorandum.(2) Deferred, for consideration at a later meeting, their decisionon the action to be taken in regard to the 10s. a weekpension for widows.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions to circulate a memorandumcontaining a representative selection of public statementsmade by members of the Government or their supporterson this question.Malaya. 7.   The Colonial Secretary reported to the Cabinet that the(Previous        agreement reached in the Conference on Constitutional Advance inReference:      Malaya was due to be signed that afternoon.   The agreementCM. (56) 4th    contained satisfactory assurances  on external  defence, internalConclusions.    security, finance and the position of expatriate officials.   It wouldMinute 3.)       also incorporate assurances regarding the future of United Kingdomeconomic interests in Malaya.   The Departments concerned hadagreed that it would not have been practicable to safeguard theseinterests by binding undertakings, and the business community inMalaya had not urged that undertakings of this nature should besecured.
7CM. 9 (56)It had been agreed that Lord Reid, who had consented to act inthat capacity, should be the Chairman of the ConstitutionalCommission. This would include representatives from Australia,Canada, India and Pakistan, together with a second representativefrom the United Kingdom. The terms of reference of theConstitutional Commission would not be published until they hadbeen approved by the Cabinet and by the Council of Rulers. It wasforeshadowed that, when Malaya achieved full self-government, theexercise of sovereign functions would rotate among the Rulers inturn. The fact that Her Majesty was Sovereign of the StraitsSettlements of Malacca and Penang had presented some difficulty inthis connection, but the terms of reference of the ConstitutionalCommission would contain a formula making it clear that TheQueen&apos;s position would be in no way prejudiced by the arrangementsforeshadowed. He had agreed, in deference to the wishes of theMalayan leaders, that the report of the Conference should expressa hope that the Constitutional Commission would complete their taskin time for full self-government to be brought into effect byAugust 1957.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate a written reporton the results of this Conference.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,8th February, 1956.
