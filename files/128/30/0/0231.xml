They would, however, involveFood Subsidies, an increase of 1   7 points in the cost-of-living index.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the continuance of the bread subsidy could no longerbe justified on economic grounds, and that there were equally strongarguments in favour of the proposed increase in the price of milk.At the same time it was recognised that there would be politicaldifficulty in presenting these two measures as part of a programmefor curbing inflation. The public would find it difficult to understandwhy such a programme should include measures which wouldincrease prices and stimulate current demands for increased wagesand would find this inconsistent with the Government&apos;s professeddesire to secure a period of stability in prices.   Special importancewas therefore attached to the timing of these two measures. TheCabinet were informed that the principal wage claim now undernegotiation was that of the workers in the engineering and ship-building industries, and that there was reason to believe that thismight have been settled by the middle of February. If, therefore, theannouncement of these measures could be deferred until the secondhalf of February, there was less likelihood that their effect on thecost of living would be used in support of increased claims in currentwage negotiations.   Account must also be taken, however, of theeffect of these measures on the living expenses of pensioners andpersons in receipt of National Assistance.   From the point of viewof these classes of the community, there was much to be said forpostponing the withdrawal of these food subsidies until a time whenit could be accompanied by some compensating increases in NationalAssistance rates and social service benefits. From that point of viewit might be preferable that these changes in food subsidies should beintroduced in the budget, when countervailing advantages could beprovided for those classes which would be most seriously affectedby increases in food prices.On this question of the timing of these changes opinion in theCabinet was divided. Those who favoured the earlier date arguedthat firm action in respect of food subsidies was necessary todemonstrate to public opinion, at home and abroad, the Govern-ment&apos;s determination to deal effectively with the inflationary pressureswhich were undermining the national economy. They also urged theadvantages of introducing together all the unpopular measures whichthe Government thought it necessary to take for this purpose. OtherMinisters, who were more impressed with the political difficulties ofjustifying at the present time measures which would directly increasethe cost of living, argued that it would be preferable to postpone theseparticular measures until later in the spring, when they were lesslikely to coincide with the critical stage of current wage negotiationsand could be accompanied by some countervailing concessions tothose classes of the community who would be most seriously affectedby them.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that, in completing his plans forremedying the current economic situation, the Chancellor of theExchequer should assume that steps would be taken to abolish thebread subsidy and to increase the retail price of milk as proposed inparagraphs 50-51 of CP.

4Washington, with particular regard to the stage then reached incurrent wage negotiations, whether these measures should be includedamong those which the Chancellor was proposing to announce in ihesecond half of February or whether they should be reserved forinclusion in his budget proposals at a later date.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to thetiming of his proposals for discontinuing the breadsubsidy and increasing the retail price of milk.The Cabinet were informed that, in the forthcoming review offarm prices, the farmers&apos; representatives would press for a substantialincrease in the level of agricultural subsidies. It was unlikely that asettlement could be reached on this occasion in agreement with thefarmers&apos; representatives. The Government would probably find itnecessary to impose a settlement, at a figure somewhere between theestimated and the actual cost of the subsidies in the current year.The Minister of Agriculture said that it would be helpful if asmall Committee of Ministers could be appointed to supervise theconduct of the review. He hoped that the Chancellor of theExchequer would preside over this Committee and that the LordPrivy Seal would keep in touch with its proceedings. The Lord PrivySeal said that he would be glad to give the committee such help as hecould and would keep in touch with its work.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the proposals in paragraph 52 of CP. (56) 17on the probable level of agricultural subsidies in 1956-57;and agreed that a Ministerial Committee composed of Chancellor of the ExchequerMinister of AgricultureHome SecretarySecretary of State for ScotlandEconomic Secretary, Treasuryshould be appointed to supervise the conduct of thefollowing review of farm prices.The Cabinet noted that a Ministerial Committee had beenappointed, under the Chairmanship of rhe Lord Privy Seal, to reviewthe course of Government expenditure on the social services over thenext five years. It would be some time before this Committeereported. Meanwhile, the only early economy which seemed to bepracticable in this field was an increase in the charge for school meals.The Minister of Education suggested that this charge might be raisedfrom 9d. to Is. In discussion, however, doubts were expressed aboutthe expediency of making such an increase at the present time.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Education and theSecretary of State for Scotland, whether any increaseshould be made in the current charge for school meals.Administrative The Cabinet were reminded of the Prime Minister&apos;s request for ~osts. a further reduction in the cost of administration.  The Chancellor ofthfExcbeauer said that he would need the fullest co-operation fromall Ministers in charge of Departments if he was to reach the PrimeMinister&apos;s target of a reduction of between ten and fifteen thousandFarm Prices.Social Services.

If a reduction of this order was to beachieved, some lowering of administrative standards must beaccepted.The Cabinet (4) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 56-68 of CP. (56) 17,and invited all Ministers in charge of Departments toco-operate with the Chancellor of the Exchequer inreducing the current cost of administration.Coal Imports. The Cabinet (5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider a proposal,reported in paragraph 59 of CP. (56) 17, for a reductionin the level of coal imports.Steel Imports. The President of the Board of Trade said that there were soundeconomic grounds for a small increase in the price of home-producedsteel. These must, however, be balanced against the generaladvantages of a period of stability in prices. He agreed that furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of discontinuing theexisting control over steel prices and, in particular, of dispensing withthe system of averaging the prices of imported and home-producedsteel.The Cabinet (6) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to initiate afurther study of the existing methods of controlling steelprices.import In paragraphs 63-65 of CP. (56) 17 the Chancellor of (heControls. Exchequer had drawn attention to the possibility that urgent stepsmight have to be taken to control imports. The Cabinet agreed that,despite the disadvantages of reintroducing these controls, plansshould be prepared for emergency action to limit imports if theeconomic situation continued to deteriorate.The Cabinet (7) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare, inconsultation with the President of the Board of Trade,plans for emergency action to limit imports.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theparticular proposals put forward in CP. (56) 17 would now bediscussed further, with the Departmental Ministers directlyconcerned, in the light of the views expressed in the Cabinet&apos;spreliminary consideration of the Chancellor&apos;s plans. The results ofthese further discussions would then be brought together in a definitiveprogramme of proposals, which should be ready for furtherdiscussion by the Cabinet immediately after his return from NorthAmerica.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theproposals put forward in CP. (56) 17 to be consideredfurther, in consultation with the Ministers directlyconcerned, and to submit revised proposals for the Cabinet&apos;sconsideration early in February.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,25th January, 1956.
