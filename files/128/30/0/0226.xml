3CM. 2 (56)ConferenceCentre.(PreviousReference:C.C. (55) 25thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the formerMinister of Works (CP. (55) 187) reporting the outcome of the studyof the possibilities of erecting a permanent conference centre incentral London.It was stated in the memorandum that existing conferencefacilities were inadequate and were likely to become more so. Thecost of a permanent conference centre large enough to accommodatethe General Assembly of the United Nations would, however,amount to some  7 millions. It was improbable that the GeneralAssembly would wish to meet in London more than about once ineach decade, and no use could be foreseen for most of the accom-modation during the intervening years. It would therefore be cheaperto put up temporary buildings for any occasion on which the Assemblywere to meet here. A smaller conference centre capable ofaccommodating conferences of 500 delegates could be provided ata capital cost of about  1| millions and the lack of such a centreprevented us from offering hospitality to the smaller conferences. Ofsome 50 conferences of less than 500 delegates likely to be held overthe next five years, about half would be held in Europe but onlythree in the United Kingdom. There was therefore a case forproviding a small conference centre, although it would not be strictlyan economic proposition, and the building of accommodation for thispurpose could not now be given priority over other building projectswhich had been suspended for reasons of economy. Thememorandum therefore recommended that this proposal should beexamined again when there was less need for economy aid that, inthe meantime, no action should be taken to acquire a site.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in CP. (55) 187.Sale of SurplusWar Materials.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the proposed White Paperon the sale of surplus war materials was now expected to be readyfor publication during the last week of the Parliamentary recess. Inview of this, it would be possible to propose that the debate whichthe Labour Opposition wished to have on this subject should takeplace on the day when Parliament reassembled (24th January). Thismight forestall the Labour Opposition, who were contemplating aMotion of Censure. Although such a Motion would not in itselfembarrass the Government, it could not be debated before25th January, and it was undesirable that the departure of the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary for Washington should have tobe delayed because of such a Motion.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Leader of the Labour Opposition should beinformed, through the usual channels, that the Governmentwere prepared to arrange for a debate on the sale of surpluswar materials to be held in the House of Commons on24th January.Teachers&apos; 3.   The Prime Minister said that he had not been whollySuperannuation, convinced of the desirability of postponing the date on which the(Previous increased rate of contribution under the Teachers&apos; (Superannuation)Reference: Bill would come into force, and he felt that the Cabinet shouldCM. (56) lst reconsider the conclusions towards which their discussion on theConclusions, previous day had tended.   It was on the question of salaries, notMinute 6.) superannuation., that the teachers had a genuine case. Their49596 7b 2
4resistance to the payment of increased superannuation was notfounded on any sound principle and this was recognised amongGovernment supporters. He suggested that a further attempt shouldbe made to disentangle the difficulties which had arisen over aninterim increase in teachers&apos; salaries and to seek a solution to theproblem in that field before making, in regard to superannuation,concessions which would not be justified in themselves.The Minister of Education said that, on further reflection, he hadcome to the conclusion that it might be possible to separate the twoissues and to make progress if the Government were to take theinitiative in making a public statement designed to reopen a way tothe award and acceptance of an interim increase in salaries. Itwould be made clear in such a statement that the Government wouldhave been willing to approve the introduction of a reasonable interimincrease of salaries from 1st April, 1956, and that, if the BurnhamCommittee were to return to the suggestion of an interim increase, theGovernment would be prepared to consider it. These points wouldbe set in the context of a sympathetic reference to the need for anearly and thorough review of teachers&apos; salaries generally.It was generally felt in further discussion that an approach ofthis kind might well have some prospect of success and would bepreferable to the offer of the concessions in regard to superannuationwhich had been discussed previously.The text of a draft statement was considered and agreed. It wasdecided that, as some of the schools were about to reopen, thestatement should be issued forthwith to appear in the newspaperson 6th January and that the Burnham Committee, together with therepresentatives of the local authorities and of the teachers, should benotified in advance of the Government&apos;s intentions. The statementfor publication in Scotland, although on similar lines, would need tobe couched in somewhat different terms.The Cabinet were informed that, in advising the teachers toreject the offer of an interim increase of salary of 5 per cent, whichhad been made to them, the representatives of the local authoritieshad been exclusively preoccupied with the importance of increasingthe total range of teachers&apos; salaries and were concerned to ensurethat the total funds which would be available for improving teachers&apos;remuneration should be applied to this purpose. It could scarcelybe doubted, however, that, once an interim offer of a 5 per cent,increase of all basic salaries had been made, the Burnham Committeewould have to include in their next award a minimum provision ofthis order for all teachers.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Education to arrange for the issue of a public statementon the question of teachers&apos; salaries on the lines which hadbeen agreed in their discussion.Malta. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(Previous (CP. (55) 194) covering the Report of the Malta Round TableReference: Conference (Command 9657). The Cabinet confined their discussionCM. (55) 47th to the principal majority recommendation in the Report that MaltaConclusions, should be represented in the Parliament at Westminster if this shouldMinute 4.) be the clear and unmistakable wish of the Maltese people.The Lord Chancellor said that, in arriving at the recommenda-tion that this proposal of the present Maltese Government shouldbe accepted, the Round Table Conference had been influenced by a
5CM. 2 (56)number of considerations. First, there was an urgent need for adecision on the constitutional future of Malta, and, as the Island couldnever hope to attain the status of an independent member of theCommonwealth, there was no visible alternative solution. In thepresent uneasy conditions which prevailed in the Middle East andMediterranean region, it would be a serious step to reject theovertures for closer association which the Government of Maltahad put forward when there was a tendency for so many territoriesto prefer to take a more independent course. In many ways Maltawas unique among our possessions; she had joined us of her ownfree will; she had shared in our history and traditions for 150 years;and we had depended on her in three wars. The fortress economywhich we had had to create there had distorted the true economyof the Island. There was no reason to believe that the economicrepercussions of integration would prove as serious as had beenfeared. The Maltese were not asking for a close parity in socialstandards but for a broad equivalence taking fully into account thedifferent conditions which prevailed in the Mediterranean. Eventhis would take 15 or 20 years to attain. The Maltese were notasking for any greater volume of financial assistance than we hadalready been prepared to offer them and their economic objectiveswere not out of line with the level of economic development whichwe desired and were prepared to support in other Colonial territories.He did not consider that the misgivings expressed in the minorityreport by two members of the Conference were well founded.Distance, the existence of a subordinate Parliament, differences inhistory, language and legal systems were not in themselves, asexperience had proved, a bar to representation. It might well happenthat, in order to protect her nascent industries, Malta might beimpelled to impose duties on imported goods even from the UnitedKingdom. But this need not be a fundamental bar to representation,for the duties would simply achieve the purpose of a subsidy and wehad always been prepared to follow an empirical approach in suchmatters.The Colonial Secretary said that the Cabinet would wish to knowthat, whatever decision might be taken, the thoroughness with whichthe Round Table Conference had carried out its work had createda most profound impression in Malta. As regards the principalrecommendation, he himself had no doubt that representation atWestminster was the right solution. There would be no consistencyin a policy which sought forcibly to prevent Cyprus from drawingaway from us and at the same time repelled Malta in her attemptto draw closer. In his view there was positive value in the existenceof a minority report, for it would show that all the considerationsto which the two dissenting members referred had been taken intoaccount and rejected by the majority of the Conference. The wishesof the Maltese people would be known before the Government hadto state their attitude towards the main proposal and it would benecessary for the Cabinet to decide whether a simple majority or athree-quarters majority, or some intervening percentage, wouldconstitute &quot; clear and unmistakable&quot; support in Malta forintegration. But the response of the Maltese people would beinfluenced by the form of the questions which were put to them andby a number of other factors, and he would prefer to reserve adecision on this question until it could be taken in the full knowledgeof the circumstances in which the referendum had been conducted.In the course of discussion misgivings were expressed about thepossible consequences of Malta&apos;s representation in the Parliamentat Westminster:  (a) The Home Secretary said that such a step would stimulatepressure for a greater measure of independence, or for increasedrepresentation at Westminster, on the part of Wales and possiblyScotland.
6(b) It was felt that some restraint would be exercised on thisstimulus if it were laid down that Malta should be represented, inproportion to her population, on the same basis as Northern Ireland.Mr. Mintoff had asked for a minimum representation of threemembers, but the present size of the Maltese electorate would justifya representation of rather more than two, but not three, members.It should, however, be possible to justify an initial representation ofthree members provided the basic principle was written into thearrangements and no increase in representation was allowed to occuruntil it was justified by growth in the Maltese electorate.(c) Several Ministers felt that, in the search for means of holdingin restraint centrifugal tendencies in the Commonwealth, integrationwas too easy a solution. It was contrary to our traditions, andMalta would obtain power and influence over our affairs withoutresponsibility for them. There was some support for the viewsexpressed in the minority report. Against this, it was pointed outthat no satisfactory alternative had been put forward, that theoutlook in Malta would be serious if a solution could not be found,and that the decision to allow Maltese representation at Westminstercould be reversed should it be shown by experience to be wrong.There was support for the view that the merit of the proposaldepended on whether Malta was in fact unique and whetherrepresentation would lead to a widespread demand from otherColonial territories for similar advantages. On this, it was pointedout that a survey which had already been carried out had shownthat out of thirty-five territories only three of the smaller Colonieswere likely to consider claiming similar treatment.(d) The view was also expressed that, if a solution whichinvolved some measure of integration had to be accepted, it wouldbe undesirable that Maltese members should have the full right ofspeaking and voting on United Kingdom and Commonwealth issueswhich did not concern them. Moreover, Maltese representation,based on a growing electorate, might well be in a position to holda balance in the deliberations of Parliament. Against this, it wasargued that it was contrary to our traditions to provide for limitedmembership of either House of Parliament and the representationof Malta would not present more serious problems than werenormally experienced in the relations between State and Federallegislatures.(e) In the light of these various considerations there was somediscussion of the measure of support for the proposal in Malta whichwould constitute the clear and unmistakable will of the Maltesepeople. Some Ministers felt that a simple majority would besufficient and that a favourable vote of 55 per cent, would be entirelysatisfactory. Those Ministers, however, who felt misgivings on themain issue, considered that a more decisively favourable vote, ofthe order of 60 per cent., should be required and that, to avoiddispute and misunderstanding, this should be made public beforethe referendum was held. It was considered, however, that, as theRound Table Conference had not felt able to give a lead on thispoint, it was not open to the Government to make an announcementin advance of the referendum and in advance of the discussion ofthe Report in Parliament. It was suggested that, to avoid theGovernment&apos;s having to take an arbitrary decision which might bechallenged in debate and create misunderstanding in Malta, thequestion should be remitted to the Round Table Conference for arecommendation. But the Conference had felt that this was a matterfor the Government to decide.The Colonial Secretary said that the Maltese Prime Minister hadundertaken to consult him on the proposition which would be putto the Maltese people and the Cabinet would be informed of thequestions which would be put in the referendum.
7CM. 2 (56)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the proposal wereto be accepted, it should be on the clear understanding that financialassistance to Malta would continue only at the level at presentforecast and not at some more favourable level. It would benecessary to determine at the outset the maximum financial assistancewhich the United Kingdom would agree to provide over a definiteperiod of years and to secure the Maltese Government&apos;s acceptanceof this figure. Both these conditions were clearly in line with therecommendations on financial assistance in the Report.It was agreed that the Report should next be considered inmore detail by the Colonial Policy Committee, with the addition ofthe Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the HomeSecretary.The Cabinet (1) Deferred their decision on the question whether the principalrecommendation in the Report of the Malta Round TableConference should be accepted.(2) Invited the Colonial Policy Committee, with the additionof the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Home Secretary, to consider in more detail therecommendations in the Report and the problems arisingout of them and to report back to the Cabinet.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate to the Cabinetthe terms of the questions which would be put to theMaltese people in the forthcoming referendum.Armed Forces.Pay.(PreviousReference :C.C. (54) 13thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (56) 3) on pay for the Armed Forces.The Minister of Defence said that he had set out in his paperthe main differences between the proposals of the Service Ministersand those of the Chancellor of the Exchequer about pay increases forthe Services. Decisions about the future of National Service wouldhave to be taken by March, 1958. The number of National Service-men required depended on the country&apos;s military commitments andon the size of the regular element in the Armed Forces. It seemedinevitable that, on political grounds, some cut would have to be madein the period of full-time National Service by 1958, but such areduction without a reduction in the requirement for NationalServicemen would only result in a serious loss of efficiency in theServices. It was essential, therefore, during the next two years, toincrease regular recruitment and re-engagement. Apart from three-year engagements which were generally accepted only as a preferablealternative to National Service, regular recruitment had shown aserious decline during the past three years. What the Services wantedwas an increase in the number of men engaging for at least nineyears. For such men, when fully trained, the Chancellor had offereda pay of 155. a day, which would equate their earnings approximatelywith the average industrial wage in April, 1955. Industrial earningswere, however, rising and, in the view of the Service Ministers, morewould be required if young men were to be induced to accept long-term Service engagements with all the restrictions on personalfreedom which a Service career inevitably involved. Moreover, someinitial lead on the current average of industrial earnings was justifiedsince Service pay was only adjusted at five-year intervals. TheServices considered, therefore, that the pay for the trained manaccepting a nine-year engagement should be 18s. a day. Thisproposal was less than the figure which the Service Ministers hadoriginally put forward and represented the minimum which theyconsidered necessary to stimulate long-term Service recruitment.
8The problem of retaining an adequate number of officers in theServices was equally serious. Large numbers of officers in the middleranks were leaving the Services for employment in industry andgreater inducements would be required to persuade them to continuein a Service career. The Service Ministers had originally proposedincreases in officers&apos; pay amounting to  213 millions a year. Theirproposals had now been reduced to about  18 3 millions a year, butagainst this the Chancellor had offered increases amounting to only 10 millions a year.Increases in the pay of National Servicemen would notcontribute to the main objective of increasing regular recruitment.On the other hand, National Servicemen had not had any increasein pay since 1946 and it would be difficult not to include them in ageneral review. It was therefore proposed to increase their pay bya shilling a day, which would cost  5 millions a year.There were certain other minor differences between the ServiceMinisters&apos; and the Chancellor&apos;s proposals, but these could be resolvedby further discussion. In total the Service Ministers&apos; proposals wouldamount to an increase of about  84 millions a year, whereas theChancellor&apos;s counter-proposals would amount to about  54 millionsa year. The proposals of the Service Ministers were designed notmerely as a pay increase to give some sort of parity with otheremployment, but as a new deal to show clearly that the Servicescould offer a worthwhile career.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals forincreases in Service pay must be considered against the generaleconomic background of the country.   Despite the measures takenduring the last year, culminating in the autumn budget, the economicsituation had not improved.   The December figures for unemploy-ment were the lowest ever recorded, which indicated that thecompeting demands on the available labour were increasing. Thetrade returns for December showed a deficit of about  100 millions,compared with a deficit of  70 millions in the previous month. Goldand dollar reserves had fallen again and were now only about  100millions above the danger mark.   In the circumstances it would bewrong for the Government to do anything to aggravate theinflationary pressure, particularly as the private sector of the economywould be looking critically to see whether the Government werefollowing the financial precepts which were being urged on them.Despite all efforts to achieve a reduction, the Estimates for next yearwould show an increase in Government expenditure; defenceexpenditure would increase by about  100 millions and civilianexpenditure by about  150 millions. This increase would be criticisedin the country, particularly by business men who had been affectedby credit restrictions.   He agreed on the importance of increasingregular recruitment, but in view of the serious economic situation ofthe country it was essential that the pay increases given to the Servicesshould be the minimum needed to achieve this objective. It had beenrecognised that it would be impossible to maintain Armed Forces ofthe size required on a voluntary basis.   The problem of reducingdependence on National Service would therefore have to be tackledby stages. The regular element in the Services should be increased tothe maximum possible and with the resultant increase in efficiency theServices should be able to meet their commitments with smaller totalnumbers.  Turning to the comparative figures given in the Ministerof Defence&apos;s paper, his own proposal of \5s. a day for the trainedman undertaking a nine-year engagement was roughly equivalent toa wage of about  10 a week for a civilian worker, when account hadbeen taken of allowances in kind which Servicemen received. Thispay would be received by a comparatively young man after eighteenmonths&apos; training, whereas the equivalent wage in industry would beearned by much older men after many years in their employment.Moreover, a regular soldier would not remain as a private throughouthis Service career: on promotion he would get increases in pay as a
9CM. 2 (56)non-commissioned officer. In order to stimulate longer-term recruit-ment, there should be a greater differential between the pay of menentering on nine-year and three-year engagements. He also suggestedthat there should be no increase in pay of National Servicemen,except to those of 21 years or more. This proposal would save  3millions a year. The Service Ministers&apos; proposals would involve anincrease of nearly 30 per cent, on the present cost of Service pay. Hisproposals would involve an increase of about  54 millions a year,which was in his view the maximum which the country could atpresent afford. If it were decided that any higher figure was required,a compensating saving would have to be made elsewhere in Govern-ment expenditure.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) An increase in the number of long-term regulars wouldreduce the effort which the Services at present had to devote totraining, but any saving of this kind would only be apparent in thelonger term. This saving would be significantly increased if NationalService could be abolished.(b) In the Royal Air Force no less than 30 per cent, of the menwere engaged on training or in being trained. The shortage of long-service men made it extremely difficult to get the number of skilledmen required.(c) The production demands of the Services had a greaterinflationary effect on the economy than any increase in pay On theother hand, the Services and the Ministry of Supply had already madevery considerable economies in their Estimates for next year, whichwould only increase by about  100 millions, although  75 millionshad to be provided to meet the costs of the Forces in Germanyand production costs had also increased by  75 millions. The risksinvolved in the cuts which had already been made would only bejustified if the efficiency of the Forces could be increased through animprovement in regular recruitment.(d) In 1950 the Socialist Government had given the ArmedForces a pay increase of  40 millions a year. This had not beensufficient to stimulate long-term regular recruitment and the Armyhad been forced to fall back on three-year engagements. Recruit-ment had temporarily improved, but only 6 per cent, of these three-year men were now renewing their initial engagements. An increaseof  54 millions a year as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerwould only bring the Services into line with current wages in outsideemployment. The experience of the 1950 pay increase indicated thatthis would not be sufficient to achieve the objective of increasinglong-term regular recruitment.(e) An increase of 30 per cent, in the Services&apos; pay would belikely to have repercussions on other public employees who, howevermistakenly, would consider that their salaries and wages should beincreased by comparable amounts. In particular it would be difficultto persuade the teachers to accept a salary increase of only 10 percent.(/) The previous pay increases in 1950 and 1954 had not hadany effect on the wage claims put forward by the Trade Unions.(g) Experience in the Royal Navy, where trained men on seven-year engagements were at present paid 15s. a day, showed that thisrate was insufficient to retain such men in the Service.(h) The present difficulty over regular recruitment was in partdue to the general over-employment in the country. On the otherhand, experience over the years showed that there was generally abody of men willing to make their careers in the Services providedthe pay and conditions were broadly comparable to those in otheremployment.49596 2
10(/) Unless regular recruitment could be improved, the Armywould be in a serious position by 1958. To maintain an efficientArmy 90,000 men with over three years&apos; experience would berequired but, if present trends continued, there would be only 50,000by that date and of these only 13,000 would be in the three to sixyears group.(/&apos;) For the first time since the abolition of the press gangs, thevolunteer intake into the Royal Navy had fallen below the intake ofNational Servicemen. If this trend continued the efficiency of theNavy would be seriously impaired.(k) Unless the present inflation were controlled, the benefits ofany pay increase to the Services would very soon disappear.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that long-term regular recruitment should be encouraged andthat the main benefits of any pay increases should be given to themen prepared to accept nine-year engagements, even at the expenseof improvements in the pay of shorter-term regulars and NationalServicemen. It was, however, evident from the discussion that therewas a conflict between the pay increases which the Service Ministersconsidered necessary to achieve the objective of improving regularrecruitment and the amount which other Ministers considered itwould be prudent to spend for this purpose in view of the seriouseconomic position of the country and the urgent need to restrictGovernment expenditure in order to combat inflation.It was agreed that, in the light of the guidance given by theCabinet&apos;s discussion, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Defence should attempt in furtherconsultation to arrive at a possible basis for settlement.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would consider furtherwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofDefence the problem of pay increases for the Armed Forcesand would inform the Cabinet of their conclusions.Technological 6.   The Cabinet gave preliminary consideration to the problemEducation. of technical and technological education in the United Kingdom in(Previous the light of the undertaking which had been given to publish a WhiteReference: Paper on this subject shortly after the present Parliamentary recess.CM (55)45th They had before them memoranda by the Minister of EducationConclusions, (CP. (55) 205) and by the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (55)Minute 6.) 207) and a note by the Prime Minister (CP. (56) 1) covering amemorandum by Lord Cherwell.The Lord Privy Seal said that further examination of thisproblem was required in order to reconcile the proposals which LordCherwell had put forward with those outlined in the memoranda bythe Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland.It would be inappropriate to entrust this further examination to anoutside Committee as proposed by Lord Cherwell. He suggested thatthe matter should initially be examined by an official Committeewhich should include representatives of the Ministry of Education,Scottish Office, Treasury and Ministry of Labour. This Committeeshould report to the Minister of Education. It should consider thedraft of the White Paper to be submitted to Parliament. The problemmight then be discussed by a small Ministerial Committee consistingof the Lord President, the Minister of Education, the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury, the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Scotland (Mr. Henderson Stewart), and himself.
IICM. 2 (56)The Cabinet Agreed with the procedure proposed by the Lord PrivySeal for examining the problem of technical and techno-logical education in the United Kingdom.Civil Service.RoyalCommission.(PreviousReference:C.C. (53) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (55) 203) on the Report of the RoyalCommission on the Civil Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he invited hiscolleagues to give their general approval to the broad principlesrecommended by the Royal Commission and the changes in presentconditions of service which they had proposed, so that the OfficialSide of the National Whitley Council could enter into negotiationswith the Staff Side with a view to the early implementation of theseproposals. The Official Side would be instructed to secure an agreedsettlement which would adhere as closely as possible to the RoyalCommission&apos;s proposals, reporting back for further instructionsshould agreement on any material point appear unattainable withouta significant departure from them.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in CP. (55) 203.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,4th January. 1956.
