.1CM. 62 (56)Germany. ]    jne Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First LordTraining of of the Admiralty (D.C. (56) 21) on the provision of training facilitiesAirmen. for the German Fleet Air Arm.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that in March 1955 theDefence Committee had agreed that the German Air Force couldbe given training facilities in the United Kingdom, provided that nolarge number of German airmen were in this country in uniformat any one time. Negotiations were in progress for the purchase bythe German Fleet Air Arm of 68 Seahawks and 16 Gannets at atotal cost of  6-8 millions. The success of these negotiations waslikely to turn on our willingness to provide the training requirementsfor which the Germans had asked. These could be provided if theGermans supplied their own maintenance and administrative staff.It would mean that a total of about 264 German Service personnelwould be brought to this country but they would be dispersed overa number of different airfields. The Admiralty would have to bringforward 18 aircraft from the reserve to meet this training requirement,at a cost of about  500,000. If there were a continuing commitmentfor initial pilot training, they would be unable to make the proposedcut of  500,000 in their air training costs. He therefore proposedthat the Germans should pay the full cost of meeting this commitment;and on this basis the total training bill would amount to 1 -25 millions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the provision of thesetraining facilities for the German Fleet Air Arm would make itimpossible to carry out certain reductions which it had been hopedto achieve in Service expenditure. On the other hand we shouldgain a larger benefit from the sale of the aircraft. He agreed thatthis German request should be met, but he asked that the detailsof the charges which the Germans should be asked to meet shouldbe discussed further between the Treasury and the Admiralty.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the training facilities outlined in D.C. (56) 21should be provided for the German Fleet Air Arm.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange for theAdmiralty and the Treasury to settle the precise sum to becharged for these facilities.&gt;Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 61stConclusions.Minute 1.)DiplomaticExchanges.*2. The Cabinet reviewed the course of the diplomaticexchanges which had taken place since the end of the LondonConference.The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Government wereexpected to reply that morning to the offer of the Five-PowerCommittee to elucidate the conclusions of the conference. It seemedlikely that they would agree to meet the Committee in Cairo. Thisvenue, despite its disadvantages, would enable the consultations to becompleted more quickly. The Committee were empowered to do nomore than explain the statement of principles: if the Egyptians wereready to accept those principles as a basis for negotiation a new bodywould be setup to carry on the negotiations. It was contemplatedthat this might consist of six Powers, including the United States,the United Kingdom and France.The Prime Minister said that the United States Secretary of Stateand the French Foreign Minister had been consulted about possiblecourses of action if Egypt rejected the principle of internationalcontrol over the Suez Canal. The possibility of referring the issueto the Security Council was now being considered in consultationwith the Governments of the United States and France. Hitherto,the United States had been against any reference to the United* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.50746 1 b 2
4Employees ofthe Suez CanalCompany.Political andEconomicConsiderations.Nations, but the French Government recognised that such a coursewould have advantages from the point of view of world opinion. Itwould undoubtedly involve serious risks e.g., of delay and ofembarrassing amendments: but we should certainly stand better withforeign opinion and with our own if we had shown that a majorityof the Security Council were prepared to endorse the statement ofprinciples adopted by the London Conference. A Russian veto ofsuch a resolution would demonstrate clearly the obstructive natureof Communist tactics.Consultations were also being held about the possibility ofdenying to the Egyptian Government the financial benefit of transitdues for ships using the Suez Canal. The Dutch and GermanGovernments were prepared to support action on these lines.Hitherto the United States Government had argued that, if thepayment of transit dues were stopped, they would no longer be ableto block the Egyptian Government&apos;s gold holdings in New York.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of making some appropriate reference tothe Security Council, before any military operations were undertaken,if we could be assured in advance of the full support of the UnitedStates and other friendly Powers. In that event it should be possibleto defeat any embarrassing amendments to a resolution endorsingthe statement of principles adopted at the London Conference. Fiveof the permanent members of the Security Council had alreadyendorsed that statement, and it should be possible to secure two orthree additional votes. It would be preferable to take the initiativein referring the issue to the Security Council rather than risk beingarraigned before it on the ground that our military measuresconstituted a threat to peace.The Foreign Secretary referred to the position of the non-Egyptian employees of the Suez Canal Company. The majority ofthe pilots disliked working for the new Egyptian authority and hadindicated their loyalty to the Company, on whom they depended fortheir pension rights. The Company were considering the issue of aninstruction to their pilots to leave their posts on 7th September unlessby that date the Egyptian Government had accepted the principle ofinternational control. In view of their position as the major share-holder, the United Kingdom Government could not dissociatethemselves from any instructions issued by the Company. Aninstruction on the lines now proposed might be interpreted as anattempt by the United Kingdom Government to impede the operationof the Canal. On the other hand, it would be wrong to press non-Egyptian employees of the Company to remain in Egypt againsttheir will. The Government had therefore suggested to the Companythat their foreign employees should be advised to remain at workuntil it was known whether the Egyptian Government were preparedto negotiate on the basis of the statement of principles adopted atthe London Conference.In discussion it was suggested that, whatever instructions wereissued by the Company, it would be desirable that the Foreign Officeshould issue a statement about the position of British nationalsemployed by the Suez Canal Company. This might emphasise thedesirability that these employees should remain at work until the finalreply from the Egyptian Government had been received, while at thesame time recognising that individuals could not be pressed to remainat work against their will.The Cabinet then considered the political and economicconsequences which would follow if Egypt&apos;s action in seizing the SuezCanal were allowed to pass uncorrected. Copies were produced ofa paper (E.C. (56) 35) in which the Treasury had made a provisionalassessment of the financial and economic considerations which were atstake. This showed that, if an atmosphere of crisis were avoided, themilitary precautions now in hand would not seriously disturb theequilibrium of the national economy, though they would tend to retard
5CM. 62 (56)the progress which was being made in checking inflation andimproving the balance of payments. If military operations had tobe undertaken, the Budgetary cost would not be large in relation to thecurrent level of defence expenditure, but more serious economic effectswould flow from the dislocation of traffic through the Suez Canal.The major risk to the national economy lay in the threat to our oilsupplies. If the Suez Canal were closed, the cost of obtaining oilfrom the Western Hemisphere to supplement our supplies would bea serious burden on our balance of payments and on our reserves ofgold and dollars. If, in addition, the pipelines to the Levant wereclosed, we should be unable to obtain all the oil we needed, industrywould be dislocated, and we should be unable to sustain for longthe burden of paying for such oil supplies as we could obtain fromthe Western Hemisphere. If for any reason we also lost our oilsupplies from the Persian Gulf, the economy of the United Kingdomand of Western Europe would cease to be viable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our national economynow depended on supplies of oil from the Middle East. ColonelNasser&apos;s ambitions threatened those supplies directly, because theyjeopardised the freedom and efficiency of the Suez Canal; andindirectly, because the success of his plans would inevitably impairour relations with the oil-producing countries of the Middle East.In further discussion it was argued that, although those countrieswould still have an interest in selling their oil, it would not besatisfactory to us to be obliged to take it on their terms; and, asexperience in Iran had shown, there could be no certainty that in thesecountries nationalist aspirations would not outweigh commercial self-interest. The Governors of Aden, Somaliland and Kenya had alreadygiven warning that the Arabs in those Colonies were watching forthe outcome of this contest between Colonel Nasser and the WesternPowers and that, if it ended in a triumph for Colonel Nasser, Britishinfluence among the Arabs in these countries would be destroyed.If this were true of Arab communities in British Colonial territories,it was evident that we should face a very serious situation in the ArabStates themselves, and we could hardly hope to sustain for long ourinfluence in Iraq or in the Persian Gulf. There could therefore belittle doubt that, if Colonel Nasser&apos;s policy succeeded, our wholeposition in the Middle East would be undermined, our oil supplieswould be in jeopardy, and the stability of our national economywould be gravely threatened.The Minister of Defence said that, for the reasons which hadbeen stated in the discussion, he agreed that we could not afford toallow Colonel Nasser to succeed in his attempt to seize control overthe Suez Canal and that, if all other methods proved unavailing,force would have to be used to prevent it. On the other hand, theCabinet should weigh the disadvantages of using force. If, togetherwith the French, we took military measures against Egypt, our actionwould be condemned by a substantial body of public opinion incountries overseas, including several of the independent countries ofthe Commonwealth. Within the United Kingdom itself opinionwould be divided. Our vital interests in other parts of the Middle Eastwould also be affected; we must, in particular, expect sabotage againstoil installations in other Arab countries. Moreover, once we hadsent military forces into Egypt, it would not be easy to extricate them;we might find ourselves saddled with a costly commitment. While,therefore, he was ready to agree that we must continue to be preparedto use force in the last resort, he hoped that we should first exhaust allother means of curbing Colonel Nasser&apos;s ambitions and, in particular,that we should let no opportunity pass of securing a settlement byagreement.The Lord President said that no course was now open to us whichwas free from serious risks. If, however, we were satisfied that thesuccess of Colonel Nasser&apos;s policy would undermine our nationaleconomy and destroy our influence as a world Power, we should be
6resolved to take whatever action was necessary to defeat that policy.This did not mean that we should not continue to do our utmost tosecure our objective by peaceful means. Moreover, if force hadultimately to be used, we should seek the maximum internationalsupport for its use. He therefore hoped that, before any militarymeasures were taken, we should have recourse to the procedures ofthe United Nations. We should, however, remember that the UnitedNations was only a means to an end; and the end was, not merely thepreservation of peace, but the observance of the rules of law andjustice. If the United Nations failed to secure international justice, itwould have failed to fulfil its purpose. Finally, the lessons of the1930&apos;s should not be forgotten. Experience with Italy, and later withGermany, had surely shown that if the encroachments of a dictatorwere not checked at the outset, when comparatively little strengthwas needed to check them, the ultimate reckoning involved a fargreater convulsion and a much greater sacrifice.The Lord Chancellor said that, while force should be the lastresort, it was a weapon which we should not shrink from using if needarose. It would be wrong to disregard the United Nations, but itwould be equally wrong to allow the real issue to be eroded byineffective international debate. As soon as we were satisfied thata just settlement could not be secured through the machinery of theUnited Nations, we should ourselves take other steps to secure it.Apart from any consideration of self-interest we had a strong case,morally and in international law. We were entitled to see that itprevailed. If it could not be made to prevail by peaceful means, weshould be resolved to impose it by force. It had been well statedby Professor Goodhart, in a letter published in The Times on11th August, that there was no foundation for the view that undermodern international law force might be used only to repel a directterritorial attack. A State might properly use force to protect a vitalnational interest which had been imperilled; and in such a case it wasthe State which had altered the status quo which was guilty ofaggression.The Lord Privy Seal said that the national interest must beparamount. But, in order to secure it, the Government would needthe greatest measure of support they could command in Parliamentand in the country. From this point of view it was important thatthey should be able to show that, before resorting to force, theyhad taken all practicable steps to secure a satisfactory settlement bypeaceful means. There was a substantial section of Governmentsupporters in the House of Commons who would attach specialimportance to this point. From the Parliamentary point of view itwas specially desirable that some reference should be made to theSecurity Council, despite the risks which that involved, before anymilitary operation was undertaken. The Parliamentary situation wasin any event bound to be difficult, for there would be some elementsof public opinion in this country which would oppose any use of forceas a means of securing a settlement of this question. It was as yettoo early to decide when Parliament should be convened. It seemedunlikely, however, that it would be appropriate for it to meet beforethe end of the following week.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat it was evident that the Cabinet were united in the view that thefrustration of Colonel Nasser&apos;s policy was a vital British interestwhich must be secured, in the last resort, by the use of force. Hefully recognised that, before recourse was had to force, everypracticable attempt should be made to secure a satisfactory settlementby peaceful means and it must be made clear to the public, here andoverseas, that no effort to this end had been spared. At the sametime we could not afford to allow these efforts to impose an undue Adelay. Our French Allies, whose public opinion was less divided than ^our own, would be quick to place an unfavourable interpretation onanything which could be construed as hesitancy on our part. Colonel
7 CM. 62 (56)Nasser would also be looking for signs of weakening in our attitude.Finally, the difficulties of any military operation would be increasedif it were long delayed. While therefore the possibilities of a peacefulsettlement should be fully explored, this should not be allowed toweaken our resolution or to reduce the weight of our pressure on theEgyptian Government.Mi,itarv The Cabinet then had a brief discussion about the character ofMeasures.       the military operations that might have to be undertaken.The Minister of Defence said that the Cabinet would not wishto be informed of the details of the military plan. He could, however,assure them that ample force would be available to secure the essentialobjectives which the Government had in mind and to deal with suchopposition as was expected. The French were contributing asubstantial portion of the forces required, and they were co-operatingsatisfactorily in the planning of the operation. Military planning wasstill based on the original assumption that any operation undertakenshould be launched at the earliest practicable date, and up to now ithad not been found necessary on political grounds to defer anypreliminary movement or preparation to an extent which would havethe effect of delaying the operation. A stage would soon be reached,however, at which it would become difficult to preserve any largemeasure of flexibility in the military plan. The efficiency of theoperation might be endangered by any long postponement of the dateon which planning was being based.In this part of the discussion the following particular points wereraised:  (a) What would be the scope of the operation? The Cabinetwere informed that the forces which it was proposed to deploy shouldbe sufficient to overwhelm such opposition as was likely to beencountered.(b) Would any preliminary bombardment be required? It wasexplained that the preliminary air attack would be confined to theneutralisation of military airfields. This was essential to the successof the operation. It would, however, be carried out with due regardfor civilian life and property.(c) Was there likely to be some specific occasion which wouldjustify military intervention? This point was already underconsideration, in consultation with the French Government, whoattached particular importance to it.id) Would any of our Allies, in addition to the French, beprepared to participate in a military operation? The Cabinet wereinformed that New Zealand had put a cruiser at our disposal, andthat Australia might make some token contribution. It was unlikelythat any other country would participate in the operation, and themilitary plans took no account of this possibility. It was, however,to be hoped that moral support might be given by some of theGovernments which had adhered to the statement of principlesadopted at the London Conference.(e) Further preliminary movements might have to be made inthe near future if we were to be in a position to take military actionpromptly if need arose. The Cabinet agreed that there would be nopolitical objection to necessary movements of this nature.The Cabinet Took note that the Egypt Committee would continue toexplore on their behalf the means of securing a satisfactorysettlement of the Suez Canal issue; and agreed to resumetheir consideration of this problem when the EgyptianGovernment had defined their attitude towards the statementof principles adopted at the London Conference.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,29th August, 1956.
