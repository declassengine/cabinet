3CM. 57 (56)Food&apos; 1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofEgg Marketing Agriculture (CP. (56) 195) on a draft scheme for egg marketingScheme. which had been submitted by the farmers&apos; organisations under the(Previous        Agricultural Marketing Acts.Reference: jfle Minister of Agriculture said that, in order to provide a widerC.C. (53) 2nd latitude for the local sale of eggs and more freedom for the smallConclusions, producer, he had made a number of amendments to the SchemeMinute 5.) which the Farmers&apos; Unions had first put forward. Theseamendments, which went somewhat further than those recommendedby the Commissioner appointed to enquire into the objections laidagain:;t the Scheme, had been approved by the Home AffairsCommittee. The Committee had not, however, been able to agreewhether the Scheme should provide for the compulsory pooling ofthe costs of transport from the packing stations to the ultimatemarket. These costs had been pooled for many years under theexisting arrangements for marketing eggs; remote producers inScotland and Northern Ireland were particularly anxious to seethese arrangements continued, and had threatened to withdraw fromthe Scheme if it did not contain a provision making this compulsory.The proposed Egg Marketing Board would have authority, underthe Scheme as it stood at present, to pool transport costs and mightwell avail themselves of this authority. He was averse, however,to imposing a statutory obligation on the Board to pool transportcosts, as this might increase the cost of subsidising egg productionand would set an undesirable precedent for other marketing schemes.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that egg producers inthe Orkneys and other distant parts of Scotland would feel that theGovernment had been indifferent to their interests if the proposedScheme did not make it mandatory to continue a benefi; which theyhad enjoyed for many years.The Home Secretary said that he had been warned that theNorthern Ireland producers would withdraw from the Scheme if nosuch provision were included in it. He himself doubted whetherthey would take such an extreme course; but, if they did, it wouldhe necessary to submit a revised Scheme which would not then applyto Northern Ireland.It was the general view of the Cabinet that there was nojustification for including in a statutory scheme for egg marketinga requirement that the costs of transport should be pooled and thatthis matter should be left to the judgment of the Marketing Boardwhich would be set up under the Scheme.The Cabinet Agreed that the proposed egg marketing scheme should bepromulgated in the form approved by the AgricultureMinisters, viz., without a provision making it mandatoryfor the costs of transport to be pooled.LegislativeProgramme:1956-57Session.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 50thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the legislativeprogramme for 1956-57 on the basis of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;smemorandum C.P. (56) 162.The Lord Privy Seal said that, if the Government decided toproceed with the reform of the House of Lords and to introduce aBill to amend the law of murder, considerable cuts would have tobe made in the programme of Bills annexed to his memorandum.It would not be possible to take a final decision on the content of theprogramme until the time came to prepare The Queen&apos;s Speech.Meanwhile, preparatory work should proceed on the Bills containedin the lists annexed to his memorandum, which would now requiresome amendment, by obtaining authority for the proposed legislationfrom the appropriate Ministerial Committee and, where required,from the Treasury.50285 3B 2
In discussion of the composition of the lists the following pointswere made:  (a) There was some prospect that the Opposition would beprepared to facilitate the passage of the Bill on Police Pay.(b) Control over hire-purchase transactions was contributingtowards the success of the Government&apos;s disinflationary policies, butthe powers under which this control was being exercised were nowof doubtful validity. It might therefore be necessary to give priorityto a Hire-Purchase Bill in the next session.(c) A Bill to re-form the West Indies Regiment must also becontemplated. The proposal that this Regiment should be re-formedhad been welcomed by the Governments of nearly all the territoriesconcerned, but United Kingdom legislation would be necessary asit would be impracticable to attempt to secure the enactment of anidentical Bill in all West Indian Legislatures.(d) The Bills relating to Betting and Gaming and to Ceyloncould now be withdrawn from the programme. It was also unlikely,owing to difficulty in reaching agreement with the Government ofIndia, that it would be possible to proceed with a Bill amending theColonial Stock Acts; and there was some prospect that a PublicWorks Loans Bill would not be needed.(e) No legislation on local government reorganisation was nowcontemplated in the forthcoming session. There would be advantagein having a Bill on Local Government Finance, but this might not beready in time. In that event a limited Bill would be needed to remedycertain injustices to shopkeepers which had resulted from the recentrating revaluation and to provide for the rating of nationalisedundertakings.(/) The fact that the Central Electricity Board had now beenentrusted with the Government&apos;s nuclear power programme wouldreinforce the case for enacting legislation in the next session toprovide for a more flexible structure and organisation for thisindustry. The Cabinet would need to consider the case for thisBill before reaching their decision on the content of the legislativeprogramme.(g) Legislation would also be desirable to extend the provisionsof the Visiting Forces Acts to personnel of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation stationed in this country. It was also desirable thatlegislation should be enacted to embody the Geneva Conventionson the treatment of prisoners of war.(/?) In view of the judgment given in the Baddeley case, thequestion whether legislation on charitable trusts might becomenecessary was being examined. There was also a possibility that aBill dealing with the employment of young people on the railwaysmight be required.(/&apos;) Legislation to improve the salaries of the inferior Judiciaryshould be considered in conjunction with corresponding legislationrelating to Ministers&apos; salaries. Meanwhile the Judicial Salaries Billshould remain in List B.(/&apos;) In order to accommodate in the programme legislation onthe reform of the House of Lords and the law of murder, it mightbe necessary to drop the Shops (Closing Hours) Bill. This would beunfortunate, as it would make the programme less attractivepolitically.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the lists annexed to C.P (56) 162 as a basis for thelegislative programme for the forthcoming session.(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to arrange for preparatorywork on these Bills to proceed.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the ForeignSecretary and the Minister of Defence, to circulate a
5CM. 57 (56)memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee setting outthe case for the early enactment of the Bills mentionedin paragraph (g) above.(4) Agreed to resume their consideration of the final compositionof the programme at a later meeting.Anglo- 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAmerican Postmaster-General (CP. (56) 200) seeking their views on a proposedTelegraph transaction involving the sale to American interests of the trans-Company. Atlantic cables of the British Anglo-American Telegraph Company.The Postmaster-General said that the five cables were at presentleased by the British Company to the American Western UnionTelegraph Company at a rental of  262,500 a year on a 99-year leasewhich was due to expire in 2010. Under American law the latterCompany was under a statutory obligation to divest itself of itsoversea assets, and negotiations were in progress under which anotherAmerican Company was proposing to acquire these cables from theAnglo-American Telegraph Company. This transaction wouldprobably attract some criticism, on the grounds that it representeda further sale of British commercial assets to American interests andthat the price received for them was inadequate. The cables were,however, old; their value would depreciate as a result of moderntechnical developments; and heavy expenditure had to be incurredin maintaining them. From the commercial point of view theproposed transaction was soundly conceived. It would have noadverse effect on communications and would not conflict with thedevelopment policy of the Post Office.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a fair valuation ofthe lease of the cables might, on a normal basis, be as high as$13^ millions instead of the $12+ millions which was the maximumwhich would be received. Nevertheless, a discount would have tobe taken because of the age of the cables and the cost of maintainingthem; and the value of the rental agreement was depreciated by thefact that, if the operation of the cables should be suspended for aperiod of twelve months by the action of either Government, theagreement would lapse. In any event there was no power under theexchange control regulations to prevent the transaction.The Cabinet Agreed that there was no justification for intervening inthe proposed sale by the Anglo-American TelegraphCompany of its trans-Atlantic cables to the AmericanSecurities Corporation.Northernheland.SpecialA8ricuituralGrant for1956-57.(PreviousReference  (55) 2ndh0nclusions,Mi4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 199) seeking a decision on the amount of specialgrant which should, under the arrangements for agriculturalguarantees, be paid in 1956 to producers in Northern Ireland inconsideration of their remoteness from their markets on the mainland.The Home Secretary said that these grants were paid as analternative to subsidising transport between Northern Ireland andthe mainland and the need for them had been accepted. The onlyquestion which arose concerned the actual amount to be paid forthe financial year 1956. The Government of Northern Ireland, whoclaimed that the amount of the grant should be  1,491,000, werereluctant to accept an award which would compare unfavourablywith the grants paid in the two preceding years and feared seriouspolitical repercussions if a lower award were imposed on them. In
6view of this he reluctantly recommended that a compromise figureof  1,133,000 should be approved although, on the calculations, aconsiderably lower figure would in fact be justifiable. The methodsby which these grants were calculated, though they were thought toyield a broadly accurate result, were in need of improvement; andit was hoped that it would be possible to put the calculations on amore satisfactory basis for future years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toaccept a figure of  1,133,000 on the understanding that steps wouldbe taken to introduce more satisfactory arrangements for calculatingthe amount of these grants in future years. It should, moreover,be made a condition of the present award that the Government ofNorthern Ireland would not represent this as a settlement imposedon them and would not reveal any details of the calculations onwhich the grant had been based.The Cabinet-Agreed that, subject to the conditions approved in theirdiscussion, the special agricultural grant for NorthernIreland for 1956-57 should be  1,133,000.UNESCO: 5.   The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theNinth General  Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Education (CP. (56)Conference.     198) about the Ninth General Conference of the United NationsEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).The Minister of Education said that this Conference was due toopen in New Delhi on 5th November and was likely to be attendedby  delegations from  most of the 75  member  States  of theOrganisation.   Though our membership of UNESCO in the pasthad been largely a waste of money, the Russians and their satelliteshad now become active members of the Organisation and they wouldbe likely to use it as a means of furthering their political aims. Aftertalks with the United States representatives and some of theCommonwealth High Commissioners in this country, it had beenagreed that it would be unwise to leave the Organisation and thusprovide the Soviet bloc with an open field for their propaganda-We should rather take the offensive in presenting our own point ofview and trying to persuade the Organisation to concentrate on morelimited and more profitable activities. There was likely to be strongAsian support at the next meeting for a project to &quot; promote mutualappreciation of Asian and Western cultural values.&quot;  The Russianshad already indicated their support for this project and it would bedesirable for the West to take the lead in offering constructiveproposals.   Unfortunately, the inclusion of this item would involvean increase in the budget for UNESCO of $1 million over the nexttwo years. The cost to the United Kingdom would be about  15,000a year.  The item could have been included without any increase incost if the United States Government had been prepared to drop aproposal for the establishment of new training colleges for teachersin South America.  In trying to steer the Organisation on to moreconstructive lines we should equally press for a limitation on anyfurther increases in the budget.The Commonwealth Secretary agreed that the United Kingdomshould remain a member of UNESCO. In view of the fact that thenext meeting was to be in India and of the growing Russian activityin the Organisation it would be unwise to leave the field open i0Russian propaganda activities.In discussion it was mentioned that there would be severalrepresentatives from the Colonies at the next meeting and it wouldbe desirable for the United Kingdom delegation to give themguidance during the course of the Conference.
7CM. 57 (56)The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 198.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to discuss with the Ministerof Education what guidance might be given to theColonial representatives at the Ninth General Conferenceof UNESCO.&apos;Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 56thConclusions.)InternationalConference.SterlingBalances.Recall ofReservists.6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the situationcreated by the action of the Egyptian Government in nationalisingthe Suez Canal Company.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped it wouldbe agreed that the proposed conference of maritime Powers shouldbe held in London. He would be prepared to accept Paris as analternative location, but he would be strongly opposed to a meetingin Washington or Geneva.He also thought that there would be great merit in establishingthe Canal area as an International Zone. As in Berlin, only limitedforces would need to be maintained in such an International Zone,but the demarcation of this Zone would make it easier to establishany subsequent interference by neighbouring States.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the points made by the Chancellor of theExchequer should be brought to the notice of the ForeignSecretary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Suez CanalCompany had asked one of the London banks to transfer  1 millionof its holdings to Paris to enable it to meet its obligations to itsshareholders. The bank concerned had asked the&quot; Government foran indemnity for this transfer to cover the possibility of a subsequentruling by the International Court that the Suez Canal Company wasnot entitled to these assets. He proposed to refuse this request andto warn the bank that a failure to make the transfer (for whichExchange Control permission would be given) might lay it open toactions for damages by the Company.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Chancellorof the. Exchequer.The Secretary of State for War said that the Army would needabout 8,000 specialists for work in ports and docks in connectionwith the measures which were being taken to strengthen our positionin the Eastern Mediterranean. These men were Class B reservists,who could not be recalled without a Proclamation. There was astatutory requirement that Parliament should, be notified of theoccasion before a Proclamation was made and, if not sitting at thetime, should be recalled within ten days of the issue of theProclamation. To avoid having to recall Parliament for this purposeshortly after the forthcoming Adjournment, it seemed desirable thatthe necessary notification should be made that day in the course, ofthe debate on the. Suez Canal. It would be possible at the sametime to make clear the limited purpose for which the Proclamationwas required.In discussion there was general agreement that the necessarynotification should be given to Parliament that day. An announce-ment would have to be made in the House of Lords as well as inthe House of Commons. In these announcements- it would beundesirable to give any detailed figures of the men who would becalled up, as it might subsequently be found necessary to extend the
8numbers and categories of reservists required. No mention shouldbe made of the types of specialists required.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed concern about thenumbers of specialists to be recalled and the possible effect of theircall-up on the efficiency of the ports in the United Kingdom. Hehoped that the number of dock specialists required would be furtherscrutinised before the individuals were called up.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that Her Majesty should be advised to issue aProclamation empowering the call-up of a number ofspecialists included in Class B Reserve.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for War to inform the PrimeMinister of this decision and, in consultation with theChief Whip, to take the necessary steps to notifyParliament of the need for the Proclamation.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for War to inform theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labourof the numbers and types of specialists required and toexamine the possibility of reducing the numbers.Commercial 7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofPolicy. the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (C.P. (56) 191)(Previous covering an interim report by officials on the implications forReference: commercial policy of a proposal by certain European Powers toCM. (56) 52nd join together to create a common market in Europe. They also hadConclusions, before them a further memorandum by the Chancellor of theMinute 3.) Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (C.P. (56) 192)commenting on the issues arising from this proposal.The Cabinet agreed that their discussion of these memorandashould be deferred until the questions involved had been examinedfurther and policy proposals had been formulated for theirconsideration.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that, in the meantime, Ministerswho wished to do so should submit to the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade their views on thevarious problems of commercial policy discussed in these memoranda.The Cabinet Agreed to defer their discussion of C.P. (56) 191 and 192until a later meeting.IndustrialDisputes.Motor Industry.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Minister of Labour said that, contrary to the views thathad appeared in the Press, no significant progress had been made inthe talks between the British Motor Corporation and the tradeunions. The trade unions were meeting in York that day and theemployers&apos; representatives would be meeting on 8th August. Jointtalks would be resumed on 9th August. There was a risk that thesewould break down; and in this event the Transport and GeneralWorkers&apos; Union might well try to extend the strike, particularly inthe docks. Such an extension of the strike might have seriousrepercussions.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,2nd August, 1956.
