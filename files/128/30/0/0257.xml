2Singapore.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 30thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Colonial Secretary said that the Conference on constitu-tional development in Singapore had reached a critical stage.Proposals on the lines approved by the Cabinet on 19th April hadbeen put to the Singapore Delegation. They had now tabled counter-proposals which, while they made some important concessions, stillcontained a number of provisions which we could not accept. Thus,although the Delegation were ready to agree that the UnitedKingdom should retain control over external affairs, so long asexternal trade and commerce were handled by the local Government,they had suggested that local Ministers should be responsible for&quot; cultural relations,&quot; and it was possible that they intended by thismeans to undermine the United Kingdom&apos;s conduct of Singapore&apos;sexternal affairs. Again, though they accepted the United Kingdom&apos;sresponsibility for external defence, they did not recognise the dangerto defence interests from Communist infiltration within Singapore.They were not prepared to agree that the Commissioner of Policeshould be a member of the proposed Defence and Security Council,nor that he should have direct access to the Governor. As analternative, they proposed the appointment by the United KingdomGovernment of a liaison officer who would keep in touch with allpolice matters and would have the right to report to the Governorand to sit on the Defence and Security Council. They agreed thatall police appointments should be made through a Public ServiceCommission; but the Malayanisation of the police would eventuallylead to the removal of all British officers and it would, therefore,be necessary to insist that the Governor should be responsible forthe appointment of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissionerof Police and the Head of the Special Branch. This provision wasunlikely to be acceptable to the Singapore Delegation.The Delegation had prepared a draft Independence Billincorporating their constitutional proposals. There would be seriouspolitical objections to the title of this measure. But, apart from these,it would be wholly illogical to describe as &quot; independence &quot; a situationin which power was still reserved to the United Kingdom Govern-ment to suspend the constitution and to resume direct rule. Furtherattempts would be made to persuade the Delegation to omit&quot; independence &quot; from the title of any constitutional legislation atthis stage.On internal security the Delegation proposed that the UnitedKingdom Government should have power to suspend the constitutionif the internal security of Singapore &quot; had so far deteriorated as tothreaten the efficiency of the external defence installations.&quot; Thispower was to be exercisable only for a transition period, which wasto last no longer than six years and was to be reviewed at two-yearlyintervals. We clearly could not accept an arrangement by which weshould be unable to intervene until the situation had got out of handand were then required to go the whole length of suspending theconstitution. Provision must be made for earlier intervention beforean emergency had developed. The Governor must have reservepowers to take either executive action or legislative action over alimited part of the field before a situation arose in which he had touse the ultimate sanction of suspending the whole constitution.In discussion there was genera! agreement that it would beundesirable to include &quot; independence &quot; in the title of any Bill amend-ing the present constitution of Singapore. The title proposed by theSingapore Delegation would seriously affect confidence in the futurestability of Singapore, particularly in Australia and New Zealand andother members of the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation. More-over, it might be taken to imply a moral commitment to grantcomplete independence to Singapore at an early date.It was also agreed that the Delegation&apos;s proposals for internalsecurity and for a six-year transition period must be rejected. Itwould be essential that the Governor should have the reserve powers
3CM. 33 (56)proposed by the Colonial Secretary, so that he would be able tointervene before the internal security situation had deteriorated so faras to require the suspension of the constitution. It was not possibleat this stage to fix a time-limit for the exercise of these reservedpowers. The proposal for biennial consideration of the duration ofthe transition period should also be rejected, since it would lead tocontinuing arguments about the internal security position. In thelight of experience in British Guiana and Cyprus, it would benecessary that appointments to the three senior police posts shouldbe made by the Governor, until such time as a fully independentPublic Ser vice Commission was operating effectively. These issueswere so important that it would be preferable to accept theconsequences of a breakdown in the present discussions, rather thanto make concessions on any of them.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) The Governments of Australia and New Zealand could beexpected to support a decision to stand firm on the need for reservepowers over internal security in Singapore. They should be informedof the position reached in the discussions and should be warned ofthe possibility that the talks might break down on this issue. Itwould be useful if they could be ready, in the event of a breakdown,to give public support for the attitude taken by the United KingdomGovernment.(b) If the discussions broke down there might be serious disordersin Singapore. There were two British battalions and two armouredcar squadrons in Singapore;.and two further British battalions and afurther armoured car squadron could be brought in quickly fromMalaya if need arose. With the 6,000 police in Singapore, who weremainlv Malays, there should be adequate forces to deal with anydisorders. The military authorities in Singapore should, however,be warned if a breakdown seemed imminent, so that precautionarymeasures could be taken.(c) It would be unwise to accept, during the present discussions,any commitment to a future union between Singapore and theMalayan Federation. The Chief Minister of the Federation was notin favour of any such early union. The United Kingdom&apos;s continuingresponsibility for the external affairs of Singapore would enable anypremature proposals for such union to be controlled.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary.(2) Agreed that, in the discussions on constitutional developmentin Singapore, a firm stand should be made on (a) therequirement that the United Kingdom representative inSingapore should have powers to intervene before aserious emergency had developed and that there shouldbe no specified duration for the exercise of these powers;and (b) the need for the appointments to Commissionerand Deputy Commissioner of Police and the Head of theSpecial Branch being made by the United Kingdomrepresentative in Singapore until such time as an effectivePublic Service Commission was in operation.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to make a further attempt topersuade the Singapore Delegation to abandon theirproposal that the word &quot; independence&quot; should beincluded in the title of any Bill amending the constitutionof Singapore.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the Govern-ments of Australia and New Zealand of the decisionrecorded in Conclusion (2) above and of the possibilitythat the constitutional discussions might break down onthese issues.
(5) Invited the Colonial Secretary to inform the Minister ofDefence if a breakdown in the discussions appearedimminent, so that precautionary measures could be takenby the military authorities in Singapore.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,4th May, 1956.
