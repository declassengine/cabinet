3CM. 17 (56)South-EastAsia TreatyOrganisation.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 8thConclusions,Minute 3.)NuclearWeapons.1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-wealth Secretary (CP. (56) 57) regarding a proposal, which was tobe considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation (S.E.A.T.O.), that militaryplanning within the Organisation should proceed on the assumptionthat nuclear weapons would be used in the defence of the area.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he recognised thatcircumstances might arise in which the area could not be defendedwithout the use of nuclear weapons, and it was reasonable thatmilitary planning should proceed on the assumption that nuclearweapons might be used. On the other hand, if it became knownthat planning was proceeding on this basis, deep emotions wouldbe aroused in India and other neutral countries in the area.The Foreign Secretary said that, in addition to this risk, he wasalso concerned about the effect on countries, like Malaya, in whichthe S.E.A.T.O. Powers wished to maintain military bases. Carewould certainly need to be taken in framing any announcement onthis point which might be included in the communique issued atthe end of the forthcoming meeting of the Council. He himselfthought it would be sufficient if it were stated in the communiquethat the S.E.A.T.O. Powers would be prepared to use such force asmight be necessary to repel an aggressor.In discussion it was pointed out that, whatever phrase might beused in the final communique, there was no way of avoidingdiscussion in the Council of the proposal that military planningshould proceed on the assumption that nuclear weapons would beused in the defence of the area. For this was the proposal madein the report of the military advisers of the Organisation, and theirreport had already been circulated for discussion by the Council.Whatever was said in the communique, it was likely that the actualproposal which had been under discussion by the Council wouldbecome known.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that at the forthcoming meeting of the Council ofthe South-East Asia Treaty Organisation the ForeignSecretary should support the proposal that militaryplanning within the Organisation should proceed on theassumption that nuclear weapons would be used in thedefence of the area.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to do his utmost (i) to preventany premature disclosure of the fact that militaryplanning was to proceed on this basis, and (ii) to securethat, in the communique issued at the end of the Council&apos;smeeting, no explicit reference was made to the use ofnuclear weapons in the defence of the area.Buraimi.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 52) inviting their views on the concessions whichmight be made in seeking a settlement of the dispute with SaudiArabia over Buraimi.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the recent discussions inWashington, President Eisenhower had asked whether there was notsome concession which we might offer in order to induce the Saudisto enter into direct negotiation on this question and to prevent themfrom taking it to the Security Council. Could we not offer themsome means of access to the sea, east of the Qatar Peninsula? Itnow seemed possible that the Saudis would agree to start bilateraldiscussions without any assurance, given in advance, that we shouldbe ready to modify our position; but, even if the talks could thus be49812 1 B 2
4begun, it was unlikely that they could be sustained for long withoutany concession on our part. He had therefore considered what offerwe might make along the lines suggested by President Eisenhower.There were three possible ways of giving the Saudis access to thesea (i) by granting them special transit facilities, particularly foroil, and a free port;(ii) by setting up some kind of neutral zone; or(iii) by cession of territory.The third of these courses would be most damaging to our interests,and he did not recommend it. The first would be the easiest for us,but he feared that it might not be sufficient for the Saudis. TheCabinet might therefore be willing to authorise him to offer thesecond, if he found that the first was insufficient. The device of aneutral zone had worked well in Kuwait, and this encouraged himto think that it might be acceptable to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that it would be wiser not to go beyond the offer of transitfacilities and a free port. Such an offer should not give rise to anyclaims for compensation: if it did, they could be resisted. On theother hand, an offer to establish a neutral zone might appear to implythat there was some justice in the Saudis&apos; claim.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in bilateral negotiations with the Governmentof Saudi Arabia over Buraimi, the Foreign Secretarymight offer the Saudis a means of access to the sea, eastof Qatar, by way of special transit facilities and a freeport.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, before offering any furtherconcession (e.g., the establishment of a neutral zone), togive the Cabinet a further opportunity of consideringthe matter.Jordan(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Parade ofArab Legion.MilitaryAssistance.3. The Prime Minister said that the officer commanding theArab Legion had asked that a United Kingdom Minister should visitJordan to attend the Annual Parade of the Legion on 7th April.Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views, he proposed that the Secretary ofState for Air should attend this Parade, provided that it had firstbeen verified that the invitation had the support of the King ofJordan and his Prime Minister.The Cabinet endorsed this proposal.The Foreign Secretary invited the Cabinet&apos;s attention totelegrams from H.M. Ambassador at Amman (Nos. 224, 239,240, 251 and 255) reporting that the Government of Jordan had askedus for an assurance of military assistance in the event of an attack byIsrael on Syria. He circulated to the Cabinet drafts of two telegramsoutlining the reply which H.M. Ambassador should return tothis enquiry. These made it clear that, if Israel attacked an ArabState other than Jordan, the United Kingdom Government would notbe under any obligation to render military assistance to Jordan underthe terms of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty. Such action by Israel would,however, bring into play the Tripartite Declaration of 1950; and, assoon as it became clear that Israel was the aggressor, the parties tothat Declaration would range themselves behind the country attackedand take all appropriate steps to restore the position. The UnitedKingdom Government would therefore find themselves side by sidewith Jordan in a common determination to resist Israel&apos;s aggression,
CM. 17 (56)and would consult with the Jordan Government on the best meansof carrying out this common purpose. They would be prepared insuch an event to send reinforcements to Jordan, but it was importantthat the Jordan Government should themselves avoid precipitateaction and allow time for the most effective deployment of the jointresources of the two countries. The Jordan Government should alsobe on their guard against attempts to lure them into action whichmight obscure the responsibility for the outbreak of hostilities.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The action to be taken by the United Kingdom Governmentin these circumstances should be plainly based on the TripartiteDeclaration. It was agreed that the draft telegrams should beamended so as to make this more clear.(b) Was it desirable that we should commit ourselves to sendingreinforcements to Jordan in this event until we were certain thatcorresponding action would be taken by the United StatesGovernment?The Cabinet were informed that there were already clearindications that, if such a situation arose, the Americans would bequick to honour their obligations under the Tripartite Declaration.(c) British ground forces in Jordan would have to be reinforcedby air, and in earlier plans it had been assumed that the Israel AirForce would have been neutralised before reinforcements were flownin. The reinforcements would be in a vulnerable position if theyhad to be sent before this had been done. This risk might, however,have to be taken unless the United States Government were willing,in the circumstances envisaged, to join us in preliminary action againstthe Israel Air Force.(d) Was it not desirable that a strong warning should be given tothe Israel Government that, if they began work on the Jisr BanatYacoub canal near the Syrian frontier, there was a grave risk ofSyrian reactions which would lead to war?The Cabinet were informed that this warning had already beengiven to the Israel Government in clear terms and had recently beenrepeated.The Cabinet (1) Authorised   the   Foreign   Secretary   to   instruct H.M.Ambassador at Amman in the terms of the draft telegramswhich he had circulated, subject to the amendmentsapproved in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the militaryimplications of this question to be considered in the staffdiscussions now proceeding in Washington on the meansof implementing the Tripartite Declaration of 1950.Foreign 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that, on his way to and from theSecretary&apos;s forthcoming meeting of the Council of the South-East Asia TreatyMission to Organisation in Karachi, he would be visiting various capitals in theMiddle East Middle East and India.  In connection with these visits there wereand India. three points on.which he would be glad of the advice of his colleagues.Egypt- Since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 22nd February he had again(Previous considered the line which he should take in his conversations withReference: the Prime Minister of Egypt. He intended to make it clear that in the2.M. (56) 16th Middle East we had no Colonial purpose, and that our sole interestsConclusions, were to protect the sources of our oil supplies in the Persian Gulf andvlinute 5.) to prevent Soviet encroachment. Those interests were, however, vital49812 1 B 3
6to our security and we were resolved to protect them. We were inparticular determined to uphold the Bagdad Pact. We desiredfriendlier relations with Egypt, but these could not be establishedunless the Egyptian Government discontinued their hostilepropaganda and their attempts to undermine our position throughoutthe Middle East. If they changed their attitude towards us, we coulddo much for them in return by assistance over the Nile waters andin their relations with Iraq.The Prime Minister said that he was in full agreement with theline which the Foreign Secretary proposed to take. We must showno lack of resolution in our support of the Bagdad Pact. If itcollapsed, there would be nothing to prevent Soviet influence fromreaching down to the Persian Gulf.The Cabinet (1) Approved the line which the Foreign Secretary proposed totake in his forthcoming discussions with the PrimeMinister of Egypt.India. The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Mimster of Indiawas also likely to express disquiet about the Bagdad Pact. He hadbeen disturbed at the suggestion that Jordan might join the Pact, andhe might ask for an assurance that no other Arab State would adhereto it. The Foreign Secretary said that, if this point were raised, hewould point out that these were independent sovereign States, whichcould not be prevented from joining regional pacts if they wished todo so. He could, however, say that, if India accepted the existingmembership of this Pact, the United Kingdom would not urge otherArab States to join it.In discussion the suggestion was made that India&apos;s dislike of thisPact was due to Pakistan&apos;s attempts to use it as a means of assuringherself of support in a war with India. The Foreign Secretary saidthat under the Bagdad Pact the members only agreed to &quot; co-operatefor their security and defence &quot; and that our obligations to Pakistanunder the [Bagdad] Pact added nothing to our obligations to her as amember of the Commonwealth. There was certainly no obligation onmembers of the Pact to give assistance to Pakistan in the event of anattack by Pakistan on India. If, therefore, India had no aggressiveintentions against Pakistan, she had nothing to fear from the BagdadPact, and a firm assurance to this effect could be given to the PrimeMinister of India.The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval of the arguments which the ForeignSecretary proposed to use in favour of the Bagdad Pact inhis forthcoming discussions with the Prime Minister ofIndia.Israel. The Foreign Secretary said that, in the course of his forthcomingvisit to Israel, an attempt was likely to be made to induce him tovisit Jerusalem in circumstances which could be taken to imply thatthe United Kingdom Government recognised it as Israel&apos;s capital.He could not avoid paying an informal visit to Jerusalem, but heproposed to decline any formal hospitality there. If he had to meetthe Prime Minister of Israel in Jerusalem, he would do so informally.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the steps which the Foreign Secretary proposedto take to avoid any action impliedly recognisingJerusalem as the capital of Israel.
1CM. 17 (56)Cypms. 5.   The Cabinet considered telegrams which the Colonial(Previous Secretary had sent from Cyprus (Nos. 436 and 437) reporting that,Reference: in the latest stages of the negotiations. Archbishop Makarios hadCM. (56) 16th put forward unacceptable demands in connection with futureConclusions, responsibility for public security and an amnesty for politicalMinute 12.) offenders, and had raised further questions about our intentions inrespect of constitutional development. The Colonial Secretaryproposed to reaffirm the position of the United Kingdom Governmenton these points and invited the Cabinet&apos;s concurrence in the termsof a statement which he proposed to make to Archbishop Makarios.On the question of constitutional development, he proposed to informthe Archbishop that a constitutional Commissioner would be sent toCyprus to draw up, in consultation with representatives of all sectionsof opinion there, a liberal and democratic constitution which wouldprovide for an elected majority in the Legislative Assembly and wouldsafeguard, inter alia, the interests of minority sections of thecommunity. The constitution would reserve to the Governor powersover foreign affairs and defence, and all powers over public securityfor as long as might be necessary to safeguard law and order andBritish defence requirements; and the control of all other Departmentswould be transferred as rapidly as was consistent with orderlygovernment to Cypriot Ministers responsible to the LegislativeAssembly. At the same time the Colonial Secretary would reaffirmto the Archbishop the circumstances in which an amnesty could begranted and the Emergency Regulations repealed.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In the statement to be made by the Colonial Secretary itshould be made quite clear that it would be for the Governor ofCyprus to decide when the time had come to transfer to CypriotMinisters the responsibility for public security.(b) The proposed statement that the constitution would providefor an elected majority in the Legislative Assembly could be precededby the words &quot; As was made clear in the London talks.&quot; This wouldserve to remind the Archbishop that at the London Conference theUnited Kingdom Government had proposed that a proportionatequota of seats in the Assembly should be reserved to each community.(c) In the final sentence of the draft statement it was suggestedthat under the proposed constitution a minority would not be allowedto obstruct majority opinion in matters which did not prejudice theparticular minority interests concerned. There was general agreementthat this sentence should be omitted. It was certain to give offence tothe Turks. Moreover, it was inconsistent with the accepted principlesof Parliamentary Opposition and with liberal constitutional doctrines.The Cabinet Subject to the amendments noted in paragraphs (a) to (c)above, agreed that the Colonial Secretary should make anoral statement to Archbishop Makarios in the terms of thedraft set out in Cyprus telegram No. 437; and authorised theMinister of State for the Colonies to inform the ColonialSecretary accordingly.6. The Prime Minister said that it had been arranged that,subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, the Governor of Malta, who hadcome to London for consultation, should break his return journey atRome for a discussion with the Pope. There was reason to believethat the Pope might be prepared to exercise his authority overArchbishop Gronzi and to ask him to refrain, while the Report ofthe  Round Table  Conference  was before  the Parliament atMalta.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 12.)
8Westminster, from pursuing or countenancing courses which wouldexacerbate the situation in Malta. It was also hoped that the ColonialSecretary would be able to visit Malta for discussions in the course ofhis return journey from Cyprus.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.Parliament. 7.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were also informed that, in the week beginning12th March, it was provisionally proposed that the House ofCommons should debate the Second Reading of the Death Penalty(Abolition) Bill and the Report Stage of the Teachers (Superannua-tion) Bill.Soviet Union.Visit ofSovietLeaders tothe UnitedKingdom.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Lord President said that he had noted the Cabinet&apos;sdecision of 16th February that the invitation to the Soviet leadersto visit this country should not be withdrawn. He accepted thisdecision, though he regretted the necessity for it. He wished, however,to make one suggestion about the programme for the visit. He notedthat The Queen was to receive the Soviet leaders at Windsor Castle.He hoped that Her Majesty would be advised not to allow herselfto be photographed with the Soviet leaders on this occasion.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreement withthe view expressed by the Lord President on this point.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would advise The Queenthat no facilities should be given for photographs to be takenon the occasion of the visit of the Soviet leaders to WindsorCastle.Betting,Lotteriesand Gaming.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 54) covering the draft of an announcement of theGovernment&apos;s intention to give effect to the recommendations of theRoyal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming.The Home Secretary said that in the debate in the House ofLords on 8th February there had been general support for the mainrecommendations of the Royal Commission&apos;s report. Press commenton the debate had also been favourable in the main. There was goodreason now to suppose that legislation on this subject would arousemuch less controversy than had been feared. The Government werelikely to incur stronger criticism for delay in proposing amendmentof the law. A motion was to be moved in the House of Commonson 9th March inviting the Government to introduce legislation onthis subject. He recommended that this opportunity should be takento make an announcement, in the terms of the draft annexed toCP. (56) 54, stating that the Government accepted the mainrecommendations of the Royal Commission&apos;s report and had giveninstructions for the preparation of the necessary legislation forintroduction as soon as opportunity offered.
9CM. 17 (56)In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould now proceed with this legislation at the earliest practicableopportunity. The Lord Privy Seal said, however, that there was nopossibility of passing this Bill in the current session. Moreover, it wasalready clear that the Government would have to undertake a veryheavy legislative programme in the 1956-57 session. Projects forlegislation in that session already involved a total of ninety-sevenBills, of which not less than fifteen were proposed by the Home Office.It was not yet clear what priority could be given to a Betting Bill.A preliminary review of this programme would have been made beforethe debate in the House of Commons on 9th March.The Cabinet (1) Agreed   that   legislation   to   give   effect   to   the mainrecommendations of the report of the Royal Commissionon Betting, Lotteries and Gaming should be prepared forintroduction in the 1956-57 session.(2) Agreed that in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on 9th March it should be stated that theGovernment intended to introduce this legislation at theearliest practicable opportunity; but invited the HomeSecretary to settle the precise wording of this statementwith the Lord Privy Seal in the light of the preliminaryreview which the Future Legislation Committee were tomake of the programme of Government legislation forthe 1956-57 session.Farm PriceReview.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 7thConclusions.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (CP. (56) 56) setting out the basis for asettlement of the current review of farm prices and seeking authorityto offer initially a revised schedule of price guarantees at an additionalcost of approximately  17 millions in comparison with the figure forthe previous year.The Minister of Agriculture said that agricultural costs had risenby about  40 millions. This was partially offset by an increase inefficiency in the production of commodities covered by the reviewwhich would be said by the farmers to amount to  16 millions.Although it was estimated that the actual net income of the industrywould rise by  14 millions over the forthcoming year, this wouldconceal a fall of  28 millions (from  320 millions to  292 millions) innet income if it were calculated on the basis of normal weatherconditions. These were the main factors to be taken into account inreaching a settlement. The farmers would seek to recoup in increasedprice guarantees the net rise in their costs, and they would argue thata total net income of  300- 320 millions was not excessive if it wereto provide a margin for re-investment in the industry. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had concurred in the recommendationof the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review that a settle-ment should be sought at approximately  20 millions, although hehimself felt that a figure nearer  25 millions would not be inequitable.The Farmers&apos; Unions were unlikely to agree to a settlement at lessthan  30 millions, and it would be necessary to impose a settlementif the negotiations were to be concluded at a figure in the region of 20 millions.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) Although the farmers would resist as inequitable a figure of 20 millions, it would be difficult to defend a more generous award ata time when sacrifices were being demanded of all sections of thecommunity.
10(b) As in the case of industry, the larger farms were moreefficient and relatively more profitable than the small farms and theprice guarantees had the effect of increasing this disparity. It was,however, the small farmers who were experiencing the greatestdifficulty and theirs would be the case most strongly pressed in thenegotiations.id) The small farmers concentrated mainly on milk, eggs andpigs. It was proposed, however, to reduce the pig subsidy and toleave the subsidy for eggs unchanged. While it was uneconomic tosubsidise the over-production of milk, which was based on importedfeedingstuffs and restricted the United Kingdom market for the milkproducts of Commonwealth countries, it was impracticable for thesmall farmer especially during a period of credit restriction toturn easily and promptly to beef production. There was therefore acase for offering as part of the final settlement the alternativeproposal set out in Appendix B to CP. (56) 56 which contemplatedan increase of \d. rather than \d. in the price guarantee for milk.It was however agreed that, although the Government&apos;s initial offerof increased guarantees totalling  17 millions would cause disquietin the farming industry, there would be little advantage, if a settle-ment of about  20 millions had to be achieved, in raising the openingfigure to  19 millions by offering forthwith an increase in theguarantee for milk.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 56 and authorised theMinister of Agriculture to offer, in the next stage of thenegotiations with the Farmers&apos; Unions, increased priceguarantees to a total value of approximately  17 millionsas set out in Appendix B of his memorandum.Food.Danish Bacon.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 11.)11. The Minister of Agriculture reported that agreement hadbeen reached with Denmark on the proposal to impose a 10 per cent,duty on imports of Danish bacon into this country. The agreementwould run initially for four years and the Danes had been assuredthat, should it become necessary for any reason to reimposequantitative restrictions on the import of bacon, Danish interests inthe United Kingdom market would be fully safeguarded. Theagreement would be announced in Denmark that day, and it wasproposed that the Minister of State, Board of Trade, should make acorresponding announcement in the House of Commons thatafternoon. He himself would announce, in answer to a writtenQuestion, that State trading in bacon would now come to an end.The Cabinet Took note of this statement, and agreed that an announce-ment should be made in the House of Commons thatafternoon of the outcome of the tariff negotiations withDenmark on bacon.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,28th February, J 956.
