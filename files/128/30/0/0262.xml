3CM. (38) 56Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Bahrain.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 122) covering an analysis of the British positionand problems in the various States of the Persian Gulf. This hadbeen circulated as general background for the discussion of specificquestions arising in that area.The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussionon 15th May, he had given further thought to the means of improvingthe state of the administration in Bahrain. He now considered that,instead of concentrating only on the direct replacement of Sir CharlesBelgrave by another British adviser, it would be preferable that anindependent enquiry should first be held into the general structureof the administration. Such an enquiry could suitably be held by aformer member of the Sudan Political Service, who had undertakena somewhat similar investigation in Qatar. If this plan were accept-able to the Ruler and to Sir Charles Belgrave, the latter might bepersuaded to let it be known in Bahrain that, in view of his age, heexpected to relinquish his position there bet ore very long; that,against the time of his departure, it would be appropriate that thestructure of the administration should be reviewed and thatarrangements for the holding of such a review were in hand. Anannouncement on these lines would allay public anxiety in Bahrainand give time in which to carry through the necessary reorganisationof the administration.In discussion there was general support for the new proposal putforward by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s factual memorandum(CP. (56) 122) on the British position in the Persian Gulf.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to seek the agreement ofthe Ruler of Bahrain, through Sir Charles Belgrave, tothe plan which he had outlined for an enquiry into thestructure of the administration at Bahrain.3. The Foreign Secretary said that he was concerned about theactivities of a Greek priest named Kallinikos Macheriotis, resident inLondon, who was advocating violent resistance to the British rulein Cyprus and was raising funds for the &quot; victims of the nationalstruggle &quot; in the Island. There was reason to believe that these fundswere being placed at the disposal of terrorist organisations in Cyprus.The Home Secretary said that this man had been in the UnitedKingdom since 1952. though of Cypriot origin, he was a Greekcitizen by naturalisation. Therefore, if the Cabinet so desired, hecould be deported to Greece. There would be no obligation to statepublicly the grounds on which his deportation had been ordered.In discussion it was recognised that, if this man were deportedthere was a risk that the Greek Government might take someretaliatory action. It was, however, agreed that, despite this risk theman should be deported to Greece.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for KallinikosMacheriotis to be deported from this country to Greece.50009 2 B 2Cyprus.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 34thConclusions,Minute 5.)Deportation ofKallinikosMacheriotis.
4Future Policy. The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus wouldshortly be returning to London for consultations on the future courseof British policy in Cyprus. It would be helpful if it could bearranged that one or two senior Ministers would hold themselvesavailable for consultation during the course of his discussions withthe Governor. This arrangement had proved advantageous duringthe recent Conference on constitutional development in Singapore.The Prime Minister said that, before these consultations withthe Governor were opened, he would like to consider whether somefresh initiative could not now be taken on the Cyprus question. Herecalled that, at an early stage, Ministers had considered thepossibility of offering an arrangement by which Greece and Turkeywould be associated in some way with the British administration ofCyprus. Now that there was a more widespread recognition of theextent of Turkish interests in Cyprus, there might be advantage inbringing forward some suggestion of this kind. This need notexclude the possibility of further constitutional development in theIsland.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for one ortwo members of the Cabinet to hold themselves availablefor consultation by the Colonial Secretary during thecourse of his forthcoming discussions with the Governorof Cyprus.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Foreign Secretary toarrange for a memorandum to be prepared, for considera-tion by the Colonial Policy Committee, on possible meansof associating Greece and Turkey with the Britishadministration of Cyprus.CrownPrivilege.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (56) 127) reporting the conclusions of a Committeeof Ministers which had considered what modifications might be madein the existing practice of claiming Crown privilege for certain classesof official documents. They also had before them a memorandumby the Minister of Pensions (CP. (56) 128) on the application of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations to certain types of social securityrecords.The Lord Chancellor said that it was recommended that privilegeshould continue to be claimed for Departmental minutes, but thatthe existing practice should be relaxed in regard to factual reportsand records falling within the categories set out in the Annex toCP. (56) 127. This relaxation would not satisfy those members ofthe legal profession who considered that the courts themselves shoulddetermine whether Crown privilege could properly be claimed forany particular document. The Ministerial Committee had, however,been fully convinced that the work of Government would be seriouslyhampered if Departmental minutes did not continue as a class toenjoy Crown privilege.The question whether protection should continue to be accordedto the reports of welfare officers employed by the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos;and Airmen&apos;s Families&apos; Association (S.S.A.F.A.) had presented adifficulty which the Committee had been unable to resolve. Thesewelfare officers did valuable work in connection with the personalproblems of Servicemen, especially those serving overseas, but theywere not State servants and it would not be easy to substantiate aclaim that the protection of their reports was essential to the properworking of the public service.
5CM. (38) 56As regards an announcement, it was recognised that a generalstatement of Government policy in regard to Crown privilege couldnot be made in the course of debate on the Report Stage ofthe Restrictive Trade Practices Bill. It was therefore proposed thatthe Attorney-General should make a general announcement inadvance of the debate. Alternatively, a full justification of theGovernment&apos;s policy in respect of Crown privilege might be madein the House of Lords before the Report Stage of the Bill was takenin the House of Commons.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was recognised that, apart from the rules of order, it wouldbe inappropriate that a general statement on a matter of thisimportance should be made in the course of debate on the RestrictiveTrade Practices Bill. It was therefore agreed that the LordChancellor should make a comprehensive statement in the Houseof Lords in the following week, and that the Ministers principallyconcerned should be informed in advance of the terms of thisstatement.(b) Despite this statement Mr. J. E. S. Simon, M.P., was likelyto persist in attempting to obtain for the Restrictive Practices Courtwhen it sat in England the right which it would enjoy under Scottishlaw when it sat in Scotland to determine itself whether or not aparticular document should be protected by Crown privilege. Thestatement would, however, reduce the amount of support which hecould command in the House of Commons.(c) In view of the decision of Mr. Justice Sachs in Broome v.Broome, it was doubtful whether a further claim for privilege forS.S.A.F.A. reports could now be sustained. It was, however, thegeneral view of the Cabinet that these reports should not be includedin the categories of documents for which the Crown were now tooffer to waive privilege in future.id) The relaxations now proposed would not extend, inparticular, to the disclosure of highly confidential medical reportson certain criminals or to the disclosure of reports of schoolsinspectors.(e) It should be possible to maintain the practice which hadbeen observed for forty years of declining to disclose in response toprivate enquiries confidential information contained in the socialsecurity records.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 8 (i), (ii)and (iii) of CP. (56) 127.(2) Agreed that reports of welfare officers of the Soldiers&apos;,Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Families&apos; Association should notbe included among the classes of document in respectof which the right to claim Crown privilege in the courtswas not in future to be asserted.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to make a comprehensivestatement of the Government&apos;s policy in this matter inthe House of Lords in the following week, after consulta-tion with the Secretary of State for Scotland, Ministerof Defence, Secretary of State for War, Minister ofPensions and the Attorney-General.(4) Took note that nothing would be said  in the LordChancellor&apos;s statement which would prejudice theCabinet&apos;s consideration of the proposals which theMinister of Pensions was about to submit on the questionof disclosing, in response to private enquiries, confidentialinformation contained in the social security records.
6Road Traffic.20 m.p.h.Speed Limit.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (56) 129) seeking authority to announce, during theCommittee Stage of the Road Traffic Bill, that after a suitable intervalthe speed limit for heavy goods vehicles would be raised from20 to 30 m.p.h.The Minister of Transport said that he had discussed thisquestion on the previous day with representatives of the RoadHaulage Association, the British Road Services and the Transportand General Workers&apos; Union. The Road Haulage Association wereevidently reluctant to reach agreement with the drivers&apos; representa-tives on the operating conditions which would arise when the speedlimit was raised; and they would have less incentive to do so if adefinite date for the higher speed limit were now announced. Hetherefore proposed to frame his announcement in rather moregeneral terms, indicating that the higher speed limit would come intoeffect in the spring of 1957; and he would continue to urge theAssociation to reach an agreement before then on revised operatingschedules.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 129, subject to themodification mentioned by the Minister of Transport intheir discussion.Wales. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeParliamentary   Secretary (CP. (56) 124) submitting, for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration,Representation, a petition signed by 250,000 Welsh people seeking the establishmentof a separate Parliament for Wales.The Home Secretary said that, in replying to the deputationwhich had brought this petition to him, he had made it clear thatthe Government were opposed to the creation of a separateParliament for Wales. He had, however, undertaken to bring theirpetition to the notice of his colleagues in the Cabinet. In his view,the right course was to pursue the possibility of further administrativedevolution in Wales. This was already being studied. The creationof a separate Parliament for Wales would not be welcomed bypolitical opinion in either of the main political Parties. Nor, in hisjudgment, would it be in the best interests of the Principality.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should continue to reject theproposal for the establishment of a separate Parliament forWales.CommonwealthDevelopment.Kariba Hydro-Electric Scheme(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 37thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a report had beenreceived from Washington that the federal authorities of Rhodesiaand Nyasaland would be prepared to give any assurance which wouldalso be acceptable to the International Bank regarding the conditionson which contracts for this project would be awarded. TheInternational Bank would not be willing to give an assurance in theterms which the Cabinet had previously considered, namely thatcontracts would not be awarded to firms whose tenders were morefavourable solely because of a subsidy, and would seek to raise widerissues if this were pressed. It would, however, remain open to us toplace on record our views on the subject and it would be a furtherdefence against criticism from industry if Ministers were ableeventually to say that, after consultation with the Federation Govern-ment, they had satisfied themselves that no contracts had in fact beenawarded to foreign firms whose tenders were more favourable solely
7CM. (38) 56because of a subsidy. This would not give rise to difficulties withthe International Bank. Alternatively, it might be consideredwhether we should go further than this and attempt to secure anassurance in advance from the Federation Government that nocontracts &quot; were likely &quot; to be awarded to foreign firms whose tenderswere favourable simply because of a subsidy. Despite the criticismwhich might be expected from industry at any failure to induce theInternational Bank to agree to satisfactory assurances, the factremained that United Kingdom firms had obtained  70 millionsworth of business from operations financed by International Bankfunds towards which we had contributed only  20 millions.The Lord President said that the Federation Government couldbe trusted to award contracts to United Kingdom firms if it were atall possible to do so. It would be embarrassing to them and it mightprove embarrassing to us in other contexts if it became known thatby seeking in advance an assurance of the kind proposed we hadattempted to influence the adjudication of tenders. He thereforeconsidered that it would be sufficient if Ministers were able to makea statement on the lines of the first alternative suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer.The President of the Board of Trade said that this course wouldbe acceptable to him though, in view of the pressure to which hewas subject from industry, he would have preferred some form ofassurance, however limited, in advance of the adjudication oncontracts.iThe Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther instructions to be sent to H.M. Treasury Repre-sentative in Washington in terms of the first alternativesuggested by him in the course of the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,29th May, 1956.
