2ifSuez Canal(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 86thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Lord Privy Seal said that among Government supporters inthe House of Commons there was a strong body of opinion that theAnglo-French forces should not be withdrawn from Port Said untilwe had some firm assurance that our original objectives would beachieved. He would need to take account of this view in hisstatement in the House of Commons that afternoon; but he wouldbe unable to anticipate the more detailed statement of policy whichthe Foreign Secretary would be making in the General Assembly ofthe United Nations later in the day. He therefore proposed to repeatour offer to withdraw a British battalion from Port Said forthwith,but to emphasise that the complete withdrawal of the Anglo-Frenchforce was dependent upon its place being taken by a United Nationsforce, competent to secure the objectives, in terms both of theclearance and control of the Suez Canal and of a settlement of theArab/Israel dispute, which the General Assembly had defined intheir resolutions of 2nd, 5th and 7th November. He also proposedto rebut the baseless propaganda which the Egyptian Governmentwere disseminating about alleged atrocities by the Anglo-Frenchtroops in Port Said.The Cabinet agreed that the statement to be made in the Houseof Commons should be on these lines. In subsequent discussion, thefollowing points were made:  (a) Both the effectiveness of the United Nations force and thefunctions which it was to discharge, as defined in the report of theSecretary-General of the United Nations and in the relevantresolutions of the General Assembly, were arguable. But a precisedefinition of these points was less important than the strength of thesanction available to enforce the will of the United Nations. In thelast resort this sanction was the willingness of the United StatesGovernment to ensure that effect was given to the resolutions of theUnited Nations. If the United States Government were prepared toguide the forthcoming debate in the General Assembly on moderatelines and thereafter to state clearly that the problem of the SuezCanal would be firmly dealt with and that the Russians would not beallowed to exploit the situation in the Middle East to their advantage,we might hope to re-establish close political relations with the UnitedStates and to secure a satisfactory and lasting settlement in theMiddle East as a whole. Every opportunity should therefore betaken to ensure that the Government of the United States had theseconsiderations in mind in instructing their representative at theUnited Nations.(b) It was also very desirable, from the point of view of ourrelations with other members of the Commonwealth, that we shouldavoid becoming involved in another dispute in the General Assemblyin which we were treated as aggressors. Commonwealth relationshad already been severely strained by the belief that we had failedadequately to consult the other members of the Commonwealthbefore embarking on military operations in Egypt. We should doour utmost to avoid subjecting them to further serious strain at thisjuncture.(c) The Foreign Secretary had reported, in telegram No. 1328from New York, that opinion in the United Nations was gravelydisturbed by persistent Egyptian propaganda about alleged Britishatrocities in Port Said. He had urged that these charges should berefuted with the utmost vigour and that a member of the Governmentshould be entrusted with this task as a matter of urgency.(d) The Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces had nowreported that it would be possible to evacuate Port Said completelywithin 15 days. But he had emphasised that the departure of theBritish battalion which we had already offered to withdraw wouldmake it impossible for him to remount offensive action at shortnotice. It was agreed that we must be ready to give effect to ourundertaking to withdraw a British battalion, in order to establish ourgood faith in the United Nations.   But no further withdrawal of
3CM. 87 (56)British troops should be contemplated until we could judge, in thelight of the outcome of the debate in the General Assembly, whetherwe could rely on the United Nations to carry out effectively theobligations which they had undertaken by the resolutions of 2nd, 5thand 7th November.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in the Houseof Commons that afternoon on the lines agreed in theirdiscussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider whatfurther action could be taken to remove the impressionthat we had failed to apply the principle of Common-wealth consultation in formulating and executing ourpolicy in respect of the Suez situation.(3) Invited the Paymaster-General, in consultation with theMinister of Defence and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs (Commander Noble), to arrange that Egyptianallegations of British atrocities in Port Said should bepromptly and vigorously rebutted.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,24th November, 1956.
