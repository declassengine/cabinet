3CM. 37 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Whitsun recess. It washoped that the Committee Stage of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Billcould be completed on 29th May. The rest of the week would beoccupied with the Report and remaining stages of the RoadTraffic Bill.Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that both Parties in the House ofCommons were now aware that the Government were not proposingto proceed at present with the project for improving the remunerationof Members, increasing the salaries of junior Ministers andintroducing a system of expense allowances for Peers. The reactionof the Opposition had so far been moderate, but it was still possiblethat they might decide on this account to be less co-operative in thehandling of day-to-day business in the House. On both sides therewas still&quot; a strong measure of support for early action to increase thesalaries of junior Ministers. There was little disposition to oppose theintroduction of a scheme of expense allowances for Peers. Herecognised that no further attempt could be made to proceed withthis project until the economic climate was more favourable; but, sofar as it concerned junior Ministers, action could not be delayed forvery long.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Parliament.SelectCommittee onProcedure.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had been considering, o i   * chrmlH not be appointed to examinewhether a Select Comm. tee *ouW ^&apos;      W     R .certain urgent problems of Parliamentaiy v &gt; ,be useful if the numbers required for a     .   ^d/&quot;/it j? j!in Standing Committee couldi be TulaSy did not require financial resolutions, could involve expenditure.There would be advantage in appointing a Select Committee withterms of reference limiting it to these three specific questions; but^Zm^S^^Go^^^PP^ sought to expandthe Qf-one of the enouirv In the first instance, therefore, he proposedto consult nformX the Executive of the 1922 Committee tosee Xether Government supporters would accept an enquiry limitedto these three points.In discussion the following points were raised :-(a) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that thereorganisation of the Scottish Grand Committee could not be longdelaved If there were difficulties in appointing a Select Committeeon the &apos;lines suggested, he would feel obliged to suggest that theGovernment should of their own responsibility bring forwardproposals for reforming that Committee.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he agreedthat Private Members should not be free to introduce Bills whichmight involve expenditure, the Government might lose more thanthev gained if the examination of this problem had the effect ofbringing under critical scrutiny the existing Government practice ofdrawing financial resolutions in very narrow terms.   He therefore50009-1
4suggested that the Financial Secretary, Treasury, should be broughtinto consultation in the further consideration of this question.(c) Of the three problems to which the Lord Privy Seal hadreferred, that of the Standing Committees was the most urgent. Itmight therefore be convenient to deal only with that problem in thecurrent session, and to leave the other two for consideration in thenext session.The Cabinet  ^Invited the Lord Privy Seal, with the Financial Secretary,Treasury, to discuss with the Executive of the 1922Committee the advantages of holding a limited enquiry onthese specific points of Parliamentary procedure, and tosubmit his considered recommendations to the Cabinet inthe light of those discussions.House ofLords.Reform.(PreviousReference :C.C. (55) 20thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordPresident (CP. (56) 116) outlining a scheme for the reform of theHouse of Lords. They also had before them a memorandum by theLord Chancellor (CP. (56) 119) supporting the Lord President&apos;sscheme and suggesting that the Government might proceed by puttingforward in the first instance detailed resolutions on the lines indicatedin the appendix to his memorandum.The Cabinet first considered whether it was expedient that theGovernment should attempt to deal with this problem in the presentParliament.   In favour of this it was argued that, unless it wasreformed,   the   House   of   Lords   would   progressively decline.Attendance was already so sparse that the authority of the House wasin jeopardy and the conduct of its day-to-day business precarious.This was partly due to the fact that many Peers could no longer affordthe expense of attending on their Parliamentary duties; and, whilethis might be remedied by a system of expense allowances, there wasa strong feeling in some quarters that such a scheme should not beintroduced without at least a promise of reform.   A ConservativeGovernment should not sit idle while the Upper House decayedbeyond the possibility of reform. There was a real danger that, unlesssome action were taken, the country would drift into a system ofsingle-Chamber government.   This Parliament might be the lastopportunity which a Conservative Government would have to reformthe House of Lords: the next session might be the last chance for theGovernment to make this attempt in the present Parliament. TheGovernment would gain great credit if they could carry through thisreform.On the other side it was argued that no plan of reform couldhope to escape serious criticism. Any legislation on this subjectwould arouse keen political controversy. The proceedings inParliament would be protracted and would occupy a disproportionateamount of the time available for legislation, at the expense of urgentGovernment business. Ministers would be put in the position ofhaving to defend a hereditary right to govern a position which itwas not easy to sustain in the second&quot; half of the 20th century.Finally, if a plan of reform were carried through by the presentGovernment majority, it was unlikely that the Labour Party wouldbe willing to co-operate in working it.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that, while the Cabinet need not be asked to take a final decisionat this stage, it was evident that there was a sufficient body of supportin the Cabinet for proceeding with this project in the presentParliament to justify Ministers in making a detailed examination ofthe particular plan of reform which had been put forward by theLord President.
5CM. 37 (56)The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss some of the main featuresof the plan outlined in CP. (56) 116. In this part of the discussionthe following points were raised:  (a) Close attention would be paid, by critics of the plan, to themachinery proposed for selecting Peers of Parliament from amongthe whole body, of hereditary Peers. It would doubtless be said thatthe scheme outlined in CP. (56) 116 had been designed to secure apermanent Conservative majority in the House of Lords. Therewould be a Conservative majority on the Selection Committee, andit would be said that the Committee could not be trusted to ensurethat adequate representation was given to the other political Parties.Much would turn on the question whether the Select Committee wasso constituted as to reflect the strength of the Parties in the House ofLords or their strength in the country. If the former criterion wereadopted it would strengthen the criticism that the scheme wasdesigned to secure a permanent Conservative majority in the Houseof Lords. On the other hand, it could be said that it was unsoundin principle to take the voting at an Election for the House ofCommons as a basis for constituting a Committee which was toselect those hereditary Peers who were to sit in the House of Lords.The Lord President said that, while he recognised the force ofthese criticisms, it was difficult to find any better alternative. Therewas in fact no perfect way of making the initial choice of thehereditary Peers who were to sit as Peers of Parliament. Once thenew House had been constituted, however, the system should ensurethat the most suitable Peers were selected; and the provision forfresh selection for each Parliament would give a useful opportunityto check the selection and keep it up to date.(b) There would also be difficulty m the selection of the firstbatch of life Peers. To ensure a high standard, it was proposed thatonly 50 or 75 of the full number, should be nominated initially.These would reflect the strength of the Parties at the precedingGeneral Election. Thereafter, 10 life Peers would be appointed eachyear until the full number had been completed. These might bechosen either in accordance with the strength of the Parties or at thediscretion of the Prime Minister of the day. After the full numberhad been completed, vacancies would thenceforward be filled at thediscretion of the Prime Minister of the day.Varying views were expressed, in discussion, on the questionwhether, after the initial nominations and before the full number hadbeen completed, the annual nominations should be based on Partystrengths or should be at the Prime Minister&apos;s discretion. The pointwas made that, in making their final choice between these alternatives,Ministers should keep in mind the desirability of reducing thecriticism that the whole plan was likely to secure a permanentConservative majority in the House of Lords.(c) The view was expressed that it would not in the end befound satisfactory to have two different types of Peer in the Houseof Lords and that, from this point of view, it would have beenpreferable if some scheme of reform could have been devised whichavoided the necessity for creating life Peers.The Lord Chancellor strongly dissented from this view. Hethought it a great tragedy that the development of a system of lifePeers had been prevented, 100 years ago, by the Wensleydaledecision; and it was, in his opinion, a great merit of the LordPresident&apos;s plan that this decision would thereby be reversed.It was also suggested in discussion that, as time went on, anincreasing number of those who were offered&apos; Peerages might indicatea preference for a life Peerage rather than a hereditary Peerage. Ifthat proved to be so, this plan might have the result that, by a processof gradual evolution, the hereditary element in the House of Lordswould eventually disappear. The plan might indeed be regarded asa first step towards the withdrawal of the hereditary right to govern. 1 b 3
6(d) A plan for reforming the composition of the House of Lordsshould not be associated with any proposal to increase its powers.The Lord President said that, for this reason, he now felt some doubtabout his earlier conclusion that provision for swamping should beexcluded.   This point required further consideration.(e) Further thought should also be given to the question whetherhereditary Peers who did not offer themselves for selection as Peersof Parliament should be free to stand for election as Members of theHouse of Commons. The Lord President said that he was inclinedto think that this option should be open to them but that, if theyexercised it in favour of standing for the House of Commons, theyshould not be eligible thereafter for selection as Peers of Parliament.The Prime Minister suggested that, as a next step, the LordPresident and the Lord Chancellor should, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, give more detailed considerationto the plan outlined in CP. (56) 116 and to the points which hadbeen raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion. By this means some of theoutstanding doubts and difficulties might be resolved. When broadagreement had been reached on the main features of the plan, itwould probably be helpful if the four Ministers could have theassistance of a group of senior officials, under the Chairmanship ofthe Permanent Secretary of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, whocould help in preparing a more detailed plan and in supervising thepreparation of the necessary legislation. It would, however, bedesirable that the Cabinet should have a further discussion beforethe preparation of legislation was actually put in hand.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President and the Lord Chancellor toconsult with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, asproposed by the Prime Minister, on these proposals forthe&apos; reform of the House of Lords.(2) Agreed that, in the light of those consultations, the Cabinetshould at a later meeting take a final decision on thequestion whether the Government should proceed withthis project in the next session of the present Parliament.Disarmament.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the ForeignSecretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (56) 117) on future policy in respect ofdisarmament.The Foreign Secretary said that it was desirable that the WesternPowers should be in a position to put forward some fresh proposalswhen the Disarmament Commission met in June.   In his view thebest basis for securing Allied agreement was to move in the directionof immediate reductions, under agreed controls, to 25 millions forthe three largest Powers and 750,000 for the United Kingdom andFrance, with a promise of some nuclear disarmament at a stage whichwould not endanger our own development plans.   Proposals whichmade no provision for nuclear disarmament would not suffice, forthere was now an increasing recognition of the risk that, owing tothe rapid development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, someof the smaller and less responsible countries would soon be in aposition to manufacture nuclear weapons.   In his view, therefore,we must be ready to consider proposals for some limitation onnuclear armament, though we must take care to ensure that thesedid not hamper our ability to carry out our own programme andto accumulate an adequate stockpile of these weapons.The Lord President and The Minister of Defence said that greatcare must be taken to ensure that any proposals for nucleardisarmament were framed in such a way as to protect our vital nationalinterests.  It would be some years before we could accumulate an
7 CM. 37 (56)adequate stockpile of nuclear weapons, and the time-table for thispart of any disarmament plan must be such as to enable us tocomplete our programme. It was also important that provisionshould be made for effective inspection and control.In discussion it was pointed out that there were as yet noindications that the Soviet Government were willing to acceptprovisions which would limit, at an early date, their freedom tomanufacture nuclear weapons. It was also suggested that thedifficulties of establishing effective machinery for inspection andcontrol were in themselves likely to ensure that we should haveenough time to accumulate an adequate stockpile of nuclear weaponsbefore any international prohibition of manufacture came intooperation.The Foreign Secretary said that at this stags he was only askingfor authority to explore the possibility of persuading the Governmentsof the United States, Canada and France to co-operate in workingout new proposals on the general lines suggested in paragraph 14of C.P. (56) 117. The Prime Minister said that on this subject itwas unlikely that much progress would be made by the exchangeof diplomatic notes: he suggested that, when more detailed proposalshad been formulated, it might be advisable for the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs to pay personal visits to the capitals concernedwith a view to arriving at agreed proposals which could be tabledat the next meeting of the Disarmament Commission.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to explore with theGovernments of the United States, Canada and France thepossibility of putting forward, at the next meeting of theDisarmament Commission, agreed proposals on the generallines indicated in paragraph 14 of C.P. (56) 117.Volta RiverProject.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 20thConclusions,Minute 5.)6 The Cabinet had before them a note by the President ofthe Board of Trade (C.P. (56) 105) covering the report of the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the conference which had taken place inLondon in April with representatives of the Gold Coast Governmentand the aluminium companies on the Volta River project.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Gold Coastrepresentatives at the conference had been informed of our viewthat, because of the greatly increased prospective cost of the VoltaRiver scheme and of our own economic difficulties, the pattern ofinvestment contemplated in 1952 would need to be reconsidered andexternal finance would have to be sought for the project. Theserepresentations had been reinforced by the attitude of the aluminiumcompanies who were also concerned at the rising cost of the schemeand anxious to avoid any further commitment until they had seenhow the Gold Coast would conduct its affairs as an independentcountry. Fortunately, the Gold Coast representatives had takena very realistic view of the matter. The Gold Coast Minister ofFinance had subsequently seen the President of the InternationalBank, who had undertaken to have the scheme examined. A delayof something between six and twelve months had thus been secured.The Colonial Secretary supported this statement. The difficultissues which had had to be presented at the conference had beenskilfully handled and had led to no deterioration in our relationswith the Gold Coast Government.The Cabinet-Took note of C.P. (56) 105 and of the statement by thePresident of the Board of Trade.
8Commonwealth        7.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ChancellorDevelopment,    of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (56)Kariba Hydro- 123 and 125) on the action which it might be expedient to take toElectric Scheme, present contracts for the Kariba hydro-electric scheme in Rhodesia,the cost of which would be financed or underwritten by the UnitedKingdom, being obtained by the subsidised competitors of UnitedKingdom firms.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not supportthe proposal that the international Bank, who were providing a loanfor this project under United Kingdom guarantee, should be invitedto agree that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland shouldimpose a notional countervailing duty to offset the amount of thesubsidy that any foreign tender might be judged to contain. TheInternational Bank could be expected to resist such a proposal withthe result that the loan, and consequently the project itself, mightwell be jeopardised. Moreover, any reference to a countervailing dutywould provide the International Bank with an opportunity to raisethe much wider issue of the Commonwealth preference system asa whole in relation to contracts of this kind. The Bank had beeninduced with some difficulty to accept the existence of the preferencesystem and it would not be to our advantage to give them groundsfor reopening that question. He would therefore prefer to confineour representations to making it clear both to the Bank and theFederation that in our view a contract should not be awarded toa firm whose tender was more favourable solely because of a subsidy.The President of the Board of Trade said that Parliament wouldbe keenly concerned at the loss of this business to foreign competitors especially as the foreign competition was subsidised and the UnitedKingdom were providing or underwriting the capital for the project.Against our total investment of  28 millions, United Kingdom firmswere likely to secure direct orders only to the value of some 15 millions. He suggested that the Government of the Federationshould at least be asked to give a definite assurance on the linesproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to agree that itshould be made public.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusion in paragraph 8 of CP. (56) 123.(2) Invited the Lord President and the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation, to arrange for a telegramto be sent that day to the representative in Washingtonof the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland seeking anassurance that contracts for the Kariba project wouldnot be awarded to firms whose tenders were morefavourable solely because of subsidy.Egypt-High Dam atAswan.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 42ndConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The Cabinet were informed that from a recent telegramfrom Cairo it seemed that Egypt and the Sudan were likely to reachagreement on a plan for sharing the Nile Waters. If so, the EgyptianGovernment would presumably be anxious to go forward with theHigh Dam scheme. In these circumstances it would be expedientto review our attitude towards this project and to reconsider ongrounds of policy and of resources the question of a financialcontribution to it.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theCommittee of officials which had previously considered thisquestion to review it in the light of subsequent developmentsand to report to the Cabinet.
9CM. 37 (56)9. The Colonial Secretary said that the Chief Minister ofSingapore had indicated to him on the previous evening that onfurther reflection he would be prepared to accept the proposals putforward by the United Kingdom Government in respect of theirreserve powers provided that the exercise of the power to legislateby Order in Council was made subject to affirmative resolution inboth Houses of Parliament. Mr. Marshall had put forward thisproposal on his own responsibility and it was not yet clear whetherit would be acceptable to the remainder of the Singapore Delegation.The Colonial Secretary said that he had consulted the LordChancellor, who was satisfied that any difficulties about this proposal e.g., in providing for emergency action during a Parliamentaryrecess could be overcome.The Cabinet agreed that the Colonial Secretary should make afurther attempt to reach a settlement on this basis. The ChiefMinister should, however, be given no ground for claiming that hehad been able to find a basis for a settlement by extracting a newconcession of substance.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to rttempt in furtherdiscussion to reach agreement with the SingaporeDelegation on the basis which he had outlined.Restrictive 10.   The Cabinet ^^f^^^Z^ITJTSXSi^^      &lt; !he&quot;Industry Fund&quot;ofIron and Steel the iron and steel industry.      4U *      r wIndustry.

To that extent hewelcomed it. But he was also concerned to preserve the authorityof the Iron and Steel Board. It was an important object of Govern-ment policy to create conditions in which the iron and steel industrycould maintain a stable existence without constant threat ofdisturbances on successive changes of Government. For this reasonhe would have preferred that the amendment should be drawn insomewhat wider terms to cover, not merely the agreement relatingto the Industry Fund, but any other agreement which was approvedby the Iron and Steel Board under their statutory authority.The President of the Board of Trade said that to draw theamendment in the wider terms proposed would have the effect ofexcluding the iron and steel industry from the Bill.Singapore.(PreviousReference :CM.

10The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that herecognised the force of the general considerations to which theChancellor of the Exchequer had drawn attention. If the scope ofthis particular amendment could not safely be widened, other meansshould be sought of confirming the influence and authority of theIron and Steel Board.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the proceedings on the Restrictive TradePractices Bill in the House of Lords, an amendment shouldbe moved by the Government on the lines proposed inCP.
