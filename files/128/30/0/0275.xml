3CM. (51) 56Australia.Trade Talks.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 49thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State, Board of Trade (CP. (56) 182) setting out aproposed basis of agreement which had been put forward by theAustralian Minister of Trade, Mr. McEwen. Under these proposalsUnited Kingdom exports would continue to receive a certainproportion of the contractual preferences which they at presentenjoyed in the Australian market in return for undertakings by theUnited Kingdom Government which would ensure that Australianwheat secured the share of the United Kingdom market that it hadenjoyed before the war. They also had before them a memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture (CP. (56) 179) describing thedifficulties which would confront us in giving the Australians theassurances they sought, and a draft public statement, circulated at themeeting, which might be issued at the close of this stage of the tradetalks.The Minister of Agriculture said that our total imports of wheatamounted to about 4,500,000 tons a year, of which some2,700,000 tons were of similar quality to that grown in Australia.The United Kingdom market for this type of wheat was at presentshared between Australia, France, the United States and Argentina inbroadly comparable proportions. There was therefore room for theadditional 500,000 tons of Australian wheat which would restore theshare in our market which Australia had previously enjoyed. Never-theless, as shown in his memorandum, there were formidabledifficulties in the way of entering into a commitment to secure this.He hoped, therefore, that we could confine ourselves to an under-taking to study the matter earnestly in the hope of finding a way ofsurmounting the obstacles.The Prime Minister said that the discussions with the AustralianPrime Minister, Mr. Menzies, and Mr. McEwen were aue to beresumed that afternoon. Although it was clear that a definitiveagreement could not be reached in the time available, the AustralianMinisters were unwilling to return empty-handed to Australia. Mr.McEwen had indicated that, if he could be convinced of theintentions of the United Kingdom Government in respect of wheat,he would adopt an accommodating attitude in any public statementsin Australia regarding the preferences. As regards the possible basisof an agreement it would be wrong in principle and indefensiblepolitically if safeguards for Australian wheat in the United Kingdommarket were provided at the expense of home grown rather thanFrench or Argentine wheat.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Australian shareof the United Kingdom market for wheat had fallen to half its pre-warlevel and the Australians complained that countries which subsidisedtheir wheat were able to undersell them here. It was both reasonableand in our interests that we should attempt to find a solution for theAustralian difficulties. We must, however, recognise that NewZealand and other Commonwealth countries would then ask forcomparable treatment. We should therefore calculate closely theextent to which it would be to our advantage to preserve the marketsenjoyed by our manufacturing industries in Commonwealthcountries in return for concessions to Commonwealth products whichwould tend to increase our cost of living and therefore our manu-facturing costs. This appraisal could only be conducted as part of acomprehensive review of our trade and commercial policy and itwould take time. We could not at this stage give the Australians anydefinite undertakings about wheat but we should aim at securing anunderstanding with them that both sides intended to reach an agree-ment in due course.The President of the Board of Trade said that an agreement underwhich we conceded additional safeguards for Australian wheat inreturn for a substantial reduction in the preferences enjoyed by ourown exports would not be attractive to industry or to public opinion.50234 2 B 2
4Nevertheless, without definite assurances safeguarding the Australiantrade in wheat we should be unable to secure even the limited measureof preferences which the Australians were prepared to retain. Heagreed that it would not be possible to do more at this point than toreach an understanding with the Australians that it was the intentionof both sides to seek an agreement eventually.The Cabinet then considered the draft of the statement which itwas proposed to issue at the end of the present stage of the talks. Itwas agreed in discussion that reference should be made in this to the frecognition by both countries of the importance of Commonwealthtrade and to the fact that the trade talks were not being broken offbut were being deferred for a short period during which furtherpreparatory work would be done.The Cabinet (1) Approved,  subject  to  amendments  suggested  in theirdiscussion, the draft of a public statement for issue at theclose of the present stage of the trade talks.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to be guided by the sense of theirdiscussion in the further talks with the Australian PrimeMinister and Minister of Trade which were due to takeplace that afternoon, and to attempt to secure theiragreement to the issue of a public statement on the lineswhich the Cabinet had approved.Egypt.High Dam atAswan.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 50thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Secretaryof State, Mr. Dulles, had informed the Egyptian Ambassador inWashington on the previous day that the United States Governmenthad come to the conclusion that it would not be feasible for themin present circumstances to give any financial assistance towards theconstruction of the Aswan Dam. It was clear that the UnitedKingdom Government should similarly withdraw from participationin this project and it might give rise to misleading impressions, bothhere and in Egypt, if an annuoncement to that effect were not madeforthwith. He sought the Cabinet&apos;s authority for such anannouncement to be made at the Foreign Office news conference atnoon that day.The Cabinet agreed that such an announcement should be made,in terms which would emphasise the economic considerations whichhad led us to this decision and would give the Egyptian Governmentno ground for assuming that it had been taken for political reasons.The decision related only to Government participation in the scheme-It would not govern the actions of private firms who might wish totake part in the scheme on some other basis, nor would it prejudicethe question whether the facilities of the Export Credits GuaranteeFund would be available for these firms.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary, subject to the points madein their discussion, to arrange for an announcement to bemade that day that the United Kingdom Government wouldnot provide any assistance towards the construction of adam at Aswan in Egypt.CapitalPunishment.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 50thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (56) 186) reporting the conclusions of the Committeewhich they had appointed to consider the possibility of framing aGovernment measure to amend the law of murder so as to restrict thescope of capital punishment.The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee were satisfied thatthis legislation, m addition to mitigating the severity of the law m
5CM. (51) 56relation to suicide pacts, provocation, constructive malice anddiminished responsibility, should also provide that capital punishmentshould in future be reserved for a limited number of specifiedcategories of murder. They were agreed that the death penalty shouldin future be reserved for the five types of murder set out in paragraph 4of C.P. (56) 186, and that murders falling outside those categoriesshould in future be punishable by life imprisonment. The Committeewere, however, divided on the question whether murder by poisoningshould be added to the categories for which death would be thepenalty.In discussion there was some support for the view that murderby poisoning should continue to be punishable by death. Poisoningcould be a particular loathsome and cold-blooded crime; and manypeople would feel that, if the death penalty was to be retained at all,it should be available for this type of case. On the other hand it wasargued that the categories devised by the Committee had been basedon the principle that the death penalty should be retained only forthose types of murder which directly threatened the preservation oflaw and order in a civilised society. If murder by poisoning wereadded to these categories, the logic of the scheme would be disturbedby intruding the different criterion that the death penalty should beavailable for murders which aroused a strong feeling of moralindignation. It would not in fact be practicable to define classes ofmurder by reference to that criterion.In further discussion it was also suggested that it would beacceptable to public opinion if a distinction could be drawn betweenvarious classes of murder on the basis of premeditation. It was,however, recognised that there would be great practical difficulty inconstructing a classification of murders on the basis of that criterion.The Prime Minister said that it was evident that the Cabinet werenot yet ready to reach a final decision on this difficult question. Itwould be convenient if the Lord Chancellor could find an opportunityof discussing the practical difficulties involved with those of hisCabinet colleagues who had not been members of his Committee.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to discuss the practical difficultiesof this problem with those of his Cabinet colleagues whohad offered views and suggestions on it in the course ofthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at ameeting in the following week.North Atlantic 4. The Foreign Secretary said that the North Atlantic CouncilTreaty were tG discuss that afternoon the need for a reappraisal of theOrganisation, military policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).Military Policy. He himself saw no risk of embarrassment in the discussion of the(Previous subject by the Council at the present time and he had instructed theReference- United Kingdom representative to speak on the lines of hisCm. (56) 44th communication to the United States Secretary of State of 15th JuneConclusions which set out the reasons which, in our view, called for and justifiedMinute 10)&apos;    a reappraisal of the military policy of N.A.T.O.   The UnitedKingdom representative would not, however, at this stage put forwardproposals.The Minister of Defence said that the United States Governmentwere concerned at certain misconceptions which had arisen regardingtheir attitude to the military needs of N.A.T.O. They had thereforedecided that, at the next meeting of the Military RepresentativesCommittee, their representative should make a statement reaffirmingthe intention of the United States to honour their commitments to
6N.A.T.O. and making it clear that they would not make unilaterallyany significant changes in their forces in Europe except in accordancewith normal N.A.T.O. procedure. They&apos;would expect their Allies toact in the same manner. If. however, other members of N.A.T.O.were to ask for a review of military policy they would be prepared tore-examine their own commitments as a part of a general reappraisal.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 49thConclusions,Minute 7.)Broadcastsfrom Egypt.5. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that theEgyptian Broadcasting system had instituted a series of broadcastsin Greek directed at Cyprus. He proposed that these broadcastsshould be monitored for a period of fourteen days to determine theextent to which they were intended to be inflammatory. Thepossibility of action to jam the broadcasts would be considered atthe end of that time in the light of the monitors&apos; reports.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.NuclearWeapons Tests.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 49thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Prime Minister said that he would like to be able to putto the United States Government practical proposals for an inter-national system of securing some limitation of tests of nuclearweapons. He therefore suggested that a study should now beinitiated, as a matter of urgency, of the lines along which aninternational agreement might be reached on this question.The Foreign Secretary said that he strongly supported thissuggestion. Public anxiety was growing, and the Government wouldbe expected to take some fresh initiative before very long.Tre Lord President said that it would be helpful if some of thepublic misunderstandings on this question could be removed. Somepeople seemed to think that we were proposing to carry out nucleartests in order to enhance our prestige; it would be useful if it couldbe made clear that our sole purpose was to satisfy ourselves that thebombs which we were proposing to make would be fully effective.It would also be useful if a clearer distinction could be drawn betweenlimitation and prohibition of these tests.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for officials of theDepartments concerned to study, as a matter of urgency,the possibility of an international agreement for thelimitation of tests of nuclear weapons, and to report theresults of this study to the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take such opportunities asoffered to remove the public misapprehensions on thisquestion to which attention had been drawn in theCabinet&apos;s discussion.Malta. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Colonial(Previous Secretary (C.P. (56) 169) on the outcome of the recent financialReference:      discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta.CM. (56) 46th The colonial Secretary said that, as a result of the offer approvedConclusions,    by the Cabinet on 28th June, the Prime Minister of Malta hadindicated his readiness to resume negotiations.  There were, however,
7CM. (51) 56other issues on which the Government of Malta might soon comeinto conflict with the United Kingdom Government. Subject to theCabinet&apos;s views, he proposed to resist any further pressures from thePrime Minister of Malta. In particular he intended to make noconcession on the question of &quot; economic equivalence &quot; between theUnited Kingdom and Malta. And he would resist&apos;any proposals fora change in the electoral system in Malta in the absence of inter-Partyagreement or of a mandate secured from the electorate at a generalelection.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theColonial Secretary&apos;s views on these two points.The Colonial Secretarysaid that, in weighing any new proposalsfor constitutional change in Malta, Ministers might find it helpful tohave the latest views of the Chiefs of Staff on Malta&apos;s importance asa base. The Minister of Defence said that the Chiefs of Staff hadreferred to this question in a recent appreciation which they hadmade of British interests in the Middle East; but he would ask themwhether they wished to supplement this in the light of theconsiderations set out in C.P. (56) 169.The Cabinet (1) Took  note  of  the  Colonial   Secretary&apos;s memorandumC.P. (56) 169.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to ask the Chiefs of Staffwhether, in the light of the considerations set out in thatmemorandum, they had anything to add to what they hadsaid, in a recent appreciation of British interests in theMiddle East, on Malta&apos;s strategic value to the UnitedKingdom.Aden.(PreviousReference:C-M. (56) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C.P. (56) 178) on the situation in the Colony andProtectorate of Aden.The Colonial Secretary said that he had circulated this memo-randum for the information of his colleagues. Since the Cabinet&apos;smeeting on 28th June he had discussed with the Lord Chancellor andthe Attorney-General the particular problem of dealing with politicalagitators in the Colony and Protectorate and, in consultation withthem, had devised alternative proposals for this purpose which wouldnot be open to the objections raised against his earlier suggestion.These new proposals were now under consideration by the Governor.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandumC.P. (56) 178 on the situation in the Colony and Protectorateof Aden.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,20th July, 1956.
