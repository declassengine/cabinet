C.M. 83 (56)CommercialPolicy.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 10.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade(C.P. (56) 256) seeking authority to announce in Parliament theGovernment&apos;s intention to enter into negotiations in the Organisationfor European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) with the purposeof establishing in Europe a mutual free trade area on the terms whichthe Cabinet had previously considered. They also had before thema note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P. (56) 261) annexinga copy of a statement issued by the Prime Minister of Canadasetting out the Canadian Government&apos;s attitude towards theparticipation of the United Kingdom in such a free-trade area.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since the Cabinethad last considered his proposals, they had been discussed in thiscountry with representatives of employers and trade unions, and themore considered views of other Commonwealth Governments hadalso been received. These consultations had revealed an encouragingmeasure of support for the initiative which the Government had beenconsidering. At home, while employers and trade unions had beencautious in their response, a survey made by the Federation of BritishIndustries had shown support for the proposals by a majority of thelarger firms employing between them 85 per cent, of the total numberof workers in industry. The idea of a free-trade area appealed tothe underlying internationalism in the outlook of the trade unionmovement. Overseas, other Commonwealth Governments seemedto be content that the United Kingdom should take this initiative.They were less concerned with its ultimate consequences for theirown trade than with its effect on our balance of payments.In the forthcoming discussions in the O.E.E.C. we must defineour attitude towards the proposals for closer economic integrationin  Europe  and  we  must  do  so  without  equivocation. TheGovernment would not, however, be justified in assuming commit-ments which would take over a decade to come into full effectwithout first assuring themselves that such a policy commanded thegeneral support of the nation, as expressed in a full Parliamentarydebate.   Even so, a decision to enter into negotiations would notinvolve a final commitment to join a free-trade union.  This woulddepend first, on whether a basis for such a union could be establishedbetween the other European Powers concerned; and secondly, onwhether we should be able to obtain agreement to the conditionswhich we regarded as essential for the protection of Commonwealthtrade and home agriculture.  The negotiations would last for abouteighteen months.   During this time there would be continuingconsultations with the Commonwealth, industry and trade unions,and the Cabinet would be invited from time to time to take furtherdecisions in the light of progress made.  The proposals which hadbeen worked out related to the circumstances which the Cabinethad had under consideration hitherto; viz., the creation of a CustomsUnion among the &quot; six Powers,&quot; with which the United Kingdomand possibly other European countries would be associated in awider free-trade area. There were now some indications that, amongthe six Powers, both France and Germany might limit their aims tothe establishment of a free-trade area.  To the extent that, innegotiations, these countries were to pursue such an objective, thiswould create a new situation and it would be necessary to review ourown policy in the light of it.  But it would still be desirable for theUnited Kingdom to be in a position to influence developments whichmight otherwise turn to our disadvantage.   It was evident that, asa result of the Suez crisis, the year ahead would be a period of greatdifficulty for Western Europe; and, even if the negotiations for acloser economic unity in Europe were ultimately to fail, the fact thatthe United Kingdom had been ready to play a constructive part inthem would help to preserve the solidarity of Western Europe duringthis period.Discussion showed that, subject to the general endorsement ofthe proposals by all Parties in Parliament, the Cabinet were satisfied50812 2 B 2
4that the measure of support which had been vouchsafed, both athome and overseas, for such an economic initiative in Europe wouldjustify the Government in entering into negotiations on the basiswhich the Cabinet had previously considered. The response of otherCommonwealth Governments had been unexpectedly favourable,although it must be expected that their attitude would change if anydanger emerged that concessions might have to be made in respectof foodstuffs as the price of our participation in a free-trade area.At home, there had been an equally unexpected measure of supportboth from the Conservative Party and from the Trades UnionCongress, a traditionally protectionist body. While opposition mustbe expected from those industries which were especially exposed tocompetition, the Federation of British fndustries would be concernedif the Government were now to decide to draw back from thenegotiations. Although the proposals were still being studied inWashington, the Secretary of the United States Treasury had saidthat the proposals for closer economic unity represented the onlyfeasible long-term economic policy for Europe and that he wouldgive them his active support.The Lord President and The Lord Chancellor recalled that, inearlier discussion, they had made some reservations. The supportfor these proposals which had since been publicly expressed both athome and overseas, taken in combination with recent internationaldevelopments, had gone far to dispel the doubts they had previouslyentertained.In further discussion the point was made that both the UnitedStates and Canada would continue to press for assurances that theproposed free-trade area would not be designed in such a manner asto create benefits for its members while restricting the opportunitiesfor trade with the area open to third countries. For us, however,the advantages of such a free-trade area would lie in providing forour industries a protected mass market comparable in scale to thehighly protected domestic market of the United States. Thisadvantage would be proportionately lessened if we gave way to thesepressures. On the question whether our objectives would needreconsideration if the earlier plans for a Customs Union of the sixPowers did not come to fruition, no decision could yet be taken.It was not immediately apparent, however, that it would be contraryto our interests if the proposed Customs Union were in fact to bereplaced by a wider free-trade area in the creation of which we wereto take a leading part.The Cabinet next considered the arrangements for debating thepolicy in the House of Commons. A debate could be arranged inthe week beginning 26th November. It was agreed that, if a formalmotion were tabled, there would be a risk of embarrassingamendments relating, for example, to relative wage levels andstandards of social services. It might, therefore, be preferable thatthe debate should take place on a motion for the Adjournment. TheGovernment could thereafter announce their decision in the light ofthe views expressed in the debate. It was agreed that the Governmentspokesmen in the debate should be the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade.The Lord Privy Seal, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were evidently agreed that, subject to the results of a debatein Parliament, the Government should, at the forthcoming meetingof the O.E.E.C., take an initiative on the lines which the Cabinethad previously discussed. The Colonial Secretary wished to reservehis position and the Prime Minister also wished to have a furtheropportunity for Cabinet discussion before the proposed policy wasdebated in Parliament. He himself was satisfied that, subject tothe views of Parliament, it was right to enter into negotiations inthe O.E.E.C. An indication of the Government&apos;s intentions had beengiven prominence in The Queen&apos;s Speech and he was impressed bythe measure of support for the policy which had been expressed by
5CM. 83 (56)Conservative Members of Parliament. He was somewhat doubtfulwhether, in face of the pressure which must be foreseen from the lowtariff and agricultural countries in Europe, it would prove possibleto reach international agreement on the basis of our proposalswithout amendment. Finally, the disciplinary consequences of theproposed policy for our own economy, in terms of the ability tomaintain full employment and to achieve the necessary degree ofmobility of labour, must not be underestimated.The Cabinet Agreed in principle that, subject to a final decision to betaken at a meeting in the following week, the Governmentshould seek the endorsement of Parliament for their policyof entering into negotiations with other European countrieson the participation of the United Kingdom in a free-tradearea in Europe.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Second Reading of the Rent Restriction Bill would be takenon 21st and 22nd November. The debate would be opened by theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing; and the Governmentspokesmen on the second day would be the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Housing.House ofCommonsDisqualificationBill.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 9thConclusions.Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C.P. (56) 259) and the Attorney-General (C.P. (56) 262)on the amendments to the House of Commons Disqualification Billwhich had been made by the Select Committee to which the Billhad been referred.The Home Secretary said that the Select Committee had, by amajority opinion, rejected a proposal that the Bill should applythe principle of disqualifying a Member of the House of Commonsfrom holding any of the specified offices instead of the principle thatthe specified offices should disqualify from membership of the Houseof Commons. Inasmuch as the former principle would appear towithdraw from the House of Commons its jurisdiction to decidequestions of disqualification, it was unlikely to be acceptable to theHouse; and he recommended that the majority view of the SelectCommittee should be endorsed by the Government.The Select Committee had also reported the Bill with thefollowing amendments:  (i) The general disqualification of holders of all &quot; public officesor places under the Crown &quot; had been replaced by comprehensivelists of individual disqualifying offices, the Government beingempowered to add to these lists, by Order in Council, any new officescreated in the future otherwise than by statute.(ii) Members of the reserve and auxiliary forces would no longerbe disqualified on embodiment or recall to the Colours.(iii) The existing disqualifications of Government contractorsand Crown pensioners were repealed without replacement.In each case, the balance of advantage lay in accepting the SelectCommittee&apos;s amendment; and it would be appropriate also to endorsetheir suggestion that the rules and practice of the House of Commonsgoverning the disclosure of personal pecuniary interests by Membersof Parliament when speaking or voting should be reconsidered.50812 2 b 3
0In discussion there was general agreement that the recommenda-tions of the Select Committee should be accepted. Doubts wereexpressed, however, about the effect of Clause 1(4) of the Bill, inwhich it was provided that a person should not be disqualified forappointment to, or for holding, any office or place by reason of hisbeing a Member of the House of Commons. The Home Secretarysaid that these words might prove embarrassing to a Minister whosepolicy was that persons closely identified with Party politics shouldnot hold certain offices. Such Ministers might be exposed to criticismif they took it upon themselves, by administrative action, to excludesitting Members of Parliament from posts which the Select Committeehad regarded as not incompatible with membership of the House ofCommons. It might therefore be appropriate to rely on amendmentof the First Schedule of the Bill rather than on administrativemeasures to secure the exclusion of Members of Parliament fromoffices not at present listed in that Schedule.The A ttorney-General said that the task of the Select Committeehad been confined to considering fitness to be a Member ofParliament; they had not been concerned with the fitness of aMember of Parliament to hold a particular office, the decision onwhich would remain the responsibility of Ministers. There wasnothing in the Bill which prevented Ministers from reserving theright to exclude active Party politicians from certain posts, whetheror not the House of Commons considered that the holders of thoseposts could properly be Members of Parliament. But Ministersshould exercise that right, not by making disqualification from anoffice operate automatically on the nomination of the holder as aParliamentary candidate, but by making the original appointmentto the office subject to the express condition that the holder shouldoffer his resignation on being nominated as a candidate at aParliamentary election. If this argument was made clear in thedebate on the Second Reading of the Bill, it should constitute asufficient answer to any charge that the practice of Ministers wasinconsistent with the spirit of Clause 1(4) of the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the majority view of the Select Committee thatthe principle of &quot; reverse disqualification &quot; should not beimported into the Bill.(2) Approved in principle the main changes in the Bill made bythe Select Committee, and accepted the Committee&apos;ssuggestion that the rules and practice of the House ofCommons in regard to disclosure of personal pecuniaryinterests should be reconsidered.(3) Agreed that Clause 1 (4) of the Bill should be retained, butthat Government spokesmen should make it clear duringthe debate on the Second Reading of the Bill that thisclause did not derogate from the right of Ministers toexclude active Party politicians from certain posts.(4) Agreed that, subject to such minor amendment of the Billas was necessary to correct obvious errors, it should bereintroduced exactly as reported by the Select Committee.(5) Invited the Legislation Committee to consider what detailedamendments to the Bill would be justified at a later stage.Nuclear 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeRadiations. Secretary (C.P. (56) 222) seeking authority for the issue of a pamphlet(Previous describing a provisional scheme of public control designed to provideReference: protection against fall-out from thermo-nuclear explosions.CM. (56) 40th jhe ffome Secretary said that, for purposes of planning andConclusions, training, it was urgently necessary that this scheme of control shouldMinute 8.) be made known to local authorities and others concerned with theorganisation of Civil Defence.   He also recommended that the
7CM. 83 (56)pamphlet should be placed on general sale, as a further step in theprocess of educating the public in the precautions to be taken againstthe risks of fall-out. The pamphlet contained no information aboutthe effects of fall-out which had not already been published in thePress, and he doubted whether it would cause any anxiety or alarm.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that this pamphlet might be used as a basis for consultationwith those concerned with Civil Defence preparations throughout thecountry.On the further question whether it should be placed on generalsale, opinion was divided. In favour of publication it was arguedthat earlier official statements on the effect of fall-out had attractedlittle public attention. On the other side, the following considerationswere put forward:  (a) If the pamphlet were published in the near future, it might belinked with the threats of Soviet action implied in recent notescondemning Anglo-French action in the Middle East. This wouldincrease public anxiety about Soviet intentions.(b) The precautions described in the pamphlet covered only alimited part of the risk. Publication might have the effect of drawingattention to the inadequacy of the preparations which were beingmade.(c) The pamphlet itself stated that the provisional scheme ofcontrol was being referred to the Medical Research Council for studyand comment. It seemed preferable that the scheme should notreceive general publicity until the Council&apos;s comments had beenreceived and taken into account.(d) Special objection was seen to the publication of the mapsappended to the draft pamphlet. It would be preferable that, if anyillustrative maps had to be used, whether for training purposes or foreventual inclusion in a published pamphlet, they should not relate toparticular areas of the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusion (3) below, agreed that a pamphlet onthe lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56) 222 should beissued, for planning and training purposes, to localauthorities and others concerned with the organisation ofCivil Defence.(2) Agreed that no such pamphlet should at this stage be placedon general sale.(3) Agreed that, if any illustrative maps were included in such apamphlet, they should not relate to any particular area ofthe United Kingdom.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 82ndConclusions.)5. The Cabinet were informed that some small components ofthe United Nations force were now ready to be flown into Egypt assoon as the agreement of the Egyptian Government had beenobtained. The Secretary-General of the United Nations wasproceeding to Cairo with a view to resolving with the EgyptianGovernment outstanding differences about the composition andfunctions of the force.In discussion it was noted that, according to reports published inthe Press, the Egyptians were likely to argue that their acceptance ofthe United Nations force must be subject to two conditions (i) thatthe force should be stationed, not on the Suez Canal, but on thearmistice line between Egypt and Israel; and (ii) that the EgyptianGovernment should themselves have power to decide when the forceshould be withdrawn. The Foreign Secretary would presumablymake it clear to Mr. Hammarskjoeld that we should be unable toaccept any agreement with the Egyptians which included suchconditions as these.
8Reference was also made, in discussion, to the importance ofproceeding, without delay, with the clearance of the obstructions nowblocking the Suez Canal. This would be a very large and difficultsalvage operation, and the Anglo-French forces had at their disposalthe only organisation in the world which was capable of carrying itthrough effectively and quickly. For the moment the resources ofthis organisation could be usefully employed in clearing the harbourat Port Said. It was however to be hoped that the United Nationswould, without much further delay, authorise its use in clearing .obstructions throughout the whole length of the Canal. The Cabinetwere assured that, in his discussions in New York, the ForeignSecretary would lose no opportunity of stressing the importance andurgency of this problem.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the points raised in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to informthe Foreign Secretary of their anxieties lest the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in his forthcomingdiscussions with the Egyptian Government, should acceptlimitations on the functions and use of the United Nationsforce which would not be acceptable to the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and France.Export of Arms.Turkey.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 60thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 257) about the request of the TurkishGovernment to acquire one cruiser, four destroyers and eight frigates.These vessels were available, but the cost of refitting and storingthem would be between  9 and  10 millions; and it would perhapssuffice if we offered either four destroyers (at a total cost, includingrefit and stores, of about  3 millions) or merely the hulls of a cruiser,four destroyers and eight frigates (costing about  1-8 million) leavingit to the Turkish Government to arrange for these hulls to be fittedout elsewhere. In either case, however, the Turks would undoubtedlyexpect to be granted extended credit terms.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the TurkishGovernment had shown themselves to be firm friends of this countryduring the Suez crisis. They had granted us, at very short notice,facilities to overfly their territory, they had sided with us in voting,in the General Assembly of the United Nations, against the Afro-Asian resolution which had called for the immediate withdrawal ofthe Anglo-French force from Egypt; and by vigorous and almostsingle-handed action they had saved the Bagdad Pact fromdisintegration. It was therefore important that we should do all wecould to reach agreement with the Turkish Government on the supplyof warships on acceptable terms.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) An offer of hulls alone was not practicable from theAdmiralty&apos;s point of view. An offer of four destroyers could bemade, but only on the understanding that the refitting of these shipswould have to be undertaken by private shipyards and financed fromsome source other than Navy Votes.(b) Whatever the expenditure involved, there was no likelihoodthat the Turks would be able to repay any Governmental loan exceptat the expense of British commercial creditors.(c) The grant of favourable credit terms to Turkey wouldprovoke an unfavourable reaction in other countries, particularlyPakistan, to whom we had recently sold arms for cash. It wasessential that, however well-disposed we might be towards Turkey,we should not alienate opinion in Pakistan, which was also a memberof the Bagdad Pact.
CM. 83 (56)The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary, the President of theBoard of Trade and the First Lord of the Admiralty, to givefurther consideration to the financial basis on which fourdestroyers might be made available to the TurkishGovernment.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 73rdConclusions,Minute 6.)7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer^overing a report by the Ministerial Committee on the     , /.Farm Price Review. Lcr(*/x*vThe Minister of Agriculture said that further discussion with theFarmers&apos; Unions had suggested that a final settlement might bepossible on the following basis:  fi) Special Reviews. A convention should be worked out, inconsultation with the Unions, to define and limit the circumstancesin which a request for a special review would be accepted. The aimof the Government would be a convention which would go fartowards eliminating special reviews in practice: and, if such aconvention could be agreed, it would be preferable to the alternativecourse of amending the Agriculture Act, 1947, in the face ofopposition from the Unions and rural opinion in general.(ii) Assurances relating to total support. The Unions had askedfor an undertaking that the total value of the guarantees would bemaintained at 98 per cent, of their prevailing value, coupled with aprovision that the calculation should take account of cost decreasesas well as cost increases. It was probable, however, that they wouldaccept a figure of 97+ per cent., coupled with the same provision.(iii) Grants for permanent farm improvements. Despiteprobable pressure from the farmers and the landowners for someimprovement of the 33] per cent, rate of grant which the Cabinet hadauthorised, there was no need at this stage to contemplate anyincrease in that figure provided that the grant was extended tospecialised horticultural equipment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that for the purpose ofdefining the assurances relating to total support, he would havepreferred to adhere to the figure of 97 per cent, of the prevailingvalue of the guarantees coupled with any cost increases since the lastannual review. On the other hand, in the light of the upwardtendency of costs which was likely to develop, the substitution of97| per cent., with an allowance for cost decreases, would reduce byonly a relatively small amount the Government&apos;s room for manoeuvreat annual reviews. He would therefore be prepared to accept a figureof 97+ per cent., with an allowance for cost decreases, provided thatit formed one element in a comprehensive settlement with the farmers,the other features of which would be agreed on the basis which theMinister of Agriculture had described. He could not, however,accept the necessity for the extension of the proposed scheme ofcapital grants to specialised horticultural equipment.In further discussion there was general agreement that acomprehensive offer of this kind should now be made to the Farmers&apos;Unions. It should be part of the objective of this offer to eliminateas far as possible special reviews based solely on wage increases.These had had an undesirable effect on wages policy generally; and,even if we could not secure the agreement of the Farmers&apos; Unionsthat the proposed convention on special reviews should provide thatwage increases alone would not be regarded as justifying a specialreview, the Government&apos;s intention in this respect should, if necessary,be made clear in a separate letter.
soThe Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to discuss with theFarmers&apos; Unions a comprehensive settlement on the linesindicated in their discussion.GovernmentExpenditure.Health Services.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was doubtfulabout the Government&apos;s ability to adhere to their earlier decision toincrease the charge for prescriptions under the National HealthService to Is. an item. He suggested that a small group of Ministersshould consider urgently whether it was possible to effect the sameeconomy in Government expenditure by some alternative methodwhich might be more acceptable to public opinion.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Paymaster-General, theMinister of Labour, the Minister of Pensions, the Ministerof Health and the Financial Secretary, Treasury, to considerpossible alternatives to the proposed increase in the chargefor prescriptions under the National Health Service.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,J3th November, 1956.
