3CM. 73 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 30th October and 1st November there would be debates onnationalised industries.Parliament would be prorogued on 2nd November.GovernmentExpenditure.Economies,previousReference:CM. (56) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.P. (56) 247) covering the draft of an announcementwhich he proposed to make in Parliament on the following day oneconomies in Government expenditure. This wouid show furthereconomies amounting to  17  millions which, when added to the 76 millions announced in June, would give a total of  93j: millionstowards the saving of  100 millions which he had undertaken toachieve in his Budget speech.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) Several Ministers reported that, after again reviewing theirestimates for departmental expenditure on travelling and subsistence,they could not see their way to making a reduction of 5 per cent,without impairing the services for which they were responsible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would not presshis original suggestion for a 5 per cent, reduction by each Department.He still hoped, however, to secure a significant reduction in the totalexpenditure by all Departments on travelling and subsistence; andhe looked to his colleagues to make the maximum contribution whicheach could achieve towards a reduction of the total bill.(b) The proposal relating to the prescription charge had beenaccepted by the Social Services Committee as virtually the onlymethod of effecting any immediate saving in expenditure on the healthservices. It was agreed that, in the proposed statement, the decisionto increase the prescription charge would be more accuratelydescribed as a change in the method of charging for prescriptions. Itwas also agreed that the Minister of Health might inform theChairman of the British Medical Association of the Government&apos;sintentions shortly before the announcement was made.(c) Because of the extent to which Government expenditure wascommitted in advance, it was difficult to find satisfactory scope forsavings in reviews of expenditure which were related to periods ofsix months or even one year. It was argued that more effective resultswould be obtained if the aim were set at achieving larger economiesover a longer period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would consider,in consultation with the Chairman of the Social Services Committee,what further and longer term review of civil expenditure might beundertaken.(d) There remained an urgent need to achieve more substantialeconomies in defence expenditure, particularly on research anddevelopment. Our objective should be to reach in the near futureagreement with the United States on interlocking defencearrangements which might be expected to release skilled men andresources for our engineering export industries. If, however, fulladvantage was to be obtained from such an arrangement, the Serviceswould have to accept more equipment of American design.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to amendments arising out of the pointsrecorded in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the draftstatement annexed to C.P. (56) 247.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Lord Privy Seal, what steps might betaken to give effect to the point recorded in paragraph (c)above.51159 6b 2
43. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofHousing (C.P. (56) 244) and by the Lord Chancellor (C.P. (56) 246) onthe proposed legislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts.In discussion there was general support for the proposal inC.P. (56) 244 that the Bill should provide for the immediate decontrolof houses with a rateable value exceeding  40 in London and  30elsewhere in England and Wales.Discussion then turned on the application of this legislation toScotland. The Committee of Ministers which had considered thisaspect of the problem had concluded that the statutory arrangementsproposed for England and Wales could not be applied to Scotlanduntil a new rating valuation for Scotland had been completed in 1961.On the other hand, it was important that some correspondingaction to decontrol rents should be taken in all three countriessimultaneously. They therefore recommended that the Bill should,in its application to Scotland, provide for certain percentage increasesin rents related to the provisions of the Repairs and Rents Act, 1954.This would make it possible for net rents in Scotland (after excludingowners&apos; rates) to be raised by an average of 80-85 per cent, and wouldbe broadly in line with the increases which the new legislation wouldallow in England and Wales. This different approach to the problemin Scotland might lead to some possible embarrassment, but it couldbe defended on the ground that housing conditions in Scotland weredifferent from those in England and Wales.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he was ingeneral agreement with these proposals, the release of an appropriateproportion of higher value houses in Scotland from the scope of rentcontrol altogether would occasion some hardship, especially amongmiddle-class people with fixed incomes, and might on this account giverise to political difficulties.The Minister of Housing said that there was no evidence that thedecontrol of higher valued properties would lead to greater hardshipin Scotland than in England and Wales. As regards the politicaldifficulties, these were likely to be no less troublesome in the case oftenants of controlled houses whose rents would be allowed to rise tonew maximum levels. An appeals procedure for hardship cases wouldtend to defeat the Government&apos;s purpose of preventing the continuedunder-occupation of larger houses.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C.P. (56) 244.(2) Agreed that the proposed legislation to amend the RentRestriction Acts should contain provisions relating toScotland based on the recommendations in C.P. (56) 246.RentRestriction.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 69thConclusions,Minute 5.)OverseaBroadcasting.(PreviousReference:C.M. (56) 67thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that his Committee on OverseaBroadcasting would shortly be reporting to the Cabinet. But sincethe Director-General of the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.)would be leaving this country at the end of the week for a period ofseveral months, it would be useful if the Committee&apos;s provisionalconclusions could be disclosed to him before his departure, so that hisreactions could thereafter be reported to the Cabinet. He thereforesought the Cabinet&apos;s authority for the Postmaster-General and theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) to see the Director-General, and to inform him that the Government&apos;s proposals foroversea broadcasting were likely to include the following changes:  (i) The Government grant of about  5 millions in respect of theB.B.C.&apos;s external services would be reduced by at least  1 million,mainly by the elimination of the European language services.
5CM. 73 (56)(ii) This saving would be devoted, in part, to an intensificationof the B.B.C.&apos;s services to the Middle East and South-East Asia.(iii) Some part of the saving might also be used to increase theeffectiveness of our information services by other methods over whichthe Government would retain more direct control for example,the production of television material, for use wholly overseas, by theCentral Office of Information(iv) The Government would not seek to impose any directcontrol over the B.B.C.&apos;s external services, but they would requirethe appointment of a Foreign Office liaison officer to advise the B.B.C.on the content and direction of their oversea programmes.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The complete elimination of the European services would beregrettable; and the argument that the Government were notprepared to spend   1 \ millions on these services could be defended onlyif the decision were represented as part of a general redeploymentof the effort of the B.B.C. as a whole. It might also be necessaryto replace the language services with some general expansion of ourinformation services in Europe.(b) The B.B.C. should not be allowed to suppose that savingson their services were proposed as a means of finding the subsidyfor the Independent Television Authority for which the Authoritywere known to be asking.(c) In addition to the saving on the European language servicesconsideration should be given to the possibility of making somereduction in the expenditure of about  H millions on the GeneralOverseas Service.(d) A readjustment of the broadcasting services should beregarded as only one part of the wider problem of improving theinformation services generally. Other proposals to this end mightwell be considered.The Cabinet (1) Authorised  the  Lord  Privy  Seal  to arrange  that thePostmaster-General and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs (Mr. Nutting) should ascertain the reactions of theDirector-General of the B.B.C. to the provisionalconclusions of the Committee on Oversea Broadcasting.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to submit the Committee&apos;s reportto the Cabinet as soon as possible, together with anindication of the B.B.C.&apos;s views.Price ofSugar.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Minister of Agriculture said that the Government&apos;sTrading Account in sugar was likely to show a terminal loss of about 2^ millions at 31st December, 1956. Of this sum about  1 millioncould reasonably be transferred to the Sugar Board when it cameinto existence on 1st January, 1957. The balance must, however,be borne either by the consumer or by the tax-payer; and if theGovernment&apos;s previous policy in this matter was to be maintained,an increase of \d. a lb. in the price of sugar should be made in thenear future. The effect on the cost-of-living index should be anincrease of no more than 0 05 points.The Cabinet-Agreed that the price of sugar should be increased by \d.a lb.
6Agricultural (y    The Minister of Agriculture said that, as requested by thePolicy. Cabinet, the Home Affairs Committee had given further consideration(Previous to the question of introducing a differential system both for individualReference: commodity guarantees and for the proposed scheme for capitalCM. (56) 71st   grants to the farming industry.Conclusions. The Committee had reached the conclusion, which the ChancellorMinute 3.) of the Exchequer had accepted, that a system of individual commodityguarantees would provide undesirable scope for argument andcontroversy and that the farmers would be unwilling to accept sucha system. It would be preferable, in their view, to propose a flat-rateguarantee of 96 per cent, and to seek to secure by negotiation thatthe concession whereby the percentage reduction on individualcommodities would not exceed 9 per cent, over 3 years should notextend to cereals. He had already opened tentative negotiations withthe farmers&apos; representatives on this basis.. The Committee had also seen objection to a differential systemfor capital grants under which expenditure exceeding  10 an acrewould qualify for a higher rate of grant. He had therefore, with theapproval of the Committee, opened discussions with the farmers&apos;unions on the basis of a flat-rate grant of 33^ per cent. He himself,however, remained of the opinion that it would be difficult to findsuitable means of helping the small farmer if a differential systemof capital grants could not be introduced. He did not wish to pursuethe point any further for the time being, but he reserved the rightto bring it before the Cabinet again at a later stage.In discussion there was support for the view that the time wasrapidly approaching when policy towards agriculture, as expressedin the Agriculture Act, 1947, would need to be reviewed morecomprehensively. Such a review would need to take into account,not only the importance of increasing the efficiency of British farming,but also the difficulty of reconciling a flourishing agriculture in theUnited Kingdom with the probable emergence of surpluses both hereand in other countries.The Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusions reached by the Home AffairsCommittee on the question of a differential system forindividual commodity guarantees and capital grantsrespectively, and authorised the Minister of Agriculture tocontinue negotiations with the farmers&apos; unions on the basiswhich he had outlined.Suez Canal. *7.   The  Cabinet  were  informed  of  the  results  of the(Previous       consultations which had been held with the French Foreign MinisterReference:      on the previous evening.   The French Government had withdrawnCM. (56) 72nd their Ambassador from Cairo, as a protest against Egypt&apos;s complicityConclusions,    in the supply of arms to the Algerian rebels, and had brought thisMinute 6.)       incident to the notice of the Security Council. In these circumstancesthey were not anxious for an early resumption of negotiations withthe Egyptians on the Suez Canal issue.   On the other hand, theyrecognised the urgent need to bring that issue to a head.  They wereunwilling to use the gun-running incident as a ground for takingmilitary action against Egypt: they preferred that such action shouldbe based on grounds which concerned the United Kingdom as wellas France.   While they favoured early military action they wereunable to find any sufficient grounds for undertaking it at the presenttime.The Cabinet were informed that the military operation whichhad been planned could not be held in readiness for many dayslonger. There was growing dissatisfaction among the reservists who* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
7CM. 73 (56)had been recalled for service, and it would be difficult to retain themfor much longer unless there was some significant development inthe Suez dispute by which they could be convinced that their serviceswould soon be required. Moreover, the condition of the vehicleswhich had been loaded in merchant ships for many weeks was nowdeteriorating, and the time was fast approaching when they wouldhave to be unloaded and serviced. For both these reasons themilitary authorities would prefer to adopt, after the end of October,a new military plan which could be held in readiness to be put intooperation, at about fourteen days&apos; notice, at any time throughout thewinter. Under this plan the reservists would be released, and wouldagain be recalled when a fresh emergency arose; and the vehicleswould be unloaded from merchant ships and, for the most part,stored on land. It would be difficult to switch over to this winterplan without giving the public the impression that our militaryprecautions were being relaxed. This could not fail to weaken ourbargaining position in any negotiations which were undertaken withthe Egyptian Government on the Suez Canal issue.In discussion of the possibility of military action against Egyptthe following points were raised:  (a) If a military operation had to be undertaken during thewinter months, it would be similar in scope to that which had beenplanned for the summer and it would have the same objectives. Thefirst objective would be to obtain control over the Suez Canal bylanding an Anglo-French force after a preliminary air bombardmentdesigned to eliminate the Egyptian Air Force and to weaken the powerof resistance of the Egyptian Army. It could, however, be assumedthat if such an operation were launched Israel would make a full-scaleattack against Egypt; and this might have the effect of reducing theperiod of preliminary air bombardment. The second objective ofthe operation would be to secure the downfall of Colonel Nasser&apos;sregime in Egypt.(b) Was it not likely that such an operation would unite theArab world in support of Egypt? The Prime Minister said that thiswas a serious risk; but against it must be set the greater risk that,unless early action could be taken to damage Colonel Nasser&apos;sprestige, his influence would be extended throughout the MiddleEast to a degree which would make it much more difficult to over-throw him. It was known that he was already plotting coups inmany of the other Arab countries; and we should never have a betterpretext for intervention against him than we had now as a result ofhis seizure of the Suez Canal. If, however, a military operation wereundertaken against Egypt, its effect in other Arab countries wouldbe serious unless it led to the early collapse of Colonel Nasser&apos;sregime. Both for this reason, and also because of the internationalpressures which would develop against our continuance of theoperation, it must be quick and successful.(c) Military action against Egypt would presumably involveserious risks to British lives and property, both in Egypt and in otherArab countries. The Cabinet were informed that, within the limitsof what was practicable, preparations had already been made toprotect British civilians and the dependants of Service personnelthroughout the Middle East.The Cabinet then considered the prospects of bringing the Suezissue to a head by diplomatic means. The Egyptians might be askedto produce, within a specified time limit, their alternative proposalsfor placing the Canal under international supervision. This coursewould be in conformity with the Security Council resolution. It was,however, open to two objections. First, the French would notwelcome an early resumption of the negotiations with Egypt.Secondly, if such a demand were made, the Egyptians were likelyto comply with it by producing within the specified time proposalswhich, though unsatisfactory, would appear to afford a basis for
8discussion. In that event a breaking point could only be reachedafter several days of discussion. If therefore the Cabinet chose thecourse of negotiation they would face a dilemma. They could frametheir demands in such a way as to make it impossible for theEgyptians to accept them being resolved, on an Egyptian refusal,to take military action designed to overthrow Colonel Nasser&apos;sregime. Alternatively, they could seek the sort of settlement of theCanal issue which might be reached by negotiation recognising that,by accepting such a settlement, they would abandon their secondobjective of reducing Colonel Nasser&apos;s influence throughout theMiddle East.The Prime Minister said that, before a final decision was taken,further discussions with the French Government would be required.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting on thefollowing day.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,31st October, 1956.
