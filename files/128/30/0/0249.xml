3CM. (25) 56Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the first week after the Easter recess.The Committee Stage of the Restrictive Trade Practices Billwould be taken on the floor of the House on 11th and 12th April.*2. The Prime Minister said that he had been discussing withsome of his colleagues and with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff the significance of the recent appointments of Arab officers tokey positions in the Arab Legion. These further changes confirmedthe earlier view that General Glubb&apos;s dismissal had been broughtabout by a conspiracy of Arab officers in the Legion, and it was con-ceivable that this group might have the further intention ofoverthrowing King Hussein and seizing power in Jordan. A situationmight therefore arise in which it would be expedient to give the Kingan assurance that, if there was serious dissension within the Legion,we would be prepared to send further troops to Jordan to assist himin maintaining law and order.In discussion it was agreed that the King would be well advisedto remove some of these officers before they attempted to underminehis own position. On the other hand, H.M. Ambassador wouldneed to use great caution in broaching this possibility with the King,who might still be under the impression that these officers wereworking in concert with him. It was, however, most desirable thata military coup d&apos;etat should if possible be forestalled. There wouldbe much greater political and military difficulty in retrieving theposition in Jordan once the King had been overthrown. Indeed, inany operation for that purpose, the initiative might have to be takenby Iraq.The Cabinet were informed that preliminary instructions on thismatter had already been sent to H.M. Ambassador at Amman. Infurther discussion is was suggested that a supplementary instructionmight now be sent authorising the Ambassador to give the King anassurance of British military support in maintaining law and orderif, in his judgment, such an assurance was urgently required andcould be given without risk of an* unfavourable reaction by theKing.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and authorisedhim to settle in consultation with the Foreign Secretary theterms of such further instructions as were necessary toensure that H.M. Ambassador at Amman lost no opportunityof assuring King Hussein of our readiness to support himagainst any attempted coup d&apos;etat by officers of the ArabLegion.Jordan.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Cyprus.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to a telegram from theGovernor of Cyprus (No. 649) reporting that on 22nd and 24th Marchbroadcasts from Athens containing inflammatory propagandadirected against Cyprus had been relayed by the United Statesbroadcasting station &quot; Voice of America.&quot;In discussion it was suggested, if this was a sponsoredprogramme, the United States authorities might disclaimresponsibility for its content. H.M. Ambassador in Washington had,however, been instructed to take the matter up with the StateDepartment.The Prime Minister said that the United States Governmentshould be left in no doubt about the damage which such an incident* Originally recorded in a Confidential Annex.49935 2b 2
might cause to Anglo-American relations. This point should bebrought to the notice of the United States Ambassador in London.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to make appropriaterepresentations to the United States Ambassador in Londonregarding the broadcasts to Cyprus which had been relayedby the &quot; Voice of America &quot; on 22nd and 24th March.Coal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 8thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFuel and Power (CP. (56) 87) summarising a revised programme ofcapital development for the coal industry over the next ten years andseeking authority for legislation to extend the borrowing powers ofthe National Coal Board.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the borrowing powersof the Coal Board would shortly be exhausted and legislation toextend them would have to be passed in the current session. TheBoard had asked for powers to borrow an additional  400 millions,but he had taken the view that they should themselves find thenecessary resources to wipe out their accumulated deficit of about 40 millions and create a small working balance, and that the newborrowing authority should be limited to  350 millions. This wouldsuffice to cover the capital development needed to replace wastingseams and to maintain output at current levels, and it would createthe capacity for the production of an additional 30 million tons of coalby 1970. The investment programme would, however, be reviewedannually in the light of performance in increasing output.In discussion attention was drawn to the terms of a report whichthe Coal Board proposed to publish on their investment plan. Thiswas related to a total investment of  400 millions. It also containedreferences to the labour force of the industry and to productionprospects which were not wholly in accord with Government policy.The Board had not been willing to accept all the amendments of thisdocument which had been suggested to them by the Minister of Fueland Power; and it would be necessary for Ministers to make-it clear,when the report was published, that it was issued on the authorityof the Board and did not carry the full approval of the Government.In these circumstances it might be preferable that the figureincluded in the legislation to extend the borrowing powers of theBoard should not be one which invited comparison with the figureof  400 millions quoted in the Board&apos;s report. The legislation wouldin any event set an annual limit for new borrowing, and it might bebetter that the legislation should be cast in terms of an authority toborrow not more than  75 millions in each of the next four years.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was proposed to finance about two-thirds of the totaldevelopment programme without recourse to borrowing. Thepossible effect of this on the price of coal was a matter for separateconsideration. It would certainly be necessary to raise the price ofcoal to provide the  50 millions needed to cover the accumulateddeficit and to provide a small working balance.(b) It was disquietening that, as indicated in paragraph 6 ofCP. (56) 87, only some 8 per cent, of major development schemes onwhich  128 millions had been spent since 1947 had been completedto date. The Cabinet were informed that greater emphasis wouldbe laid in future on bringing development schemes to fruition inpreference to distributing investment simultaneously over an excessivenumber of such schemes.(c) The prospects of achieving a more economical productionand utilisation of coal resources by underground gasification werevery encouraging. It was doubtful, however, whether the CoalBoard would exploit these possibilities to the full, and it might be
TheTerritorialArmy.5 CM. (25) 56necessary to consider whether private enterprise should not take ahand in this.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the introduction in the current session ofParliament of a Bill to extend the borrowing authority ofthe National Coal Board.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Fuel and Power, to settle, in the light ofthe points made in their discussion, (i) the precise limitsof the new borrowing authority to be provided, and (ii) theterms of the announcement which should be made todissociate the Government from responsibility for thestatements made in the National Coal Board&apos;s forth-coming publication &quot; Investing in Coal.&quot;5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War (CP. (56) 49) proposing that an annual bounty of 20 should be paid to officers of the Territorial Army.The Secretary of State for War said that this was a small butimportant matter. To offer a smaller bounty to officers than to otherranks would create resentment quite disproportionate to the savingthereby secured and would impair the prospects of recruiting orretaining volunteer officers in the Territorial Army. Discriminationagainst officers in a payment of this kind would cause much ill-feeling.He was willing to save the sum of  110,000 involved by economieselsewhere in his Vote.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the pay and allow-ances of volunteer officers was not inadequate, and the case for abounty was by no means strong. The Territorial Army already hada surplus of officers and he doubted whether recruitment would beaffected by the size of the bounty. It was not unprecedented forofficers to receive less than other ranks and the Territorial soldierhad had a bounty of  12 at a time when there was no provision fora bounty for the officer. Nevertheless, in order to reach a settlementof this matter the Treasury had been prepared to offer the sum of  10.In discussion the view was expressed that these bounties mighthave been discontinued when recent increases were made in Servicepay. A Government spokesman had, however, indicated in theHouse of Lords that the amount of the bounty for Territorialofficers was under consideration. In view of this statement it wouldnot be easy to dispense with this bounty altogether or to justify payingthe officers materially less than the other ranks. A compromisefigure of  15 might be considered. This, combined with the messingallowance of  10, might be sufficient to remove any appearance ofdiscrimination.It was also pointed out that the present surplus of Territorialofficers was a temporary feature resulting from the disbandment ofthe anti-aircraft and coastal artillery units. There was a risk that,if the handling of the bounty were allowed to cause resentment, youngofficers would not come forward to join the Territorial Army andreplace senior Territorial officers who would shortly be retiring.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toagree to a figure of  15. He did not, however, wish to be understoodto accept this in return for an offer that the cost would be met bysavings elsewhere in the Army Votes. If economies were practicable,they should be made irrespective of any bargain of that kind.The Cabinet Agreed that the annual bounty for officers of the TerritorialArmy should be  15.
6Singapore.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 28thConclusions,Minute 3.)Malta.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 23rdConclusions,Minute 10.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ColonialSecretary (CP. (56) 85) outlining the course which he proposed tofollow in the constitutional talks due to begin on 23rd April with anall-Party delegation from Singapore.The Colonial Secretary said that he now wished to give furtherconsideration to this question in the light of advice which he hadreceived from the Governor of Singapore regarding the handling ofthe forthcoming conference. Meanwhile, the Cabinet might wishto consider the general background to the talks. We were facedwith a difficult situation in Singapore. There was intense politicalconsciousness, but no stable Government and grave danger ofincreasing Communist influence; and the position was furthercomplicated by the temperamental character of the Chief Minister.Singapore could never hope to achieve full self-government exceptas part of a larger self-governing whole; and our ultimate objectiveshould be to re-unite Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. Thetime was not yet ripe for this; the Chief Minister of the MalayanFederation had made it clear that the constitutional development ofthe Federation must first be consolidated; and in the meantime wemust preserve law and order and protect our vast trading interestsin Singapore. To do so it might well prove necessary to resume directgovernment. The Colonial Secretary believed that many membersof both Houses of Parliament were ready to face this prospect. Itwas important, however, that we should be seen to have done ourbest to allow the greatest measure of political advance which waspossible for the people of Singapore in their present circumstances.To this end he had it in mind to propose: (i) that the LegislativeAssembly should be enlarged ; (ii) that there should be an all-electedCouncil of Ministers (appropriate steps being taken to limit thenumber of Ministers); and (iii) that while external affairs, defence andinternal security would continue to be reserved to the Governor, thelocal Government would be given some say in the handling of thesesubjects. On the last point, however, the Governor of Singaporetook the view that internal security had already in practice becomethe responsibility of the local Council of Ministers and that anyattempt to exclude it from the Council&apos;s scope would be unacceptableto local opinion. The Colonial Secretary foresaw great danger inany surrender of control over internal security; but he proposed toconsider whether some formula could not be devised to meet thisdifficulty.   He would circulate his suggestions to the Cabinet.In further discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Commonwealth Secretary referred to a message fromthe Australian Prime Minister, who had emphasised that, while itwould be necessary to make some concessions to local opinion inSingapore, internal security must be regarded as bound up withSingapore&apos;s external defence.(h) The Chiefs of Staff were considering the strategic aspects ofthis question and, in particular, the problems involved in reinforcingthe British troops in Singapore in an emergency. It might not bepossible to provide the whole of the extra forces required from HongKong: in that event, it might be necessary to draw upon thestrategic reserve in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (56) 85.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate his furtherproposals regarding the conduct of the forthcomingConference on constitutional development in Singapore.7. The Cabinet reviewed the course of the debate which hadbeen held in the House of Commons on the previous day on thereport of the Round Table Conference on Malta.The Colonial Secretary had made it plain, in opening the debate,that the Government favoured the recommendations put forward by
7 CM. (25) 56the Conference. The criticisms of those recommendations which hadbeen voiced by Government supporters in the debate had, on thewhole, been moderately expressed. In view of the course which thedebate had taken the Prime Minister had authorised the ColonialSecretary to state, in replying to the debate, that an announcementof the Government&apos;s intentions would be made before Parliamentrose for the Easter recess.The Cabinet discussed the form which this announcement shouldtake. They agreed that it should now be made clear that theGovernment intended to introduce legislation to give effect to therecommendations of the Conference; but that, while the Bill wouldprovide for all the changes necessary for that purpose, that part ofit which related to the representation of Malta in the Parliament atWestminster would not be brought into operation until the Maltesepeople had shown their desire for it in a general election.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) A statement in the terms proposed should be made by thePrime Minister in the House of Commons on 28th March. It wasinexpedient that the Prime Minister should explain the Government&apos;sdecision at a further meeting of the 1922 Committee before thisstatement was made.(b) On the Government side of the House there was still someuneasiness on the question of Maltese representation at Westminster,and it was too early to say how Government supporters would voteon the proposed legislation. For this and other reasons no indicationshould be given at present of the date on which this legislation wouldbe introduced.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he continuedto be disturbed at the possibility that this constitutional change mightstimulate the demand for a measure of Home Rule for Scotland. Hewould have preferrerd that nothing should be done which mightgive this encouragement to the Scottish Nationalist movement. Hefelt bound to add, however, that there had not so far been any signsthat Scottish Nationalists were paying special attention to theseproposals for constitutional change in Malta.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should proceed in due coursewith legislation giving effect to the recommendations ofthe Round Table Conference on Malta, on the under-standing that the part of the Bill which related to therepresentation of Malta in the Parliament at Westminsterwould not be brought into operation until the Maltesepeople had shown their desire for it in a general election.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to make an announcement to thiseffect in the House of Commons on 28th March.Iron andSteel Prices.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 25thConclusions, .Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 88) on iron and steel prices.The President of the Board of Trade said that the domestic priceof steel had been held at a level 15 per cent, below that at whichBritish steel could be sold overseas, with consequent advantage to ourengineering industry. The Iron and Steel Board were now proposingto increase steel prices early in April by some 3-3^ per cent. He didnot think that the Government should challenge this decision: ourengineering industry would still be able to buy steel more cheaplythan their competitors in Europe.The price of iron and steel scrap was controlled under DefenceRegulations at an artificially low figure. He now proposed toadvance the price of scrap by  2 a ton. This would restore themargin between scrap and pig iron prices which had existed in July,1955. It would entail a further increase in the price of steel of1  per cent., the total resulting increase thus being 4 -4  per cent.
8The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that, while pricecontrol applied to steel supplied for the home market but not toexported steel, the steel industry was encouraged to export itsproducts at the higher world prices, thus causing a shortage of steelfor the home market which had to be made good by imports. It wasarguable, therefore, that prices of steel for the home market shouldbe raised by a larger amount than was now proposed. If theGovernment were to continue to refrain from limiting imports byphysical controls, they should allow the price mechanism to operate.He suggested that further thought should be given to the questionwhether price control of steel should continue.As against this it was argued that, if steel prices were not fixedby the Iron and Steel Board, it would not follow that prices wouldmove freely: it was more likely that there would be substituted acommon price arranged between the steel manufacturers. It was,however, agreed that further consideration should be given to thismatter.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the price increases proposed by the Iron andSteel Board.(2) Approved the proposal of the President of the Board ofTrade to increase the price of scrap by an average of 2 per ton.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer the question whetherthe present system of controlling the price of steel shouldbe discontinued.British 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignCouncil. Secretary (CP. (56) 86) on the difficulties of recruiting permanentstaff for the British Council.The Foreign Secretary said that he wished to apply two remedies a satisfactory pension scheme based on retirement salary, and areasonable assurance of continuity of employment. Plans for asuitable pension scheme were well advanced. To provide anassurance of continuity of employment, he now recommended that astatement should be made, in reply to a Parliamentary &quot;Question,stressing the importance of securing recruits for permanent servicewith the Council and making it known that it was the Government&apos;sintention that the Council should remain a permanent feature ofBritish overseas services.In discussion it was recognised that, in order to attract recruitsof the right calibre, some assurance of continuity of employmentmust be given. Doubts were, however, expressed about theexpediency of making a public statement on the lines proposed inCP. (56) 86. Some newspapers were implacably hostile to the BritishCouncil and the announcement could not have the result desiredif it served to provoke further Press attacks on the Council and itswork. It was also pointed out that an announcement on these lineswould be open to misunderstanding at a time when the Governmentwere seeking to reduce the numbers employed in the public service.In all the circumstances it might be preferable that the proposedassurance should be given, not in a public statement, but in privatecommunications to University Appointments Boards.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether the objectsought by the proposal put forward in CP. (56) 86 couldnot be better furthered by other means than anannouncement in Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,27th March, 1956.
