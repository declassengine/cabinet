3CM. 23 (56)1. The Prime Minister said that he was concerned at thecontinuing state of disorder in Bahrain. As a result of meetingswhich he had held during the past few days with some of hiscolleagues and military advisers, a company of British troops hadbeen moved into Bahrain from Sharjah and two frigates wereremaining there pending the arrival of a cruiser from Malta. Thetime had now come for the Cabinet to consider whether these Britishforces should be used for the restoration of public order in Bahrain.On this question the latest local advice was contained in telegramNo. 221 from H.M. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and atelegram (Mecos 115) from the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East.It was the view of the Commanders-in-Chief that, in the long term,the use of British troops to maintain law and order might have anadverse effect on our position in these areas: what was nowdiscontent with local Rulers might thereby be turned into positiveanti-British feeling: in their view the proper long-term remedy wasthe building up of effective police forces. On the other hand, in theimmediate situation confronting us in Bahrain some use of Britishtroops seemed inevitable. Under arrangements made earlier, stepswere about to be taken to bring in additional police from Iraq; butthe Political Resident now advised that the current situation mightbe further inflamed if these reinforcements were brought in at thepresent time. He therefore recommended that, for the present, notmore than 30 officers, non-commissioned officers or specialistsshould be sent from Iraq, and that even these should be held backuntil the situation had been restored. For the present he wouldprefer to rely on his authority to call on the British troops now inBahrain to restore the situation if it deteriorated further.In discussion there was general agreement that the long-termremedy was to strengthen the police force in Bahrain. Theimmediate situation was, however, unsatisfactory. We had advisedthe Ruler to strengthen the police and, in pursuance of that advice,he had made arrangements to bring in trained police from Iraq.It was unfortunate that we should now find ourselves obliged toadvise him to delay their arrival, just at the moment when they wereurgently needed. It was evident that the local police needed help;and, if there were good reasons why this should not be providedby additional police officers from Iraq, it must be given by the Britishtroops who were now in Bahrain.In further discussion it was suggested that for the present itmight be sufficient if the British troops took over some of the normalduties of the police and by this means freed more police for use inthe restoration of law and order. The Political Resident in thePersian Gulf might be authorised to put this proposal to the Ruler,but he should at the same time be reminded that under his standinginstructions he had authority, with the Ruler&apos;s consent, to call onBritish troops to restore order if the situation deteriorated further.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to sendimmediate instructions to H.M. Political Resident inthe Persian Gulf authorising him to suggest to the Ruler thatBritish troops now in Bahrain should take over some of thenormal duties of the police so as to free the latter for thetask of restoring law and order, and reminding him thatunder his standing instructions he had authority, with theconsent of the Ruler, to call upon British troops to restoreorder if the situation deteriorated further.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 20th March there would be a debate on the employmentsituation. It was agreed that the Minister of Labour and the Minister49919 3
4of State, Board of Trade should speak for the Government in thisdebate.On 21st March there would be a debate on the report of theConference of Privy Councillors on security in the public services.The Home Secretary would speak for the Government in this debate.The Cabinet were informed that Parliament would be adjournedfor the Easter recess on 29th March and would reassemble on10th April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budget on17th April.Broadcasting.The FortnightRule.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in his evidence before theSelect Committee which was considering the operation of the rulerestricting broadcasting on subjects about to be debated inParliament, he had followed the line approved by the Cabinet at theirmeeting on 13th March. In addition to the points discussed at thatmeeting questions had been raised by the Select Committee about therule which at present precluded Members of Parliament frombroadcasting on matters which were the subject of legislation. Thisprohibition applied at present from the time when a Bill wasintroduced until it received the Royal Assent. It applied only toMembers of Parliament and not to other speakers. There seemed tobe a case for some relaxation of this restriction, and he had suggestedto the Select Committee that they might well consider whether somechange could not be made.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Valuation forRating.(PreviousReference:C.C. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Minister of Housing said that he was presenting toParliament later in the day a White Paper setting out the changes inthe distribution of the rate burden between various classes ofproperty which had resulted from the recent revaluation. Thesechanges had aroused some criticism, particularly from shopkeepers.In a written answer announcing the presentation of the White Paperhe proposed to inform the House that the Government were nowreviewing the whole problem of local government finance; that thiswould be the most comprehensive review of its kind since 1929 andwould include an examination of the system of de-rating; and thatit would not be possible to arrive at a final appreciation of the futureincidence of the rate burden until this review had been completed.The view had been expressed that this reference to de-ratingmight be taken to imply that the Government already had it in mindto make changes in the basis of rating industrial and agriculturalproperty, and that this might arouse premature expectations amongother property holders. He himself saw little danger of this. Itwould be evident that any modifications in the organisation of localgovernment finance which might result from the review would affectthe distribution of the rate burden.The Cabinet agreed that a statement in the terms proposed mightbe made, subject to an amendment to make it quite clear that it wasnot the Government&apos;s intention to consider the system of de-ratingexcept as part of a general review of local government finance.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement which theMinister of Housing proposed to make in the House ofCommons on the results of the recent revaluation.
5CM. 23 (56)BritishTransportCommission.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Minister ofTransport had intended to announce that afternoon the Govern-ment&apos;s decision to increase railway charges. It was important thatthe reasons which had weighed with the Government in reaching theirdecision should be set out in terms which would serve to reinforce thearguments which the Prime Minister would put forward in discussingthe Government&apos;s deflationary policies with the Federation of BritishIndustries and the Chairmen of the nationalised industries in thefollowing week, and in a further discussion with the Trades UnionCongress at a later date. It would be convenient, from this point ofview, if the announcement could be deferred until the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Transport, whohad been consulted during the course of the meeting, agreed that theannouncement could be deferred.The Cabinet Agreed that the announcement of their decision in respectof railway charges should be deferred until 19th March;and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle theterms of the announcement in consultation with theMinister of Transport.Farm PriceReview.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 12.)6. The Minister of Agriculture informed the Caoinet of theterms in which he proposed to announce, in reply to a ParliamentaryQuestion in the House of Commons that afternoon, the results of thecurrent review of farm prices. He would announce the Government&apos;sdecision to adjust the price guarantees and production grants byamounts which would increase their total value in a full year by 25 millions. He would add, at the end of his statement, that on thisoccasion agreement had not been reached with the Farmers&apos; Unions:while they would not have wished in the prevailing circumstances todissent from the total increase in the guarantees, they were unable toagree to the price determinations or to the changes in the fatstockguarantee system. He would conclude by making it clear that theGovernment were satisfied that their determinations were fair andjust and took a full and balanced view of the needs of the agriculturalindustry and of the national economy.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the terms in which the Ministerof Agriculture proposed to announce the results of thecurrent review of farm prices.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 77) covering a revised draftof the White Paper on the Implications of Full Employment.In discussion there was general agreement that this revised draftpresented a fair and objective picture of the economic implications offull employment. It was, of course, a very generalised statement andgave less emphasis than might have been wished to some aspects ofthe current economic policy of the present Government. This was,however, inevitable in a document which reviewed the whole of thedecade which had passed since the end of the war. It should beused as a background for further Ministerial statements of theGovernment&apos;s economic policy. For this purpose it would be avaluable addition to the series of documents which would bepublished between now and the Budget.In further discussion the following specific points were made:  (a) It would be preferable that the White Paper should beentitled &quot; The Economic Implications of Full Employment.&quot;
6(b) The White Paper should be published before the Easterrecess, but not until after the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on the employment situation. It was agreed that a suitabledate for publication would be 22nd March.(c) A popular version of the White Paper was now in preparation.The text of this would be submitted to the Cabinet in due course.(d) A detailed plan should be made to ensure that continuingpublicity was given to the Government&apos;s economic policy, makingfull use of Ministerial speeches and of other media of publicity. Noopportunity should be lost of bringing home to the public the mainthemes in the Government&apos;s programme, including the need forincreased production and increased savings.The Cabinet (1) Approved  the  revised  draft  White Paper  annexed toCP. (56) 77, subject to the change of title noted inparagraph (a) above; and agreed that it should bepresented to Parliament on 22nd March.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldsubmit to the Cabinet the text of a popular version ofthis White Paper.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to concert, with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and other Ministers concerned, arrange-ments for a campaign of continuing publicity for theGovernment&apos;s economic policy.Economic 8.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofSurvey, 1956.    the Exchequer (CP. (56) 78) covering the draft of the EconomicSurvey for 1956.The Cabinet approved the draft Economic Survey for publicationlater in the month, subject to any further textual changes whichmight be necessary, and to an amendment of paragraph 82 to referto the suspension of the investment allowances rather than to theirsubstitution by initial allowances.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was recognised that the strain of maintaining a desirablelevel of investment in the Commonwealth would have to be takento some extent on the sterling reserves. It was in some respectsunfortunate that it would not be appropriate to give prominencein the Economic Survey to the understandings reached with otherCommonwealth countries on this matter.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the deflationarymeasures which had recently been introduced and reinforced wouldrequire perhaps a year to take their full effect. It would thereforebe desirable that he should give, perhaps in the course of his Budgetspeech, a general warning to the effect that further strains on thereserves must be expected.(c) The graph on page 27 of the draft Economic Survey, whichshowed our declining share of world trade in contrast to the expandingshare of Western Germany, was discouraging. Germany* had alarger share of world trade than the United Kingdom before the warand it was only to be expected that she should resume her formercompetitive position. She was, however, helped in this by havingno armaments burden.The Cabinet (1) Approved the publication of the draft Economic Survey for1956.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate in duecourse the terms of his proposed statement to cover thepoint recorded in paragraph (b) above.
7CM. 23 (56)BritishIndustriesFair.(PreviousReference:C.C. (54) 6thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 80) recommending that theGovernment should cease to provide financial assistance for theBritish Industries Fair (B.I.F.).The President of the Board of Trade said that the Londonsection of the B.I.F., concerned mainly with consumer goods, hadbeen attracting diminishing support for many years. If the fair inLondon was to continue, the Government guarantee would have tobe increased from its present figure of  100,000 to  500,000. But, eventhen, there was little prospect of its paying its way, for it was clearthat manufacturers increasingly preferred to exhibit at specialisedfairs confined to the products of particular industries. He thereforefelt obliged to recommend that the guarantee should be terminated,and that the public funds spent in publicising the B.I.F. should bedevoted henceforward mainly to improving official displays at fairsoverseas. The Government should, however, assume responsibilityfor the losses incurred to date by British Industries Fair, Ltd., anda Supplementary Estimate for about  50,000 for this purpose wouldbe necessary. The decision would arouse some criticism; but theBirmingham section of the fair would probably be able to continuewithout financial assistance and would in fact become the BritishIndustries Fair.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, in the circumstances,there was no alternative but to terminate the guarantee and to bringto an end the London section of the British Industries Fair.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) In announcing the decision, stress should be laid on theGovernment&apos;s intention to use in promoting overseas trade publicitythe savings which would accrue.   This would help to meet criticism.(b) The Government should underwrite all the liabilities whichmight arise in connection with the fair to be held in London in thefollowing month.(c) The indifferent display which had been presented by UnitedKingdom pavilions in several overseas fairs recently had done harmto our trading reputation. It might be preferable in future to refrainfrom having a central pavilion for United Kingdom exhibits, and toencourage manufacturers who wished to participate in a fair toexhibit in the appropriate trade section. The President of the Boardof Trade undertook to formulate a revised policy in this matter inconsultation with the Foreign Office.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 80.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forconsultations with the Foreign Office with a view toformulating a revised policy on the question of UnitedKingdom exhibits in overseas trade fairs.Mafta. 10.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the handling in,D Parliament of the report of the Round Table Conference on Malta.(Previous cReference *C M (56) 22nd ^he Colonial Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting onConclusions&apos; &apos;^th March, he had discussed this question further with the LordMinute 9) &apos; Privy Seal and the Lord Chancellor. They had given preliminaryconsideration to the form of a Government motion on which thematter could be debated in the House of Commons, but they thoughtit would be preferable to defer making any firm recommendation tothe Cabinet on this until they had heard the views of Governmentsupporters as expressed at the meeting of the 1922 Committee whichthey were attending that evening.   They were, however, agreed that
8it was most desirable that this debate should be held before the Easterrecess.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the results of thereferendum, it might be possible to take the line that a furtherexpression of the views of the Maltese people should be obtained,by means of a general election, before the Parliament at Westminsterwas asked to express a final opinion on this issue. The ColonialSecretary said, in reply, that it was not proposed that Parliamentshould be asked to take any definite action until some clearerindication had been obtained of the wishes of the people of Malta.It would, however, be unreasonable to suggest that a further electionshould be held in Malta on this issue before the matter had even beendebated in the Parliament at Westminster. The Prime Minister ofMalta might even decline to hold an election until Parliament hadgiven some provisional indication of its attitude towards therecommendations of the Round Table Conference.Further discussion showed that it was the general opinion ofthe Cabinet that there was now no practical alternative but to inviteParliament to accept the recommendations of the Round TableConference, on the understanding that effect would not be given tothem until clearer evidence had been obtained that they wereacceptable to a substantial majority of the people of Malta. For thereasons stated in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 13th March, this coursewas open to far less danger than that of allowing the situation inMalta to deteriorate further. Ministers should therefore give a firmlead in this direction when they discussed the matter at the meetingof the 1922 Committee.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Prime Minister should state, in reply toprivate enquiries by the leaders of the Opposition and,if necessary, in a public statement in the House ofCommons, that the Government would find time for thisquestion to be debated in the House of Commons beforethe Easter recess.(2) Agreed to resume, at a meeting in the following week, theirdiscussion on the form of the Government motion onwhich this debate would be held.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th March, 1956.
