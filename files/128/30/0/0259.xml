3CM. 35 (56)North 1    The Foreign Secretary made a brief report to the Cabinet onAtlantic the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Council.   Though theCouncil. conduct of the meeting had not been satisfactory, its conclusionswere acceptable. There had been a general recognition of the needto maintain the solidarity of the Alliance. There had been no supportfor the idea that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)could be used as a means of channelling economic aid to under-developed countries. There had been general agreement that moreuse should be made of the Council as a forum for discussion ofpolitical problems affecting some or all of its members.The Foreign Secretary said that in his view further thoughtshould be given to the possibility of interesting Parliamentarians ofmember countries in the work and purposes of N.A.T.O. In the longterm it might be feasible to create a North Atlantic Assembly,comparable with the European Assembly. Meanwhile, however, itwould be useful if further meetings of Parliamentarians frommember countries could be organised, on the lines of the successfulmeeting which had been held in Paris in 1955.In discussion some doubts were expressed about the expediencyof adding to the number of international Assemblies. In the nearfuture the most practical development of that kind was likely to bean amalgamation of the European Assembly and the Organisation forEuropean Economic Co-operation. It would be valuable ifParliamentarians from member countries could learn more of thework and purposes of N.A.T.O., but it would be preferable that theirmeetings should be organised on an ad hoc, rather than an annual,basis These meetings should not necessarily be held in Pans: therewas much to be said for holding them in other capitals of NorthAtlantic countries.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the suggestionsraised in their discussion to be communicated informallyto the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation.Bahrain.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)2 The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications thatr , 7 -i  ; tU ^rvnr in Bahrain in the course of the next fewXs AdtuaSt4TfoSef wouid be available for use if needaroie. Two* companies of.infantry *   * *e tnne,and two frigates were available in the rersian Cult.The Prime Minister said that there were difficulties in moving-4 e  ~, a Aan nr North Africa tor the purpose of assistingArmy units from Aden or NortjA and it might be morem maintaining order in the m ^ responsibility for thisSmv There seled to be no reason why they should not do this if^&apos;miSS^artt a sufficient number of frigates with asuitable complement of Marines.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultationwith the Chiefs of Staff, whether the Navy could assumeexclusive responsibility for assisting in maintaining law andorder in those territories in the Persian Gulf whose stabilitywas essential to the maintenance of oil supplies for theCommonwealth.Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Whitsun recess from 18thto 29th May.49992 1 b 2
4Parliament.Remunerationof Members.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 32ndConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that it was now evident that, ifthe Government took no action to improve the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament, the Opposition would be less co-operative inthe handling of business in the House of Commons and Governmentbusiness there might be obstructed. For this reason he was reluctantto take a wholly negative line on their suggestion that there might besome form of independent enquiry into this question. It was unlikelythat this suggestion would be publicly pressed until after the Whitsunrecess. He proposed, before then, to submit to the Cabinet hisconsidered recommendations on it. Meanwhile, he would takeinformal soundings among Government supporters on this andother aspects of the problem.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Automation.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 34thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a draft statement of theGovernment&apos;s attitude towards automation which the Prime Ministerproposed to make in reply to Questions in Parliament that afternoon.The Minister of Labour said that a conference of leading tradeunionists, which had been held in York on the previous day inconnection with the current dispute at the Standard Motor Company&apos;sfactory, had adopted a generally constructive and helpful approachtowards the problems of automation. It would, however, bepremature at this stage to forecast what the ultimate attitude of thetrade union movement would be. Meanwhile, it was clear that theincreasing development of automation would give rise to problemswhich would be of direct concern to the Government. Someindustrial workers would be faced, as a result of automation, withfinancial losses which they could not have foreseen. The Departmentsconcerned should now consider whether any adjustments could bemade in the structure of the national insurance system or of the socialservices which would afford some compensation for losses due to thedisturbance of normal employment on this account. On the otherhand, the recent ruling of the National Insurance Commissioner thatshort-time workers were entitled to unemployment benefit for daysof enforced idleness was likely to impair the mobility of labour; andurgent consideration should be given to the possibility of taking stepsto reverse or modify this ruling. It was therefore desirable that theofficial Committee proposed in paragraph 8 of CP. (56) 113 shouldbe set up as soon as possible. He no longer thought it necessarythat a Junior Minister should preside over this Committee.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to certain amendments agreed in theirdiscussion, the draft statement on automation which thePrime Minister proposed to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon.(2) Approved the proposal in paragraph 8 of CP. (56) 113 thatan official Committee should be set up to promote andco-ordinate action which the Government might need totake in connection with automation.GovernmentExpenditure.Economies.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 4thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that some progresswas being made in the search for economies towards the total savingof  100 millions which he wished to secure in the current financialyear. He thought it advisable that as many as possible of theeconomies should be announced simultaneously, and he was hopingto make such an announcement towards the end of June. Hetherefore suggested that a review of the progress so far made shouldbe held before the Whitsun recess, and he hoped that the Prime
5CM. 35 (56)Minister would preside over a small meeting of Ministers for thispurpose.In discussion it was pointed out that the scope for immediatefurther economies in the social services was limited and that, if cutscould be made in expenditure on supply and development for defencepurposes, labour and materials could be diverted to other purposeswhich would bring greater benefit to the national economy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a small Committeeof Ministers (Lord Privy Seal, Chancellor of theExchequer, Minister of Defence and Minister of Supply)to review the progress made towards the reduction ofGovernment expenditure in the current financial year.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 23rdConclusions,Minute 7.)Wages andPrices.499927. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the next stage in the series ofdiscussions with representatives of industry, of the trade unions andof the nationalised industries on the problem of rising prices.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were no signsof any reduction in the pressure for increased wages. It was,however, demonstrable that the increase in the general level of wageshad outstripped the increase in prices, and that prices were unlikelyto advance over the next few months sufficiently to close the wholeof the existing gap. This gave the Government an opportunity to callon both sides of industry for their co-operation in securing a periodof stability in wages and prices. He proposed that, at the meetingwith representatives of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) thatafternoon, Ministers should give a firm lead in asking organisedlabour to show moderation in its wage demands over the next twelvemonths. The argument in support of this appeal was summarisedin Appendix I of CP. (56) 118. He proposed that Ministers shouldspeak on these lines at their meeting with the T.U.C. representatives.In discussion of the text of the statement annexed to CP. (56) 118the following points were raised:  (a) In paragraph 4 of the draft it was stated that the effect ofprice increases already announced &quot; or in prospect&quot; was likely toinvolve an increase of a little over 2\ points in the new cost-of-livingindex in 1956. It was agreed that, in place of the words &quot; in prospect &quot;there should be inserted a more specific reference to price increaseswhich would form part of further Government economies or wouldresult from wage increases already granted.(h) It was agreed that paragraph 5 of the draft statement shouldbe amended to read: &quot; The Government sees no reason to expectany further increase in the cost of living this year resulting from itsown decisions. Nor does it expect any increases above the levelstated resulting from actions of the Boards of the nationalisedindustries, unless of course there are further wage increases there.&quot;(c) It was agreed that the reference to price stability inparagraph 7 of the draft should be drafted in terms of preventingincreases in prices rather than in terms of keeping prices steady.Discussion then turned on the manner in which the Govern-ment&apos;s policy on prices should be announced. It was recognisedthat the representatives of the T.U.C. were unlikely to agree that astatement on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (56) 118 shouldbe incorporated in the communique to be issued after their meetingwith Ministers that afternoon. That communique would haveto be drawn in fairly general terms.   Ministers would, however, 1 b 3
6make it clear to the T.U.C. representatives at that meeting that theGovernment intended to make a policy statement on wages andprices and would explain the lines which this was likely to follow.The Prime Minister would then be free, if he so desired, to makethis policy statement in the speech which he was to make in Scotlandon 11th May. Alternatively, he might make a fairly brief referenceto this question in his speech and leave the full statement of policyto be issued separately thereafter. This point could be decided laterin the day, when the reactions of the T.U.C. representatives to thebroad lines of the statement were known.Discussion then turned on the question whether any referenceshould be made, in the discussions with the T.U.C. representatives,to the effect on the cost of living of a relaxation of the RentRestriction Acts. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that theGovernment would be lacking in frankness if they made no referenceto this problem. He would wish to say that rents represented theone remaining price distortion in the economy, which the Govern-ment would have to tackle in due course. He would, however, goon to say that, even if the Government decided to legislate on thissubject, it must be more than a year before the effects would beginto be felt in terms of an increase in the cost of living. This,therefore, was not a practical problem in relation to the presentconcept of a year&apos;s stability in wages and prices. The Minister ofHousing said that he would have preferred to avoid any referenceto the problem of rents in the forthcoming discussions with repre-sentatives of the T.U.C. If, however, it were thought unrealistic tosuppress all reference to this problem, he hoped that it would bedealt with on a hypothetical basis without any disclosure that theGovernment were contemplating early legislation. The Governmentshould, if possible, avoid arousing premature controversy on thisquestion: they should keep the initiative in their own hands.The Cabinet (1) Approved  the  draft  statement  on prices  annexed toCP. (56) 118 subject to the amendments noted inparagraphs (a) to (c) above.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, together with the LordPrivy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour, would endeavour at their meetingthat afternoon to secure the co-operation of the T.U.C.in carrying through a policy on the lines indicated in thatstatement.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider further,in the light of this meeting with representatives of theT.U.C, the form and manner in which this policy couldbest be presented to the public.United States 8.   The President of the Board of Trade said that the UnitedAid States Government proposed to extend to Indonesia and Burma the(Previous        arrangement previously adopted for Pakistan under which aid wasReference:      provided by the delivery of surplus United States raw cotton to aC.C. (55) 25th   manufacturing country which supplied a corresponding quantity ofConclusions,    cotton goods to the country selected for the aid.   The delivery ofMinute 9.) &apos;    the raw material was subject to the discriminatory condition, againstwhich we had consistently protested, that half of it should be carriedin American ships. On the other hand, it would be of great benefitto the United Kingdom cotton industry if they were allowed tocompete for the new business arising from aid to Burma and Indonesiaand the additional business remaining available under aid to Pakistan,which might amount to nearly $10 millions in all. If they were unableto do so, the trade would be taken up by their competitors in Europe.
7CM. 35 (56)The Minister of Transport said that he recognised the strengthof the case for allowing the cotton industry to compete for the businessnow in view. This would, however, be more acceptable to theshipping industry if it could be said that it represented no abandon-ment of the principle of resistance to the discriminatory shippingcondition in itself, and that each transaction would continue to beconsidered on its merits.The point was made in discussion that the growing disquiet ofshipowners over the use of &quot; flags of convenience,&quot; a matter on whichthe interests of United Kingdom and American ship-owners wereidentical, might provide the basis for a general discussion with theUnited States Government of shipping problems in which the twocountries had a common interest, including the 50 per cent, shippingcondition for aid cargoes.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, without setting further precedents for the future,the United Kingdom cotton industry should be allowedthe opportunity of competing for export business undertriangular aid transactions between the United States andBurma and Indonesia respectively, together with furtherbusiness of this kind arising in connection with aid toPakistan.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Transport, whether the time might beopportune for an early approach to the United StatesGovernment on shipping problems of common interest tothe two countries.East-WestTrade.(PreviousReferences:CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 7 andCM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Foreign Secretary said that in the recent discussionswhich he had held in Paris with the United States Secretary of Stateno very constructive response had been made to our proposals forrelaxing the restrictions on trade with China. The Americans werenot prepared to go further than to agree to the greater use of the&quot; exceptions procedure &quot; and had pressed us to agree, in return, tothe reimposition of the embargo on the export of copper wire to theSoviet Union. They had, however, indicated that if the latter pointwere accepted thev would be ready to consider some compensatingadjustment in the Soviet list. This attitude was far from satisfactory,and it was for consideration whether we should now pursue the matterin the Co-ordinating Committee for East-West Trade in Paris. Hedid not recommend that we should take this course, at any rate whileCongress was still in session. The only alternative open to us wasto extend the use of the &quot; exceptions procedure &quot; unilaterally.The President of the Board of Trade said that he preferred thisalternative course. Provided the proposed exports were needed forpeaceful purposes and would not contribute to the military strengthof the recipient, the exceptional circumstances in which reasonableexports were permissible were not further defined. He recommendedthat we should make the fullest use of the &quot; exceptions procedure &quot;and should inform both the United States Government and Britishindustry that this was our intention. Malaya and other interestedColonial Governments should also be informed and we should makeit clear that, in determining what constituted reasonable exports, theinterests of the Colonies would be taken into account.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The continued control oyer trade with China, for which weshared the responsibility, was beginning to jeopardise the maintenanceof satisfactory relations with those Colonies which were most closelyinterested in this trade.  For Malaya, the significance of the trade
8with China in rubber was at present only psychological, for she couldsell all the rubber she had. Hong Kong&apos;s interests were moreseriously affected for, as a result of strategic controls, her trade withChina had dropped to one-tenth of its previous level.(b) United States experts believed that the Soviet programme ofguided missiles was dependent on imports of copper wire. Our ownexperts took a different view. The Soviet Union obtained throughimports 40,000 tons of copper wire last year and might obtain 60,000tons this year. The attention of the United States Government shouldbe drawn to the relative insignificance of these figures in comparisonwith a domestic production of copper in Russia of nearly 500,000 tonsa year, and consumption in the United States of over 1 million tons.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in maintaining a desirable level of trade withChina, we should rely on an extended use of the&quot; exceptions procedure &quot; on the lines proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade.(2) Agreed that full account should be taken of the interests ofColonial territories in operating the &quot; exceptionsprocedure.&quot;(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence and the President of the Boardof Trade, a considered statement of our reasons forrejecting the United States proposal for the reinstatementof the embargo on the export of copper wire to the SovietUnion.(4) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment of the foregoing decisions and to make asuitable announcement in Parliament on the futureadministration of control over the China trade.Singapore.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 33rdConclusions.)10. The Colonial Secretary said that in the Conference onconstitutional development in Singapore the point of breakdown hadnot yet been reached. The Singapore Delegation had made somefurther concessions. They had agreed that the word &quot; independence &quot;should not be included in the title of the legislation incorporating theirconstitutional proposals, though they had made few changes in thenature of those proposals. They had agreed that the United Kingdomrepresentatives should have the majority vote in the proposed Defenceand Security Council. They were not, however, willing to agree thatthe Governor should have reserve powers sufficient to enable himto exercise effective control over internal security in normal times:in this matter they still wished to deny to him power to intervenein any circumstances short of an extreme emergency justifying thesuspension of the Constitution. Discussions were continuing, but itwas possible that the Conference would break down early in thefollowing week.The Cabinet were informed that, in the event of a breakdown,the Governments of Australia and New Zealand would be willing tolend their public support to the attitude which the United Kingdomhad taken in the Conference. For this purpose, however, they wishedto know in advance how the United Kingdom Government proposedto present their case to public opinion. Therefore, when it was knownon what point the Conference was likely to break down, no timeshould be lost in preparing a draft of the statement to be made onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government and communicating thisto the Governments of Australia and New Zealand.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.
9CM. 35 (56)(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for the Common-wealth Relations Office to be kept in touch with the furtherprogress of the Conference so that the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand might be informed, at theearliest possible moment, of the lines of the statementwhich the United Kingdom Government were likely tomake on the results of the Conference.The President of the Board of Trade said that agreement(Previ0US was now in sight in the tariff negotiations whu^hadtaen m progressReference- at Geneva since January.   In return tor reductions in unitedCM (56)4th Kingdom tariffs on machinery, motor cars, aircraft paper and minorConclusion items we stood to gain useful concessions from the United States,Concius ons.

Germany and ^j^^ ^ fey                States includedreductions in their tariffs on motor cars aircraft, textile and leathermaterials and various minor but useful items. The scope of the gotiafe^^ by the fact that the United States werepSded from reducing their tariff this year by more than 15 percent but an agreement on the basis he had outlined would^ be ofsome marginal advantage to us. It would be within the authorityrivSn by fhe Cabinet in January. We had conceded virtually noreductions in the tariffs on agricultural products.The proposed reduction in the duty on paper should have noappreciable effect on the balance of payments. Newsprint, which wasK-free, accounted for half our total imports of paper. Of heremainder, imports from Sweden, Norway and Finland were of theorder of  10 millions and we had secured from these countries tariffconcessions covering a comparable value of trade.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,10th May, 1956.
