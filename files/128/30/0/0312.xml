3CM. 88 (56)Official Cars.(PreviousReference :C.C. (51) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in view of the currentrestrictions on oil consumption, it would be appropriate thatMinisters, other than those requiring police protection, should usesmaller cars, and that drastic reductions should be made in thenumber of cars permanently allocated from the central pool for theuse of Junior Ministers and officials. Detailed arrangements for thispurpose would be discussed between the Treasury and the Ministerof Works.In discussion it was suggested that the same principle should beapplied to the use of cars by Service Departments.The Cabinet-Approved in principle these proposals for restricting the useof official cars, and invited the Lord Privy Seal to approveon their behalf detailed instructions for giving effect to them.Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 87thConclusions.)2. The Cabinet had before them telegram No. 1406 from theForeign Secretary in New York, reporting his latest discussions withthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. It appeared from thistelegram that (i) the United Nations force would, by 5th December,have been built up to about 4,000 troops, to which would be added,in due course, two combat brigades with appropriate administrativetroops; (ii) as soon as the Anglo-French force had withdrawn, workwould begin on the clearance of the section of the Suez Canal whichremained under Egyptian control; (iii) negotiations about the futurecontrol of the Canal were likely to be deferred until theAnglo-French force had been withdrawn, or at least until the datefor its final withdrawal had been fixed; but negotiations shouldproceed thereafter by direct contact between the Governments ofthe United Kingdom, France and Egypt on the basis of the genera!principles outlined in the Secretary-General&apos;s letter of 2nd Novemberto the Egyptian Foreign Minister; (iv) once a date for the withdrawalof the Anglo-French force had been fixed, the decision of the EgyptianGovernment to expel British nationals from Egypt might besuspended.The Foreign Secretary did not believe that we should obtainany greater satisfaction on the clearance of the Canal or its futurecontrol by deferring the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force. Itwas therefore necessary to consider how soon this withdrawal couldbe carried out without alienating that section of the Government&apos;ssupporters which was opposed to an unconditional withdrawal.In discussion the following points were made (a) The Foreign Secretary should return to London as soon aspossible. It was inexpedient that he should become involved infurther debate in the United Nations before he had discussed thesituation with his Cabinet colleagues. The Cabinet also needed hisadvice before a further statement of Government policy was made inParliament.(b) It would be helpful for the Cabinet to know the ultimate sizeand composition of the United Nations force, as envisaged by theSecretary-General. It was particularly unsatisfactory that theCanadian contingent, which was originally to have been part of thisforce, appeared to have been excluded under pressure from Egypt.(c) It would be difficult politically for the Government toconvince their supporters in the House of Commons that theAnglo-French force should be withdrawn without reference to theclearance of the Canal. We should therefore endeavour to reachagreement in the United Nations on the preparation of a phasedtimetable, in which the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force and
4the clearance of the Canal would proceed simultaneously, althoughneither would be expressed as conditional on the other.(d) It was also important politically that, although thewithdrawal of the Anglo-French force could not be made conditionalupon a settlement of the future regime of the Canal, the proposednegotiations on this subject should proceed as rapidly as possible onthe basis of the Secretary-General&apos;s letter of 2nd November to theEgyptian Foreign Minister, which appeared to be broadly comparablewith the six principles approved by the Security Council on13th October.(e) The threatened expulsion of British subjects from Egyptwould be strongly resented by public opinion in this country. Itappeared to involve a breach of the Geneva Conventions, and, subjectto verification of the legal position, should be vigorously challengedon this ground. The Foreign Secretary should be asked whether, inhis view, it would be wise to table a resolution in the United Nationsinviting the General Assembly to condemn this action of the EgyptianGovernment.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to convey to the ForeignSecretary in New York a telegram of guidance in thegeneral sense of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor legal advice to be obtained on the question whetherwe could claim that the proposed expulsion of Britishsubjects from Egypt constituted a breach of the GenevaConventions.Government 3.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, at the request of the PrimePublicity.       Minister,   the   Postmaster-General   had   agreed   to undertakeresponsibilities in connection with the co-ordination of Governmentpublicity, particularly in connection with the Suez Canal situation.The Director-General of the Central Office of Information would betemporarily seconded to assist him in this task.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,27th November, 1956.
