3CM. 49 (56)Police Pay.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (56) 173) on the question of giving retrospective effectto pay awards for the police. They also had before them a furthermemorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. (56) 174) covering thereport of a committee of officials on the extent to which repercussionsmight be expected in other fields of public service if the claims of thepolice were conceded.The Home Secretary said that there was widespread sympathy,especially among Government supporters, for this claim by the police.He had already announced in the House of Commons that theGovernment were exploring the possibility of introducing legislationto enable future pay awards to be made retrospective. He was nowsatisfied that there would be no grounds for affording similar treatmentto pensions and allowances if retrospection were to be accorded tothe police and that any immediate repercussions in regard to teachers&apos;salaries would be avoided if the introduction of the legislation werepostponed until after 1st October. He therefore sought authority toinform the House that the Government had completed theirconsideration of the matter and had decided to introduce the necessarylegislation to enable any future pay awards to the police to be maderetrospective to any date which might be agreed between thenegotiating bodies or settled by arbitration.There remained the question of retrospection for the pay awardmade in December last. There was no case on merits for notconceding this claim, which would cost about  2 millions, sharedequally between the Government and the local authorities. Owingto a misreading of the statute, earlier pay awards had been maderetrospective on numerous occasions and the provision in the Actwhich made this illegal had only recently been brought to light. Ifthe arbitrators&apos; decision that the latest award should be maderetrospective were not put into effect, the police would take the viewthat they were being made the victims of a legal technicality andthey would have support in this attitude. In view of this herecommended that he should inform the House that the Governmentwould discuss with the local authorities (on whom half the cost wouldfall) whether a provision could be included in the proposed legislationto cover the payment of the arbitrators&apos; last award.The Minister of Labour said that the granting of retrospection tothe police was unlikely to have any significant repercussions in regardto pay awards in industry. The Industrial Disputes Tribunal andsimilar bodies already had permissive powers to make pay awardsretrospective when they saw fit and frequently made use of thesepowers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the casefor taking the necessary powers to make pay awards for the policeretrospective in future and he saw no alternative but to acceptthe need to carry out the arbitrators&apos; most recent award.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the views expressedby the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary to make a further statementin the House of Commons on the question of police pay inthe terms which he had outlined.National HealthService.Remuneration f Doctors.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 47thConclusions,Minute 13.)50203-2. The Cabinet had before them the draft of a reply to theBritish Medical Association setting out the reasons for rejecting theirclaim for an increase in the remuneration of general practitioners andhospital medical staff.Subject to a minor amendment suggested in their discussion, theCabinet approved the terms of the proposed reply which stated thatin present circumstances the Ministers concerned would not feeljustified in considering any claim for a general increase ofremuneration and that they did not accept the premises on which theclaim had been based.-4 b 2
In further discussion the point was made that the relativeremuneration of doctors in different branches of the profession wasbecoming seriously out of balance. The holders of academic postsin the Universities and doctors in research institutions engaged onpreventive medicine were at a special disadvantage in comparisonwith consultants who qualified for merit awards. There was,however, little prospect of remedying this situation in the near future.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the amendment suggested in theirdiscussion, the terms of the proposed reply to the BritishMedical Association on the pay of medical staff under theNational Health Service.Australia.(PreviousReference:C.C. (55) 21stConclusions,Minute 5.)Trade Talks.3.   The President of the Board of Trade said that the proposalsput forward by the Australian Minister for Trade, Mr. J. McEwen,in the trade discussions now in progress, would have the effect ofbringing virtually to an end the system of contractual preferenceswhich, under the Ottawa Agreements, Australia accorded to exportsfrom the United Kingdom.     Mr. McEwen evidently wished toeliminate altogether the preferences which we now enjoyed in respectof capital goods and heavy engineering equipment.  Our exports ofthese products to Australia amounted to some  100 millions annually.He had indicated that he would be willing to continue to accord tocertain categories of our exports some limited and undefinedpreferential treatment, but this would not be on a contractual basis.In return for this, he was asking for a larger and more assured marketin the United Kingdom for Australian wheat on terms which wouldprovide full safeguards against variations in the subsidy accorded tohome-produced wheat and cheap foreign wheat.   He would wish usto take powers which would make it mandatory to impose counter-vailing action against foreign wheat when the need arose.   He hadbeen informed that proposals on these lines could not form the basisof an agreement which would be satisfactory to us.   He had pointedout that it would remain open to us to press in further negotiationsfor the retention of some remnant of the contractual preferencesystem, but, in view of the direction which Australian policy was nowtaking, little confidence could be placed in this.The Cabinet considered the situation arising from these talks. Ithad been foreseen that the Australians might press for extensivemodifications in the preference system, but the Australian PrimeMinister had himself given no indication that they would propose tobring it virtually to an end. There was reason to believe thatMr. McEwen was concerned primarily to secure for himself thewidest possible margin of latittide in regard to the preference systemin order to be able the more effectively to negotiate benefits forAustralian trade. It might therefore still be possible to reachagreement on a compromise basis which would safeguard some ofour interests. It was doubtful whether Australia would wish toassume responsibility, within the Commonwealth, for taking thelead in destroying the structure of the Ottawa Agreements. Therewas, however, no doubt that we should have to accept very substantialreductions in the preferences in Australia which we had hithertoenjoyed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Australia&apos;s changedattitude to the preference system reflected the fact that the UnitedKingdom was no longer able to fulfil her traditional role of providingthe capital needed for the industrial development of the Common-wealth. It would be open to Australia to bring the preference systemto an end simply by giving six months&apos; notice.  The preferences were
5CM. 49 (56)still of great value to us and it was important that we should retainwhat preferences we could. It would now be necessary, however,to re-examine, in the light of the Australian attitude, the relativeimportance and future prospects of our trade with Australia and theCommonwealth, and with Europe and other overseas markets. Timewould be necessary for this and there was no possibility of reachingfinal agreement with the Australians in the course of the presentdiscussions. Mr. Menzies&apos; attention should be drawn to theconsequences which the Australian proposals would have for us andhe should be asked to allow time for reflection before taking a stepwhich would have the effect of disrupting the main economic linkbetween the countries of the Commonwealth. Talks between officialsmight then be held towards the end of the year.There was general agreement in the Cabinet with the coursewhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer had outlined.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Commonwealth Secretaryand the President of the Board of Trade, to arrange for theissues raised by the Australian trade proposals to bediscussed further with the Prime Minister of Australia onthe lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Europe.EconomicCo-operation.(PreviousReferences:CM. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 9, andCM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 11.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C.P. (56) 171) on the liberalisation oftrade in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.fc.E.C.) and a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade (C.P. (56) 172) suggestinghow the pressure for tariff reductions might be handled at theforthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the Organisation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the targets set by theCouncil of the O.E.E.C. in January, 1955, for the removal ofquantitative restrictions on imports from member countries hadlargely been achieved, though the United Kingdom had so far onlymanaged to liberalise 85 per cent, of the total imports on privateaccount compared with the obligation to liberalise 90 per cent. Thisdefault had been justified hitherto owing to balance of paymentsdifficulties, but there had been growing criticism of our failure inthis respect. At the forthcoming Ministerial meeting of theOrganisation there was likely to be strong pressure for tariffreductions. While it could be argued that a round of tariffnegotiations had only recently been completed under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, a purely negative attitude to thisproposal would leave the initiative with the Messina Powers; and,if a common market were to be established by these Powers, weshould be faced with serious problems of commercial policy if westood outside it. After discussing the matter with the President ofthe Board of Trade, he proposed that the United Kingdomrepresentatives should agree at the forthcoming Ministerial Meetingto the necessary further liberalisation of trade on private accountto meet the target set by the Organisation. This would involveincreases in imports from Western Europe amounting to about 1-U millions. Further concessions would also be necessary onimports into the Colonies, which might double the total increase inour import costs. But, if our balance of payments positiondeteriorated, it would be possible to reimpose import restrictions.On the tariff question, time was required to consider the effectswhich the development of a common market by the Messina group50203 4 B 3
6would have on other member countries of O.E.E.C. It would beinappropriate, however, for the United Kingdom to take the initiativein proposing study of these effects, since it might be taken asforeshadowing a major move in our external economic policy. Muchfurther consideration would be required before any definite plancould be put forward. Arrangements had therefore been made forthe Secretary-General of the Organisation to prepare a proposal fora study covering the whole possible range of co-ordination andco-operation between O.E.E.C. and the Messina countries, including 4those methods of association of individual members of the  Organisation with members of the Messina common market asseemed appropriate. At an appropriate moment during the CouncilMeeting we should indicate our readiness to take part in such astudy.The Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequerfor handling the forthcoming discussions at the MinisterialMeeting of the Organisation for European EconomicCo-operation.Salaries of 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordLower Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 170)Judiciary.       recommending increases in the salaries of Metropolitan Magistratesand Sheriffs Substitute and of the holders of certain other judicialoffices.The Lord Chancellor said that he and the Secretary of State forScotland had felt obliged to submit this question to the Cabinetbecause they had been unable to reach agreement with the Chancellorof the Exchequer either on the amount of the increase to be made inthe salaries of Metropolitan Magistrates and Sheriffs Substitute oron the timing of the introduction of these salary increases. In theirview there was a strong case for early action. Formal representationsfor salary increases had been made on behalf of the various groupsconcerned on various dates between October, 1954, and March, 1955:a reply to those representations had been deferred pending the receiptof the report of the Royal Commission on Civil Service salaries;but, now that it had been decided that the increases recommendedfor the Civil Service in that report should be granted withretrospective effect from 1st April, it was very difficult for theGovernment to hold up corresponding action in favour of the holdersof these judicial offices. The salaries of most of these posts were fixedby statute and could not be increased without amending legislation.They therefore recommended that the Government should announcebefore the summer recess that they proposed to introduce thenecessary legislation for this purpose early in the forthcoming sessionand that the salary increases would operate retrospectively from thedate of the announcement.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned on the question of timing.Serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of making anannouncement on the lines suggested in the course of the next fewmonths. This would be a critical stage in the Government&apos;s effortto secure a period of stability in wages and prices. The nationalisedindustries had declared their intention to avoid price increases overthe coming months, and a corresponding statement of policy on thisquestion was about to be issued on behalf of private employers. Itwas important that nothing should be said at this stage which mightprejudice the effect which these statements might have in encouragingrestraint in the pursuit of claims for increased wages. It was onthis account that the Government were asking Members of
7CM. 49 (56)Parliament to show an example by accepting a delay in theimprovement of their remuneration. Junior Ministers, whose claimsfor increased salaries were much stronger than those which couldbe put forward in respect of these judicial offices, were also beingexpected to wait for a more favourable opportunity. The Cabinethad also decided that day (Minute 2 above) to reject an applicationfor an increase in the remuneration of doctors under the NationalHealth Service. In all these circumstances it would be preferablethat proposals for increasing these judicial salaries should bepostponed until the autumn.The Lord Chancellor said that he would have found it easierto justify such a delay if it had not been decided to proceed withthe increases in Civil Service salaries, with retrospective effect from1st April. The salaries of these judicial offices were closelycomparable with some of the Civil Service salaries which were nowbeing increased. The adjustment made in judicial salaries in 1952had been insufficient; and the holders of many of these offices werefinding that their net remuneration to-day was less than it had beenbefore the war. If no public announcement could be made beforeParliament rose for the summer recess, would it be possible for aleading representative of each of the groups concerned to be informedin confidence that it was the Government&apos;s intention to introducein the forthcoming session legislation to increase these salaries?The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the argumentsadvanced by the Lord Chancellor. He would find it very difficultto justify further delay in dealing with claims which, on their merits,were so strong. There was also serious practical difficulty in findingsuitable people to accept these offices at the present salaries.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to consider this question further in the lightof the views expressed in their discussion.6. The Prime Minister said that on 15th February the DefenceCommittee had agreed that if the prospective order from Germanyfor Centurion tanks did not materialise the Royal Ordnance Factory,Dalmuir, would have to be closed down. At that time, he had senta personal message to President Eisenhower asking for the views ofthe United States Government about the future supply of tanks toGermany. He wondered whether a further approach should be madeto the Americans. General Gruenther had recently informed himthat the United States had not made any special effort to obtain aGerman order for tanks; and, since the Americans had now obtaineda substantial order for aircraft from Germany, they might bedisposed to help in influencing the Germans to place the order fortheir additional tank requirements in this country.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was at present enough work to keep the RoyalOrdnance Factory, Dalmuir, in operation until September this year.(b) The Germans had been given about 1,000 M. 47 tanks bythe United States and they were understood to require a further2,000 tanks. There was no significant difference in price betweenthe British Centurion tank and the American M. 47 tank. In theinterests of standardisation, there was a strong case for persuadingthe Germans to equip with British tanks those of their units whichwould co-operate with the British forces in the Northern ArmyGroup.Export ofAnns.(PreviousReference:C-M. (56) 15thConclusions,Minute 5.)Germany.
8(c) The value of the German tank order would be between 60 and  80 millions. If obtained, it would represent a valuableexport order, since the import content of the materials used wassmall. On the other hand, there was a shortage of steel and ofskilled manpower in British industry; and, if the order were notforthcoming, the Royal Ordnance Factory at Dalmuir could be usedto produce other exports.(d) In his telegram No. 522 of 7th July H.M. Ambassador atBonn had advised against asking the Americans to put furtherpressure on the Germans about the placing of the order for theirtank requirements, since the German authorities would be likelyto resent such an intervention. The Ambassador had suggestedthat he should discuss the matter with the United States Ambassadorat Bonn and, at a meeting on 9th July, the Ministerial Committeeon Strategic Exports Policy had agreed with this proposal. It wouldbe preferable to await the outcome of these discussions before takingany further action. It had also been suggested that the Minister ofSupply might visit Germany to discuss the Centurion order in thecontext of arrangements for the supply of arms generally.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the arrangements summarised in paragraph id)above for handling the question of a German order forCenturion tanks.lndia- In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Indian(Previous Government wished to obtain additional supplies of Centurion tanksReference: in the current year, but their future requirements were unlikely toCM. (56) 9th be sufficient to justify the retention of additional capacity for tankConclusions, production.  Any such orders would be paid for out of India&apos;sMinute 2.) sterling balances and there would therefore be little benefit instimulating further Indian orders.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the point made in discussion about furtherorders for tanks from India.Cyprus. 7   jne prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting(Previous        on the previous day, he had reflected further on the terms of theReference:      statement on Cyprus which he was to make in the House of CommonsCM. (56) 48th  that afternoon.   It seemed to him that the fifth paragraph of theConclusions,    draft which the Cabinet had approved was open to some risk ofMinute 7.)       misunderstanding.  He would prefer that it should be re-worded asfollows: &quot; The House will readily understand the risks which wouldbe involved if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to attempt unilaterallyto take such steps.   As it has proved impossible to obtain inter-national agreement in this matter, which so clearly contains the seedsof grave danger to the whole future of the Eastern Mediterranean,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have to accept that for the presentprogress by this means cannot be realised.&quot;Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theamended wording proposed by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister and the Lord President, in thestatements on Cyprus which they were to make in the twoHouses of Parliament that afternoon, to adopt, in place ofthe fifth paragraph of the draft annexed to CP. (56) 161,the amended wording noted above.

He therefore suggested that, in hisreply to a Parliamentary Question that afternoon, the Prime Ministershould ir.clude a reference to the possibility of control beingestablished as part of such a comprehensive disarmament agreement.This would be in line with the views of the United States Governmentwho wanted to keep any limitation of nuclear weapons tests withinsuch a general agreement.In discussion of the terms of a draft reply proposed by theForeign Secretary, it was suggested that the wording used in thestatement by the Prime Minister on 7th June, 1956, might be repeated.That statement had indicated the Government&apos;s willingness to discussmethods of regulating and limiting test explosions which took accountof the need to safeguard the essential defence requirements of theUnited Kingdom.The Cabinet Agreed that the Prime Minister should reply to theParliamentary Question that afternoon about the control ofnuclear weapons tests on the lines indicated in thediscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,12th July, 1956.
