2Suez Canal The Lord Privy Seal welcomed the Foreign Secretary on his(Previous return from New York and expressed the Cabinet&apos;s appreciation ofReference: tne skill with which he had presented the British case at the GeneralCM. (56) 89th Assembly of the United Nations.Conclusions. The Foreign Secretary said that the atmosphere in the UnitedMinute 2.) Nations had shown some improvement in the last few days. But itwas clear that the Assembly would continue to debate the Suezsituation at intervals and would maintain their pressure for the earlywithdrawal of the Anglo-French force. On this question the Cabinetshould take their decision in the light of the position established inhis latest discussions with the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and members of the United States Government. Thesediscussions had shown that (i) The United Nations force wouldreach a figure of about 4,000 men in the near future, and wouldthereafter be built up to a strength of two combat brigades; (ii) TheSecretary-General appeared to be determined that clearance of theSuez Canal should be started as rapidly as possible. He hadappointed General Lucius Clay and General Wheeler to takeexecutive charge of the operation, and had retained Mr. McCloyas his chief adviser for this purpose. He intended to despatch surveyteams to plan the clearance in the near future; and he was favourablydisposed in principle to the employment of Anglo-French personnel,provided they were civilians. On the other hand, it was not whollyclear how far he would feel able to take this action in advance of afirm undertaking to withdraw the Anglo-French force; (iii) On thefuture administration of the Canal the Egyptian Government hadnow declared their willingness to negotiate on the basis of theSecretary-General&apos;s letter of 24th October, which was designed togive effect to the six principles adopted by the Security Council on13th October. It was very doubtful whether any alternative approachto this problem would be more profitable; (iv) In the recent debatesin the General Assembly no progress had been made towards acomprehensive settlement of the problems of the Middle East. Thefunctions of the United Nations force were defined by reference to theGeneral Assembly&apos;s resolutions of 2nd, 5th and 7th November, ofwhich only the resolution of 2nd November referred, in its preamble,to the importance of a settlement of the Israel-Arab dispute;(v) Although public opinion in New York was more friendly to theUnited Kingdom than official opinion in Washington, the withdrawalof the Anglo-French force remained, in the eyes of the United StatesGovernment, a condition precedent to any resumption of cordialrelations between the United Kingdom and the United States.The Foreign Secretary said that in his judgment the economicconsiderations were now even more important than the political. Wecould probably sustain our position in the United Nations for threeor four weeks; but, so far from gaining anything by deferring awithdrawal of the Anglo-French force which we could, if we wished,complete within the next fortnight, we should thereby risk losing thegood will of public opinion, which in all countries wished the clearanceof the Canal to proceed as rapidly as possible. On the other hand,if we withdrew the Anglo-French force as rapidly as was practicable,we should regain the sympathy of the United States Government;we should be better placed to ask for their support in any economicmeasures which we might need to take; and we should have removed,as far as lay within our power, all impediments to the furtherclearance of the Canal. But we could not properly maintain (andshould not seek to do so) that our withdrawal of the Anglo-Frenchforce was dependent on a firm guarantee that clearance of the Canalwould proceed forthwith. It was unlikely that the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations would be either able or willing to give such aguarantee; and it would be preferable that we should base our actionon our previous undertaking that the Anglo-French force would bewithdrawn as soon as its place was taken by an effective UnitedNations force, which was competent to carry out the functionsassigned to it by the General Assembly.  This point would shortly
3CM. 90 (56)be reached, and it would therefore be possible for the Cabinet, if theyagreed, to authorise the withdrawal of the Anglo-French force, whileemphasising that this action was based on our confident expectationthat rapid progress would now be made by the United Nationstowards the clearance of the Canal, an agreement about itssatisfactory administration thereafter, and a comprehensivesettlement of the long-term problems of the Middle East.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be necessaryto announce, early in the following week, the losses of gold anddollars which we had sustained during November. This statementwould reveal a very serious drain on the reserves and would be aconsiderable shock both to public opinion in this country and tointernational confidence in sterling. It was therefore important thatwe should be able to announce at the same time that we were takingaction to reinforce the reserves both by recourse to the InternationalMonetary Fund and in other ways. For this purpose the good will ofthe United States Government was necessary; and it was evident thatthis good will could not be obtained without an immediate andunconditional undertaking to withdraw the Anglo-French force fromPort Said. He therefore favoured a prompt announcement of ourintention to withdraw this force, justifying this action on the groundthat we had now achieved the purpose for which we had originallylaunched the Anglo-French military operation against Egypt and thatwe were content to leave to the United Nations, backed by the UnitedStates, the responsibility, which the General Assembly could now bedeemed to have accepted, for settling the problems of the MiddleEast.In discussion there was general agreement that, while action onthese lines might be unavoidable, it would not easily be accepted by aconsiderable body of opinion among the Government&apos;s supportersunless the following conditions were fulfilled. First, we must bereasonably sure that the United Nations force would be competentto discharge the tasks which the United Nations had accepted. Aforce of about 4,000 men, to be increased to a total of two combatbrigades, could perhaps be regarded as effective for this purpose,particularly in the light of the statement by the Secretary-Generalthat &quot; in terms of potential effectiveness in performing its mission, itmust be rated as equivalent to a substantially larger military body.&quot;Secondly, some action towards clearance of the remainder of theCanal must be seen to have begun before the withdrawal of theAnglo-French force was complete. Thirdly, we must be satisfiedthat, even after our troops had been withdrawn, the threatenedeviction of British nationals from Egypt would be suspended andadequate protection for them would be secured. Fourthly, we musthave reason to expect that, as soon as we announced a firm decisionto withdraw the Anglo-French force, the response from the UnitedStates Government would be immediate, and the authority of theUnited States would be put unreservedly behind the United Nationsin achieving a comprehensive settlement of the problems of theMiddle East.In further discussion the view was expressed that the Govern-ment might still be able to extract some further advantage from thepresent situation. Reports from various sources continued to suggestthat the position of the Egyptian Government was deteriorating andthat the economic situation in Egypt was becoming increasinglyprecarious. Moreover, public opinion, both in the United Kingdomand in many parts of the Commonwealth, appeared to be becomingdaily more favourable to the Government. It would be unwise,therefore, to withdraw prematurely from Egypt if, by maintaining ourhold upon Port Said for a little longer, we might compel both theUnited Nations and the United States to give us firm guarantees thatour objectives, in terms of clearance of the Canal, its internationaladministration thereafter, and long-term settlement of the problemsof the Middle East, would in fact be achieved.
4It was argued, on the other hand, that these considerations hadto be weighed against the economic consequences which might resultfrom our continuing to defy the United Nations and to remainestranged from the United States. We had by now exploited to thefull the value of our occupation of Port Said as a factor innegotiation, and our ability to bargain further with the UnitedNations would be considerably weakened if, by the time it becamenecessary to publish the loss sustained by the reserves duringNovember, we had not obtained the active support of the United ^)States for the measures which we should have to take to sustain thestrength of sterling.The Lord Privy Seal said that it appeared to be the preponderantview of the Cabinet that we should announce, in the next few days,that we were now prepared to withdraw the Anglo-French forcefrom Port Said as rapidly as possible, in the faith that the UnitedNations had now accepted responsibility for securing the objectivesfor which we had originally begun military operations against Egypt.It would, however, be necessary to secure the agreement of theFrench Government to this proposal and to take such steps as timeallowed to secure United States and Commonwealth support foraction on these lines.The Cabinet - (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the light of their discussion,to consult the French Government about the course ofpolicy which should now be followed.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th November, 1956.
