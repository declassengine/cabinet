3CM. 46 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.On 3rd July there would be a debate on the economic situationwith special reference to the difficulties which were being experiencedby the motor industry. The Government spokesmen in this debatewould be the Chancellor of the Exchequer and either the Presidentof the Board of Trade or the Minister of Labour.Germany.Support Costs.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 45thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Minister of Defence said that the German Governmenthad now agreed to make in the coming year a contribution of 34 millions towards the cost of British forces in Germany. Newsof this agreement had already reached the Press in Bonn, and hesought authority to announce it in the House of Commons on thefollowing day.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Defence to announce in theHouse of Commons on the following day, after consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, the agreement reached withthe German Government on their contribution towards thecost of British forces in Germany.Cyprus. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that speculations about the(Previous current negotiations on the Cyprus question had given rise toReference: discontent among a certain section of Government supporters aboutC.M. (56) 45th the way in which the Government were handling this question. ThereConclusions, was also a more widespread feeling of anxiety on this question inMinute 1.)       the Party.  Some of this was attributable to a misconception of therespective functions of the Executive and the legislature in respectof international negotiations.After discussion it was agreed that the Lord Privy Seal shouldexplain to a meeting of the 1922 Committee that evening theresponsibilities of the Government in relation to internationalnegotiations.Aden.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C.P. (56) 153) recommending that the AdenProtectorate Order, 1937, should be amended by Order in Councilin order to enable the Governor to deport undesirable natives of theColony or the Protectorate.The Colonial Secretary said that since his memorandum wascirculated he had discussed the matter further with the Attorney-General and they were now seeking an alternative means of dealingwith the problem which would be less likely to give rise tointernational difficulties. He would like further time in which topursue these consultations.The Prime Minister said that it was important that we shouldmaintain sufficient military strength at Aden to Command respectthere. The local levies and troops were not sufficient for this purposeand urgent consideration should now be given to the stationing of afull battalion at Aden.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider further, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, alternative means of giving additional authority50203 1 b 2
4to the Governor of Aden to enable him to deal withtrouble makers in the Colony and Protectorate.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider whether a fullBritish battalion could be stationed at Aden.InternationalTin Council.(PreviousReference:C.C. (53) 65thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary and the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 154)on the question of diplomatic immunity for the International TinCouncil and its employees.The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet had agreed twoyears earlier that there would be great advantage in having theheadquarters of this body in London. They had recognised that, ifit were established here, its funds and operations would need to haveimmunity from United Kingdom taxation. They had, however,asked that any attempt to secure tax exemption for employees ofthe Council should be resisted. Our attitude on this point had beenmade plain in the negotiations leading up to the International TinAgreement; but the other parties to the Agreement had not beenwilling to accept it. In view of the immunity already enjoyed by theforeign employees of the International Sugar and Wheat Councils,it would be difficult to sustain a decision to refuse immunity to theforeign employees of the Tin Council. It was therefore proposedthat this point should now be conceded.The Cabinet agreed that, in view of the advantages of havingthe headquarters of this organisation in London, diplomaticimmunities should be extended to it and to the members of its staffas proposed in CP. (56) 154.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out in paragraph 16 ofCP. (56) 154.NationalInsurance:UnemploymentBenefit.(PreviousReferences:CM. (56) 35thConclusions,Minute 5, andCM. (56) 41stConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Pensions (CP. (56) 151)discussing whether early action should be taken to obtain a modifica-tion of the recent ruling of the National Insurance Commissioneron the entitlement of short-time workers to unemployment benefit.The Minister of Labour said that the Commissioner&apos;s decisionhad created an apparent anomaly in the case of the higher-paidworkers in the engineering industry who, although normally workinga five-day week, were held to be entitled to two days&apos; unemploymentbenefit in a week in which their working week was reduced to fourdays. Nevertheless, it might be inexpedient to take early actionto secure a reversal of this ruling. The payment of unemploymentbenefit in cases of short-time working was necessary to meet forexample the needs of lower-paid cotton workers who might beworking a three-day week. At present the ruling was having only amarginal effect on the mobility of labour in the engineering industry.Appeals which would govern the matter in relation to some 2\ millionworkers had still to be heard. It appeared, moreover, that legislationwould be necessary if the ruling were to be reversed. The Ministerof Pensions and he had therefore come to the conclusion that theright course would be to review the matter in the autumn in the lightof developments in the meantime and to consider then whether aclause to regulate this matter should be included in the NationalInsurance Bill which it was hoped would find a place in the legislativeprogramme for next session.
5CM. 46 (56)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Commissioner&apos;sdecision had revealed an important defect in the law. The dangercould be foreseen that, in certain circumstances, the NationalInsurance Fund might be called upon to finance the working of evena three-day week over a lengthy period in the engineering industry.He accepted the need to defer a decision on the question whetheramending legislation should be introduced but he hoped that thedrafting of the legislation would be put in hand without delay.The Minister of Pensions said that legislation might not provenecessary if it were desired to secure a modification of theCommissioner&apos;s ruling only in regard to workers whose agreementprovided for a five-day week. It might be possible to deal with thispoint by revision of the regulations.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 13 of C.P. (56) 151.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to arrange, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour, for the necessary prepara-tions to be made, without publicity, to enable action onthis matter to be taken promptly if it were authorisedby a subsequent decision of the Cabinet.The White FishSubsidy.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 45thConclusions.Minute 12.)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C.P. (56) 158) covering his proposals for a settlementof the various questions aifecting the future of the white fish subsidy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toagree to an average daily rate of subsidy of about  17 for steamtrawlers for the forthcoming year. This would concede nearlythree-quarters of the increase for which the trawler owners hadasked and it would involve an increase in the total cost of the subsidyfrom  2   3 millions this year to about  3 millions next year. It wouldmean that about 120 steam trawlers would leave the fishing industryduring the course of the year. He was also prepared to agree to anextension of the subsidy to 1962 and to combine this with anannouncement that the Government had it in mind to introducelegislation at the appropriate time to provide some financial assistanceout of the funds already authorised by the White Fish and HerringIndustries Act, 1953, for the conversion of coal-burning vessels tooil burning. He saw no justification, however, for restoring the cutwhich had been made at the beginning of the year in the subsidy toinshore fishermen.The Minister of Agriculture said that he was content with theseproposals with regard to the amounts of subsidy to be paid for theforthcoming year. He hoped, however, that agreement could bereached on an extension of the subsidy to 1963 as the grant and loanschemes would come to an end in that year and it would beconvenient if the grant, loan and subsidy arrangements were toterminate at the same time. This could be achieved by providingin the forthcoming legislation, which would be necessary inconnection with the subsidy, that the subsidy should be continuedin the final two years to 1963 by statutory instrument subject toaffirmative resolution.The point was made in discussion that it was in the nationalinterest that the trawler fleet should be modernised as rapidly aspossible. The Minister of Defence undertook to consider whatfurther shipyard capacity might become available for the buildingof motor trawlers as a result of adjustments in naval needs whichmight emerge from the current review of defence policy.
6The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals to govern the payment of the whitefish subsidy for the forthcoming year summarised inCP. (56) 158.(2) Agreed that the forthcoming legislation concerning the whitefish subsidy should contain provision for the extensionof the subsidy until 1963 by statutory instrument subjectto affirmative resolution for the two final years of theperiod.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Agriculture, what shipyard facilitiesmight be released from Admiralty requirements for thebuilding of motor trawlers.Malta.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 45thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Cabinet had before them a note (CP. (56) 159) by theColonial Secretary covering a minute summarising the outcome ofrecent financial discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta and thedraft of a statement on this matter which he proposed to make in theHouse of Commons on the following day.The Colonial Secretary said that Mr. Mintoff had asked that theUnited Kingdom Government should agree to afford financial aid toMalta during the forthcoming year to the extent of  7-8 millionsinstead of the figure of  4-5 millions which had been considered by theRound Table Conference. The Governor of Malta had recommendedthat some compromise should be sought in the matter, but he himselfsaw grave objections to taking any such course. The figure of 4-5 millions had not been questioned at the time of the Round TableConference and, if the Government were now to agree to the higherfigure which Mr. Mintoff proposed, they would find themselvescommitted in effect to an acceptance of equivalence in standardsbetween the United Kingdom and Malta. He had assured the Houseof Commons that Malta&apos;s representation at Westminster would notlead to a demand for comparable terms from other small Colonies,but there was no certainty that this would be so if it were seen thatMalta was to obtain financial assistance on a scale substantiallygreater than had been foreshadowed. Moreover, there was no doubtthat Mr. Mintoff&apos;s demands, if conceded this year, would be raisednext year. If, however, the demand were to be refused there would bea general election in Malta and Mr. Mintoff might then abandon theconstitutional policy recommended by the Round Table Conferenceand propose a settlement based on self-determination for Malta witha defence treaty and a subsidy from the United Kingdom on theLibyan model.The Lord Chancellor supported the views which the ColonialSecretary had expressed. The level of aid which had previously beenagreed had been based on figures which had been put to the RoundTable Conference by experts on Malta&apos;s behalf.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, in spite of theconsequences which might follow, Mr. Mintoff&apos;s demands would haveto be resisted. Ministers considered a number of counter-proposalswhich might have some face-saving value for Mr. Mintoff withoutconceding the substance of his claim. It was suggested thatMr. Mintoff might be attracted by a proposal that the level of aidshould be expressed in terms of a grant of  7^ millions to cover aprogramme for an eighteen months period and should be combinedwith the offer of a Commission to be appointed by the UnitedKingdom to review Malta&apos;s financial needs and resources and therelative burdens which should be carried by Malta and the UnitedKingdom respectively. It was agreed that this course should beadopted and that the statement which the Colonial Secretary proposedto make in the House of Commons on the following day should beexpanded to include a reference to it.
7CM. 46 (56)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposals of the Maltese Prime Minister foradditional financial aid for the forthcoming year shouldbe rejected.(2) Agreed that Mr. Mintoff should be offered aid amountingto  7^ millions to cover a period of eighteen months andthat this should be combined with a proposal that aCommission appointed by the United Kingdom shouldconduct a further investigation into Malta&apos;s financial needsand resources.(3) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement inParliament on the following day in the terms of the draftannexed to C.P. (56) 159 expanded to include referenceto the point recorded in Conclusion (2) above.Libya.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 45thConclusions,Minute 8.)9.   The Foreign Secretary said that his negotiations with thePrime Minister of Libya had resulted in an agreement that the UnitedKingdom would provide additional financial aid to Libya of   million in the current year.   In the following year, it would be ^ million subject to a further increase of up to  i million as a resultof the postponement of the evacuation of Derna West Barracks bythe British Army.  In regard to the Libyan Prime Minister&apos;s requestfor assistance in increasing the size of Libya&apos;s armed forces, he hadundertaken that United Kingdom experts would examine Libya&apos;sneeds for a navy and an air force and that, subject again to therecommendations of experts, somewhat more extensive assistancemight be given to the Libyan army in the form of training facilities,equipment and the use of British installations in Libya.  This was anot unsatisfactory outcome of the negotiations: an offer to bringforward the quinquennial review by one year would undoubtedly havecost us more. Nevertheless, financial support for Libya was becomingan increasing burden and an urgent reappraisal should be made of thevalue to us of our connection with Libya under present strategicconditions. The United States, who had transferred their principalbase in North Africa to Libya from Morocco, might reasonablybe expected to bear a greater share of the expenditure involved insupporting the territory.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report of his negotiationswith the Prime Minister of Libya.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to review our long-term need formilitary facilities in Libya and the means of meetingthat need.CoalProduction.(PreviousReference :CC. (55) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.)The GrandNational.10. The Cabinet were informed that the National Hunt Clubwere, for financial reasons, proposing next year and thereafter torevert to the traditional practice of running the Grand NationalSteeplechase on a Friday instead of on a Saturday as in recent years.It was estimated that this would involve a loss of output of20,000 tons of coal next year. There was no power to compel theorganisers of the race to continue to have it run on Saturdays and allthe other principal races had now reverted to their traditional daysof the week. It was however agreed that, in view of the importanceof coal production in the current economic situation, a further attemptshould be made to persuade the organisers to postpone for a furtheryear their decision to run the Grand National on a Friday.
8The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to make a furtherattempt to persuade the organisers of the Grand NationalSteeplechase to agree to postpone for a further year theirdecision to have this race run on a Friday.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,29th June, 1956.
