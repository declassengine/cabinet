The Prime Minister said that he had asked Sir AlecKirkbride to attend this meeting of the Cabinet in order that hemight give his impressions of the present situation in Jordan.Sir Alec, who had served for more than twenty years in Jordan andhad oeen H.M. Minister there until 1951, had happened to be inAmman on private business at the time when General Glubbwas dismissed.  King Hussein had sent for him and, after discussingthe situation, had pressed him to come specially to London in orderto assure Her Majesty&apos;s Government that neither the King nor theGovernment of Jordan desired to see any change in the traditionalrelations of friendship and co-operation between the two countries.From the conversations which he had held in Amman, Sir Alec wassatisfied that the King&apos;s dismissal of General Glubb was not a suddendecision taken in a mood of temperamental instability, but derivedfrom a long-standing dissatisfaction with the way in which GeneralGlubb had controlled the Arab Legion.   It was essentially an actdirected against General Glubb personally; it was not designed todisrupt Jordan&apos;s relations with the United Kingdom; and both theKing and the Prime Minister of Jordan were now most seriouslydisturbed at the possibility that a lasting breach might thereby becreated in the relations between the two countries.   Their primaryobject was to preserve the independence of Jordan, and theyrecognised that this could not be preserved without the continuingfriendship and support of the United Kingdom.In reply to questions by Ministers, Sir Alec Kirkbride made thefollowing points:  (a) The King&apos;s action had destroyed the unity of the ArabLegion. Without British officers in positions of executive command,the Legion could not be expected to recover its efficiency as a fightingforce. If, however, we decided on that account to withdraw fromJordan, the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan would fall and the countryitself would collapse. This would have serious effects in Iraq. Itwould probably lead to the fall of the Hashemite dynasty, and theend of British influence, in that country also. We must thereforecontinue to support Jordan in order to protect our vital interests inIraq.(b) It would be a mistake to attempt to bring Iraq into anydiscussions which we might now have about the future of ourrelations with Jordan. The Prime Minister of Jordan, who was inleague with the Saudis, was a bitter enemy of the Prime Minister ofIraq and was strongly opposed to any closer association betweenJordan and Iraq. King Hussein would also resent any attempt byus to instigate his relatives in Iraq to bring pressure to bear on him.(c) The Jordan Government were unlikely to accept suggestionsthat they should look to Egypt or Saudi Arabia, instead of the UnitedKingdom, for financial assistance. They realised that such financialsupport would not be continued for long when once the link betweenJordan and the United Kingdom had been broken. The object ofthese other Arab States was to absorb Jordan, not to preserve itsindependence.(d) The relations between the United Kingdom and Jordan hadbeen seriously shaken by the events of the last few days, but thedamage was not irreparable and the situation could be restored ifprompt action were taken. What was immediately required was anassurance that the United Kingdom Government were not proposingto withdraw their support from Jordan, and an offer to discuss theterms on which British officers might serve with the Arab Legionin the future.The Prime Minister thanked Sir Alec Kirkbride for theinformation and explanations which he had given to the Cabinet.Sir Alec Kirkbride then withdrew from the meeting.b 2
4Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that it would be inexpedient for the Government to basetheir policy on the assumption that friendly relations between thiscountry and Jordan could not be restored. The extent to which wecould continue our Treaty obligations to Jordan must, however,depend on the future reliability of the Arab Legion. Our first taskshould therefore be to discuss with the Jordan Government the basison which British officers might be associated with the Legion in thefuture. It might, for example, be possible to persuade the JordanGovernment to accept a definite commitment to retain a number ofBritish officers in given posts for specific periods. The scope ofthese discussions might subsequently be widened so as to cover themore general problem of future relations between this country andJordan. Before this wider question was broached, however, weshould consider how we could reduce the extent of our obligationsunder the existing Treaty. In present circumstances it seemedundesirable that we should retain under any Treaty with Jordanobligations greater than those which we had undertaken by theTripartite Declaration of 1950.The Cabinet then considered the draft of a personal messagefrom the Prime Minister to the King of Jordan and of a formal noteto the Jordan Government. The first of these was intended as areply to King Hussein&apos;s message to the Prime Minister in TelegramNo. 364 from Amman. Its purpose was to make it plain that theUnited Kingdom Government were prepared to match any effortswhich the Jordan Government might now be ready to make tostrengthen the Anglo-Jordan alliance. The second draft, whilereaffirming the decision that British officers could not now holdpositions of executive command in the Arab Legion, suggested thatdiscussions should be held about the terms on which British officersmight serve in Jordan in the future.In discussion various suggestions were made for amendmentof these two drafts. It was also agreed that they should beaccompanied by a telegram of instructions to H.M. Ambassadorin Amman making it clear that the discussions which he wasauthorised to open with the Jordan Government should at this stagebe confined to questions affecting the service of British officers inJordan, now and in the future, and that he should not embark on thewider issue of future relations between the United Kingdom andJordan until he had received further instructions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to revise thedrafts of the message to King Hussein and of the note tothe Jordan Government, in the light of the commentsmade in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, and to prepare a draftof the instructions to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atAmman which should accompany those messages.(2) Took note that the Minister of State for Foreign Affairswould submit drafts of these three telegrams for the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval.2. The Minister of Agriculture said that, after the Cabinet&apos;smeeting on the previous day, he had communicated to Sir JamesTurner, the President of the National Farmers&apos; Union, the Govern-ment&apos;s decision that the current review of farm prices should beconcluded on the basis of a schedule of guarantees representing anincrease of  24 millions, as compared with the previous year, andincluding an increase of \d. a gallon in the guaranteed price for milk.Sir James Turner had now indicated that the farmer&apos;s would beprepared to accept a settlement on the basis of a figure ofFarm PriceReview.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 20thConclusions,Minute 10.)
5CM. 21 (56) 25  millions with a somewhat different schedule of guarantees,including an increase of id. a gallon on milk. The Minister said thathe could not recommend acceptance of the latest schedule putforward on behalf of the farmers: in particular he would not be infavour of increasing the price of milk by more than fd.: but he wasdisposed, for the sake of an agreed settlement, to offer a ratherdifferent schedule of guarantees representing a total increase of 25-{- millions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the coursewhich the negotiations had taken, there was much to be said forimposing a settlement. It would be difficult for the farmers tocriticise effectively a settlement at  24 millions when it would beknown that they had been ready to accept one of  25] millions. Hisown preference was therefore for adhering to the decision which theCabinet had reached on the previous day. If, however, an additional 1 million was to be offered it was important that the increase to bemade should be one which could be justified on economic grounds.He would be strongly opposed to any further increase in the price ofmilk.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis question.Some Ministers saw positive advantage in imposing a settlementon this occasion. They thought that this would be consistent withthe Government&apos;s general economic policy at this time. It wouldhelp the Government to justify decisions which they mightsubsequently be required to take in respect of other industries. Itwould also be likely to have a salutary effect in strengthening thefarmers&apos; opposition to further wage claims by farm workers.Other Ministers thought it would be unwise to forego thisopportunity of arriving at an agreed settlement with the farmers. Itwould not seem reasonable to have broken off negotiations when thegap dividing the two parties was so small a figure as  1 million. TheGovernment had been right to show that, in present economiccircumstances, they were resolved to deal firmiy with the farmers; butthey had achieved that object by reducing the farmers&apos; demand from 41 millions to  25 millions. An imposed settlement was likely togive rise to political difficulties in the House of Commons andbitterness in the rural constituencies.There was, however, agreement in the Cabinet that, even ifanother  1 million were to be conceded, no concession should bemade to the farmers on the prices of milk, eggs or pigs. In all thecircumstances the best course would be for the Minister ofAgriculture to inform Sir James Turner that the Government werenot prepared to increase the guaranteed price of milk by more than%d. a gallon, and to see whether he had any other proposal to putforward.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to inform thePresident  of the  National  Farmers&apos;  Union  that theGovernment were not prepared to increase the guaranteedprice of milk by more than \d. a gallon.Israel.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that attheir meeting on 28th February the Cabinet had noted that, in hisforthcoming visit to Israel, the Foreign Secretary would avoid anyaction impliedly recognising Jerusalem as its capital. The ForeignSecretary had accordingly proposed that he should call on the IsraeliForeign Minister in Tel Aviv and on the Prime Minister in Jerusalem.He had been told in reply that it would be impracticable for theIsraeli Foreign Minister to receive him formally in Tel Aviv. The
6Foreign Secretary could now decline to visit Jerusalem, accepting therisk that the Israeli Government might say that in that event theywould prefer that he should not visit Israel at all. Alternatively, hecould carry out the programme which they suggested, but issue apublic statement thereafter making it clear that this did not implyrecognition of Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s capital. The first of these courseswas more in accord with the policy which we had hitherto pursued,but it might give rise to political criticism in Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that in this matter the ForeignSecretary should be guided by the precedent established by the UnitedStates Secretary of State. If he paid the same visits as Mr. Dulleshad done, this should give rise to no political criticism. If he madethis offer and the Israeli Government rejected it, he could then offerto visit Tel Aviv but not Jerusalem.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to advisethe Foreign Secretary in the sense of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,9th March, 1956.
