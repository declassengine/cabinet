3CM. 3 (56)ParliamentaryDisqualification.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Home Secretary said that it now appeared that certainlyfour, and possibly seven, members of the Northern Ireland Parliamentwere disqualified from membership of their House. Although theenquiry into these cases would be conducted by a Select Committeeof the Northern Ireland Parliament, any legislation that might beneeded to indemnify the members concerned and to validate theirelection would have to be enacted by the Parliament at Westminster.He was consulting the Attorney-General on the matter and a furtherreport would be made to the Cabinet at a later meeting.It was pointed out in discussion that the House of CommonsDisqualification Bill, which was designed to provide a generalstatutory authority covering this type of case, had not yet advancedbeyond its preliminary stages in the House of Commons. There waslittle doubt, however, that the progress of this Bill would beaccelerated if it were possible to omit the controversial Clause 6,containing provisions relating to Crown contracts, and to refer thatproblem separately to a Select Committee. The Opposition mightbe disposed to agree to this course. In the interim period allpracticable steps should be taken to avoid the return for a third timeof a disqualified candidate by the Mid-Ulster division.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to consider further, inconsultation with the Attorney-General and the Parlia-mentary Secretary, Treasury, what steps might be taken(i) to avoid the repetition of an abortive election inMid-Ulster, and (ii) to accelerate the passage of the Houseof Commons Disqualification Bill.Food.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 10.)Danish Bacon.2. The President of the Board of Trade said that negotiationswere in progress with Denmark on the means of regulating the importof Danish bacon when the series of bulk purchase contracts, whichhad been in operation since the beginning of the war, came to an endlater in the year. It would not be possible to abandon State tradingwithout imposing some alternative form of control on the import ofDanish supplies. The quota which had regulated the import ofbacon from Denmark before the war could not be reinstated becauseof the commitments we had assumed under the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade; and the Economic Policy Committee hadrecommended that, as an alternative, a 10 per cent, tariff should beimposed. Negotiations were proceeding on that basis.In discussion concern was expressed that the proposed tariffwould lead to a rise in the cost of living at a time when the presentupward trend should be reversed. If imports were unrestricted,bacon should become cheaper and the cost of living would fall. Itwas pointed out that this result, however desirable, could only beachieved at the cost to the Exchequer of a very large increase in thedeficiency payments which were paid to the domestic farmer for pigproduction. The cost of production of bacon in Denmark wassubstantially less than here and, if prices fell because of unrestrictedimports, the deficiency payments to British farmers already runningat a level of about  60 millions a year might rise to a figure of 100 millions. As the proposed 10 per cent, tariff was broadlyequivalent to the level of profit on Danish bacon which had beenobtained in recent years under State trading, there was little risk thata tariff set at this level would lead to a rise in the price of bacon:indeed, as Danish costs were so much lower than ours, a 10 per cent,tariff might not prove high enough to prevent some increase in the49596 3b 2
4deficiency payments. The unrestricted import of Danish bacon hadnot been permitted before the war and the control of imports was nota new departure.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the President of the Board ofTrade on the negotiations on imports of bacon fromDenmark.Jordan. 3.   j}le Foreign Secretary said that there had been further(Previous        disturbances in Jordan following the announcement on 4th JanuaryReference:       that the King&apos;s dissolution of Parliament had been unconstitutional.C.C. (54) 23rd   A new Government had been formed by Samir Rifai who had statedConclusions,     that his policy would be to keep Jordan out of the Bagdad Pact orMinute 4.)       any other alliances.   The disorders had subsided, but the situationremained tense and it was doubtful whether the present lull wouldcontinue.   As a precautionary measure, two battalions of the Para-chute Brigade were being flown to Cyprus and these troops would bemoved into Jordan, should the need arise. In the meantime the Kingof Jordan had agreed that 250 men of the light anti-aircraft wing ofthe Royal Air Force Regiment at Habbaniya should be flown intoJordan and that the British armoured regiment already stationed atAqaba should be put at short notice, but should not at present movecloser to Amman.  The question of providing protection for Britishsubjects in Jerusalem in the event of further disturbances was beingconsidered, but detailed arrangements awaited an assessment by theConsul-General in Jerusalem of what would be required.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the area hadsuggested that members of the Royal Air Force Regiment should besent to Mafraq as well as to Amman. This was being considered bythe Chiefs of Staff. Such a division of the force seemed, however,to be undesirable. King Hussein had suggested that the move of thisunit into Jordan should take place gradually, so as to attract as littleattention as possible. It would be preferable, therefore, for themovement of the complete unit to Amman to take place in twoechelons.(b) King Hussein had shown considerable resolution in therecent difficult conditions in Jordan. H.M. Ambassador in Ammanmight be authorised to convey, at his discretion, a suitable messageof encouragement to the King.(c) There were reports that 3,000 Saudi troops were con-centrating near the Jordan frontier, and King Hussein had suggestedthat the United Kingdom Government should warn the SaudiGovernment against precipitate action. There was a possibility thatthe Saudi Government might try to use any such warning forpropaganda purposes. It was, however, unlikely that the Saudiswanted war and, if the Saudi Government had been warned, in thesame way as Israel had been warned, that the United Kingdomintended to stand by the obligations of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty,the United Kingdom would be in a stronger position should itbecome necessary to use British forces to help Jordan in repelling aSaudi attack.
5 CM. 3 (56)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to inform the Chiefs of Staffof the views noted in paragraph (a) above on the arrange-ments for moving the unit of the Royal Air ForceRegiment from Habbaniya to Jordan.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to authorise H.M. Ambassadorin Amman to convey, at his discretion, a suitable messageof encouragement to King Hussein.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the SaudiArabian Government to be informed that the UnitedKingdom Government intended to stand by theirobligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty in the eventof any attack on Jordan.Soviet Union.Visit of SovietLeaders to theUnitedKingdom.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 45thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the forthcomingvisit of the Soviet leaders to this country. They had before them, inCP. (55) 197 and CP. (56) 2, texts of statements made byMr. Bulganin and Mr. Krushchev during their tour of India andBurma and after their return to Moscow, together with a selection ofstatements on the Soviet system and leaders which had been madesince 1945 by members of the United Kingdom Government andleading members of the Opposition.The Lord President recalled that, when the Cabinet hadpreviously discussed this matter, he had expressed the view that, ifthe hostile statements had not been withdrawn before the proposedvisit took place, the entertainment of the Russian leaders in thiscountry would have a serious effect on our prestige in the rest of theworld. Subsequent developments had made it even less desirablethat the proposed visit should take place, for on their return toMoscow the Russian leaders had continued to make a series ofanti-British speeches, some of which had been couched in termscalculated to encourage disaffection in our dependent territories. Hewas not convinced by the argument that it was our duty to preserve(by not withdrawing the invitation) a channel of communication withthe Soviet Government, for the Russian leaders were realistic enoughto take the initiative in creating an opportunity for discussion shouldthey see advantage in doing so. Nor would it influence the Russianleaders, who were neither open-minded nor idealistic, to obtain afirst-hand impression of life in this country. As had been shownby the action taken over the Berlin airlift, a firm stand impressedthe Russians. But it neither promoted understanding with them norenhanced our prestige in the rest of the world to turn the othercheek, and it would have a most profound effect on our reputation inAsia and Africa, and even in Europe, if we received the Russianleaders without requiring them to withdraw the hostile expressionswhich they had used.In discussion the view was expressed that, on the evidencecontained in the texts of statements made over the course of years byleaders on both sides, the exchange of abuse might be considered tobe evenly balanced. It had been the practice for our own leaders tocomment freely on the tyrannical character of the Soviet system, andto do so even in speeches made abroad. But, against this background,it could not be overlooked that the Soviet leaders had decided toexpress themselves most violently during a period in which we hadreason to believe that friendlier relations might prevail and hadframed our own remarks accordingly.   There was nevertheless
6support in the Cabinet for the view that, because in a nuclear age somuch was at stake, the visit should still take place in spite of the riskthat our motives might be misunderstood in Asia and elsewhere. Thecase for this would be reinforced if, as matters had developed, thevisit were devoted to an exchange of views rather than to sightseeing.The Foreign Secretary said that it must be recognised that, in thenew circumstances, the visit might prove troublesome in a numberof ways but he considered that, on balance, the invitation shouldremain open. The withdrawal of an invitation which had been givenand accepted would be turned to account by the Russians, and if theycould provoke a withdrawal they would represent it as a victory inthe cold war. He felt that the Russian leaders, if challenged, wouldderide the idea that their remarks, which on examination would beseen to have been cleverly framed, were ill-intentioned. A moresatisfactory opportunity of cancelling the invitation would arise if theRussian leaders made a point of seizing the occasion of theirforthcoming Party Conference to continue to speak in the sameunfriendly terms.The Prime Minister said that he had given much thought to thisquestion. The attitude taken up by the Russian leaders had createda delicate situation in which our interests would not be served by thesimple solution of an outright cancellation of an invitation which hadbeen extended when a friendlier atmosphere prevailed. But the visit,if it were to take place, should now assume a different character andbe devoted mainly to an exchange of views. As this would transformthe visit, for all practical purposes, into a two-Power conference hefelt it desirable before taking a final decision to discuss the situationfully with the President of the United States during the forthcomingtalks in Washington. But the statements made by the Russianleaders could not go unchallenged and a suitable opportunity formaking representations would arise for the first time when H.M.Ambassador returned to his post in Moscow later that month. TheAmbassador should be instructed to make it clear to the Sovietauthorities that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had been disturbed by aseries of utterances which seemed to have been calculated to do harmand to ask whether the opinions which had been expressed reflectedthe attitude of the Soviet Government. The question whether thevisit should then take place and the precise character it shouldassume could be considered in the light of the response which H.M.Ambassador obtained.The Lord President said that he would reserve his right to raisethis matter again when he knew the outcome of the representationsto be made in Moscow and of the consultations to take place inWashington.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that H.M. Ambassador in Moscow should beinstructed to seek an explanation of the hostile statementswhich had been made in recent months by the Sovietleaders.(2) Agreed in principle that the proposed visit of the Sovietleaders, should it take place, should be made the occasionof an exchange of views.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretarywould discuss the matter with the President of the UnitedStates during their forthcoming visit to Washington.(4) Deferred their decision on the question whether the invitationshould be cancelled.
7CM. 3 (56)Buraimi.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 35thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary (CP. (56) 9) seeking authority to inform the United StatesGovernment that we were not prepared to resume arbitration withSaudi Arabia over Buraimi or to seek a negotiated settlement.The Foreign Secretary said that, since the action taken on26th October to re-assert the authority of the ruler of Abu Dhabi andthe Sultan of Muscat in the Buraimi area, the Americans had pressedconstantly that we should re-open the matter either by resumingarbitration or by negotiating a settlement. Although we should beprepared to discuss minor frontier adjustments in accordance with thestatement which the Prime Minister had made in the House ofCommons at the time there could be no question, for the reasons givenin his memorandum, of resuming arbitration or seeking a negotiatedsettlement. If, as the Americans thought likely, Saudi Arabiareferred the matter to the Security Council the United Kingdom, as aparty to the dispute, would not have the right of veto. But, providedthe United States Government could be persuaded not to workactively against us, he hoped it would be possible to secure sufficientabstentions to prevent an adverse vote. He hoped that, in theforthcoming talks in Washington, it would be possible to convince theUnited States Government of the reasons why it would not be soundpolicy to agree to negotiate or to resume arbitration over this matter.Although difficulty could be foreseen in ensuring a satisfactoryvote, if the matter were brought before the Security Council, theCabinet agreed that it would not be in our interest to appear to showreadiness to seek a compromise with Saudi Arabia on the Buraimiquestion.The Cabinet-Approved the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary inCP. (56) 9.OverseasInformationServices.(PreviousReferences:C.C. (54) 49thConclusions,Minute 5, andCM. (55) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the formerChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 195) on expenditure onoverseas information services for the year 1956-57.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at  12-3 millions theexpenditure foreshadowed for 1956-57 showed an increase of 1-7 millions or 18 per cent, over the Estimates for the current year.This was a disproportionate increase in one year and it could not bejustified at a time when we were in deficit on current overseas accountand any increase in expenditure could be made only by depleting thereserves. He therefore proposed that a limit of  11 - 55 millions shouldbe placed on the provision for overseas information in 1956-57 andthat the Departments concerned should be asked to allocate this sumbetween the various services in accordance with their relativepriorities.The Foreign Secretary said that  560,000 of the increase relatedto expenditure on the additional services in the Middle East whichthe Cabinet had recently held to be urgent. It might not, however,be possible to spend within the financial year the total provisionwhich had been requested and, although a provision of  11-55millions would be inadequate, he was reasonably satisfied that a sumof  11-8 millions would cover actual expenditure on all essentialservices.
8In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Provision should be made within the proposed limit for thecomparatively modest increases which were contemplated in theexpenditure on information services in Commonwealth and Colonialterritories.(b) It was pointed out that, to some extent, the rising costs ofinformation services conducted by the British BroadcastingCorporation (B.B.C.) escaped the more stringent control exercisedover departmental expenditure. Against this, it was pointed out thatthe B.B.C. were merely agents for the Government in conducting 1these services and that part of the increased cost could be attributed Jto capital expenditure which would result in economies in the longerterm. In broadcasting to Eastern Europe it might be more profitableto concentrate our efforts on one or two countries rather than todissipate our resources in attempting to exert an influence over theentire region.(c) It was argued that expenditure on overseas informationshould not be considered in isolation but should be regarded as partof the general budget for defence and the Foreign Service. It wouldthen be possible, when economies had to be made in Governmentor overseas expenditure generally, to consider whether a cut whichwould otherwise fall on information expenditure could be absorbedwith more justification elsewhere in the foreign and defence budget.(d) It was pointed out that, in comparison with other countries,the provision we made for expenditure on international trade fairsand exhibitions was extremely small. As a result, our displays werepoor in quality and had been criticised by the exporting trades asa poor advertisement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a provision of  118 millions should be madefor expenditure on overseas information in 1956-57.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the ForeignSecretary, in consultation with the CommonwealthSecretary and the Colonial Secretary, to consider howthis sum should be divided between the various services.Malta. 7.   The  Lord  Chancellor  reported   to   the   Cabinet that(Previous        Mr. Mintoff, the Prime Minister of Malta, had given the UnitedReference:      Kingdom Government an opportunity to consider the terms of theCM. (56) 2nd   referendum to be held in Malta.  The Maltese electorate were beingConclusions,     invited to vote, not merely on the single question whether they wishedMinute 4.)       representation in the Parliament at Westminster, but on a propositionwhich included in effect all the supporting recommendations madeby the Round-Table Conference and constituted a summary of itsreport.   In the absence of the Colonial Secretary, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and he had considered the latest draft of thedocument which Mr. Mintoff intended to put before the Malteseelectorate and had suggested two amendments designed to eliminateambiguities which might give the Maltese people a misleadingimpression of the economic benefits which would follow fromintegration.   Mr. Mintoff had accepted one of these amendmentsbut had not been prepared to accept the other.   He recognised,however,   that   in   these   circumstances   the   United KingdomGovernment must be free to explain, if the matter were raised indebate, the extent to which they were committed to the terms of thememorandum.
9CM. 3 (56)The point was made in discussion that it might, nevertheless,be too late for the United Kingdom Government to dispute the termsof the referendum once the Maltese electorate had voted in favourof it.The Cabinet Took note of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s statement.EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 37thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 7) summarising the mainfactors in the continuing deterioration of the economic situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we had reached thesame vulnerable position as a private business which persisted intrading beyond its means. We were trying to do more than ourresources would allow. The steps which had been taken to restrainconsumer demand and to restrict credit had not succeeded in bringingthe situation under control. The effectiveness of credit restrictionas an instrument was gravely impaired by the fact that the Govern-ment and the local authorities were together responsible for half thetotal new investment now made in this country. Nor was thisinstrument fully effective in the private sector, where the policy ofdividend restraint had left many firms with a substantial accumu-lation of liquid resources. Investment had been stimulated bycontinuing inflation until it had reached excessive levels. With risingprices Government expenditure, even without any expansion ofservices, went steadily up and the Estimates for 1956-57 would showan increase of some  300 millions over the estimates for the currentyear. Further measures to arrest the decline would now need tobe considered.The Cabinet had a general discussion which is not recordedexcept for the following points:  (a) The wage negotiations which were now in progress or inprospect over a wide field of industry were bound to result in awardswhich would act as a further stimulus to inflation. This process wasnow so far advanced that it could not be reversed. But the pressurefor wage increases which came to a head at the turn of the year wasthe outcome of wage demands which had been formulated in thepreceding spring. Any policy which might be aimed at forestallingthe recurrence of a further inflationary movement at the end of thepresent year should therefore be brought to bear on industry andthe unions during the next few weeks, before the latter took up fixedpositions in regard to their next wage claims.(h) As regards departmental expenditure, the tendency towardsover-budgeting might be brought under control if, taking a morerealistic view, Departments refrained from making provision forsupplies and equipment which might not be delivered within thefinancial year. Close Departmental budgeting would itself makesome contribution in the present inflationary situation. It wouldtherefore be preferable to make a conservative estimate of supplieswhich would have to be paid for during the financial year and toseek supplementary provision should the estimate prove too low.A determined attempt must also be made to reduce Governmentexpenditure in absolute terms.The Cabinet-Took   note   of   the   Chancellor   of  the Exchequer&apos;smemorandum CP. (56) 7.49596 3
10Social Services.        9.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after consultation(Previous        with the Lord Privy Seal, he proposed that the terms of referenceReference:      for the Committee of Ministers which was to review expenditureCM. (55) 45th   on the social services should be as follows:  Conclusions,   jQ examme ine issues which would arise if the increaseMinute 6.) at present estimated in the expenditure on the social servicesover the next five years were to be avoided or substantiallyreduced, and to report to the Cabinet.&quot;These terms of reference were acceptable to the Lord Privy Sealwho had expressed his willingness to preside over the Committee.The Cabinet had already agreed that the Committee should includethe Ministers who were responsible for the social services and theSecretary of State for Scotland. On this basis the Committee wouldconsist of Lord Privy Seal (Chairman).Secretary of State for Scotland.Minister of Housing.Minister of Agriculture.Minister of Education.Minister of Pensions.Minister of Health.Financial Secretary, Treasury.He also recommended that the Committee should include, ifpossible, one or two Ministers without departmental responsibilityfor social services.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.TechnologicalEducation.ImperialCollege ofScience.(PreviousReferences:CM. (56) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6, andCM. (55) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (56) 4) on the question whetherthe Collcutt building should be demolished to make way for the newbuildings of the Imperial College, or whether it should beincorporated in the College. The Home Affairs Committee had notbeen able to reach agreement on this point.It was stated in the memorandum that the Royal Fine ArtCommission had strongly recommended that the Collcutt buildingshould be preserved. This would, however, be a wasteful use of theImperial College site and would lead to the loss of some 360 studentsor approximately one-quarter of the expansion which had beenplanned. In view of this it was recommended that the Collcuttbuilding should be demolished and that the need for this decisionshould be explained to the Royal Fine Art Commission.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Works (CP. (56) 8) setting out the case on aestheticgrounds for retaining this building.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, although there wouldbe public criticism of a decision to demolish a well-known Londonbuilding, the pressing need for greater numbers of technicians wasoverriding. It would not be practicable to provide for the expansionof the Imperial College at another site except at the cost of a delaywhich could not now be contemplated. In any event opinionswould differ on the architectural merits of the Collcutt building.The Cabinet Approved the course proposed in paragraph 11 ofCP. (56) 4.
11CM. 3 (56)Monopolies andRestrictivePractices.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 47thConclusions,Minute 5.)Iron and SteelIndustry.11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (56) 11) on a proposal of the Iron and Steel Boardthat the iron and steel industry should be excluded from the fieldof enquiry of the proposed judicial tribunal, and that the Iron andSteel Board should itself be charged with jurisdiction over restrictivepractices in the iron and steel industry.The Lord Chancellor said that the Iron and Steel Board feltstrongly that their statutory authority and responsibility would becompromised if restrictive practices in the iron and steel industrywere made subject to the jurisdiction of the proposed tribunal. TheCommittee of Ministers under his Chairmanship, who wereresponsible for preparing the proposed legislation, had found somedifficulty in accepting the Board&apos;s view. They had felt that thepassage of the forthcoming Bill would be jeopardised if the iron andsteel industry were omitted from its scope, and that other industrieswould not be content that the Iron and Steel Board should enjoythe special powers which they sought. There were moreover otherobjections, set out in the memorandum, to this course. The Ironand Steel Board were at present conducting a review of the restrictivepractices in their industry and it was proposed that the Board shouldbe given an undertaking that restrictive practices in the iron andsteel industry would not be brought before the tribunal until thisreview had been completed and considered by the President of theBoard of Trade.The President of the Board of Trade said that the jurisdictionof the proposed tribunal would not in fact impair the authority ofthe Iron and Steel Board, for the tribunal would merely replace theexisting Monopolies Commission, to which the iron and steel industrywas already subject. It was not proposed to accord any specialtreatment to the Iron and Steel Board in connection with their reviewof restrictive practices: he would be ready to act in the same way ifthe Monopolies Commission were to continue in operation.The Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed in CP. (56) 11.Parliament.Redistributionof Seats.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)12. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 5) towhich was annexed a copy of a letter from the Speaker requestingthat the proposed Bill to amend the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, should relieve him of his positionas Chairman of the four Boundary Commissions. The Speaker wasconcerned lest he should again become embroiled in controversywhich might impair the authority of the Chair. He proposed as analternative the establishment of Commissions of officials whosereports would be referred to a statutory committee consisting of theSpeaker, as Chairman, and four other Members of the House ofCommons to be elected by the House at the beginning of eachParliament. This body would consider the Commissions&apos; reports andreport on them to the Home Secretary.There was also annexed to the memorandum a draft reply urgingthe Speaker to reconsider the matter on the grounds that there wasno suitable substitute for the Speaker as Chairman of the BoundaryCommissions; that the alternative which he proposed would notwork satisfactorily in practice; and that political controversy of thekind which had arisen during the previous winter would be unlikelyto recur.
12The Cabinet were in agreement with the proposed reply.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to reply to the Speaker in the terms of thedraft letter annexed to CP. (56) 5.Remembrance 13.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSunday. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 6)proposing that, subject to any consultations which might be necessarywith the Commonwealth and Colonial Governments, they shouldsubmit for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure that Remembrance Sunday shouldin future be observed invariably on the second Sunday in November.The Home Secretary said that the proposal had been made bythe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Church of Scotland, in orderto avoid interference in some years with the observance of All Saints&apos;Tide. It had the approval of the leaders of the principal religiousdenominations and of the British Legion.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in CP. (56) 6.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,12th January, 1956.
