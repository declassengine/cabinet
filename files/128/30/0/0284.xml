CM. 60 (56)Suez Canal.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 59thConclusions,Minute 3.)504061.   The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on theinternational conference about the Suez Canal.The United States delegation had now put before the conferencewritten proposals for the future control of the Canal.   These, thoughstill concerned only with matters of principle, outlined an effectivesystem of international control. They were wholly acceptable to thedelegations of the United Kingdom and the other Western Powers.It was expected that the Pakistan delegation would that afternoonpropose certain minor amendments, which were acceptable to thedelegations of the United States and the United Kingdom; and, ifthese were accepted, it was likely that Pakistan, Turkey and Iranwould all be ready to support this declaration of principles,   fn thatevent 16 of the 22 countries represented at the conference wouldbe ranged in support of this declaration; and it was possible thatsome of the others might also adhere to it subject to reservations onparticular points.   Discussion would then turn on the procedure forpresenting the conclusions of the conference to the Egyptian Govern-ment.   The United Kingdom delegation would have preferred thatEgypt should be called upon to accept the principles set out in thedeclaration.    Among other delegations, however, there was aconsiderable measure of support for the view that it would beinexpedient at this stage to present anything in the nature of anultimatum to Egypt. The Eastern Powers, in particular, believed thatsuch an approach would be rejected outright by Egypt.  They wouldprefer that the conference should appoint a small Committee topresent the declaration to the Egyptian Government as a basis for thenegotiation of a treaty.The Prime Minister said that, if this latter procedure werefollowed, care would have to be taken to avoid giving the impressionthat the Committee were prepared to negotiate with the EgyptianGovernment. In his view it should be their function to present theconclusions of the conference to the Egyptians and to elucidate anypoints on which further information was desired. They would alsohave the function of bringing pressure to bear on the Egyptians toaccept the declaration of principles as a basis for the subsequentnegotiation of a treaty. The composition of the Committee wouldtherefore be of crucial importance. Some of the Foreign Ministersof the Western Powers had made it clear, in conversation with him,that their support for this method of procedure was given on theunderstanding that the United States Secretary of State and thePrime Minister of Australia would be members of the proposedCommittee. It was contemplated that the Foreign Minister of oneof the Scandinavian countries should be a third member of theCommittee, and that the fourth should be a representative of anEastern Power, possibly Iran. The Prime Minister said that, if theCommittee could be constituted in this way, he would be ready tosupport this method of procedure. He expressed the hope that, itproposals developed on these lines, the Prime Minister of Australiawould find himself able to undertake this responsible task.Mr. Menzies said that the Australian Parliament was due tomeet on 30th August to debate the Budget, and his Cabinet colleagueswould normally have expected him to be in Canberra at that time.If, however, the United Kingdom Government asked that his returnto Australia should be deferred so that he could undertake this taskon behalf of the Suez Canal conference, his colleagues in Canberramight be ready to give their assent.In further discussion the following points were raised :-(a) Had any indication yet been given of the attitude which theUnited States Government might adopt towards the enforcementof the conclusions of the conference, if these were rejected by theEgyptian Government?b 2
4The Cabinet were informed that the United States Secretaryof State had not so far been very forthcoming on this point. Heseemed at present to be reluctant to contemplate any further financialor economic pressures on Egypt. He had, in particular, expresseddoubts about the possibility of United States co-operation in anyarrangement for securing that transit dues for passage through theCanal were paid into a blocked account so as to deny any financialbenefit to the Egyptian Government.(b) The attitude of the Soviet delegation at the conference hadnot been hostile. There seemed to be some reason to believe that theSoviet Government did not wish to become too closely involved inany dispute arising from this action of the Egyptian Government.It was possible that, if the situation deteriorated, it might beadvantageous that neither the United States nor the Soviet Unionshould become embroiled in it.(c) The position about the payment of transit dues remainedconfused. Dues paid in Paris were available to the Suez CanalCompany. Dues paid in London were not so available, for theWestminster Bank, to which they were paid, were at present unwillingto cash cheques drawn by the Company. The Company&apos;s legaladvisers were now considering the possibility of taking proceedingsagainst the Bank, and also against the owners of United States shipswhose transit dues were still being paid in Cairo. The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that he was doing his best to hold this positionfor the time being and to dissuade the Company from prematurelegal action.(d) A Norwegian shipping company which had hitherto paidtransit dues in Egypt had now arranged for dues to be paid in Londonand, despite this, had been able to pass one of its ships through theCanal.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and ofthe points raised in discussion.Parliament.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 59thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Prime Minister referred to the proposal that Parliamentshould be recalled immediately after the end of the internationalconference. If Parliament were to meet on 28th August the noticeof recall would need to be issued on 23rd August.In discussion it was suggested that it might, after all, beinadvisable to recall Parliament to hear a report of the outcome ofthe international conference. If the ensuing debate revealed adivision of opinion between the Government and the Opposition, thismight influence Egypt&apos;s attitude towards the conclusions of theConference and might also lead other countries to doubt whetherpublic opinion in the United Kingdom was solidly in support of thestand which the Government had taken on the Suez issue. On thesegrounds it might be preferable to defer the recall of Parliamentuntil after a reply had been received from the Egyptian Government.On the other hand, it might be embarrassing to the Government ifParliament were in session when decisions had to be taken on afurther course of action following an Egyptian rejection of theconclusions of the international conference.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their consideration of this question attheir next meeting.
5CM. 60 (56)Export ofArms:Linkup(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (CP. (56) 202) on the sale of warships toTurkey.The First Lord of the Admiralty said the Turkish Governmentwished to purchase one Dido class cruiser, four &quot; M &quot; class andfour Battle class destroyers and eight Bay class frigates. ATurkish admiral had arrived in this country to negotiate for thepurchase, refitting and provisioning of these ships. The cruiser andthe frigates could be provided and, while no Battle class destroyerswere available, three Z &quot; class destroyers could be provided. Onpolitical and strategic grounds it would be desirable that this Turkishrequest should be met, but it was doubtful whether Turkey couldafford the heavy cost involved. This would amount to at least 10 millions and, if the three &quot;Z&quot; class destroyers were also sold,would rise to  12 millions. Even if the Turks were able to meetthe immediate cost of purchase (over  1| millions), there would begreat difficulty in persuading firms to accept the financial risksinvolved in undertaking the repair and refitting work which wouldbe needed.The Cabinet should be aware that for some of these ships firmoffers would shortly be made by Spain and Peru, who were in aposition to meet the cost involved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Turkey was extremelyshort of foreign exchange. She would only be able to pay for thesewarships by delaying still further the payment of her existingcommercial debt to this country (about  18 millions). Thecontractors would not be able to obtain any cover from the ExportCredits Guarantee Department; for in view of Turkey&apos;s financialposition this was now restricted to the provision of spare parts forexisting equipment with an overall limitation of  750,000 at any onetime.In discussion it was mentioned that the Turkish Prime Ministerwas taking a personal interest in the procurement of these warships.Though there would be a strategic benefit in helping Turkey, theships could not be given to the Turkish Government, since theywould need to be reconditioned before they were serviceable. In anyevent it would be undesirable to give ships to Turkey when Pakistanhad been asked to pay for naval vessels supplied to her. Turkeywould, however, be eligible to obtain certain ships on loan underthe plans at present being formulated within the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation, and the best course would be to advise theTurkish Government that three frieates might be made available onloan in this way. Under these plans Turkev would be required tomeet the costs of refitting the ships, which might be between 1 and  2 millions.The Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toexamine the possibility of making three frigates available tothe Turkish Government under the arrangements beingformulated within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationfor the loan of warships, and to submit proposals on thisbasis to the Turkish Government.T.        Vl&apos; 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Firstiime-expired Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (56) 203) on the retention of time-expiredregulars.       regulars in the Royal Navy.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in order to meeturgent commitments arising from the Suez Canal situation, the RoyalNavy would need to retain a number of men whose seven-year
6engagements were about to expire. At present these men wereleaving the Service at the rate of 500 a month. The correct meansof retaining them would be to take power to do so by Proclamation.He recognised that it would be politically undesirable to issue afurther Proclamation for this purpose until after the end of theinternational conference on the Suez Canal, but action would haveto be taken not later than 31st August. It was, however, the factthat the Proclamation issued in 1950 for the retention of time-expiredmen during the Korean war had never formally been cancelled; and,if there were serious political difficulties in making a freshProclamation at the present time, it might be possible to issueinstructions under the Proclamation of 1950 for the retention of anyman who was then serving and was still in the Service. This wouldnot, however, cover all the men that it would be necessary to retain,and it might also be thought undesirable to make use of aProclamation which had been issued for a different situation.Discussion showed that there was genera! agreement in theCabinet that it would be undesirable to issue a further Proclamationat this stage. Before the adjournment Parliament had been assuredthat the Government had all the powers required for strengtheningthe Forces as part of the precautionary measures that were beingtaken. In the circumstances it would be preferable to make use ofthe powers under the 1950 Proclamation, which had not in termsbeen limited to the purposes of the Korean war.The Cabinet-Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to use thepowers existing under the 1950 Proclamation for theretention of certain time-expired regulars in the Royal Navy.Cyprus. 5.   The Colonial Secretary said that he had been considering,(Previous        in consultation with the Governor of Cyprus, what response shouldReference:      be made on behalf of the United Kingdom Government to the actionCM. (56) 59th   of Eoka in giving public notice of their intention to suspend theirConclusions,    terrorist activities in the Island.   There was little doubt that theirMinute 2.) &apos;    decision was due to the increasing pressure to which they had beensubjected by the security forces in the Island, but it should not betaken as implying any change of heart on the part of the terroristleaders. There was evidence that they would use this respite, if theycould, to re-group their forces and to obtain further supplies of arms.In these circumstances he recommended that the Governor shouldbe authorised to make an early announcement of surrender termswhich would give the terrorists an opportunity to surrender with theirarms. The text of the proposed announcement was set out in Cyprustelegram No. 1676.  He also suggested that it should be announcedat the same time in London that Lord Radcliffe had agreed toaccelerate his work on the preparation of a new constitution with aview to making a second visit to Cyprus within the course of the nextfew weeks.In discussion various questions were raised about the conditionson which terrorists were to be invited to surrender themselves andtheir arms. It was agreed that the terms of the proposed offer shouldbe considered in detail by the Ministers immediately concerned.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement(2) Appointed a Committee consisting of Lord Chancellor (In the chair);Lord Privy Seal;Home Secretary;Colonial Secretary;Solicitor-General;
7CM. 60 (56)to consider, together with a representative of the ForeignSecretary, the terms on which terrorists in Cyprus shouldbe given an opportunity to surrender themselves andtheir arms; and to report their conclusions to the PrimeMinister.BechuanalandProtectorate.^Previous^Reference:CM. (56546thConclusions.Minute 10.)6. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in accordance withthe Cabinet&apos;s decision of 14th December, 1955, he had continued topursue the policy of supporting Rasebolai as Acting Native Authorityin the Bamangwato Reserve, in the hope that the tribe wouldeventually come to accept him as their Chief. Seretse Khama andTshekedi continued, however, to press their request for leave toreturn to the Reserve; and, in recent conversations which he had hadwith them, both had expressed their readiness, in return for suchleave, to renounce their claims to the Chieftainship. Seretse waswilling to make such a renunciation on behalf of his children as wellas himself. If satisfactory undertakings could be obtained fromthem, it might be possible to terminate their exile from the Reserveunder conditions which would not undermine the authority ofRasebolai.The Commonwealth Secretary said that his negotiations withSeretse and Tshekedi were not yet completed. He had, however,thought it right to mention them to his colleagues at this stage, sinceit was possible that information about them might be published inthe Press.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the CommonwealthSecretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,21st August, 1956.
