3CM. 31 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 30th April there would be a debate on an Opposition motionon agricultural policy. The Cabinet agreed that the Minister ofAgriculture should be the first Government spokesman on thisoccasion and that the Lord Privy Seal should reply to the debate.If Scottish aspects of the problem came under discussion, aParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland might also speakin the course of the debate.Local 2.   The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatGovernment on 27th April Government supporters in the House of CommonsFinance. would be asked to vote against the Third Reading of a Private(Previous Member&apos;s Bill on Industrial Rating Many of them felt someRefereni- sympathy with the purposes of the Bill and would be reluctant, toct(56023rd vote against it unless they were satisfied that good progress was beingConclusions made with the Government&apos;s review of local government finance.SnuteT) He therefore sought the Cabinet&apos;s authority to announce m the course}       of the debate on this Bill, that the Government s broad conclusionson the problem of local government finance would be made publicbefore the end of the current session.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be unfortunate iflocal authorities gained the impression that the Government intendedto reach conclusions on this problem without prior consultation withthem It might be preferable therefore to name a date on which theGovernment hoped to open consultations on this subject withrepresentatives of the local authorities.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto announce, in the debate on the Third Reading of theIndustrial Rating Bill on 27th April, that the Governmenthad made good progress with their review of local govern-ment finance, that they planned to open consultations onthis subject with representatives of the local authorities inthe autumn, and that they hoped that their conclusionswould be announced before the end of 1956.Capital 3.   The Cabinet were informed that on the previous day thePunishment House of Commons had made reasonable progress with the(Previous Committee Stage of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill. It nowReference: seemed unlikely that the House would wish to spend a dispropor-C.M. (56) 30th tionate length of time on this Bill, and the Committee Stage might beConclusions, completed in another two days. Amendments limiting the scopeMinute 3.) of the Bill might well be carried, and it was possible that the Billmight emerge from the Commons in such a confused form as toprejudice its chances of passing into law.There had been some misunderstanding about the effect of anamendment providing that the Bill should not apply to any offencefor which the penalty of death was prescribed by the Army and AirForce Acts and the Naval Discipline Act. This was of concern tothe Colonial Office, as well as the Service Departments; and furthersteps should now be taken to secure a concerted view, between theDepartments concerned, on the effect of the amendment and on thequestions of policy involved.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the progress made in the Committee Stage ofthe Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.49937 1 b 2
4(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consult with the HomeSecretary, Colonial Secretary, Service Ministers andAttorney-General on the application of this Bill to capitaloffences&apos;under the Army and Air Force Acts and theNaval Discipline Act.Industrial 4.   The Minister of Labour said that the Trade Unions in theDisputes. engineering industry were pressing a claim for equal pay for women(Previous workers which would cost about  50 millions a year.   They hadReference: asked that he should appoint a Court of Enquiry to examine theCM.(56)26th nature of the work done by women in engineering; but an investiga-Conclusions, tion of that kind could not appropriately be undertaken by a CourtMinute 3.) of Enquiry, and he would be obliged to inform the Unions that theirEngineering request could not be granted. This reply would be unwelcome to theIndustry. Unions, and there was some risk of industrial disturbance.In discussion concern was expressed about the decision of theAmalgamated Engineering Union to put forward a further substantialwage claim within a few weeks of the previous settlement. It mightbe wise to encourage the employers to make it clear without delaythat no further wage increase could be contemplated at this stage.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour and the President of the Board ofTrade, to consider and report to the Prime Minister howthe problems raised by the further wage claims in theengineering industry could best be handled.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 24thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPrivy Seal, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture (CP. (56) 102) on the proposal for an enquiry into thedisciplinary powers of the Agriculture Ministers and the provisionsfor security of tenure for tenant-farmers.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;sdecision of 21st March, he had discussed this proposal further withthe Agriculture Ministers. They were all agreed that there was littlechance that a limited enquiry would be completed in time forlegislation to be passed in the 1957-58 session. The alternative wasa more extensive enquiry culminating in a report soon after a newParliament had been elected. They recommended, however, thatbefore embarking on such an enquiry the Ministers concerned shouldfirst discuss with the leaders of the industry the general working ofthe Agriculture Acts and the Agricultural Holdings Acts in the lightof experience during the last eight or nine years, with particularreference to the Government&apos;s disciplinary powers and to therelationship of landlord and tenant. Such discussions might possiblydisclose sufficient common ground to enable the Government tointroduce amending legislation in the 1957-58 session. If, however,no acceptable basis for such legislation could be found, the discus-sions would at least provide a further justification for appointing anindependent enquiry.In discussion it was recognised that further consideration wouldneed to be given to the terms of reference of the proposed enquiry inthe light of the discussions that were to be held with the leaders ofthe industry.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (56) 102.
5CM. 31 (56)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHousing (C.P. (56) 101) submitting proposals to serve as a basis forearly legislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts. They also hadbefore them a memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandiCP. (56) 104) suggesting that the timing of the proposed legislationshould be considered in relation to the progress of the Valuation andRating (Scotland) Bill.The Minister of Housing said that the proposals in his memo-randum had been formulated by the Committee of Ministers whichhad been set up under his Chairmanship to consider the problem. Asa first step towards getting housing progressively on to an economicbasis, it was proposed that rents should be allowed to rise by stagesto new controlled, but more nearly economic, levels based on therateable value. It was also proposed that powers should be takento remove categories of houses from rent restriction altogether byregulation as opportunity permitted, and that the tenant should beentitled to claim a reduction of rent if the landlord failed to keep ahouse in proper repair. Legislation on these lines would not bepopular but it would be to the ultimate benefit of the tenant in certainrespects: it would ensure that houses were kept in better repair, andit would help to relieve the housing shortage by encouraging peopleto move from larger houses, which they were not fully occupying, tosmaller properties. In order that the beneficial effects of otherwiseunpopular leaislation should become apparent before the nextGeneral Election, it was desirable that, if the Cabinet approved therecommendations, the legislation should be enacted in the presentsession.Discussion showed that the Cabinet endorsed the proposed basisfor amending the Rent Restriction Acts and were agreed on the needfor early legislation on this subject. It was, however, recognised thatthere would be formidable difficulties in proceeding with thislegislation in the current session. The legislative programme, whichhad already been lightened, was still overloaded and it would not bepossible to accommodate a Bill on this subject unless the CopyrightBill and possibly some other measures were abandoned. Moreover,the introduction of this controversial legislation might provoke theOpposition to obstruct other Government business in the House ofCommons. The Government had been faced in recent months witha full measure of controversial subjects and it would be prudent, if itcould be avoided, not to add to their number. The Bill, if it was tobe enacted this session, would have to be introduced by the middleof May and this would precipitate the Scottish difficultiesforeshadowed in C.P. (56) 104. On the other hand, undesirable asthe prospect of delay might be, there would still be time for thebeneficial effects of the proposed legislation to become apparentbefore a General Election if a Bill were introduced as early aspossible in the next session and received the Royal Assent by31st March, 1957.After further discussion it was agreed that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of postponing this legislation until thebeginning of the next session, on the understanding that it would thenbe givenlhe highest priority.The Cabinet (1) Approved, as a basis for legislation to amend the RentRestriction Acts, the proposals outlined in paragraph 7 ofC.P. (56) 101.(2) Agreed that legislation on this subject should be givenpriority in the legislative programme for the forthcomingsession of- Parliament with a view to the Bill receiving theRoyal Assent by 31st March, 1957.RentRestriction.(PreviousReference :CM.

6Soviet Union. 7.   The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on theVisit of Soviet results of the discussions with the Soviet leaders, which had beenLeaders to the   concluded on the previous day.Umted The Prime Minister said that, in general, the talks had beenKingdom.       useful.  They had been conducted, on both sides, with candour and(Previous        realism. On some subjects, such as Germany and the Far East, thereReference :      was evidently no basis for agreement at the present time.  On otherCM. (56) 30th matters the Middle East, disarmament, trade and cultural contactsConclusions,  concrete results had been achieved which would be announced inMinute J.)      a public statement which was to be issued on the following day. Noconcessions had been made to the Soviet Government; and theopportunity had been taken, both at formal meetings and in privateconversations, to make a forthright statement of our views on suchmatters as religious toleration, the position of the Satellite countriesin Eastern Europe and Colonialism.On the Middle East a public declaration was to be made, onbehalf of the two Governments, which called on the States concernedto prevent an increase of tension in the Gaza strip and promisedsupport for United Nations action designed to secure a peacefulsettlement of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel. Theterms of this declaration were likely to give satisfaction in the UnitedStates. The declaration contained, it was true, nothing about thesupply of arms to countries in the Middle East. This question had,indeed, been the cause of some embarrassment to us in thediscussions; for we should ourselves have been unable to accept anyagreement which might have limited our freedom to supply arms toIraq. During the talks, however, the United Kingdomrepresentatives had stressed the advantages of restraint in the supplyof arms to the Middle Eastern countries; and, elsewhere in the publicdeclaration, the two Governments had undertaken to &quot; do theirutmost to put an end to the armaments race in all parts of the world.&quot;The Soviet representatives had been left in no doubt that the UnitedKingdom Government were determined to safeguard the supply ofoil from the Middle East, which was vital to the British economy:they had taken note of the statements made on this point, and hadsaid that these would be taken into account in the formulation oftheir policies towards the Middle East. In reply to their outspokencriticisms of the Bagdad Pact they had been assured that, so far aswe were concerned, this was purely a defensive organisation and that,if international tension in this area could be reduced, they couldexpect that increasing emphasis would be laid on the economic,rather than the military, purposes of the organisation. There wasno doubt that their anxieties about the Pact would be further allayedif it became possible to state publicly that no further military baseswould be established in the countries in the Middle East which weremembers of the Pact.On disarmament the Soviet representatives had been doubtfulwhether much practical progress would be made in the DisarmamentSub-Committee of the United Nations. The public declarationwould, however, indicate that both Governments were in favour ofmaking a start with a substantial reduction of conventional forcesand armaments, under appropriate international control. As regardsnuclear weapons, the Soviet leaders had accepted a wording whichimplied that nuclear warfare was as great a threat to the Soviet Unionas to capitalist countries. They shared our apprehension that thedevelopment of atomic energy for peaceful purposes might enableless responsible countries to manufacture nuclear weapons. Theyhad said that, in their view, the prohibition of nuclear tests was theonly effective safeguard to prevent this; but they had not pressed theirsuggestion for prohibition of further nuclear tests.On trade the Soviet representatives had made detailed proposalsfor a very considerable expansion of Anglo-Soviet trade. They had,of course, urged the withdrawal of the controls over trade in strategic
7CM. 31 (56)goods; but, even if the existing restrictions were maintained, theproposals which they had put forward could lead to a substantialincrease in exports from the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union.Indeed, the limiting factors were more likely to be our difficulty indelivering the goods they required and their difficulty in earning themeans of paying for them. They would have liked to tie us downto payment in maize and timber under a bilateral agreement, but thishad been avoided.On cultural exchanges a separate declaration was to be made.During the talks the United Kingdom representatives had made itplain that the Soviet Government could not expect an improvementin this aspect of Anglo-Soviet relations if they continued to use forthis purpose organisations in this country which were controlled byCommunists. They had undertaken to review their present practicesand procedures in this respect, though they had been unwilling tostate publicly that they would work in future through the SovietRelations Committee of the British Council.In conclusion the Prime Minister said that the visit of the Sovietleaders had given rise to fewer embarrassments than he had feared.He had no complaint to make of the mixed reception which they hadreceived from the public. The discussions, though they had producedfew immediate results, had at least ensured that the Soviet leadershad a clearer understanding of the considerations underlying theviews and policies of the United Kingdom Government on theimportant international problems of the day. If the SovietGovernment wished for a better understanding with the UnitedKingdom, they would at least have a clearer idea of the means bywhich it could be achieved.Finally, the Prime Minister said that the Soviet leaders hadpressed him to make a return visit to the Soviet Union. It would bedifficult for him to decline this invitation, but he proposed to say thatin view of his many other commitments he was at present unable tofix a definite date.The Cabinet Took note of this report on the course of the discussionswith the Soviet leaders.Commonwealth 8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofAffairs. the Exchequer (CP. (56) 96) covering a memorandum which hadGovernment     been prepared by the Treasury in agreement with the CommonwealthBorrowers.      Relations Office and the Colonial Office on the question of accordingtrustee status to the securities of Commonwealth countries which hadsevered their direct link with the Crown.It was stated in the memorandum that stocks issued by theseCommonwealth Governments could not enjoy trustee status becausethey no longer fulfilled the requirements of the Colonial Stock Acts.The issue had arisen most urgently in the case of India. The IndianGovernment wished to borrow on the London market but theirprospects of raising money there would be prejudiced by the fact thattheir stocks would not enjoy trustee status. We were committed toassisting sound economic development in the Commonwealth byproviding long-term finance within the limits of our resources and itwas to our interest to continue to do so. It was recommended,therefore, that the Colonial Stock Acts should be revised to takeaccount of constitutional development in the Commonwealth byextending the present system governing trustee stocks to Common-wealth countries which severed the direct link with the Crown,subject to conditions which would give guarantees of stockholders&apos;rights equivalent to those now required by the Colonial Stock Acts.
8The memorandum sought authority in the first instance for anapproach to the Government of India on this basis.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C.P. (56) 96.Aden.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 22ndConclusions.Minute 13.)9. The Colonial Secretary said that the report of theindependent Commission which had enquired into the recent seriesof strikes in Aden would be published that day. The Commissionhad concluded that the strikes were due primarily to economic andindustrial conditions and that there was no clear evidence ofsubversive activity by political agents. It would, however, benecessary to study the report of the Commission before deciding whataction should be taken to deal with any genuine industrial grievances.Meanwhile, he was satisfied that the Governor had the necessarypowers to deal with the situation.In discussion concern was expressed about the recent decision ofimportant firms to close down their operations in Aden. It wasimportant to restore stability to the Colony as quickly as possible,since continued unrest in Aden would have disturbing effects on thesituation in the adjacent Protectorates.Reference was made to a suggestion, put forward by the LordPresident, that Governors of Colonies should have reserve powers toenable them to take certain limited action to preserve order withoutgoing to the length of declaring a state of emergency.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the ColonialSecretary, to submit to the Colonial Policy Committeehis proposal for strengthening the powers of ColonialGovernors to deal with disorder.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,26th April, 1956.
