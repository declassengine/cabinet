3CM. 11 (56)EconomicSituation.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 7thConclusions.)*1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the measuresneeded to reduce the inflationary pressure in the national economy.They had before them a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (56) 32) covering a summary of revised proposals which he haddrawn up after further consultation with the Ministers concernedand the draft of an announcement of these measures which heproposed, subject to the views of the Cabinet, to make in the Houseof Commons on 15th February. The measures proposed includedreductions in the current and investment expenditure of the Govern-ment, the nationalised industries and the local authorities; the sale,in order to reduce imports, of stocks of sugar and raw materials, andsome postponement of coal imports; and the further restriction of hirepurchase credit.The Cabinet first considered the proposals relating to investmentexpenditure in the public sector of the economy. They were informedthat most of these involved only a postponement of programmedexpenditure. This point would be emphasised in any public statement,more particularly in respect of programmes on which someundertaking or pledge had already been given or implied.In detailed discussion of this part of the Chancellor&apos;s proposalsthe following points were made:  (a) Transport. The cancellation of  5 millions worth of ordersfor lorries for the British Transport Commission would help to reducethe strain on the engineering industries.(b) Electricity The Chairman of the Central ElectricityAuthority was unwilling to accept any further reduction in hisinvestment programme and the reduction proposed might have tobe enforced by way of a formal direction by the Minister. Theproposed cut of  10 millions represented a postponement of about5 per cent, of the total investment programme for electricity and wasnot out of line with the reductions proposed in other fields. The cutswould be divided evenly between generating ( 100 millions) anddistribution ( 72 millions). Care would be taken to ensure that theydid not fall disproportionately on the development of ruralelectrification, although they would necessarily have the effect ofreducing the pace of that development.(c) Scottish Electricity. The South of Scotland ElectricityBoard, after reducing their programme from  19 millions to 16 millions, would nevertheless soend  1 million more in 1956 thanin 1955.(d) Gas. The reduction of  5 millions represented a real cut inexpenditure, not merely the postponement of a programme.(e) Air. The Minister of Transport said that, in addition to the 1| millions already agreed, he was considering further possible cutsin the expenditure of the Air Corporations.(/) Development Areas. The proposals in paragraph 13 ofCP. (56) 32 did not extend to expenditure by the Northern IrelandDevelopment Commission, which operated under a separate scheme.(g) Home Defence. As a result of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion onthe previous day, it had been agreed that the total Estimate for defenceexpenditure by Civil Departments would be  44-72 millions, andnot  43i millions as stated in paragraph 15 of CP. (56) 32.(h) Miscellaneous Local Authority Expenditure. The Ministerof Health said that he had reached agreement with the Chancellorof the Exchequer on the cuts to be imposed on certain minor itemsof investment in local health services, but he could not accept afurther cut of  \\ millions in expenditure on old people&apos;s homes.This programme had already been reduced, in comparison with theprevious year, from  4-4 millions to about  3 millions.   Delay inOriginally recorded in a Confidential Annex.49599 2
4providing these homes would make it more difficult to relieve thepressure on accommodation in hospitals and mental institutions. Itwould be unfortunate if local authorities had now to be restrainedfrom incurring expenditure on this service, when they were beginningto respond to the pressure which had been applied to them to buildthese homes.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat there was insufficient reason to exempt this particular servicefrom restrictions which were to be applied generally over the wholefield of miscellaneous investment expenditure by local authorities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be prepared toreview the matter again at the end of six months and to consider thenwhether any higher rate of expenditure for this service might beauthorised.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult furtherwith the Minister of Health, in the light of their discussion,on the reduction which should be applied to the provisionof old people&apos;s homes.(i) Roads. The Minister of Transport said that the reductionfrom  16 millions to  15J millions on major road improvements mustbe viewed in the context of the temporary abandonment of the newroad programme, the cost of which had been expected to rise to amaximum of  40 millions in three years&apos; time. The postponementof this programme would be unpopular and would be criticised. Theseparate provision of  34 millions did not relate to expenditure onthe improvement of minor roads as such but to the cost of eliminating,in the interests of safety, the more dangerous road hazards,particularly at the approaches to the large towns. This expenditurecould not be further curtailed, especially as only  250,000 was spentdirectly on road safety measures. The local authorities were beingurged to concentrate their expenditure on safety projects in preferenceto maintenance work and the improvement of road surfaces.(/&apos;) School Building. The Minister of Education said that theproblem of imposing a cut on capital expenditure by local educationauthorities was complicated by the fact that the school-buildingprogramme was already in arrear. The buildings which representedthe arreas of 1955 would in fact be started in 1956 and the cost ofthis additional work added to the programme would effectively nullifythe cut of  10 millions which had been proposed in the programmeitself. In order to impose an effective cut on actual building he hadoffered to put a limit of  25 millions on starts of new school buildingsin the first half of the next financial year and to discuss later with theChancellor of the Exchequer a corresponding limit for the secondhalf of the year. These limits were calculated in terms of the cost ofthe buildings when completed and would not, therefore, reflect theactual saving to be achieved in expenditure in that year. This stepwould, however, result in the postponement of nearly  30 millionsworth of school building. This action would, of course be representedas inconsistent with statements in the forthcoming White Paper onTechnical Education which stressed the importance of an improvedprovision of secondary schools.In discussion concern was expressed lest such a reduction in theschool-building programme might involve the Government in breachof undertakings given at the time of the Election and reaffirmed in thedebate on the economic situation as late as the previous November.The undertaking to provide 200,000 places and to accelerate theprogress of the rural reorganisation scheme was one of the few actualpledges involving expenditure which the Government had given atthe time of the Election. This suggested that further considerationshould be given to the manner in which the proposals would be
5CM. 11 (56)announced. It could fairly be said that the educational buildingprogramme was not being abandoned or curtailed but would, throughforce of economic circumstances, take somewhat longer than hadbeen expected to carry out. It would also be right in any suchstatement to lay stress on the volume of school building which was infact being completed. In a period of overstrained resources thepostponement of fresh starts would contribute to this by releasinglabour and materials for the earlier completion of buildings alreadystarted. It would, however, be necessary to convince public opinionthat the Government&apos;s disinflationary measures were effective enoughto prevent labour and materials being diverted to less essential typesof building.The Cabinet (2) Approved  the  proposals  outlined  by  the  Minister ofEducation in regard to the school-building programme.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Education, to consider further in the lightof their discussion the terms in which the Government&apos;sdecision in this matter should be announced.The Cabinet next considered the proposals relating to importsand the sale of stocks. In this part of the discussion the followingpoints were made:  (k) The President of the Board of Trade, the CommonwealthSecretary and the Colonial Secretary would consider, in consultation,what effect the sale of 400,000 tons of Government stocks of sugarmight have on our obligations under the Commonwealth SugarAgreement and on our trade relations with Cuba.(/) The President of the Board of Trade said that it would be avery considerable marketing operation to dispose of  50 millionsworth of strategic stocks within the year. Unless the operation werehandled carefully in consultation with the various trades concerned,the stability of commodity markets might be endangered. Schemesfor these disposal operations were at present being formulated inconsultation with the Treasury.In considering the proposals relating to current Governmentexpenditure the following points were noted:  (m) Farm Prices. The Cabinet were informed that, on aprovisional forecast, provision for agricultural subsidies for theforthcoming year might amount to  15-20 millions more than thecorresponding provision for the current year. Farmers&apos; costs hadrisen by  40 millions since the previous review.in) Administrative Costs. The Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat the Treasury would be ready to discuss with Departments in thefollowing week the steps necessary to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;sdecision that Civil Service numbers should be reduced.The Cabinet then turned to discussion of the proposals todiscontinue the bread subsidy and to raise the retail price of milk.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these proposals mustbe considered in relation to the total economic problem with whichthe Government were faced. The economic situation, measured bya deficit of  100 millions which the United Kingdom had incurred oncurrent overseas account in 1955, was grave and there was noimmediate prospect of improvement. The level of investment in thenationalised industries was the measure of the rate at which inflationwas increasing. The proposed cuts in investment were, as had beenseen, mainly cuts in programmes and not in actual expenditure. Atbest, even if the cuts were fully effective, investment expenditure wouldnot be reduced by more than about  70 millions. Rightly or wrongly,the removal of the bread subsidy had come to be regarded by informed
6observers, in this country and abroad, as a test of the Government&apos;sdetermination to deal effectively with the economic problem; and,with a further heavy trade deficit in January, there was risk of aserious loss of confidence in sterling. The removal of the breadsubsidy would directly reduce the inflationary pressure by some 40 millions. The additional small burden that would be thrown onpoor people (calculated at 5d. a week for each person) could be offsetby an increase in National Assistance scales, although the presentscales would not in fact be inadequate until the cost of living had risenfrom its present level of 154 points to 158 points. These proposalsfor changes in the prices of bread and milk would add 1   76 points tothe cost of living. A rise of this order in the cost-of-living indexshould not be a governing factor in stimulating wage claims, whichwould continue to be pressed while there were prospects of forcingemployers to award increases. Hardship could scarcely be claimedwhen national expenditure on sweets had risen from  40 millions to 250 millions since the end of rationing.The Minister of Labour said that the removal of the bread subsidywould be bound to have a considerable psychological effect in wagenegotiations and, by reason of its ultimate effect on wages, was morelikely to prove inflationary than disinflationary. The total wagesbill, which had risen by  100 millions even when a policy of wagerestraint was in force, had risen by  300 millions in 1955 and wouldrise by a similar amount in 1956. But the prospects of achievingmoderation in wage claims for the next round of negotiation werebetter now than they had been for a long time. The cost of livingwas at present steady and likely to stay so. The influence of theleaders of the major Trade Unions was being exerted in favour ofrestraint. The more responsible elements in the Trade Unionmovement would fail to comprehend the action of the Governmentin deliberately increasing the cost of living at this stage, and the leaderswould be unable to sustain a policy of moderation if the Governmenttook this step. Moreover, the wages of 3 million workers were relateddirectly to movements in the cost-of-living index. The removal ofthe subsidies would not be disinflationary in effect if it gave renewedstimulus to the pressure on wages. Nor would it help simply topostpone the removal of the bread subsidy until the forthcomingbudget, for the majority of wage claims which would be negotiatednext year would, in fact, be formulated at conferences to take placeduring Easter and Whitsun this year.The Cabinet (6) Agreed to resume at their next meeting their discussion ofthe proposals to discontinue the bread subsidy and to raisethe price of milk.Statement onDefence, 1956.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Minister of Defence invited the Cabinet&apos;s decision ontwo outstanding points on the draft Statement on Defence, 1956,which had been circulated with CP. (56) 30.(a) The Minister of Defence recalled that, in their discussion onthe previous day, the Cabinet had agreed that the passage in the draftStatement dealing with evacuation policy should emphasise the factthat the Government&apos;s first task must be to complete their plans forthe evacuation of the priority classes. The Cabinet had contemplatedthat the words &quot; this will be our first task &quot; should be included afterthe second sentence of the draft paragraph set out in paragraph 2 ofCP. (56) 30.The Minister of Defence said that, on further reflection, he would,prefer that this addition should not be made to that paragraph of theWhite Paper. It was already stated, in the preceding sentence, thatfirst attention should be given to the evacuation of the priority classes,0
7CM. 11 (56)and it seemed unnecessary to repeat that statement in different words.He would prefer to deal with this point in the course of his speechin the debate on the White Paper. He could then explain that, inaddition to this organised movement of the priority classes, theGovernment contemplated that there might be a further measure ofdispersal from the centres of the more densely populated areas.(b) The Minister of Defence said that he had also given furtherthought to the wording of paragraph 131 of the draft, whichforeshadowed a reduction in the Government&apos;s strategic stocks ofindustrial raw materials. He now proposed that this paragraphshould read as follows:  &quot; The strategic holdings of industrial raw materials are largeand, in the light of the new priorities, can be run down to someextent without risk. The Government have decided to makea start on this in 1956-57, which will lead to a continuing savingin the heavy cost of turnover. Care will be taken to avoiddisrupting markets; where substantial quantities of anycommodity are involved, the arrangements will be discussed withthe appropriate interests.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Approved the amendments which the Minister of Defenceproposed to make in paragraphs 117 and 131 of the draftStatement on Defence, 1956.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to include these amendedparagraphs in the draft Statement, and took note that theStatement would be presented to Parliament on17th February.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,10th February, 1956.
