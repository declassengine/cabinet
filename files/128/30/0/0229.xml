CM. 5 (56)Pensions 1.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord Chancellor(Increase) Bill, covering the report of a Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs(Previous Committee (CP. (56) 19) on proposals for increases in the pensionsReference:      of retired public servants.CM (55) 41st jfie Lora, chancellor said that pensions increases for retiredConclusions,     members of the central and local government services and retiredMinute 9.)       officers of the Armed Forces had hitherto been confined to thesmaller pensions and had been subject to a means test.  It was nowproposed to modify the definitions of hardship which had beenapplied by successive Governments by eliminating the means test andmaking no distinction between pensioners with and pensionerswithout dependants and (subject to a maximum varying from 60- 100 in any one case) to increase pensions by a percentagevarying between 6 and 10 per cent, in recognition of the rise in thecost of living since 1952.  The annual cost of the proposed increaseswould be somewhere between  10 and  11 millions. These proposalswould provoke some criticism. First, there would be pressure, whichthe proposal to abolish the means test would reinforce, that theGovernment should take urgent action to meet the claims of otherelements in the community who depended on public funds and mightbe considered to be in greater hardship than retired public servants.Secondly, the proposals were less favourable to the classes ofpensioners who would be affected by them than alternative proposalswhich had been worked out by a group of Government supporters.Those proposals would cost between  20 and  25 millions annually.The Government had announced in November their intention ofintroducing legislation on this subject in the near future.   But, inview of the repercussions which could now be foreseen, the Cabinetwould wish to consider carefully what course of action should bepursued.The Minister of Pensions said that, while he did not dissent fromthe proposals set out in CP. (56) 19), they would make it impossiblefor him, in resisting pressure for corresponding benefits for othergroups dependent upon public funds, to rely on the argument thatthe Government had been concerned only to meet hardship. Hetherefore wished to be able to state that the measures which he hadin mind for dealing with family allowances, old workmen&apos;scompensation cases, widows, and the earnings rule for retirementpensions, would be considered on their merits as opportunity offeredand to undertake that relief would be forthcoming for the more acutecases.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned first on the question whether itwould be justifiable to award the proposed increases in the presenteconomic situation; and, secondly, on the question whether, if theproposals were put into effect, this was the time to relax the hardshipconditions which had previously been applied.On the first question it was argued that the Government couldnot reasonably refrain from carrying out intentions which had beenannounced, and subsequently reaffirmed, during a period in whichdeterioration in the economic situation had already become apparentand the Government had been taking steps to meet it. On thesecond question, there was support for the view that this would bean inopportune moment to relax hardship conditions. Against this,it was pointed out that the proposals would fail in their purpose ifthey were made subject to hardship limitations.The Cabinet were informed that it would be difficult to findParliamentary time in the current session for the legislation whichwould be needed on such parallel matters as family allowances andthe old cases of workmen&apos;s compensation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he saw no alternativebut to proceed with the proposals in CP. (56) 19, in the knowledgethat the abolition of the hardship limitations, which he would have49597 2 B 2
4preferred in present circumstances to have been able to retain, wouldlead eventually to the concession of parallel claims amounting to 5 or  6 millions. He hoped that, although these claims would haveto be dealt with as they came up, the Minister of Pensions would beable to avoid giving any assurances about them in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals for pensions increases annexed toCP. (56) 19.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to decide, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofPensions, what action should be taken to explain theGovernment&apos;s policy to Government supporters, and toarrange for an announcement of the Government&apos;sproposals to be made in the House of Commons ata suitable opportunity in the immediate future.Cyprus.(PreviousReferences:CM. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 1 andCM. (55) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)Broadcastsfrom Athens.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecretary and Colonial Secretary (CP. (56) 18) recommending thatthe Governor of Cyprus should be authorised to arrange fordiscriminate jamming of subversive broadcasts from Athens toCyprus, on the understanding that these arrangements would bebrought into force if the present discussions with ArchbishopMakarios broke down or if, in spite of an agreement with theArchbishop, hostile broadcasts continued to be made from Athensto Cyprus.The Colonial Secretary said that he fully recognised theinternational objections to this course; but he and the ForeignSecretary had come reluctantly to the conclusion that, as the GreekGovernment were unwilling or unable to control these broadcasts,we had no alternative but to take physical measures to prevent theirbeing heard in Cyprus. If the Governor was to succeed in maintain-ing order in the Island, he must have the means of preventing thedeliberate incitements to violence which were being broadcast fromAthens.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Postmaster-General said that the Cabinet should beaware of the probable consequences of this action. The Greeks couldcertainly retaliate by jamming broadcasts from the Cyprusbroadcasting station. They might also be able to jam the Arabicbroadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation.The Cabinet agreed that, in the circumstances envisaged, theseconsequences would have to be accepted.(b) It was thought unlikely that the Greek Government wouldlodge a complaint with the United Nations against our jamming ofbroadcasts from Athens. In view of the character of thosebroadcasts, such a complaint would carry little weight.(c) This action was likely, however, to be challenged inParliament; and the Government should be ready to justify it byreference to the character of the broadcasts. The Colonial Secretarysaid that excerpts from these broadcasts could if necessary bepublished in the form of a White Paper; and he undertook to arrangefor a White Paper to be prepared and held in readiness forpublication.The Cabinet Agreed that the Governor of Cyprus should be authorisedto arrange for discriminate jamming of subversivebroadcasts from Athens to Cyprus, on the understandingthat these arrangements would be brought into force if the

(55) 27thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP. (56) 15) on the future of the existing controlover the distribution of newsprint.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that on 28th July theCabinet had authorised him to make an announcement foreshadowingthe withdrawal of this control after a period of six months, duringwhich the manufacturers and users of newsprint would arrangeamong themselves to regulate consumption within the total ofsupplies available so that adequate provision would be made for theneeds of the smaller newspapers. In the event the newspapers hadfailed to make a satisfactory agreement for sharing the availablesupplies. There was no assurance that adequate provision would bemade to meet the needs of the smaller newspapers. And, with theexception of The Times, all the newspapers were now anxious thatthe existing control should be maintained. In these circumstancesthere seemed no alternative but to continue the control for the timebeing, on the basis that manufacturers and users would continue theirefforts to find means which would enable it to be withdrawn beforethe end of 1956. In this event, however, an arbitrary decision wouldhave to be taken about the future size of The Times. This newspaperhad now completed its plans for using mechanical printing paper,instead of newsprint, and wished to increase its size from its presentaverage of 15 pages to 24 pages. If it were allowed to do this, itwould secure a marked advantage over other newspapers; and heproposed, by way of a compromise, that The Times should be limitedto 21 pages so long as the present control over the distribution ofnewsprint was maintained.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the existing schemewas designed to control the distribution of newsprint; and, if TheTimes chose to use a more expensive form of paper, he saw no reasonwhy it should be brought within the scheme at all. He was, however,concerned, from the point of view of conserving foreign exchange,to prevent any increase in imports of newsprint; and he suggestedthat the newspapers should now be informed that they would not beallowed to increase their existing contracts for overseas purchase ofnewsprint.The President of the Board of Trade said that the suggestionmade by the Chancellor involved the adoption of a new policy quitedifferent from that which he had been following, with the Cabinet&apos;sauthority. If this strict limit was to be applied to the import ofnewsprint, he could not expect the newspapers to continue theirefforts to dispense with the control over distribution. Nor did hethink it would be reasonable to exempt The Times from all limitationof size while the other newspapers remained subject to thedistribution scheme. Before the Cabinet considered the matterfurther he would like to have an opportunity of discussing it withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to discuss the future of the Govern-ment control over the distribution of newsprint, and agreedto consider this problem further at a meeting in thefollowing week.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,23rd January, 1956.
