3CM. 20 (56)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 14th March there would be a debate on Cyprus. TheGovernment spokesmen in this debate would be the Prime Ministerand the Colonial Secretary.The Report Stage of the Teachers (Superannuation) Bill couldnot now be taken until the week beginning 19th March.Capital 2.   The Cabinet discussed the handling of the debate whichPunishment    was to take place in the House of Commons on 12th March on the(Previous        Second Reading of the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.   They hadReference:      before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. (56) 70)CM. (56) 16th indicating the line which he proposed to take in this debate.Conclusions, The Cabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should not on thisMinute 6.) &apos; occasion develop at length the case in favour of capital punishmentbut should confine himself to making it clear that the Governmentremained of the opinion that it should be retained. There wereindications of some change of opinion in the House of Commons onthis question. If members of the Government had the same freedomto abstain from voting as they had enjoyed on the Governmentmotion advocating the retention of the death penalty, it was likelythat the Second Reading of the Bill would be carried. On the otherhand, it was now beginning to be realised that this Bill might becomea source of political embarrassment to the Government; and, if itwere made known that all members of the Government would beasked on that account to vote against the Bill, some of the Govern-ment supporters who favoured abolition of the death penalty wouldbe prepared to vote against the Bill or to abstain from voting. Inthat event the Bill might well be defeated on Second Reading.Despite this, the Cabinet took the view that on the Second Readingof the Bill members of the Government should be free to abstainfrom voting.The Cabinet next discussed how the further stages of the Billshould be handled if it obtained a Second Reading. They agreedthat nothing should be said in the Second Reading debate about thenumber of days which would be made available for the Committeeand Report Stages; for, if such an announcement were made,Members who were opposed to the Bill would be encouraged to tablefrivolous amendments. The Home Secretary might, however,indicate, early in the Committee Stage, that it was in the Govern-ment&apos;s interest to see that the further proceedings on the Bill werehandled in a workmanlike way so as to avoid undue encroachmenton other Government business. This consideration should influencethe Government&apos;s attitude towards amendments. It would be theresponsibility of the Chair to see that purely wrecking amendmentswere not called. The Government should also do what they couldto see that time was not spent in the discussion of frivolous amend-ments. Serious questions would, however, be raised by way of amend-ment for example, whether the Bill should extend to NorthernIreland or to the Colonies, and whether it should apply to murdersof policemen or prison warders. On such issues as these theGovernment would be expected to give firm advice to the House.As regards the form of the Bill, it was recalled that in replyingto a Parliamentary Question on 23rd February the Prime Ministerhad not excluded the possibility that the Government might give sometechnical assistance in connection with the Bill. The HomeSecretary said that the opponents of the Bill should not, in his view,be given expert help in drafting amendments during the CommitteeStage. It would, however, be the duty of the Government to see thatthe Bill was in proper form before it left the Commons; and theGovernment should arrange that any necessary amendments for thispurpose were brought forward on the Report Stage.49812-4 B 2
4The Lord President asked that, throughout the proceedings inthe House of Commons, it should be remembered that the Bill waslikely to be rejected by the House of Lords. From this point of viewit was desirable that the Government should take as littleresponsibility for it as they could during its passage through theCommons.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in the division on the Second Reading of theCapital Punishment (Abolition) Bill back-benchsupporters of the Government should be allowed a freevote but members of the Government should not be freeto vote in favour of the Bill.(2) Approved the proposals put forward by the Home Secretaryin CP. (56) 70 regarding the line which he should take inthe Second Reading debate; and, in the conduct of anyfurther proceedings on the Bill, invited him to be guidedby the views expressed in their discussion.Cost ofLiving.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 4thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (56) 66) and the Minister of Pensions (CP. (56) 67) onthe proposed introduction of a new Index of Retail Prices.The Minister of Labour said that this new Index had beenrecommended by the Cost of Living Advisory Committee on the basisof a widespread enquiry into household budgets. The existingInterim Index did not adequately reflect the changed pattern ofhousehold expenditure, and the introduction of a new and up-to-dateIndex would be welcomed. He proposed to accept the AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendations and to introduce the new Indexforthwith. It would show future monthly changes in the level ofretail prices compared with the level in January 1956, as a base date.But, in order to show the movement of prices since 1947, he proposedto publish, in addition to the new Index, a figure linking the all-itemsfigure of the new Index to the existing Interim Index.The Cabinet approved the proposals put forward by theMinister of Labour for the introduction of the new Index of RetailPrices. Discussion turned on the question whether a separate Indexfigure should be published reflecting the expenditure of the lowestincome groups.The Minister of Pensions said that the new Index would be basedon calculations reflecting the pattern of expenditure in nine-tenthsof all households in the United Kingdom. But expenditure of thelowest income groups, including persons on National Assistance,would be expressly excluded from these calculations. There wouldtherefore be strong political pressure for the publication of a separateIndex applicable to those groups. All the material for the compila-tion of such an Index would be available; and, if the Governmentdeclined to publish it, they would be accused of suppressing it fortheir own convenience. He therefore favoured the publication of aseparate Index which would serve as a guide in considering claims bypensioners, persons on National Assistance and others in the lowestincome groups.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the Cabinetwas against the publication of a separate Index of this kind. Officialpublication of two different Indices of Retail Prices was likely to leadto confusion. It was undesirable that claimants, whether for wagesor for social benefits, should be able to support their claims byreference to whichever of two Indices was the more favourable tothem.
5CM. 20 (56)The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Minister ofLabour in CP. (56) 66, and authorised him to publish thereport of the Cost of Living Advisory Committee and tointroduce the new Index of Retail Prices as fromJanuary 1956.(2) Agreed that no arrangements should be made at present topublish a separate Index for the lowest income groups,and that political pressure for the publication of such aseparate Index should be resisted for as long as possible.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to consult with the LordPrivy Seal on the terms in which these decisions should beannounced.WarPensions.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 8thConclusions.Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions (CP. (56) 64) on claims for increases of the basicdisablement pension for ex-servicemen and of the pensions ofdisabled ex-servicemen who had lost limbs.The Minister of Pensions said that the British Legion had urgedthat the basic disablement pension should be increased to 90s., inorder to restore more nearly the purchasing value it possessed in1938 when it stood at 405. There was substance in this claim, andit was true that more generous pensions were paid by the UnitedStates and certain Commonwealth countries. This pension had,however, been raised to its present level of 67.?. 6d. in 1955: anincrease of Is. would cost  1 million: and in the current economicsituation it would be difficult to meet the claim which had been putforward. He therefore proposed, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval,to inform the National President of the British Legion that he hadcome reluctantly to the conclusion that no further increase in thispension could be contemplated at present. He undertook to consultwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the precise wording of hisreply to the British Legion.The claim for an additional allowance for disabled men whohad lost limbs in the first World War rested on the argument that thewearing of artificial limbs became more burdensome with advancingage. As a result, the relative disadvantage in which a limbless manfound himself in comparison with a man in full health did not remainconstant but actually increased. This had not hitherto been admittedas a valid argument, but it now appeared that medical opinion mightbe changing on this point. He therefore proposed that the MedicalResearch Council or, if they were unable to undertake it, somealternative professional body should carry out an investigation intothis question.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward by the Minister ofPensions in CP. (56) 64.Volta RiverProject.(PreviousReference :C.C. (52) 99thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 60) and the Colonial Secretary(CP. (56) 71) on the next stage of negotiations on the Volta Riveraluminium scheme.The President of the Board of Trade said that the PreparatoryCommission would shortly complete its examination of the scheme.Their report would disclose a formidable increase in the prospectivecapital cost of the project. The United Kingdom would be requiredto make a direct investment of  72 millions instead of  52 millions asformerly expected.   Moreover, as the Gold Coast would be able to49812 4b 3
draw on their sterling balances for their investment of  75 millions,and the aluminium companies would have the right to raise half oftheir investment on the London market, the total burden on ourbalance of payments might amount to well over  150 millions.The economic purpose of the scheme might have been achievedby a much smaller investment in Canada. It had, however, otheradvantages as a means of reducing dollar expenditure and as animaginative project of Commonwealth development. We could notnow withdraw from it without adverse effects on our relations withthe Gold Coast. But, if it were to go forward, we must find anexternal source for a substantial part of the capital sum required.He therefore proposed that we should inform the Gold CoastGovernment that the pattern of investment contemplated in 1952would now need to be reconsidered, and that the World Bank shouldbe approached as a possible external source of funds. Finally, if theproject were to be undertaken, he would wish to consider with hiscolleagues how the participation of the Government in it could bestbe organised. The management of a complicated scheme of this kindcould not readily be undertaken as part of the ordinary responsibilitiesof a single Department of Government.The Colonial Secretary supported this view. He added that thedifficulties of arranging for effective control and management of thisproject in the Gold Coast would be enhanced by the gradualwithdrawal of British officials and technical experts from the serviceof the Gold Coast Government during the period of transition toself-government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed thatexternal funds should be sought for this project. He had arrangedfor calculations to be made of the scale of investment which,assuming participation by the World Bank, we might be able toafford.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Our views on the financing of this scheme should be explainedto the Gold Coast Government well in advance of the meeting ofexperts which was to be held in London in April.(b) The preliminary investigation of the scheme had beenundertaken on the basis of evidence, set out in Cmd. 8702, that aserious shortage of aluminium must be expected to develop if no stepswere taken to meet it. This evidence had not yet been questioned.It was important, therefore, that the matter should not be handled insuch a way as to induce pessimism in the aluminium companies asthat would in turn influence the attitude of the World Bank to theproject.(c) The World Bank, if they agreed to participate, were likely toinsist that the project should be put to international tender. Thispossibility would have to be faced, although it might result incontracts for some of the work on the project being placed elsewhere,with significant consequences for our balance of payments.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in CP. (56) 60 for handling the nextstage of the negotiations on the Volta River aluminiumscheme.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the ColonialSecretary, in consultation, to arrange for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s present attitude in the matter, and the reasonsfor it, to be outlined to the Gold Coast Government inadvance of the discussions due to take place in April.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate to theCabinet a memorandum setting out the level of invest-ment in the scheme which the United Kingdom might, inpresent circumstances, be able to finance.
7CM. 20 (56)(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and the ColonialSecretary, to consider and report to the Prime Ministerwhat special arrangements should be made, within theGovernment, for supervising the United Kingdominterests in this project.CommonwealthMembership.Gold Coast.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)6.   The Colonial Secretary recalled that the constitutionaladviser to the Gold Coast Government had been working out ascheme of constitutional development for discussion by a conferenceof all political parties in the Gold Coast.   The leading oppositiongroup, the National Liberation Movement, had refused to co-operatewith the constitutional adviser and had now declined to attend theconference. There was therefore little prospect that the constitutionaldispute between the political parties in the Gold Coast could beresolved by negotiation; and there seemed no alternative but to holda general election on the constitutional issue. The Prime Minister ofthe Gold Coast was, however, seeking to avoid the holding of anelection, on the pretext that there would be large-scale intimidationof voters and possibly some bloodshed. The Governor of the Colony,who was at present on leave in this country, had no reason to believethat the conduct of an election on this issue at the present time wouldbe substantially worse than that of previous elections in the GoldCoast, and he advised that an election was the only way of avoidinga constitutional deadlock.The Colonial Secretary said that in these circumstances heproposed to inform the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast that HerMajesty&apos;s Government would welcome a general election on theconstitutional issue; and that, if his constitutional proposals wereaccepted by a reasonable majority of the newly-elected legislativeassembly, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to declarea firm date for the Gold Coast&apos;s attainment of full self-governmentwithin the Commonwealth.The Cabinet-Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement andauthorised him to communicate with the Prime Minister ofthe Gold Coast in the sense which he proposed.South-West 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAfrica. Commonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (56) 72) seeking approval of aproposal that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should intervene inproceedings before the International Court of Justice on theadmissibility of oral hearings of petitioners from South-West Africa.The Cabinet were informed that the purpose of such anintervention would be, not to support the South African Governmentin resisting the claim of the United Nations to exercise supervisionover South-West Africa, but to ensure that no ruling was given by theInternational Court which might imply that the United Nations hadsome supervisory jurisdiction over dependent territories within theCommonwealth.The Attorney-General said that the Law Officers had not in factadvised, as stated in paragraph 5 of CP. (56) 72, that the InternationalCourt ought on merits to rule that oral hearings from South-WestAfrica were not admissible. The advice which they had given wasthat a fairly strong argument could be put before the Court insupport of this view. Information was now available about the linewhich the United States Government were proposing to take at the
8hearing. They proposed to argue that, as the South African Govern-ment were unwilling to furnish to the United Nations the informationabout South-West Africa which they would have been required togive to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, the UnitedNations were entitled to use other means of informing themselvesof conditions in South-West Africa. At first sight it seemed that thiswas an argument which we need not oppose. A ruling based on it jwould not carry any implication that the United Nations had somesupervisory jurisdiction over dependent territories within theCommonwealth. It might therefore suffice if a United Kingdomrepresentative attended the hearing before the International Courtwith a watching brief. He could argue the construction of theopinion given by the Court in 1950 and could, by emphasising thespecial status of South-West Africa, make it clear that the decisionon this case would have no application to dependent territories withinthe Commonwealth.The Cabinet Agreed that a United Kingdom representative should attendthis hearing before the International Court with a watchingbrief authorising him to intervene, if necessary, to argue theconstruction of the opinion given by the Court in 1950 andin order to stress the difference in status between South-west Africa and the dependent territories of theCommonwealth.Cost of 8.  The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofMeat the Exchequer (CP. (56) 50) and the Minister of AgricultureInspection.      (C.P. (56) 69) on the question whether the cost of meat inspectionshould be borne by the local authorities, by the Exchequer, or by themeat industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although the amountinvolved was insignificant, he was anxious to avoid any new Exchequergrant which, by provoking other claims, might prejudice the positionof the Exchequer in relation to the major review of local governmentfinance which was now in progress. Equal justification could beclaimed for financial support for a great number of other localgovernment services and activities. Though Scotland was a netexporter of meat, Scottish local authorities had made no claim forspecial assistance in meeting the cost of meat inspection.The Minister of Agriculture said he would be reluctant to seethis charge transferred to the meat industry. It would be difficultto justify a breach of the principle that public health expenditureof this nature was rightly charged to public funds. As a result ofthe policy of concentrating slaughtering in fewer places, the cost ofmeat inspection was now falling with greatly disproportionate weighton some rural authorities and was equivalent in some cases to arate of up to 5d. in the  . In consequence, inspection in these areaswas not being properly carried out.Discussion showed that there was general support in theCabinet for the view expressed by the Minister of Agriculture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if it was the wish of theCabinet that a Government grant should be provided for this service,he must ask that it should at least be made clear to local authoritiesthat the grant was of a provisional nature and would be subject toreview in due course in the light of any reorganisation which mightbe made in the structure and finance of local government.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 5 ^of C.P. (56) 69, Exchequer assistance should be given to wlocal authorities towards the cost of meat inspection.
9CM. 20 (56)Territorial 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignWaters: Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofIceland Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (CP. (56) 45) reporting the latestFisheries        developments in the Iceland fisheries dispute.Dispute. jyiq Organisation for European Economic Co-operation had,(Previous        with our encouragement, appointed an informal group to seek aReference:      solution to this problem in association with the Governments ofCM. (55) 53rd the United Kingdom and Iceland.  This group had put forward theConclusions,    following proposals for a settlement: (i) Iceland should make noMinute 8.)      change in their fishery limits until the report of the International LawCommission on territorial waters had been considered by the nextAssembly of the United Nations,   (ii) Iceland should allow foreigntrawlers to seek shelter within the present fishery limits in badweather, without first being required to stow their gear, and to selltheir catch in Iceland ports if delayed there by damage,   (iii) Thefishing industries of the two countries should negotiate an agreementto regulate the landing of Iceland-caught fish in United Kingdomports,   (iv) In return for the agreement to be negotiated under (iii),the British fishing industry should remove the boycott on Iceland-caught fish in United Kingdom ports.   The Ministers concernedwere satisfied that an interim settlement on these lines was the bestthat could be obtained at the present time, and they recommendedthat it should be accepted.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a settlement of the Iceland fisheries disputeshould be sought on the basis indicated in paragraph 3of CP. (56) 45.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to urge the Secretary-General of the Organisation for European EconomicCo-operation to press the Iceland Government to accepta settlement on these lines.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Agriculture, whetherany further warning should be given to the British fishinginterests concerned that, in negotiating an agreement toregulate the landing of Iceland-caught fish in UnitedKingdom ports and in giving publicity to the nature andeffect of this agreement, they would be well-advised tohave regard to the provisions of the Restrictive TradePractices Bill.Farm PriceReview.(PreviousReference:CM. (56) 19thConclusions,Minute 5.)10. The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (CP. (56) 73) covering the draft of a WhitePaper on the Annual Review of Farm Prices, and (ii) an informalnote of the counter-proposals put forward by the Farmers&apos; Unionsin the latest stages of the negotiations.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in the latest discussions,the farmers&apos; representatives had shown themselves more unwillingthan had been expected to contemplate failure to reach agreement inthe negotiations. After indicating that they would not be preparedto accept a settlement on the basis of guarantees totalling less than 31-32 millions, they had put forward revised proposals totalling 29-5 millions and would very probably be willing to reach anagreed settlement at a compromise figure in the region of 27 millions, provided the individual guarantees for fatstock werecontinued. Although the farmers were most deeply concerned overthe level of the milk subsidy, they were prepared to withdraw fromtheir original proposal of \\d. a gallon and to accept an increase ofId. It was for the Cabinet therefore to consider whether any furtherconcession should be made to the farmers, above the offer of 24 millions which had been approved, in the hope of making an
10agreed settlement possible. He would not himself see grounds foroffering more than fd. on milk but, in the interests particularly ofNorthern Ireland farmers, further consideration might be given towaiving the slight cut in the pig subsidy which was being imposed asan earnest of the Government&apos;s concern to secure greater efficiency.The farmers attached great importance to their proposal that ^ 1 million should be made available for the assistance of smallfarmers and it might be possible to make out proposals regardingsilage to satisfy them on this score.It was the general view of the Cabinet that there were no validgrounds for increasing the offers already made. It was essential thatthe settlement should reflect the realities of the economic situation;the pig subsidy, for example, led to costly expenditure in foreignexchange. An imposed settlement at  24 millions could not berepresented as a hardship. Moreover, an imposed settlement shouldhelp to promote wage stability in the industry and might well be seenby farmers in that light. Although the farmers would dislike theabolition of the individual guarantees for fatstock, these had simplybeen introduced as a protection for farmers on the decontrol of meatwhen it could not easily be foreseen how stable the auction marketswould prove. On the other hand, as the farmers were greatlypreoccupied with long-term assurances, it would be right to introduceinto the White Paper a suitably cautious indication that theGovernment had this in mind.The Cabinet (1) Confirmed their previous decision that the proposals set outin CP. (56) 62, together with an increase of \d. a gallonin the guaranteed price for milk, should remain the basisof a final settlement of the current review of farm prices.(2) Approved, subject to further amendment in the light of theirdiscussion and to any necessary drafting amendments, thedraft White Paper annexed to CP. (56) 73.InternationalWheatAgreement.(PreviousReference :CM. (56) 12thConclusions,Minute 5.)11. At their meeting on 13th February the Cabinet had invitedthe Minister of Agriculture to circulate a memorandum on theattitude to be adopted by the United Kingdom Government towardsthe renewal of the International Wheat Agreement. They now hadbefore them a note by the Minister of Agriculture (CP. (56) 48)covering a minute on this subject which he had submitted to thePrime Minister on 14th February.The Minister of Agriculture said that, with the Prime Minister&apos;sapproval, the United Kingdom representatives had, at the recentmeeting in Geneva, followed the line indicated in that minute. As aresult, the United Kingdom had said they could not adhere to a newWheat Agreement but they would be willing to associate themselveswith the work of the International Wheat Council, where they wouldseek to secure the adoption of policies designed to bring worldproduction of wheat into line with world demand, so as to preventthe accumulation of further surplus stocks. There was reason tobelieve that the Governments of Canada and Australia now had abetter understanding of the reasons for our attitude towards thisproblem.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (56) 48 and of the statement by theMinister of Agriculture.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,8th March, 1956.
