2Suez Canal. j&apos;ne Foreign Secretary said that at the end of the debate in the(Previous        General Assembly on the previous day both the Argentine and theReference:      Afro-Asian resolutions had been adopted.   The latter required theCM.(56)81st   Anglo-French contingent to be withdrawn immediately; but theConclusions.)   more moderate body of opinion in the United Nations now appearedto be aware of the danger of leaving a military vacuum in the areaUnited Nations. of {he Suez Qana^ ancj might be content that our action should bebased  on  the  Argentine  resolution  which  authorised  us, byimplication, to retain the Anglo-French contingent in position untilan international force assumed responsibility. The case for adoptingthis course was strengthened by the fact that the Afro-Asianresolution had been amended to require us to withdraw consistentlywith the other resolutions on this subject, viz., the original resolutiontabled by the United States and the two Canadian resolutionsproposing the establishment of an international force.   It wasreasonable, therefore, that we should adhere in principle to our earlierstatement that we would not withdraw from the area of the SuezCanal until a competent international force was in position to accepta transfer of responsibility.On the other hand, it was important that we should re-establishclose relations with the United States Government and secure theirsupport for our policy in the Suez Canal area and the Middle East.The latest message from the President of the United States, in whichhe had shown reluctance to discuss longer term issues until afterthe Anglo-French forces had been withdrawn from the Suez Canal,was disquieting in view of the signs of an intensification of Sovietactivity in the Middle East. It was now urgently necessary to decidewhat further action the Government could take, consistently withtheir earlier declarations about the importance of an uninterruptedpolicing of the Suez Canal area, to enlist the active heb of theUnited States Government in support of their policy.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Reconnaissance indicated that the airfields in the neighbour-hood of the Canal were being rapidly repaired; and it was possiblethat, under cover of the cease-fire, the Egyptian losses of aircraftwere being made good from the Soviet Union. The possibility ofan Egyptian attack on the Anglo-French forces in the Suez Canalarea could not be excluded, as was evidenced by an incident duringthe previous night when an Egyptian patrol, in contravention of thecease-fire, had advanced round the flank of our forward positionsshort of El Kantara and opened fire on them. The patrol hadwithdrawn after our forces had returned the fire in self-defence.(b) We had been compelled to bring military operations to a haltbefore our objectives had been fully attained. We were now facedwith a situation in which the Suez Canal was blocked; our oil suppliesfrom the Middle East were at risk; alternative supplies from theWestern Hemisphere could not be counted upon, especially in theabsence of financial aid from the United States; and, so long as Egyptwas free to reconstitute her forces with Russian help while we werebound by the cease-fire, our troops at Port Said and in Cyprus wereexposed to a risk which the Commander of the Anglo-French forceswas unwilling to accept unless the United Nations could guaranteethem against Egyptian attack.(c) The Government of Israel had now publicly declared that theArmistice Agreement with Egypt was dead and that Israel wouldrefuse to agree to the stationing of any foreign force, irrespective ofits title, in her territory or in any of the areas occupied by her. Shehad also announced her annexation of the fsland of Tiran at themouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, and appeared to be treating the SinaiPeninsula as Israeli territory. If Israel was to be compelled toevacuate the territory which she had occupied and to retire behindthe former Armistice lines, the responsibility of securing hercompliance must be accepted by the United Nations and could not^e shouldered by the limited Anglo-French force now in Port Said.
3CM. 82 (56)id) The Government&apos;s political position in the House ofCommons was vulnerable. They could rely on the continued loyaltyof their own supporters if they held firmly to a clear and simplejustification of their case, emphasising that the reason for theirwillingness to withdraw the Anglo-French contingent was the factthat the fighting had been stopped, just as their reason for originallylaunching the operation had been the urgent need to take policeaction which it was beyond the capacity of the United Nations toorganise with the necessary speed. But, although the Governmentcould claim, with good reason, to have compelled the United Nationsto assume a responsibility which they would otherwise have refusedto face, their position would remain insecure so long as thereappeared to be some divergence of policy between them and theGovernments of the United States and other Commonwealthcountries. In these circumstances it remained urgently necessarythat we should re-establish close relations and understanding withthe United States Government.It was agreed that, in the light of these considerations and subjectto the agreement of the French Government, we should now informthe United Nations that we were prepared to embark immediatelyupon staff conversations with the Commander-designate of theinternational force, and to agree with him a plan for the orderly andeffective transfer of responsibility from the Anglo-French contingentto the international force. At the same time we should press the UnitedStates Government to instruct their representative at the UnitedNations to support this proposal and to provide all practicableUnited States co-operation in the preparation of a plan which wouldprevent a military vacuum developing in the area of the Suez Canal,would secure the removal of obstructions in the Canal as rapidlyas possible, and would mark the beginnings of a common Anglo-American policy in the United Nations and in the Middle East.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, subject to the agreement ofthe French Government, to instruct the United KingdomRepresentative at the United Nations to propose thatstaff talks should take place immediately between theCommander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French forces and theCommander-designate of the international force, to enablea plan to be prepared for the orderly transfer ofresponsibility in the area of the Suez Canal.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to endeavour to secure thesupport of the United States Government for the actionwhich we proposed to take in the United NationsAssembly.Troop The Minister of Defence said that, if the United Kingdom forcesMovements. were to remain in their present positions in the Port Said area formore than a week, the Allied Commander would wish to withdrawthe parachute brigade and the commando brigade and to substitutetwo infantry brigades from the Third Infantry Division. The thirdbrigade from this division would be stationed in Cyprus to act asan immediate reserve for the Port Said area. These proposals hadbeen discussed with the Chiefs of Staff. The troops and shippingassembled for the follow-up operations would be dispersed in themost economical way. It had also been agreed that the majorityof the Valiant squadrons and some of the Canberra squadronsshould return to the United Kingdom. The ground facilities would,however, be retained in the Middle East, so that the aircraft couldbe flown back at short notice if need arose.In discussion it was suggested that the Egyptian Governmentmight claim that this readjustment of the troops in the Port Saidarea constituted a build-up of forces. It would, however, be easyto disprove such an allegation. It might, indeed, appear that thisredeployment amounted to a reduction in the strength of the UnitedKingdom forces in Port Said.
4The Cabinet (3) Approved in principle the proposed redeployment of Britishforces in the Eastern Mediterranean, and invited theMinister of Defence to settle the detailed arrangementsin consultation with the Chiefs of Staff.Morale ofUnitedKingdomTroops.The Minister of Defence said that Anglo-French forces hadcarried out a difficult landing operation with great success, but werenow being confined to their present positions. The AlliedCommander was concerned about the effects of this inactivity on themorale of the troops, particularly in view of the conflicting statementson the wireless and in the Press about the value of the operations.General Keightley had asked for guidance on what should be saidto the troops. He was proposing to advise General Keightley toemphasise that the successful landings had stopped hostilities betweenIsrael and Egypt and had also stimulated the United Nations intotaking positive action to deal with some of the long-standingproblems of the Suez Canal area.The Cabinet (4) Approved the instructions which the Minister of Defenceproposed to send to the Allied Commander-in-Chief.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,10th November, 1956.
