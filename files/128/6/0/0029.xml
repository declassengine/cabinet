1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (46) 396) on British food supplies during the period to september 1947. This disclosed a serious danger of shortages forthe United Kingdom and for areas of direct United Kingdomresponsibility in the supplies of wheat, fats, meat, bacon and rice.The Minister of Food said that for alleviation of this situa-tion we must look mainly to the United States. The deterioration in our position was largely due to the raising of food controls there,and that in turn was linked with internal politics in the UnitedStates. He suggested that as soon as the Congressional Electionswere over we should endeavour to arrange for the United States,the Canadians and ourselves to hold a review of world supplies of grain, fats, meat, bacon and rice. He thought that the case forsuch a review would have to be made in the first instance by ministers.The following points were made in discussion  (a) There had been virtually a breakdown of the machinery ofthe International Emergency Food Council. That body was being less and less used, and the United States were now decidingunilaterally to which countries they would send their food exports.(&amp;) In addition to making representations to the United States,we should increase our efforts to develop alternative sources ofsupply. We should seek to obtain more wheat from Canada; our long-term contract did not cover the whole of the Canadian supply,and there was evidence that Canadian wheat was being kept backon farms. Possibly more meat and other supplies could be obtainedfrom Eire. Pressure should also be maintained to increase exportsof oils and oil-seeds from Tropical Africa.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this last point was already under close attention. There were possibilities of con-siderable development involving a large outlay of capital. He would shortly submit a memorandum to the Cabinet on this subject.(c) The proposed approach to the United States Governmentshould not be made only on the basis of United Kingdom needs. Itshould be set against the background of the world situation. Itwas also to our advantage to see that adequate supplies of food-stuffs were provided for India and the British Zone of Germany,even though they were not as directly our responsibility as theUnited Kingdom and the Colonial Empire.(d) The Foreign Secretary said that we must recognise theinternal situation in the United States. It was a large Country andits administrative machine was not fully effective. The president had been forced to remove the commodity controls and there was little chance of their being reimposed. As a result, both prices anddistribution were much disorganised. There were food shortages invarious parts of the United States.(e) It was suggested that we should attempt to arouse fhe con-science of the American people to their responsibility toAvards theworld. On the other hand, it was argued that it would be inexpe-dient to appear to make direct criticism of the United States atti-tude towards world food supplies. There was still some isolationistsentiment in the country, which had been strengthened by allegation-tions of &quot; dollar diplomacy &quot; recently made by the Russians. Andit would be unfortunate to stir up controversy as a prelude to negotiations.(/) On the other hand, there were strong arguments in favourof publishing the facts of the world food situation for the informa-tion of the public in the United Kingdom. The Government had found themselves handicapped in public discussion in the past,because it had not been possible to give figures of stocks and imports.The Cabinet felt that the reasons which had made this impossible[32698-2]e 2(previous reference:CM. (46) 85th(Jonclusions,ginute 6.)British food supplies.
no longer had the same force, while it was important that the peopleof this country should know why it was necessary to maintain inpeace-time restrictions as severe as any that had been imposed duringthe war.Any such publication of the facts would, however, require care-ful handling. A statement might be made early in the new Sessionduring the debate on The King&apos;s Speech, and the Minister of Foodwas invited to prepare a draft of such a statement for considerationby the Cabinet.(g) The best approach to the United States Government wouldbe for the Foreign Secretary to raise the matter in the first instancewith the United States Secretary of State, and to emphasise to him the unfortunate political consequences of serious shortages of food.It should, for instance, be a matter of concern to the State Depart-ment and the American Chiefs of Staff to avoid a breakdown inthe authority of Governments in the East; and it could be brought home to them that there would be grave risk of this if there werewidespread famine in this area. It was preferable that emphasis Ishould be laid on considerations of defence rather than charity.There was general agreement that this would be the best initial \approach to the problem. The Foreign Secretary might also be able jto discuss matters with the Prime Minister of Canada. Thequestion whether, thereafter, the Minister of Food should visit the!United States and whether there should be a more formal - con-ference with the United States and Canadian Governments could jbe left over for consideration in the light of the results of these!preliminary conversations.The Minister of Food undertook to provide the Foreign!Secretary with a brief note of the points to be raised with the United!States Administration, and with a fuller memorandum giving aimore detailed analysis of the situation.The Cabinet 1(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, during his visit to the UnitedStates, to discuss with members of the United states administration the possibility of taking steps to improve the supply of food-stuffs to the United Kingdom, to areasof direct United Kingdom responsibility, and to areas such as India and the British Zone in Germany in whichwe had a special interest.(2) Agreed to consider the position further when the results!of these discussions were known.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to prepare for submission to the Cabinet the draft of a statement, to be made during the course of the debate on The King&apos;s speech at the Opening of the new Session of Parliament, givingthe basic facts of the situation regarding the principalfood-stuffs at present in short supply.IncLVsFood The Cabinet then considered the immediate situation in IndiaSupplies. They had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of State foiIndia (CP. (46) 395) showing that there was now every prospectof a most serious shortage of cereals in India in November and december, and that famine was likely to develop over wide areas the Cabinet discussed whether an immediate approach coukusefully be made to the United States Government through the ambassador drawing their attention to this situation and its political implications. The general view was that it would be betteito delay such an approach until it could be made as part of thgeneral case which the Foreign Secretary was to place before tillUnited States Administration. The Ambassador could, howeveijbe kept fully informed of the facts.Several Ministers suggested that the food shortage in Indijwas likely to last for a considerable time. Food consumption ijIndia had increased without any corresponding increase in food
production. It was therefore important to press on with develop-ment schemes, both in India itself and in other undeveloped areas,to increase food supplies.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the serious situation likely to arise in Indiawithin the next two or three months, and invited theForeign Secretary to discuss the position with the UnitedStates Administration as part of the general approach which he would be making to them, soon after his arrival in America, on the world food situation  IS &apos;ct whole.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (46)358) on the Palestine Conference, giving an account of the discus-sions at the Conference with delegates from the Arabs States, anda summary of informal conversations with representatives of theJewish Agency with a view to bringing Jewish representatives intothe Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that at the present stage he wishedto make only an interim report on the course of these discussions :he would not ask the Cabinet to formulate their views on future policy in Palestine until further conversations had been held withrepresentatives of both Arabs and Jews. He had hoped that itwould have been possible to make more satisfactory progress inthe informal conversations with Jewish representatives; but theprospects of persuading them to adopt a more reasonable attitude had been impaired by the public statement issued by president truman on the suspension of the Conference with the Arab States.Since then, however there had been indications that the Presidentmight allow the State Department to resume the conduct of negotia-tions on the Palestine problem; and it had been suggested to him that, while he was in New York, he might have conversations onthis subject with members of the United States Administration andwith representative Jews. He therefore asked the Cabinet to suspend judgment on this matter pending the results of these further conversations in New York, and also of the continued dis-cussions which were likely to be held in London with representativesof the Jewish Agency under the direction of the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for the Colonies.On the Arab side the situation would also become easier if thenegotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Couldbe brought to a successful conclusion. Arab apprehensions wouldalso be reduced if other countries would give some practical indica-tion of a readiness to receive some of the Jewish displaced personswishing to emigrate from Europe; and there was now some reasonto hope that the United States Government might promote legisla-tion authorising the admission of a number of displaced persons tothe United States. These were further reasons for counsellingdelay.If at the beginning of December theie seemed to be no prospectof reaching a settlement by continued negotiation with the two sides,the Cabinet would then be faced with a choice between three possible courses. The first would be to impose a solution acceptable to oneor other of the two communities in Palestine. The Chiefs of staff had advised that, with the resources at our disposal, we could not hope to impose by force a solution which would be actively resisted by both communities. The second course would be to surrender theMandate and withdraw from Palestine. This would have serious effects on our strategic position in the Middle East and on our prestige throughout the world.

The second course would be to surrender theMandate and withdraw from Palestine. This would have serious effects on our strategic position in the Middle East and on our prestige throughout the world. The third possibility was to proposea scheme of Partition which might possibly provide for the Arab
part of Palestine to be merged in Transjordan. The Foreign secretary said, however, that he did not wish to ask the Cabinet Ito consider these alternative courses at this stage.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet Iof the latest developments in his conversations with representatives jof the Jewish Agency on the measures which might be taken to restore law and order in Palestine. There was now some prospect that the Agency would make a public declaration dissociating them-selves from the use of violence by Jews in Palestine and promisingto do their utmost to suppress terrorism. If such a declarationwere made, it should be possible to authorise the release of theJewish leaders who had been held in detention in Palestine since29th June. This should rally Jewish opinion in Palestine, andshould pave the way for Jewish representatives to join the PalestineConference. It would be expedient to authorise at the same timethe release of some of the Arabs who were still undergoing imprison-ment or detention.In discussion several Ministers said that they were glad thatthe possibility of Partition was not excluded from consideration,and expressed the view that this would in the end be found to bethe only practicable solution of the Palestine problem.The Foreign Secretary commented on the restraint shown byJewish supporters of the Government in the House of Commons inrefraining from raising the Palestine question in the recent debate on Foreign Affairs. He hoped that the Lord President would findan opportunity of conveying to those Members his appreciation oftheir attitude.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements made by the Foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and agreedto defer further consideration of future policy in Palestineuntil the results were known of the conversations whichwere to be held with Jewish representatives both in Londonand in New York.United 3.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign nations. Secretary (CP. (46) 373), the Secretary of State for DominionIndian Affairs (CP. (46) 394) and the Secretary of State for India (CP.Complaint (46) 397) regarding the complaint to be made by the government against of India at the General Assembly of the United Nations about theSouth Africa,    treatment of Indians in South Africa.These memoranda discussed what attitude should be taken bythe United Kingdom Delegation when this matter came before theAssembly. The Foreign Secretary, in his memorandum, pointed outthat discussion in the Assembly of this dispute between two membersof the British Commonwealth would place the United Kingdom, as a leading member of the United Nations, in an embarrassing position;and it should be our policy to avoid becoming involved in the disputefurther than was essential. After examining the alternative courses open, he recommended that our Delegation should take theline that, as most of the Indians concerned were South Africannationals, the matter was one of domestic jurisdiction within themeaning of Article 2 (7) of the United Nations Charter and, assuch, not appropriate for discussion by the Assembly. TheSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs supported this view. TheSecretary of State for India, in his memorandum, urged that theUnited Kingdom Delegation should confine themselves to statingthat, as the dispute lay between two members of the British Com-commonwealth, they would take no part at all in the discussions.It was the view of the Cabinet that it would be impossible forthe United Kingdom Government, as one of the leading members

(46) 386) suggesting that the Departments concerned should be instructed to make a full study of the implications of closer economic co-operation between this country and western europe.The Foreign Secretary said that, on reflection, he had decided not to ask the Cabinet to consider this proposal until after the forth-coming elections in France.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer consideration of the proposal put forward in CP. (46) 386.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th October, 1946.of the United Nations, to dissociate themselves entirely from alldiscussion of this matter in the Assembly, as recommended by theSecretary of State for India. They agreed, however, that everyeffort should be made to prevent the Assembly from discussing the merits of the complaint. It was important that the general assembly should refrain from discussing matters falling within thejurisdiction of sovereign States. The United Kingdom delegation should therefore speak in support of the view that this mattercame within Article 2 (7) of the Charter.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United King-dom Delegation at the General Assembly of the united nations to follow the course recommended in para-graph 3 (ii) (6) of CP. (46) 373, viz., to support the viewthat the complaint about the treatment of Indian nationals in South Africa was a matter of domestic jurisdictionwhich, under Article 2 (7) of the United Nations Charter,was not appropriate for discussion at the Assembly. our delegation should be asked to inform the Indian Delega-tion in advance of the line which they proposed to take in the discussion; and all members of our Delegation shouldbe instructed to avoid expressing any view on the merits of this dispute, not only at formal meetings, but also inunofficial contacts during the Assembly.
