In addition to debates on Welsh Affairs and thePress (see Minutes 3 and 4 below) it was proposed that there shouldbe a two-day debate, probably on 29th and 30th October, on theWhite Paper on Central Organisation for Defence. The Opposi-tion had agreed that, if two days were allowed this Session for thediscussion of the White Paper, they would not ask for a general debate next Session on the Second Reading of the Ministry ofDefence Bill.The Liberal Party had asked for a single day&apos;s debate on Tradeand the Economic Situation. It was agreed, after discussion, thatthis request might be granted; and the Cabinet were informed thatthis debate might be arranged for 31st October.There was still some pressure for a debate to be held on palestine before the end of the Session. In discussion, it was agreedthat there would be grave disadvantages in holding such a debatewhile the discussions with the Arab States stood adjourned and discussions with representatives of the Jewish Agency were still proceeding. The Lord President undertook to continue to resist the demand for an early debate on Palestine.PeaceConference.(previous reference:CM. (46) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. At the Prime Minister&apos;s request The Foreign Secretarygave the Cabinet an account of the proceedings at the Peace Con-lerence in Paris and his first impressions of the results achieved.He undertook to circulate to the Cabinet in due course a full reporton the work of the Conference.The Prime Minister said that he felt sure the Cabinet would wish him to express, on their behalf, their appreciation of the out-standing efforts which the Foreign Secretary had made to bringthe Conference to a successful conclusion, and of the valuable help which he had had throughout the Conference from the minister without Portfolio. The Cabinet warmly endorsed the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.       tThe Foreign Secretary, in thanking the Cabinet, said that hewould like to put on record his appreciation of the part played bymembers of the Foreign Office staff who had assisted Ministers atthe Conference. He had been specially impressed by the skill shown by the officials who had represented His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe work of the various Sub-Commissions.
Administrationof Wales anddlonmouth-sbire.(previous reference:CM. (46)9thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 378) regarding the form of the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on Welsh Affairs.The Lord President said that, although the Cabinet had decided to reject the demand of the Welsh Parliamentary Partyfor the appointment of a separate Secretary of State for wales and Monmouthshire, it had been thought expedient to set aside aday for the discussion of Welsh Affairs by the House of commons and it was proposed to publish, in time for that debate, a white paper on Government activities in Wales and Monmouthshireduring the year ended 31st July, 1946. A draft of the White paper had been considered by the Lord President&apos;s Committee at their meeting on 11th October. The debate would probably be held duringthe week beginning 28th October. He proposed that the debate should be held on a Government Motion welcoming the White paper and the Governments decision further to integrate and co-ordinategovernmental and administrative machinery in Wales and Mon-mouthshire. Mr. Speaker had agreed that a debate on a motion in these terms could include discussion of the proposal for a separateSecretary of State for Wales.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the forthcoming debate on Welsh affairs should be taken on a Government Motion in the terms proposed in CP. (46) 378.The Cabinet next discussed the choice of Government spokes-men for this debate. They agreed that the reply to the debate should be made by the Minister of Health. They then considered whether the other Government spokesman should be another WelshMinister or a Minister having Departmental responsibility for someof the main subjects likely to be raised in the debate. In discussion it was pointed out that the demand for a separate Welsh adminis-tration was founded mainly in the fear of a recurrence of wide-spread unemployment in Wales; and on this account it was desir-able that the first Government speech in the debate should stress the economic aspects of the problem and the action which theGovernment were taking to promote the economic welfare of Wales.It would be preferable, therefore, that the debate should be openedby the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the President of the Board of Trade shouldopen, and the Minister of Health reply to, the forth-coming debate on Welsh Affairs.Inquiry into 4.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal thatthe Press. a Royal Commission should be appointed to enquire into the owner-previous ship, management and control of the Press and the news agencies.Reference: They had before them a memorandum (CP. (46) 379) on the cm. (46)84th membership, terms of reference and powers of such a Commission,Conclusions, which the Lord President had prepared, in pursuance of the minute 2.) Cabinets request at their earlier discussion on 3rd October, afterconsultation with the President of the Board of Trade, the LordChancellor, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour.In amplification of his memorandum, The Lord President said* that he wished to suggest a modification of the draft terms ofreference for the proposed Royal Commission. It was desirablethat these should include some mention of the need for accuracy inthe presentation of news; and he therefore proposed that thefollowing draft should be substituted for that set out in CP.(46) 379-&quot; With the object of furthering the free expression ofopinion through the Press and the greatest practicableaccuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the control,[32676-2] b 2
management and ownership of the newspaper and periodicalPress and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recom-mendations thereon.&quot;As regards powers, he suggested that, if it were decided toappoint such a Commission, the Government should make it clear at the outset that they reserved the right, if it became necessary todo so in the course of the Commission^ inquiry, to apply to theCommission the provisions of the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921.The Cabinet first discussed whether it was expedient that theGovernment should initiate an inquiry into the press on the lines proposed. In the course of a full discussion they reviewed the considerations for and against this proposal which had been putforward in their earlier discussions on 30th July and 3rd October.On the question whether the Government should proceed forthwith to institute an inquiry on the lines proposed, opinion in the Cabinetremained divided. In the course of the discussion, however, thesuggestion was made that it would be appropriate to allow the Houseof Commons, in the first instance, to express its views on the questionwhether such an inquiry should be held; and there was generalagreement in the Cabinet that it would be easier for the Govern-ment to institute such an inquiry in response to a demand supported,after debate, by a substantial weight of opinion in the House ofCommons.The Cabinet were informed that there was a general expecta-tion, among all Parties in the House of Commons, that theGovernment would afford facilities for a debate on this question.A substantial majority of Government supporters would favour the institution of an inquiry; and it was likely that this view would be supported by some members of other Parties.A number of Government supporters had already placed onthe Order Paper of the House of Commons a Motion calling foran investigation into the ownership and control of the press, theextent of monopolistic tendencies in ownership, and the influence of financial and advertising interests on the presentation of news.The Cabinet thought it would be preferable that a debate should beheld on a Motion in less specific terms, e.g-, one drawing attentionto the growing public concern at monopolistic tendencies in thecontrol of the press. It would no doubt be possible to arrange forGovernment supporters to table an alternative form of Motion on those lines, and the Government could then afford facilities for a debate on that Motion.Further discussion showed that there was general support forthe view that the right course would be^to-.afford facilities for a debate in the House of Commons on a Motion, framed on the general lines indicated above and moved by Government supporters. Itwas further agreed that no Government spokesman should interveneuntil the end of this debate. Discussion then turned on the questionwhether the Government spokesman should confine himself to a promise that the Government would consider the matter in the lightof the views expressed in the debate, or whether he should proceed at once to announce the Governments intentions. The cabinet agreed that if, as was likely to be the case, the debate had shownthat the weight of opinion in the House of Commons was in favourof an inquiry, the Government should at the end of the debateannounce their intention to hold an inquiry through the medium of a Royal Commission. The terms of reference, powers and composition of the Commission could be announced at a later stage.The Prime Minister said that he would wish to have a further opportunity of considering the composition of the proposed Commis-sion. He was disposed to think that the membership proposed inOP. (46) 379 was too large; he would himself prefer a smaller body,including a larger proportion of well-known names which would command public confidence. He also thought it would hepreferable to include one or two people who had in the past beenprofessionally engaged in newspaper management or journalism.
67CM. 87 (46),The Cabinet (1) Agreed that arrangements should be made for the Houseof Commons to debate, preferably before the end of thepresent Session, a Motion to be tabled by government supporters drawing attention, in general terms, to the increasing public concern at the growth of monopolistictendencies in the control of the press; and that, if this debate showed that the weight of opinion in the Houseof Commons favoured the institution of an inquiry intothe press, the Government should announce at the endof the debate their intention to hold such an inquirythrough the medium of a Royal Commission.(2) Agreed that the terms of reference of the proposed Commis-sion should be on the following lines : &quot; With the objectof furthering the free expression of opinion through thepress and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the control, manage-ment and ownership of the newspaper and periodicalpress and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, andto make recommendations thereon&quot;; and that, when these terms of reference were announced, it should bemade clear that the Government reserved the right, ifthey thought it necessary to do so in the course of theCommission^ inquiry, to apply to the Commission theprovisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,1921.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult further with the Lord President about the membership of theproposed Commission.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th October, 1946.
