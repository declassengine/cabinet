Council of 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the CabinetForeign an account of the proceedings at&apos; the recently concluded Session ofMinisters.       the Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris.(Previous The Foreign Secretary said that in the discussions on GermanyReference: M. Molotov had taken a very intransigent line. In particular, heC.M.(46)66th had pressed strongly that the Ruhr should be placed under inter-Conclusions, Allied control. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s own policy had been to minute 1.) refuse to agree to such a proposal unless the Western Powers wereGermany.       permitted to share in the control over industries in Eastern Germany.On reparations M. Molotov had taken the line that Russia was entitled to deliveries as laid down in the Berlin Agreement but hadno obligation to carry out the clauses in the Agreement under which germany was to be treated as an economic whole. He had made itclear to M. Molotov that we were prepared to co-operate fully on a reciprocal basis with the Powers in control of the other Zones, butthat, if there were no reciprocity from any ]3articular Zone or ifthere were no willingness to carry out the whole of the BerlinAgreement, we should be compelled to organise the British Zone insuch a way that no liability would fall on the British tax-payer.Mr. Byrnes had expressed his willingness for full co-operationbetween the American and other Zones and had suggested to himprivately that arrangements should at once be made for co-operationbetween the Brititish and American Zones to the exclusion of theRussian Zone. The Foreign Secretary had thought that it wouldbe a mistake at this stage to commit ourselves irrevocably to ameasure which implied a clear division between Eastern and western Germany. He had, therefore, suggested that a writtencommunication should first be sent to the other members of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers, and that the action which Mr. Byrnesproposed should be taken only if, on receipt of their replies, it was clear that we must abandon hope of Russian co-operation.As regards demilitarisation and. the removal of Nazis frompositions of influence, M. Molotov had made man)&apos; charges that wewere not playing our part. He had accordingly proposed toM. Molotov that there should be a full enquiry throughout the wholeof Germany both in the military and economic field, but this hadnot proved acceptable. There was a considerable body of evidencethat war material was still being manufactured in the Russian zone and he proposed to present a note to the other three Powers setting out as much of this evidence as could safely be disclosed. He thoughtthat it would be well to bring publicity to bear on Russian activities in this matter.Draft Treaties The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to circulate withinwith Italy the next few days a memorandum summarising the position reached and the in regard to the draft Treaties with Italy and the Satellite States.SatelliteStates.Austria. M. Molotov had. draw attention to the very large number of displaced persons still in Austria and had again alleged that insufficient progress was being made in the removal of prominentNazis. The Foreign secretary had not found himself in a goodposition to counter these allegations. There was no doubt that therewas a very large number of displaced persons still in Austria. Theyconstituted a very considerable liability for the Austrian Govern-ment and on all counts it would be Avell that they should be moved.He thought, therefore, that every effort should be made to remove as many as possible of these people before discussions were resumedat the end of the month.In discussion the Foreign Secretary made the following further points : (a) It was necessary throughout the negotiations to bear in mind the possible repercussions of decisions taken in relation to europe on the situation in the Far East, where there was a state of muchtension between the United States and Russia.
(b) One positive result of the Conference was that France had now been accepted as a full member of the Council of foreign ministers. At the instance of Russia, however, China was no longerso regarded on the grounds that she was not a signatory to theArmistice with the European Powers..(c) There was evidence that Russia was working towards aBalkan federation and, though Russian troops were being withdrawn from Balkan countries, a party militia was being built up to take their place.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had beenasked by the Foreign Office not to be too forthcoming in had discussions with M. Klentsov, head of the Russian Trade delegation to the United Kingdom. There was, however, great need for timberfor housing, and he feared that there was little prospect of ourobtaining any timber from Russia unless we were ready to make some concessions.The Minister of Health said that substantial imports of timbermust be obtained if the housing target was to be reached.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, before a separate agreement for co-operationbetween the British and United States Zones of germany was made, a further effort should be made to obtain theco-operation of all four Powers in carrying out the berlin Agreement.(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should present a note to the Foreign Secretaries to the Governments of Russia,the United States and France regarding the evidencethat the demilitarisation clauses of the Berlin agreement were not being observed in the Russian Zone.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary proposed to circulate to the Cabinet as soon as possible a memorandum showingthe position reached in regard to the draft Treaties with italy and the Satellite States.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to consider, asa matter of urgency, the possibility of removingdisplaced persons from Austria.Peace The Foreign Secretary said that the date for the PeaceConference. Conference had been fixed for the 29th July only as a resultof a concession to the Russians on reparations from Italy and the sacrifice of our own claims in respect of British assets in Roumania.He would be glad to have the views of his colleagues on thequestion of the United Kingdom representation at this Conference.Its work would be confined to the Treaties with Italy and theSatellite States and he thought that it would be a mistake to arrangefor Heads of Governments to be present at it. He did not, therefore,recommend that the Prime. Minister should lead the UnitedKingdom delegation. He felt, however, that major difficulties would occur on German questions and that it would be well to aim at ameeting of Heads of Governments after the Council of foreign ministers had had their resumed discussion on Germany.At the forthcoming Conference the work would largely be donein commissions and it would, therefore, be desirable to have a numberof representatives. He suggested that he should himself lead the delegation and be accompanied by the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.In discussion it was suggested that it might be well for the delegation to be reinforced as occasion arose by other Ministers.Thus, the Chancellor of the Exchequer might attend when importantfinancial questions were being considered.The question was also raised whether representatives of theOpposition should be given an opportunity of taking part either in
the forthcoming Conference or in a later Conference on Germany.It was pointed out that the Labour Party in the past had advocatedOpposition representation at such conferences; that it was thenormal Canadian practice to arrange for the Opposition to berepresented, and that Mr. Truman had brought Opposition Senatorswith him to the meeting at Potsdam. The general view of theCabinet, however, was that there would be very serious drawbacksin associating representatives of the Opposition with the UnitedKingdom delegation.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the United Kingdom delegation to the forth-coming Conference in Paris should be composed of theForeign Secretary, the First Lord of the Admiralty, theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury and the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,on the understanding that other Ministers might attendparticular meetings which raised subjects of specialconcern to them.(6) Agreed that representatives of the Opposition should notbe invited to form part of the United Kingdom delega-tion either to the forthcoming Conference or to the laterConference on Germany.Persia.(previous reference:CM. (46) 59thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before themSecretary of State for Foreign Affairssituation in South Persia.a memorandum by the(OP. (46) 269) on theThe Foreign Secretary said that he was much concerned about the situation in the oil-fields of the Anglo-Iranian oil company. Though he was convinced that much could be done to counter the Tudeh Party&apos;s agitation against the Company by amore sympathetic treatment of labour and by the development of social welfare in the oil-fields, it was by no means unlikely thatthere would be disturbances which the Persian authorities could notcontrol. He therefore thought it desirable that emergency plans should be made for evacuating British and Indian personnel fromthe oil-fields area and for occupying the Abadan area in order toprotect the lives of the Company&apos;s employees concentrated there andto guard the valuable refinery installations. He fully realised the implications of employing British forces on Persian soil and thatas one of the consequences Russian forces would probably enterNorthern Persia; but he felt that we must be ready to take actionto save British lives and to safeguard our vital Middle East suppliesof oil. The plans which he proposed would in no circumstances beput into effect unless there seemed no alternative and, in the meanwhile, preparations would be made as unostentatiously aspossible. Since he had circulated his memorandum he had beeninformed that a general strike had started in the oil-fields.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there was reason to expect that any crisis in the oil-fields would arise suddenly.The Chiefs of Staff had therefore felt that the most effective plan would be to move a brigade of Indian troops into Basra-Shaiba,from which they could reach Abadan within a matter of eight to twelve hours. The Government of India raised no objection to themovement of these troops, which could reach Basra-Shaiba in about four weeks. Their arrival in Iraq need not add to the total size ofthe British forces in that country since it would be possibleconcurrently to move out a corresponding number of British troops now awaiting repatriation. The alternative plan would be to movea brigade from Palestine when trouble arose, but the leading-elements of troops from Palestine would take about eight days toreach Persia. This plan would also be open to the objection that itwould involve depleting the forces available to deal with any troublethat might arise in Palestine.
If a crisis arose in South Persia before the troops from Indiareached Basra-Shaiba, the British troops now awaiting repatriationcould be used but the conditions were not really suitable for their employment.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he welcomed theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposals. The Persian Government had notbeen taking effective steps to deal with the activities of the TudehParty. Firm action on our part might well have a good effect. Itwas vital for the United Kingdom to safeguard the supplies which came from the South Persian oil-fields, since, at any rate for theimmediate future, there was no alternative source of supply onwhich we could rely to meet our full requirements.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) It was necessary to bear in mind the possible repercussions of the action proposed throughout the Middle East, even if thetroops which it was proposed to send to Iraq were never used. Theonly forces which we were entitled to keep permanently in Iraq were three battalions of ground troops to guard air bases. We hadindeed the right to send troops through Iraq in transit, but it mightwell be argued that the troops now to be sent would not be in transit.Any evidence that we were interpreting the Treaty to our ownadvantage would have repercussions not only in Iraq, where publicopinion had been very sensitive on the matter, but also in Egypt,where it might well affect the negotiations now in progress.Against this it was argued that, if the movement of indian troops into Basra-Shaiba were accompanied by the departure of theBritish troops awaiting repatriation, serious difficulty could probably be avoided.(6) The Navy could arrange to send a cruiser to Abadanimmediately.(c) The attitude of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to a recentwage-claim by their workers had been unsatisfactory. This claim didnot appear to have been at all unreasonably presented and, had itbeen granted, the present strike might well have been averted. Inview of the large Government interest in the Company and of thefact that the labour troubles might lead to a situation in which british military forces would have to be used, it seemed right thatthe Chairman of the Company should be told forthwith that theCompany must consider sympathetically any reasonable demands made by the workers and take up more vigorously the question of improving labour conditions.(d) It would be desirable to consider whether the degree ofcontrol which the Government exercised over the Anglo-Iranian oil company was commensurate with their financial interest in theCompany.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that an Indian Brigade should be moved to Basra-Shaiba forthwith and that concurrently the Britishtroops now awaiting repatriation there should be withdrawn.(2) Agreed that a cruiser should be sent to Abadan at once.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange toinform the Government of Iraq of what was proposedbut that there would be no public announcement of theaction which was being taken.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange to see theChairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at once with a view to impressing on him that the Company must consider sympathetically any reasonable claims by theirworkers.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate amemorandum to the Cabinet explaining the arrange-ments for the exercise of control by the Government overthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 266) recommending certain increases in dollar expenditure as a result of the approval of theUnited States loan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their meetingon the 29th April (CM. (46) 38th Conclusions, Minute 3) the cabinet had approved import programmes for the second half of 1946 andthe first half of 1947 based on the assumption that the loan, wouldbe granted. The position had, however, been reviewed at a meetingof the Ministers mainly concerned under the chairmanship of theLord President on the 12th July, and it had been agreed torecommend the additional expenditure shown in Annex A to cp. (46) 266. It was true that owing to the rise in dollar prices theloan was now worth less to us, but the export programme had gonebetter than had been expected and owing to supply difficulties it seemed unlikely that the full expenditure of $1,350 million in theprogramme approved in April would be incurred. He accordingly proposed that the Minister of Food should have authority to seek to purchase additional foods, mainly fruits, costing $40 million inall; that an additional $25 million should be spent on tobacco for stock-building, and that the President of the Board of Trade shouldhave authority to spend up to an additional $10 million on rawmaterials and machinery. There should also be an increase of50 per cent, in the basic petrol ration, together with some increasein supplementary allowances, which would cost $15 million apartfrom the dollar expenditure resulting from consequential relaxationsof petrol rationing in Australia and New Zealand. If the cabinet approved, he proposed to make a statement in the House of Commonslater in the day on the lines of Annex B to CP. (46) 266. this statement gave no details of the proposed easements and his intention was to leave any such information to be given by theindividual Ministers concerned.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) The President of the Board of Trade said that he regarded the proposed additional expenditure of $10 million on raw materials and machinery as satisfactory. Owing to the difficulty of securingdeliveries of machinery from the United States it was unlikely thatit would be possible to spend any appreciable part of this additional sum on machinery during the next 12 months.(b) Nothing would be gained by allocating additional dollars for expenditure on timber, since the shortage of timber had been caused by a strike in Canada.(c) It was pointed out that the Soviet Government had recentlyoffered to buy the whole Macedonian tobacco crop. Greek tobacco,though it was alleged that it was not popular in the UnitedKingdom, would be welcome in Germany and Austria and it seemedmost desirable that we should attempt to buy the Greek crop for manufacture and consumption in Germany.(d) There was no prospect of any appreciable export of driedfruit from Greece to the United Kingdom in the current year.(e) It had already been agreed that, if the loan were approved,supplies of Canadian newsprint sufficient to enable six-pagenewspapers to be produced would be purchased, and a reference tothe fact that additional supplies of newsprint were being obtainedshould be inserted in the statement which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to make.(/) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled thatwhen the Cabinet had discussed import programmes in April hehad drawn attention to the importance of maintaining the purchaseof tobacco from Southern Rhodesia. The President of the Board ofTrade confirmed that the increased dollar purchases of tobaccoproposed in CP. (46) 266 would not prejudice Southern Rhodesia inany way.(g) It was agreed that the opening sentences of the third paragraph of the proposed statement should be recast so as to take
account of the fact that it might not be possible to obtain thesupplies of food, raw materials and machinery covered by theadditional expenditure proposed.(A) There was likely to be pressure from the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand for the complete abolition of petrol rationing in these countxues and this might involve an additional expenditure of $15 million, making a total additional expenditureon petrol of $30 million.(i) The Foreign Secretary said that the Ambassador in washington had stressed the need for avoiding any action whichmight give critics of the American administration grounds forsuggesting that, having secured the loan, we intended to act withoutany regard for American interests. He asked whether it would notbe possible to hold up for some time at least the signature of theCanadian Wheat Agreement.The Minister of Food said that he had made it quite clear toMr. Clayton that we should have to sign the Canadian wheat agreement immediately after a--decision had been reached on theloan. In view of the position in Canada he did not see how signaturecould be delayed beyond this week.(j) If it were later found that further supplies of cereals couldbe obtained from the United States, there would be no objection tothe expenditure of additional dollars for this purpose.The Cabinet Approved the additions to the import programmes for theyear mid-1946 to mid-1947 as summarised in Part II of annex A to CP. (46) 266 and agreed that the Chancellorof the Exchequer should make a statement in the Houseof Commons later in the-day in the terms of Annex B to cp. (46) 266, subject to the amendments agreed on at (e)and (g) above.4. The Prime Minister asked the Minister of Food whether hewas satisfied that the instructions given to the public about the bread rationing scheme were sufficiently clear. It had been suggested tohim that housewives, particularly in families some members of whichwere entitled to extra coupons, had difficulty in understanding thescheme. Although the need for rationing had been generally accepted it was important that the Government should not exposethemselves to criticism by failing to devise a simple and efficientscheme.In discussion it was pointed out that bakers had had no experience of rationing during the war and would probably find itdifficult to operate a scheme under which there were so many different scales. The scheme would work much more easily if house-wives could be persuaded to deposit their coupons with the bakers,and it had been suggested in some areas that, in order to save wasteand avoid queues, it would be desirable to make registration forbread compulsory.The Minister of Food said that though he apprehended some difficulty from the unco-operative attitude of the bakers, he did notthink that the average consumer would have any serious difficultyin understanding the scheme. He agreed that if consumers woulddeposit their coupons with their bakers the scheme would workmuch more smoothly, but he did not feel that he would be justifiedin applying compulsory registration, particularly since the schemewas being brought into force at a time when many people were about to go on holiday, He realised the difficulties caused by the varyingscales, but this was an essential feaure of any rationing scheme forbread. He had, however, arranged to make a small increase to children which would reduce the number of different scales fromeight to seven.bread rationing.(previous reference erence:CM. (46)63rdConclusions,Minute 5.)
6. The Lord President said that in the debate on Broadcastingon the following day reference would no doubt be made to thefollowing Motion which had been put down by government supporters : &quot;Newspapers. That, in the opinion of this House, it is expedient that steps should be taken to investigate the owner-ship and control of the Press; the extent of monopolistictendencies in the ownership of chains or groups of newspapers,and the influence of financial and advertising interests on the presentation and suppression of news.&quot;He thought that some form of enquiry on the lines suggested inthe Motion might well be useful and he would like to have theauthority of his colleagues to state in the course of the debate thatthe Government thought that there was a case for considering whether an enquiry of this kind should be instituted.The Cabinet-Approved the line which the Lord President proposed totake in the Broadcasting debate with  regard to the suggested enquiry into the ownership and control of thePress.7. The Minister of Health referred to a speech made by theMinister of Works on the previous day, in which he was reported as having stated that the Government estimated that 100,000permanent and 100,000 temporary houses would be completed by theend of 1946. He pointed out that, with the approval of the Cabinet,he had always avoided giving.any target figure. Although he hopedthat the target mentioned by the Minister of Works would beachieved, it was extremely embarrassing that it should have been announced at the present stage, since the Government would be exposed to much criticism if they failed to reach it and, even if theywere successful, their achievement would have been discounted as aresult of the premature disclosure of the figures.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th July, 1946.Parliament.legislative programme,1946-47Session.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Parliament.Enquiry intothe ownership and Controlof the Press.Housing.(previous reference:CM. (45) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theLord President and the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (46) 268) reporting the results of a preliminary examination of the legislative programme for the 1946-47 session which had been made by theLegislation Committee.The Lord President explained that the object had been to draw up a provisional Programme which would serve as a guide to departments in their work on the preparation of legislation duringthe next two or three months. The inclusion of any particular Billin the provisional Programme did not guarantee it a place in thefinal Programme, nor would Bills put forward by Ministers at alater stage necessarily be excluded from the final Programme if itwere shown that they were urgently required. At the same time, itshould be realised, that the number of Bills already proposedconstituted a much larger Programme than the Government were likely to find time for in the 1946-47 Session.The Cabinet (1) Approved the list of Bills annexed to CP. (46) 268 for the guidance of DeiDartments in the preparation of legisla-tiori, pending the formulation of a final Programmeconcurrently with the preparation of The King&apos;s Speech.(2) Authorised the Legislation Committee to keep theprovisional Programme under review and to make suchminor adjustments as might seem desirable from timeto time.
