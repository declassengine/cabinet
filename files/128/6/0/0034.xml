(46) 92ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1., The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the arrange-ments proposed for the remainder of the Debate on the A ddress.On 14th and 15th November discussion was expected to turn onforeign affairs and Colonial affairs respectively. In the following week Mr. Speaker would select particular subjects or amendmentsfor discussion. On 18th November there would be a debate on compulsory national service and the Territorial Army. The subject for discussion on 19th November had not yet been determined. On20th November Mr. Speaker would call the Opposition amendmenton. nationalisation, man-power and output. It was contemplated that the Debate on the Address would be concluded on 20th Novemberor, at latest, by 7 - 30 p.m. on 21st November.It was agreed that the Lord President should speak on behalfof the Government in the debate on nationalisation. The lord president would settle, in consultation with the Prime Minister,which Ministers should speak on other days during the Debate onthe Address when it was definitely known what subjects would bediscussed on the remaining days of the debate.The Second Reading of the Ministry of Defence Bill would betaken on 22nd November.The Home Secretary said that the Report on the Care ofChildren (Cmd. 6922) was to be discussed on the Adjournment on22nd November. One of the questions which the Cabinet would haveto decide, when they considered this report, was whether the centralresponsibility for this subject should rest with the Home Office,the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education. This question might seem to be pre-judged if any of the Ministers in charge ofthose three Departments replied on the Government^ behalf to the debate on 22nd November. He therefore suggested that the Govern-menfs reply should be given by some Minister who was notassociated with any of those Departments.The Cabinet agreed that the Government spokesman in this debate should be the Lord Privy Seal.2. The Prime Minister said that on 18th November he wasto be asked in a Parliamentary Question by Mr. M. Edelman, M.P.,whether he and the Foreign Secretary would consult with the leader of the Opposition in order to formulate jointly with the Oppositionthis country&apos;s foreign policy. He proposed to reply that, while itwas the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to continue thepractice of keeping the Leader of the Opposition informed of themain factors in the foreign situation, the. responsibility forformulating this country&apos;s foreign policy must rest with the Govern-ment alone.The Cabinet-Approved the terms of the reply which the Prime minister proposed to give to this Question.3. The Prime Minister said that the premature disclosure in cairo of partial accounts of the Sudan Protocol to the proposed anglo-Egyptian Treaty had gravely prejudiced the prospects of persuading the Sudanese to accept the protocol. The Governor-General of the Sudan had returned to london to represent to theGovernment the strength of the feeling which these disclosures hadaroused in the Sudan. He believed that, if this formal recognitionof Egyptian sovereignty over the Sudan were now given, force wouldbe required to maintain public order and all the confidenceengendered by fifty years of co-operation between British andSudanese would vanish over-night. Many of the Sudanese officials in the administration would resign, and some of the British officialsmight also resign. At the worst, there might be widespread disorderand bloodshed. The Governor-General had asked that the cabinet should be made aware, before taking their final decision, of the32746-3] b 2
change in the situation caused by these disclosures in Cairo.&quot; In the changed circumstances he could no longer subscribe to the sovereigntyclause of the Protocol. If, however, the Cabinet decidedito proceedwith the Protocol and still wished him to continue as Governor-General, he was ready to do so and would use his personal influence to mitigate the feeling in the Sudan and to reduce the amount of force required to maintain public order. A letter to this effect whichthe Governor-General had addressed to the Prime Minister was read to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that there was little doubt in lawabout Egypt&apos;s sovereignty over the Sudan, and it was recognised inpractice by the facts that the Governor-General was appointed bythe King of Egypt, that the Egyptian flag was flown in the Sudan,and that Egyptian troops had been stationed there. For the lasttwenty years, however, the Sudan Government had allowed the sudanese to close their eyes to the Egyptian connection to such an extent that the explicit recognition of Egyptian sovereignty in the protocol would come as a severe shock to Sudanese opinion. TheGovernor-General&apos;s view on this point must be accepted. Even so,however, the Prime Minister felt that it was impossible to withdraw from the understandings about the Protocol which the foreign secretary had reached with Sidky Pasha. Such a withdrawal wouldmean the loss of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, with all that thisentailed for our future relations with Egypt and our strategic posi-tion in the Middle East. Egypt would probably refer the whole issue to the United Nations and the sovereignty question to the Interna-tional Court, which was likely to uphold the Egyptian claim. In that event, our position in the Sudan would be worse than it would be under the Protocol; and meanwhile we should have lost our positionin Egypt and the Middle East. In these circumstances the PrimeMinister recommended that, despite the risk of disorders in theSudan, we should proceed with our present plans for the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Sudan Protocol. We should, however,endeavour to mitigate feeling in the Sudan by hastening theestablishment of Sudanese legislative and executive organs so asto make it clear to the Sudanese that they were being put in aposition to control their own affairs with no more interference, fromthe Egyptian Government than in the past.The Prime Minister said that he had put these considerations to the Foreign Secretary in a telegram (No. 2079 of 11th November);and the Foreign Secretary, in his reply (telegram No. 1613 of 12thNovember), had endorsed the recommendations which were nowbeing made to the Cabinet.Discussion showed that it was the view of the Cabinet that,notwithstanding the possible reactions in the Sudan, we should notwithdraw from the understanding reached with Sidky Pasha aboutthe Sudan Protocol. There were good prospects that within thenext few days the Egyptian Government would accept the latest proposals regarding the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty; and it was mostimportant that nothing should be said or done at this stage to prejudice these prospects. At the same time, we should lose no opportunity of averting serious trouble in the Sudan. Apart fromlong-term measures for expediting Sudanese progress towards self-government, more immediate action could be taken to reassure the sudanese. Thus, some of the leaders of political parties in theSudan might be brought to this country, so that they might satisfy themselves at first-hand of the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto enable the Sudanese to achieve self-government. Though itwould be inexpedient to issue such an invitation before the egyptian government had reached their decision on the Treaty, preliminaryarrangements could be made at once so that the invitation could beissued as Soon as the decision of the Egyptian Government was known. Further, the Prime Minister could send to the Governor-General of the Sudan a letter, which he could show to some of the sudanese leaders, assuring him that His Majesty&apos;s Government had considered his representations and were satisfied that the positionof the Sudanese was fully safeguarded. This would be separate from the personal letter which the Prime Minister had already
decided to send to the Governor-General inviting him to continue in office despite his apprehensions about the effect of the sovereigntyclause in the Sudan Protocol to the Treaty.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the Prime Ministers recommendation that,despite the possible reactions in the Sudan, we shouldnot withdraw from our understandings with SidkyPasha about the text of the Sudan Protocol to the newAnglo-Egyptian Treaty.(2) Asked the Minister of State to put in hand preliminaryarrangements for inviting leaders of political parties inthe Sudan to visit this country.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would ask the Governor-General of the Sudan to continue in office and that theForeign Secretary was also sending him a letter whichhe could show to British Members of the Administrationexplaining the reasons why His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad recognised the Egyptian claim in regard to theSudan and stating that the position and prospects ofBritish officials would not be jeopardised.(4) Suggested, that a further letter should be sent to theGovernor-General in suitable terms to be shown to the sudanese leaders assuring him that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had considered his representations andwere satisfied that Sudanese interests were fully safe-guarded by the proposed Sudan Protocol to the newAnglo-Egyptian Treaty.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (46) 408) covering a draft of theTransport Bill and drawing attention to certain points on which decisions were required; and a memorandum by the Lord President(CP. (46) 420) reporting the conclusions reached by the Committeeon the Socialisation of Industries as a result of their examinationof the Bill.The Cabinet first considered the conclusions reached by theCommittee on the Socialisation of Industries on the points raised in CP. (46) 408. These were summarised in paragraph 2 of cp. (46) 420. There was general agreement that the Committee&apos;conclusions should be accepted, on the understanding that theMinister of Transport would consider, in consultation with the LordChancellor and Parliamentary Counsel, whether it would be preferable to provide in Clause 28 that, where transferred property was subject to mortgage, the compensation should be paid into asuspense account pending settlement of the claims of the severalincumbrancers.With reference to the compensation Clauses of the Bill theChancellor of the Exchequer said that he had agreed with theMinister of Transport on the terms of compensation to stockholders.In order to check undesirable speculation, he desired to make anearly announcement in the House of Commons of the proposals under this head which the Government intended to submit for theapproval of Parliament.It was pointed out in discussion that the redemption of railwaydebentures would involve serious inconvenience for trustees. Thiswas inevitable; but it would be helpful if, to balance this incon-venience, some generosity could be shown in the terms of compensa-tion. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would keep thispoint in mind;The Cabinet Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make an early announcement (if necessary in advance of thepublication of the Bill) about the terms of compensationproposed for stockholders.6-3] b 3
The Cabinet then considered the recommendations made bythe Committee on the Socialisation of Industries on the points setout in paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 420.It was agreed that the qualifications for membership ofthe British Transport Commission should be specificallystated in the Bill.Some doubt was expressed about the proposal that the Billshould specifically provide for a separate Hotels Executive to runrailway hotels, restaurants and restaurant cars, and it wassuggested that it might be better to omit from Clause 5 (3) of theBill all references to the particular Executives to be established.As against this, it was argued that such references were necessaryto give an indication of the form of the proposed organisation : andthat there were advantages in making clear from the outset theGovernment&apos;s intention to provide that hotels, restaurants andrestaurant cars should be under the management of a separateExecutive. The Minister would not, however, be tied down to establishing the Hotels Executive at any specified time.The Cabinets conclusion was that the balance ofadvantage was on the side of including in the Bill a reference to the Hotels Executive in the form recommended in paragraph 3 (6) of CP. (46) 420. The Minister ofTransport undertook (i) to consider whether the HotelsExecutive could be empowered to run the hotels at civilairports owned by the State, and (ii) to consult thePresident of the Board of Trade with regard to appoint-ments to the Hotels Executive.In paragraph 3 (c) of CP. (46) 420 it was recommended that clause 6 of the Bill should require the Minister, in setting upconsultative committees, to consider the special needs of Scotlandand Wales.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was not satis-fied that this would meet the reasonable claims of Scotland. he asked that provision should be made for a Scottish division of eachof the Executives; that there should be a Scottish Advisory Council,appointed in consultation with himself; that the Chairman of thisCouncil should be a member of the British Transport Commission;that suitable representatives of Scotland should be appointed to theExecutives; and that there should be a Scottish Co-co-ordinating committee on the lines of that for discharging the work of the forestry Commission in Scotland. Failure to make such concessions to Scottish sentiment had provoked strong opposition to the CivilAviation Bill, particularly in the House of Lords, and in the endit had been necessary to concede the demand for a separate CivilAviation Advisory Committee for Scotland.The Secretary of State also said that, in spite of the under-taking given by the Minister of Transport at the Cabinets meetingon 15th April (CM. (46) 35th Conclusions, Minute 5), the Bill didnot include powers to nationalise the steamer services in the High-lands and Islands of Scotland. It seemed to him that, in view ofthe heavy subsidies which were being paid towards these services,the Bill should at least take power to nationalise them at some later date.The Minister of Transport said that he could not accept the suggestions made by the Secretary of State. The form of the regional organisation must be related to the needs of the different forms of transport for which the British Transport commission would be responsible. Thus, it might be convenient to divideScotland into three areas for some purposes, while Wales would naturally fall into two areas. He would, therefore, strongly depre-cate any provisions in the Bill which would require him to treatScotland as a single self-contained area. It had been decided thatcoastal shipping services should not be brought under public owner-ship, and he could not agree to the inclusion in the Bill of powers to
nationalise steamer services in the Highlands and Islands ofScotland.In further discussion it was urged that the proposal to include in the Bill words requiring the Minister to consider the special needsof Scotland and Wales might imply that this was an English bill which was being applied to Scotland and Wales. It would be better to seek to meet the claims of Scotland and Wales in the first instance by substituting the words &quot;England, Scotland and Wales&quot; forthe words &quot;Great Britain&quot; in Clause 3 (1) of the Bill. Anyfurther concessions, e.g., by amendment of Clause 6, could be reserved for the Committee Stage. The Minister might also antici-pate criticism by making it clear in his Second Reading speech that,in practice, the regional organisation for transport would take full account of the needs of Scotland and Wales.The Cabinet invited the Minister of Transport to substi-tute the words &apos;&apos; England, Wales and Scotland &apos;&apos; for&quot;Great Britain&quot; in Clause 3 (1) of the Bill; to consult with the Secretary of State for Scotland regarding thestatement to be made on the Second Reading of the Billabout the regional organisation for transport in Scotlandand Wales; and to reserve for the Committee Stageany further concessions, e.g., on Clause 6 of the Bill.The Cabinet then considered the procedure proposed inparagraph 4 of CP- (46) 420 for the fixing of transport charges.It was explained that the first step would be for the british transport Commission to send to the Minister a statement of theprinciples on which they thought that the charges should be based.This statement would be referred to a Charges Advisory Committee,which would hold a public enquiry at which interested parties wouldhave the right to appear. After considering the Co.committee&apos;srecommendations, the Minister would submit to Parliament anorder fixing the principles on which the charges were to be basedand providing for the establishment of a Transport Tribunal, whichwould take the place of the Railway Rates Tribunal. In fixingparticular charges the Transport Tribunal would have regard to theprinciples laid down in the order.The President of the Board of Trade said that the power to adjust transport charges would be one of the most powerful instru-ments of economic planning. Under the procedure proposed,however, the Government would be virtually depriving themselves ofthis power. The Transport Commission could not be expected to appreciate the broader considerations of economic planning, and theprocedure envisaged would result in a rigid structure of rates which could not readily be adjusted to suit the changing needs of a planned economy. Experience had shown that in practice it wasimpossible to fix charges by reference to principles laid, down inadvance, and that the only way of securing the necessary flexibilitywas to give a tribunal such as the Railway Rates Tribunal thenecessary powers to enable it to evolve a body of principles on the analogy of the common law. A further disadvantage of theMinister&apos;s proposal was that, if the principles were to have anyeffect, they would be bound to deal with such matters as the granting of rebates to particular traffics and this would immediately bring into political controversy matters which ought to be left for decision by an independent body.In discussion it was suggested that a better course would beto appoint a body similar to the Railway Rates Tribunal, whichwould have full powers to determine rates after hearing the various interests concerned.The Minister of Transport said that he thought it essential thatthere should be a general review of the principles on which rates were to be fixed, as the British Transport Commission would begiven a virtual monopoly in the field of transport; and he thoughtit would be impossible to ask Parliament to allow this review tobe carried out entirely by an independent body.
In further discussion there was general recognition of the need to provide for the adjustment of charges to meet the needs ofeconomic planning. It was pointed out, however, that this was notnecessarily inconsistent with the procedure proposed by the Ministerof Transport, and that the alternative of laying down no principlesin advance would not free the Minister from challenge inParliament on questions of transport charges, and might place an impossible task on the Transport Tribunal. It was desirable thatthe points raised in the Cabinets discussion should be exploredfurther by the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries.The Lord Chancellor said that he had certain points to raiseabout the constitution of the tribunals provided for under the Bill.It might be convenient if these also could be considered by theCommittee.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the points noted above and to Conclusion (2)below, approved in principle the draft Transport Bill. annexed to CP. (46) 408, and took note that the Ministerof Transport would circulate a revised draft of the Billto the Legislation Committee as soon as the outstanding points had been settled.(2) Invited the Committee on Socialisation of Industries,together with the Minister without Portfolio and theLord Chancellor, to review in the light of the cabinets discussion the procedure for the fixing of transport charges.Fuel Supplies 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note (CP. (46) 419) by the for industry. Minister of Fuel and Power covering a memorandum prepared by officials of his Department and the Board of Trade regarding ascheme for the compulsory rationing of industrial supplies of coal,gas and electricity during the coming winter.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, as indicated in hiscovering note, he did not favour the scheme recommended in thismemorandum and he would be glad of the opportunity to present tothe Cabinet an alternative scheme of his own. This could be circulated to the Cabinet before the end of the week.The Cabinet Agreed to defer consideration of this question until their meeting on 19th November.Civic 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (46) 418) byRestaurants. the Minister of Food, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of StateSupply of for Scotland proposing that the Civic Restaurants Bill shouldIntoxicating empower local authorities to supply intoxicating liquor inLiquor. restaurants operated under the Bill.It was pointed out in the memorandum that, if this proposal were approved, a special procedural difficulty would arise in thelarger burghs in Scotland, where the local authority administeringa civic restaurant wOuld, if seeking a licence, have to apply to licensing court whose members would also be members of the localauthority. The alternative procedure would be to empower theMinister of Food or the Secretary of State for Scotland to grantlicences; and it was considered that this alternative would raiseeven greater difficulties. It was therefore recommended that, ifdrink was to be sold at all in civic restaurants, the local authoritiesshould be left to follow the procedure prescribed by the ordinarylicensing law.In discussion, it was pointed out that at present these were mainly family restaurants, and if they supplied intoxicating liquortheir character might be changed. Would it not be wiser to see how these restaurants developed before deciding that they might beempowered to supply drink ?
As against this, it was pointed out that the development ofcivic restaurants against the competition of privately-ownedcatering establishments might be handicapped if they wereprecluded from selling drink. All that was proposed was that theBill should empower local authorities to do this if they so desiredand obtained the necessary licence. The issue would therefore be leftto local option.The Cabinet Agreed that a provision should be included in the CivicRestaurants Bill authorising the sale of intoxicatingliquor in civic restaurants, subject to compliance with thenormal requirements of the licensing law.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th November, 1946.
