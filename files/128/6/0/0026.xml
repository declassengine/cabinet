South-WestAfrica.(previous reference:CM. (46) 85thConclusions,Minute 5.)AT their meeting on 10th October the Cabinet had deferred pending discussions with Field-Marshal Smuts, a final decision ontheir attitude towards the proposal of the South African Govern-ment that Soutb-West Africa should be incorporated in the Union.They had, however, considered that, if they were pressed for animmediate indication of their views, use might be made of thefollowing formula: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government, for its part,expresses its confidence that the South African Government hassought to ascertain as accurately as possible the wishes of theinhabitants; but it will, of course, be for the United Nations todecide whether the action taken for this purpose by the SouthAfrican Government is satisfactory to them.&apos;&apos;The Cabinet were now informed that the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had had an opportunityof discussing this matter with Field-Marshal Smuts. He had urged very strongly that, in the discussions at the forthcoming meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the UnitedKingdom Government should support the incorporation of South-West Africa in the Union; and he had taken particular exception to the second part of the formula reproduced above. Apart fromthe fact that it indicated indecision, it would be inappropriate tosuggest that the United Nations might prescribe other methods of ascertaining the views of the inhabitants. For the United nations had not inherited all the powers of the League of Nations in respectof mandated territories; and the approach which the South african government were making to the General Assembly was not anapplication for permission to incorporate South-West Africa in theUnion, but merely a notification of the wishes of the inhabitants.Field-Marshal Smuts had made it clear that, whatever was said inthe General Assembly, the Union Government intended, inpursuance of their powers as mandatory, to proceed with their plan of incorporating this territory in the Union.In discussion the view was expressed that, even though theUnited Nations had no legal right to prescribe procedure for ascer-taining the views of the inhabitants in this case, the United King-dom Government should on general grounds support the principlethat transfers of sovereignty should not take place unless the wishes of the inhabitants had been ascertained by methods prescribed or approved by international agreement. It was also suggested thatit was unfortunate that the Union Government should insist onproceeding with this proposal at the present time, before the trusteeship Council had been established and laid down rules ofprocedure which would afford some guidance to Governments insuch matters. The notification which the Union Government pro-posed to make at the General Assembly was likely to provoke debate in which the policy of that Government would be criticised, andother Governments of the British Commonwealth would be placedin an embarrassing position.Despite these considerations, however, it was the general viewof the Cabinet that it would be inexpedient for the United KingdomGovernment to refrain from supporting the Union Government inthis matter if the action which they proposed to take were contestedin the General Assembly. As the matter was to come up in the formof a notification of the steps taken by the Union Government toascertain the wishes of the inhabitants, there was no occasion forthe United Kingdom Government to indicate in advance that theywould support the South African case. The United KingdomGovernment were, however, satisfied that the steps taken by theUnion Government to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants were as complete and satisfactory as was practicable; and their repre-sentatives could properly support the Union Government in resistingany suggestion which might be made in the Assembly for supple-mentary enquiries for this purpose.The Cabinet were informed that the Union Government wouldbe willing to make a declaration, in the course of the proceedings at the Assembly, that in the administration of South-West africa the principles of the mandate system would continue to be fullyobserved.
In the light of the discussion recorded above, the Cabinetproceeded to consider the draft reply contained in Annex IV to cp. (46) 371 to a Parliamentary Question by Lieut.-Colonel D. It.Rees-Williams, M.P., about the steps taken to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants of the territory. It was agreed that, subject tothe omission of the statement that the United Kingdom Government&quot; supported the South African case,&quot; a statement in the terms ofthe draft answer annexed to CP. (46) 371 should be made in theHouse of Commons before the meeting of the General Assembly.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the proposal of the South African Govern-ment to incorporate South-West Africa in the union were contested in the General Assembly of the united nations, the United Kingdom Government should express their confidence in the measures taken by theUnion Government to ascertain the wishes of theinhabitants, should oppose suggestions for any inde-pendent enquiry on this point, and should support theSouth African case for the incorporation of this terri-tory in the Union;(2) Agreed that, while there was no occasion to announce inadvance this intention to support the South Africancase, the Parliamentary Question about the consultationof the inhabitants of the territory should be answeredin the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 371,subject to the substitution of the following, in place ofthe final sentence of that draft: &quot; I take this oppor-tunity to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom is satisfied as to the steps taken bySouth African Government to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants.&quot;Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18*A October, 1946.
