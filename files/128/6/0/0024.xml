Shipping. i.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the MinisterPurchase of     of Transport (CP. (46) 375) regarding the United States and united States   Canadian dry cargo shipping at present in our service,jad Canadian The Minister of Transport said that since the end of the warpry Cargo       our shipping deficiency of between 4 and 5 million deadweight tonsStopping.        2m(j keen made good (i) by bareboat charter of about 1 million tons(Previous        of Canadian, and about 2-8 million tons of United States, shipping;Reference:       and (ii) by voyage charter of additional Canadian and United StatesCM. (45)29th   ships.   Under an agreement made with the Canadian GovernmentConclusions,     re-delivery of the Canadian ships on bareboat charter was not to minute 1.)      be completed until September 1949.   No similar agreement had yetbeen made with the United States Government, and there was reasonto fear that we might be faced with a sudden demand for thereturn of these United States ships.   Such a demand might be averted if a number of these ships could be bought; and arrange-ments might then be made for the re-delivery of the remainder tobe deferred for some years.   He therefore sought the authority ofthe Cabinet for the purchase of United States or Canadian ships at present on bareboat charter to us up to a total of 1 million dead-weight tons.  Among these ships he proposed to buy 75 &quot; Liberty &quot;ships which would be resold to British ship-owners.   Their cost would be about $41 million : but this would be offset by savings on the cost of their bareboat hire, which over three years would amount to about $21 - 5 million.   It might also be necessary topurchase on Government account 35 ships at present engaged onour short sea trades.  Their price was disproportionately high, eventhough it would be offset by savings on chartering, and it would be preferable to retain them on bareboat charter, at least until the endof 1949.   If, however, this was. not practicable, he would be com-pelled to buy them on Government account.It was also desirable to reduce our dependence on voyage-chartering. The best means of doing so would be to buy outrighta certain number of the ships now on voyage-charter and to give an assurance to ship-owners and builders that if, after three or fouryears, the ships so bought became surplus and stood in the way of construction of new ships in British shipyards, they would betaken off the market. The exact number of ships to be boughtwould depend on the volume of our import programme in 1947 and1948, but the Minister asked for authority, if need be, to buy up to50 of these ships at a cost of about $30 million. This would be offset by equivalent savings in freight rates over two years.The First Lord of the A dmiralty supported the proposals madeby the Minister of Transport. He suggested, however, particularlyin regard to the proposal to purchase up to 50 ships not on bareboatcharter, that the Minister should keep in touch with the Ship-building Advisory Committee, whose terms of reference coveredall matters affecting new shipbuilding.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theapplication for authority to buy 75 &quot; Liberty &quot; ships now on bare-boat charter and 35 ships engaged in the short sea trades. the dollar expenditure involved would be largely offset by savings onchartering. No cost would fall on the United Kingdom Exchequerfrom the purchase of the &apos;&apos; Liberty &apos;&apos; ships, as they were to beresold, to private ship-owners. He a&apos;sked, however, that no decision should be taken at this stage on the application for authority to buy up to 50 further United States ships not on bareboat charter,as he considered that the financial implications of this proposalrequired further examination.Other points made in discussion were : (a) High freight rates were seriously affecting the price ofimports, notably timber, and the possibility of reducing those rates should be considered.(b) If the United States Government were willing to sell war-time ships which were earning high freights, this was because they regarded them as having no continuing value. We must be careful to avoid being forced into buying more of such ships than were[32676-1] b 2
necessary; and also to ensure that any ships bought did not spoil!the market for United Kingdom shipbuilders.   There was generalagreement that, if there was any question of ships bought affectingUnited Kingdom shipbuilding, an assurance should be given to theindustry at the appropriate stage on the lines suggested by theMinister of Transport.(c) It was to be hoped that we should recover some of our carry,ing trade, and account should be taken of this in calculating whetheradditional United States ships would be required.(d) Many ships in the mercantile marine were now very old-and it was important to avoid a situation in which, in two or threeyears&apos; time, a large proportion of our merchant fleet would beobsolete. Building in United Kingdom yards over the next fiveyears should cover to a considerable extent replacement of obsoleteships as well as an increase in our total tonnage.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to purchase up to1 million deadweight tons of United States and canadian ships at present on bareboat charter to theUnited Kingdom, the ships purchased to include (i) upto 75 &quot; Liberty &quot; ships which would be resold to UnitedKingdom ship-owners, and (ii) 35 ships engaged in the short sea trades which would be purchased on government account.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to discuss further withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer the suggestion that,to reduce our dependence on voyage-chartering, up to50 additional ships of the bulk-cargo type should be bought from the United States on Government account.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to submit to the cabinet a memorandum covering (i) the present level of freight rates and the possibility of reducing them, (ii) the steps which could be taken to recover our carrying trade, and(iii) the age and quality of our merchant fleet.Commercial 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Food(Previous (CP. (46) 374) covering the brief on international commodity policyReference: which had been prepared for the guidance of the United KingdomCM. (46)44th delegates to the Preparatory Committee on Trade and EmploymentConclusions, and to the Preparatory Commission of the Food and AgricultureMinute 8.)      Organisation.In discussion attention was drawn to the proposal that the costof schemes for promoting increased imports into needy countries should be borne by producer countries and not by charging higher prices to other importing countries.   Was it likely that this pro-posal would prove acceptable to producer countries?   Was it notprobable that other importing countries would have to make some contribution 1   It was pointed out that these schemes would be forthe long-term benefit of producers and it was reasonable that anattempt should be made to persuade them to bear the whole of thecost.    Our representatives should certainly take this as their Iobjective, though they might be forced to make some concession.!The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the dangers of 1our incurring further dollar expenditure for the benefit of other Icountries; and asked that no concession should be made on this Ipoint without further reference to the Cabinet.   There was general support for this view.The Cabinet-Approved the brief annexed to CP. (46) 374, on the under-standing that it would be made clear to the UnitedKingdom delegates that they were not at liberty, without
61CM. 86 (46)further instructions, to agree to any modification of theprinciple that the cost of schemes for promoting increased imports into needy countries should be borne by the producer countries concerned.3. The President of the Board of Trade said that on1st August the Ministerial Coal Committee had decided that, inallocating new production of large excavators, the Excavator Allo-cation Committee should give absolute priority to the needs of open-cast coal working until requirements for 500 cubic yards capacityhad been fulfilled. On the basis of that decision the Ministry of fuel and Power had requisitioned a large excavator built by Messrs.Ransome and Maries to the order of the Finnish Government. this order had been placed long before 1st August, and the Finns hadbuilt a special ship to convey the excavator to Finland, where itwas urgently needed for the construction of a power station. the finns had been counting on having it delivered by the autumn sothat the preparation of the site could be completed before the onsetof winter. The diversion of this plant to open-cast coal workingwould be keenly resented by the Finnish Government and might prejudice negotiations now proceeding for the supply of a large quantity of timber from Finland to this country.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that this particularexcavator would provide only 50 of the 500 cubic yards&apos; capacity for which his Department had been given absolute priority. Itwould, however, produce 40,000 tons of open-cast coal a year; andthe coal production programme depended on a substantial increasein open-cast working. These excavators took many months to build;and it was only by diversion of orders that his Department wouldbe able to secure early delivery of the new plant for which they hadbeen given priority.After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that the coal committee had not been aware at the time that their decision of1st August would be taken as giving authority to override the dueperformance of a contract concluded with a foreign Government.The general question of allocating available supplies of excavatorsbetween the various claimant Departments had since been taken up on the Lord Presidents Committee, who had invited the lord president to allocate new production in 1947, and to consider what further contribution could be made by the Services from plantalready held by them. It was preferable that these matters shouldbe handled in future under the authority of the Lord presidents committee, who could hold the balance between the various civiluses. And absolute priority for one claimant, at the expense of all others, should not in future be given (even for a limited period)without the authority of the Cabinet itself. Meanwhile, he thoughtthat the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of allowing the Finnish Government to obtain immediate delivery of theexcavator which they had ordered from Messrs. Ransome andMaries. The Ministry of Fuel and Power might be able to make good the loss of this excavator by securing additional plant now heldby the Service Departments; and he would himself represent tothe Service Ministers the need for immediate action to give effectto the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (46) 31stMeeting, Minute 4, Conclusion (1)) that their Departments shouldmake available one-third of their holdings of civil engineeringequipment.The Cabinet-(1) Decided that the Ministry of Fuel and Power should atonce relinquish to the Finnish Government the excavatorbuilt to their order by Messrs. Ransome and Maries,which had been requisitioned by that Department foruse in open-cast coal working;
Cabinet Office, S. W. 115th October, 1946(2) Confirmed the decision taken by the Lord President^Committee on 27th September, 1946, that the allocation of civil engineering equipment from new productionsurpluses and Service holdings should in future ^carried out under the authority of the Lord presidents committee;(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would represent to theService Ministers the need for immediate action to giveeffect to the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee; that the Service Departments should make available for civil needs one-third of their holdings of civil engineering equipment.
