flntiny amongBritish Troopsg Malaya.1. The Secretary of State for War recalled that, in his statement in the House of Commons on the 8th October, he had said that he was awaiting the advice of the Judge Advocate-Genera]on the legality of the proceedings which had been taken betweenthe 12th August and 19th September against a number of men ofthe 13th Parachute Battalion on charges arising from a mutinyat the Muar Camp, Malaya, on the 14th May. He had now receivedthe report of the Judge Advocate-General, who advised him thatthe proceedings were irregular in several respects and that theconvictions could not be allowed to stand. He was satisfied that the trial, as a whole, was unsatisfactory; and he therefore proposed toquash all the convictions recorded. The men now detained inconsequence of those convictions would be released forthwith; andno further proceedings would be taken either against them or against the others Who had not so far been brought to trial. Forpurposes of demobilisation the period which these men had spentawaiting trial or under detention would count as service.The Secretary of State said that he proposed to announce thisdecision in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement made by the Secretary of Statefor War.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Business inthe House ofLords.The King&apos;speeches onthe Proroga-tion and opening ofParliament.2. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.On the 14th October there would be a debate on a Motionrelating to the Fair Wages Clauses in Government Contracts.On the 15th October there would be second reading debates onthe Coinage Bill, the Public Works Loans (No. 2) Bill and theUnemployment Insurance (Eire Volunteers) Bill. The Committeeand remaining stages of these Bills would be taken on the18th October.On the 16th October there would be a debate on Coal, on the motion for the Adjournment. It was agreed that the opposition should be left to open this debate. The Minister of Fuel and power would follow the first Opposition speaker, and his parliamentary secretary would reply to the debate.The Committee and remaining stages of the Association ofCounty Councils (Scotland) Bill, the Police (Scotland) Bill and theEducation (Scotland) Bill would be taken on the 17th October.The Lord President said that there was little business for theHouse of Commons in the week beginning the 21st October; and itwould be helpful if business could be taken then for which time would otherwise have to be found in the next Session. possible alternatives were a debate on India or on the White Paper onCentral Organisation for Defence and the Ministry of DefenceBill. The Cabinet reaffirmed their view that it would be preferable to defer for the time being a debate on India. And, if the Ministryof Defence Bill were introduced and passed through the House ofCommons, this would increase the congestion of business in theHouse of Lords. The Lord President undertook to consider theposition further, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, if theHouse of Lords was to complete its legislative business before thedate now proposed for prorogation, it was important that no time should be lost in passing through the House of Commons the HillFarming Bill, the A tomic Energy Bill and the Coinage Bill.The Prime Minister said that he had appointed a committee consisting of the following : Lord President (Chairman)Lord Privy SealChancellor of the ExchequerLord Chancellor[32563-4]b 2
Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsChief whip to prepare and submit to the Cabinet drafts for The King&apos;speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on thePalestine Conference by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 358). This gave an accountof the discussions at the Conference with Delegates of the arab states, and a summary of informal conversations with representa-tives of the Jewish Agency with a view to bringing Jewish repre-sentatives into the Conference.The Prime Minister suggested that further discussion of theGovernments policy in respect of Palestine should be deferred until after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return to London.The Cabinet took note of CP.

The Lord Chancellor said that it had been suggested toJudgment at him that the text of the judgment at the Nuremberg trial of warNuremberg criminals should be published in this country as a Command Paper.Trial. He commended this suggestion to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theLord Chancellor, to arrange for the text of the judgmentat the Nuremberg trial to be presented to parliament as a Command Paper.Review of The Cabinet were informed that the Control Council in BerlinNuremberg were now considering the appeals lodged against the sentencesSentences. imposed at the Nuremberg trial. After a meeting of Ministers held under the Prime Minister&apos;s Chairmanship on the 7th October, theBritish Commander-in-Chief had been informed that on political grounds it would be preferable that there should be no alteration ofthe sentences imposed by the Court, and he had been invited toask for further instructions if he found any disposition on theControl Council to modify any of the sentences. At their firstmeeting the Council had considered eleven appeals and had decidedto reject them all. The remaining appeals were to be considered at a second meeting later that day. An appeal that the sentence of death on General Jodl should be executed by shooting insteadof hanging had been supported by the representatives of the UnitedStates and France on the Council; but neither the British nor theSoviet member of the Council had been willing to agree to this modification of the Courts sentence.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to informthe British Commander-in-Chief that the cabinet endorsed his refusal to agree to any modification of the sentence imposed by the Court on General Jodl.tsount The Cabinet were informed that Count von Papen, who hadvon Papen. been acquitted of the charges preferred against him at Nuremberg,had applied for permission to take up residence in the british zone of Germany on the ground that he was residing there whenhe was arrested by the Allied Armies in April, 1945. The british commander-in-Chief had rejected this application, but had askedfor the Cabinets views, in ease the application were renewed. Hehad pointed out that, if von Papen were admitted to the british zone, he would in the ordinary course be interned and brought before a tribunal as a potentially dangerous person.In discussion, it was pointed out that it was undesirable thatthe British authorities in Germany should appear to be putting ontrial again a man who had been acquitted by the . Court at
53CM. 85 (46).Nuremberg.   It was also undesirable that we should appear to be       11 2giving asylum to a person of such notoriety as von Papen.   On bothgrounds it would be preferable that he should not be admitted tothe British Zone.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to informthe British Commander-in-Chief that it was the view ofthe Cabinet that Count von Papen should not beadmitted to the British Zone of Germany.South-WestAfrioa.(previous reference:CM. (46) 45thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (OP. (46) 371) regarding the attitude to be taken by the United Kingdom Government to the. proposal which was to be made by the South African Government at the forth-coming Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations that south-West Africa should be incorporated in the Union.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thematter was one of great importance, in view of the political situationin the Union. After two previous discussions the Cabinet had decided that they would support the South African proposal if theconsent of the inhabitants had been sought and obtained &quot; by methods agreeable to the United Nations.&quot; Field-Marshal smuts had been informed accordingly. The South African Governmenthad consulted the natives by methods which were set out in Annex Ito OP. (46) 371, and a substantial majority had declared themselvesin favour of incorporation in the Union. He was himself satisfiedthat the methods of consultation adopted had been as fair as was practicable; and Lord Hailey, who was now in South Africa, had confirmed this view.The South African Government had given notice of their intention to raise this question at the forthcoming Session of theAssembly; but the United States Government had suggested to themthat it should be postponed for a year and that meanwhile a united nations Commission of Enquiry should visit the country and make recommendations to the Assembly. This suggestion would not be acceptable to Field-Marshal Smuts, who would feel obliged by considerations of domestic politics in the Union to keep the subject on this year&apos;s Agenda.The attitude of the United Kingdom Government must bere considered in the light of these developments. The Secretary ofState believed that a most unfavourable impression would be created in South Africa if we showed any signs of sympathy with theUnited States proposal. He therefore suggested that a public statement should at once be made, in reply to a Question which wasto be asked in the House of Commons on the 14th October, to theeffect that we supported the South African case and were satisfied with the steps taken to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants.In discussion serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of committing ourselves at this stage to support of theapplication of the South African Government. It was unfortunate that the consultation of the inhabitants had been carried out underthe sole responsibility of the mandatory Government without any independent observers. We might ourselves be satisfied that the consultation had been carried out impartially; but, if we argued that this form of consultation was sufficient, we might establish an embarrassing precedent. We might debar ourselves fromproposing an independent enquiry, or the presence of independentobservers, on future occasions when the United Nations wishedto be satisfied about the views of a population under thecontrol of a foreign country. It was not enough that such a consulta-tion of the inhabitants should have been fair in fact; it must also bepossible to prove to the world in general that it had been fair.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that at the first session of the General Assembly the United Kingdom Governmenthad given a firm lead towards the maintenance of the trusteeship
principle which had been the inspiration of the mandate systemAny apparent change of attitude on our part would create an unfortunate impression in the Assembly and might increase the diffi-culties of negotiating trusteeship agreements in respect of our ownmandated territories. It would also have repercussions in those territories in Africa, particularly Tanganyika, where the terms ofour draft trusteeship agreement had not been readily accepted by theEuropean population. If the Cabinet felt that it was necessary tosupport the South African application, the Colonial Secretary hopedthat it might at least be possible to secure from the South african government a declaration that in the administration of South-WestAfrica the principles of the mandate system would, continue to be fully observed. ,After further discussion, the Cabinet decided that if they were pressed for an immediate indication of their views, use should bemade of the following formula : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government, forits part, expresses its confidence that the South African Governmenthas sought to ascertain as accurately as possible the wishes of theinhabitants; but it will, of course, be for the United Nations todecide whether the action taken for this purpose by the SouthAfrican Government is satisfactory to them.&quot; They understood,however, that Field-Marshal Smuts would be arriving in thiscountry during the following week. This being so, the wisest coursewould be to explore the position further with him in the firstinstance. The Cabinet were most anxious to avoid action whichmight cause him embarrassment in South Africa, and the problem was to secure this without causing themselves embarrassment inother directions. To gain time for discussion with Field-marshal smuts, arrangements could no doubt be made to postpone theQuestion down for answer in the House of Commons on the14th October.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs would arrange to discuss thismatter with Field-Marshal Smuts as soon as he arrived in this country.(2) Asked the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toendeavour to arrange for the Parliamentary question for the 14th October to be withdrawn from the order paper.Food- 6.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentImportation (OP. (46) 356) covering a memorandum which the Ministers of Foodof Danish and of Agriculture and Fisheries had submitted to the LordMeat. Presidents Committee about a proposal to import Danish meat intothe United Kingdom. The Committee had felt that the proposal should be approved, provided that the conditions applied to theimportation of Danish meat were as stringent as those for Argen-tine meat and that the suspension of imports of Danish meat wouldbe considered if there were serious outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Europe. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries had,however, asked that the matter should be referred for final decision by the Cabinet.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theimportation of Danish meat would expose herds in this country toa greater risk of infection by foot and mouth disease. He admitted that, if the precautions approved by the Lord Presidents Committeewere taken, Danish meat would be no more dangerous, ton for ton,than Argentine meat. If, however, we departed from the policy of excluding all imports of meat from Europe, we should increase therisk by opening up a second potential source of infection. Moreover,we should find it more difficult to compel the exporters of Argentinemeat to comply with the stringent conditions now in force, and to resist proposals for the importation of meat from other european countries.  Farmers would regard the importation of Danish meat
55CM. 85 (46).as increasing the risk of infection and might be discouraged from&apos;increasing their herds to the extent necessary to secure the maximumsupplies of home-produced beef and milk; and our export trade inpedigree stock was also likely to suffer. If additional meat must beobtained, would it not be possible to use the Danish meat for thepurpose of the proposed loan of meat to the United States Zone ofGermany ?The Secretary of State for Scotland supported these views. Hethought that the risk of infection from waste food would beincreased in the areas to which Danish meat was sent.The Minister of Food said that, as the Danish Governmentwere willing to accept the same stringent conditions as were applied in the Argentine, there seemed to be no reason why the importationof Danish meat should lead to a relaxation of the precautions takenin the Argentine. He fully agreed with the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries about the importance of preventing foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom, but he was not satisfied that theimportation of Danish meat would involve any increased risk. Theissue could not be avoided by diverting the Danish supplies to theUnited States Zone of Germany, for he had not yet agreed to make available the supplies for which the United States Government had asked and did not propose to do so unless he obtained an assurance that they would make good the 28,000 tons of meat which they had failed to deliver to us in 1945. It would be advantageous to haveDenmark as an alternative source of supply should we at any timehave to reduce meat imports from the Argentine because of out-breaks of foot and mouth disease in that country.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to the safeguards proposed by the lord presidents Committee, including precautions to avoid the spread of infection through waste food, the proposalto import Danish meat into the United Kingdom shouldbe approved.The Minister of Food asked that, in view of the decisionrecorded above, the Cabinet should now approve the proposal toincrease the domestic meat ration of underground workers in the coalmining industry and authorise an early announcement of thisdecision. The administrative arrangements for supplying theincreased ration could not be completed until an announcement hadbeen made.The Prime Minister said that he had agreed to receive a deputa-tion from the General Council of the Trades Union Congress to heartheir representations about the procedure followed in this matter by the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of Food.Although the General Council were understood to be now concerned only with the question of procedure and not with the merits of theproposal, it might be advisable to ascertain, before any announce-ment was made, that they would not regard it as a ground forcomplaint that the Government had announced their decision beforethe deputation was received.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the domestic meat ration for underground workers in the coalmining industry should be increasedby an additional shillingsworth of meat per week.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform theMinister of Food when this decision should be announced, after ascertaining whether the general council of the Trades Union Congress would feel any difficulty about its being announced before he hadreceived their deputation.
War Memoirs.(previous reference:CM. (46) 71stConclusions,Minute 4.)Mr. Churchill.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (46) 369) covering a copy of a letter fromMr. Churchill seeking agreement in principle to the inclusion ofcertain official documents in an account which he proposed to writeof the war of 1939-45.The Prime Minister explained that the documents in questionincluded : (i) memoranda circulated by Mr. Churchill to the WatCabinet on strategic issues; (ii) minutes addressed by him to theChiefs of Staff or to his colleagues; and (iii) telegrams addressed byhim to President Roosevelt and other heads of Governments, togetherwith summaries of the replies received by bim. Mr. churchill had made it clear that he would agree to submit the text for revision on behalf of the Government before publication, andwould be ready to discuss the omission of any portion of it towhich objection might be taken. This would enable the Govern-ment to ensure that nothing was included which would injure usin our relations with other nations, or be contrary to the publicinterest, or impair the confidential relations between Ministers or between Ministers and their advisers. When Mr. Churchill sub-mitted the text of his book it might be found desirable to consultother Governments, including the Dominion Governments, withregard to the publication of particular telegrams addressed to headsof Governments and of summaries of the replies to these telegrams;but it seemed clear that there was no need to consult these Govern-1ments at the present stage. It was understood that there would no question of the publication of any part of Mr. ChurchilPs book Ifor about two or three years.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Mr. Churchill should be informed that His]Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to give their agree-ment in principle to the proposal that he should include in his account of the 1939-45 war memoranda andminutes written by himself as Prime Minister or as FirstLord of the Admiralty, together with telegrams from himself to President Roosevelt and other heads of governments, on the understanding that before any partof his book was published the text would be submitted for final revision on behalf of the Government, in the light ofthe situation existing at the time.Harry The Cabinet were informed that an application had been madeHopkins. by Lord Beaverbrook for permission to consent to the publicationof certain letters which he had addressed to the President and Vice-President of the United States and to Harry Hopkins, dealing withthe United States-United Kingdom production programme for 1942.The intention was to publish the letters in a life of Harry Hopkins,which was being written by Mr. Robert Sherwood. The Depart-ments concerned had been consulted and saw no objection to thepublication of the information contained in the documents, thoughadmittedly the letters gave only a partial, and to some extentmisleading, picture of the supply position at the time.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that Lord Beaverbrook should be informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would consent to the publicationof this material, so far as they were concerned, on theunderstanding that the United States Government wereapproached and also agreed.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th October, 1946.
