Food.wheat supplies forthe UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:CM. (46) 103rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Minister of Food informed the Cabinet of the difficul-ties which he was encountering in obtaining from the United states the supplies of wheat on which we relied to maintain the currentbread ration in this country. No supplies had been shipped in thepresent quarter, and the allocations proposed for the first quarterof 1947 made no provision for any shipments to this country. unless we received at least 150,000 tons from the United States by the endof January, it would be necessary to reduce the bread ration. Ina message which he had sent to the United States Secretary for agriculture (AMAZE 8112) he had suggested that he might goto the United States this week to discuss the position personally.The Foreign Secretary had already spoken to Mr. Byrnes, who had assured him that he was doing his best to secure a decision favour-able to us. United States Ministers were expected to take a decision that day.In discussion there was general support for the view that itwould be expedient to await the result of Mr. Byrnes&apos;s interventionbefore other measures were taken. If it was heard that UnitedStates Ministers, at their meeting that day, had reached no decisionor a decision unfavourable to us, the Prime Minister might send a personal message to President Truman and the Minister of Foodmight proceed at once to Washington.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to decide, when he knew theresults of the meeting which United States Ministers were holding that day. whether he should send a personal message to President Truman and whether the Ministerof Food should go to Washington with a view to assuringthe shipment of United States wheat to the UnitedKingdom.Productionof Textiles.Export ofCotton Goods.2.   The Cabinet had before them : (i) a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. (46) 442) proposing that for the period 1st march to 31st August, 1947, the clothing ration should be 32coupons, sheets being brought within the rationing system; that plans should be made on the basis that the ration for the following period from 1st September, 1947,to 29th February, 1948, would be 34 coupons; and thatthe quarterly allocation of cotton goods for exportshould be reduced from 26,245 tons to 15,000 tons;(ii) memoranda by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(CP. (46) 458) and the Secretary of State for Burma(CP. (46) 460) expressing concern at the proposed reduc-tion of exports, and1 asking that a decision on this point should be postponed until there had been an opportunityof consulting Dominion Governments.The President of the Board of Trade said that the increase inthe production of cotton goods had fallen short of expectations. Inthe last three months of 1946 production was not likely to exceed90,000 tons, compared with an estimate of 95,400 tons; and in thefirst quarter of 1947 it was estimated that production would totalonly 87,500 tons. The short-fall was due largely to the recent decision of the industry to work a 45-hour week; but the effect ofthis would be aggravated in the coming quarter by the incidence of sickness in the winter months, the raising of the school-leaving age and the possible interruption of fuel supplies. The president said that in these circumstances there could be no substantial increase in the clothes ration, and there must be an appreciablereduction in the total volume of exports, particularly of cotton goods.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was satisfiedthat the total allocation for export must be reduced to 15,000 tonsa quarter in terms of cotton yarn. In view, however, of the repre-sentations made in CP. (46) 458 and 460, he would not ask the
Cabinet to decide at this stage between the alternative methods of distributing this cut which were set out in the Appendix to his memorandum CP. (46) 442. If the Cabinet approved his proposalfor the division of the total production between the home market and exports, he would arrange for the appointment of a Committeeof officials representing all the interested Departments to consider how the amount available for export could best be distributed amongthe various markets. Recommendations based on the report of thisCommittee could, if necessary, be submitted to the Cabinet at alater stage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if there was to bea reduction in the total volume of cotton exports, it became themore important to control the destinations to which the exportswent. He was therefore opposed to the suggestions in CP. (46)442 for reducing the measure of control over exports. He consideredthat the export of cotton goods should be so planned as to give priority to bard-currency countries, Commonwealth countries andcountries on which we relied for our food supplies. None of ourcotton exports should, in his view, go to France. Indeed, in viewof the Monnet Plan for the reconstruction of French industry andthe extent of our financial assistance to France, he thought therewas a good case for pressing France to export cotton goods to thiscountry.Other Ministers stressed the need for maintaining exports ofcotton goods to countries, particularly in South-East Asia, fromwhich we wished to secure increased exports of food-stuffs: and itwas agreed that the Ministry of Food should be represented on theproposed Committee of officials.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the export allocation of cotton goods shouldbe reduced to 15,000 tons a quarter; and invited thePresident of the Board of Trade to appoint a Committeeof officials representing the interested Departments toconsider how the reduced allocation could best be distri-buted among the various export markets.The President of the Board of Trade said that, to ensureequitable distribution, it was desirable that sheets should now bepurchasable against clothing coupons. The available supply ofsheets represented the equivalent of one coupon per head over thewhole population. If, therefore, sheets were brought within the rationing system and the number of coupons was raised from 30to 32, this would represent a slight increase in the total clothing-ration. It would, in his view, have a depressing effect both on public morale and on industrial production if now, over a year-after the end of the war, the clothing ration were actually reduced ;and, with these considerations in mind, he recommended the Cabinetto authorise a ration of 32 coupons for the next rationing period.There was general agreement with this view. Discussionturned on the question whether the decision should be announcedbefore or after Christmas. The Cabinet were informed thatdirections for the allocation of cotton yarn would have to be given before 1st January and deductions would be drawn from these aboutthe Governments intentions for the next rationing period. It wasthe Cabinets view that, on balance, this practical considerationoutweighed any psychological disadvantage in making what mightbe regarded as a depressing announcement shortly before Christmas.The Government should not, however, be committed at this stage to a decision that the clothing ration for the period 1st September,1947,, to 29th February, 1948, should be 34 coupons.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the clothing ration for the period 1st march to 31st August, 1947, should be 32 coupons and thatsheets should be purchasable against clothing coupons.[32919-2] B 2ClothesRationing.(previous reference:CM.

(3) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to makea statement in the House of Commons on 18th Decemberannouncing the clothing ration for the next rationingperiod and the decision (Conclusion (1) above) to reducethe total volume of exports of cotton goods.Organisation In the discussion several Ministers expressed disappointmentof Cotton at the slow progress made with the reorganisation of the cottonIndustry. industry. The President of the Board of Trade referred to the enquiries which had been made by the Cotton. Working Party andthe Ever shed Commission, and explained the steps which were beingtaken to give effect to the recommendations made in those reports.Among the reasons for slow progress were, on the employers&apos; side,the lack of progressive leaders in the spinning section of theindustry and, on the workers&apos; side, the multiplicity of small unions.Efforts were now being made to enlarge the spinning section intoa yarn section with a view to bringing some of the more progressiveemployers into the organisation. Negotiations were also proceedingfor amalgamation of the unions.Comment was also made on the industry&apos;s decision to adopta 45-hour week. It was most unfortunate that this decision, whichassumed a reduction in output, should have been taken by the two sides of the industry, without any consultation with the Govern-ment, at a time when increased production was so important to thenational economy. It was surprising that neither the Ministry ofLabour nor the Board of Trade should have been aware that theindustry were contemplating this reduction in hours: it shouldhave been possible for the Government to give the industry someofficial guidance, before a final decision was taken, on the conse-quences of such a step from the point of view of the national economy.The suggestion was also made that further steps might with advantage be taken to present to the public, both in the cottontowns and generally, the importance of the cotton industryto the national economy, its requirements in terms of man-power and re-equipment, and the measures proposed by the Govern-ment for reorganising the industry and, placing it on a sound economic basis.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the President of the Board, of Trade to arrangefor the Prosperity Campaign (Official) Committee toconsider what further publicity arrangements could with advantage be undertaken in respect of the re-organisation of the cotton industry.Man-Power. 3.   In the course of the discussion recorded in the precedingManning of Minute, reference was made to the need for attracting furtherEssential labour into the cotton industry, and it was suggested that for thisIndustries. purpose local publicity might now be undertaken in the cottontowns. As against this, it was pointed out that the decision tointroduce a 45-hour week had been taken with a view to attractinglabour to the industry; and a local publicity campaign might havethe effect of withdrawing labour from the engineering industry,which must produce the machinery required for the re-organisationof the.cotton industry. The general point was also made that therewere grave risks in an unco-ordinated approach to the problem of improving conditions in industries now regarded as unattractiveto labour. If, as had.recently happened in the cotton industry, itwas left to industries themselves to improve conditions of employ-ment, without official guidance, improved conditions might be offered by an industry into which the Government did not thinkit right that further labour should be attracted. And action in thisdirection taken by one industry might stimulate similar action by another. Some Ministers felt that these risks underlined the needfor increased Government control over wages policy.
Reference was also made to the extent to which labour wasbeing attracted by high wages into unproductive employment.Comment was made, in particular, on the numbers engaged in theoperation of football pools; and the question was raised whetherfootball pools should not be prohibited.The Cabinet considered that a general review should be madeof the distribution of our available man-power, showing the extentto which the essential industries were under-manned, and how farlabour which might be employed in these industries was being diverted to luxury trades or unproductive employment. On thebasis of such a review the Cabinet should consider what further steps could properly be taken to guide available labour into themore essential occupations and whether any other means could beadopted, e.g., through the control of raw materials, of reducing theman-power engaged in less essential occupations. The Cabinet were informed that some of these issues would be raised in the economic survey for 1947 which was being prepared for the MinisterialEconomic Planning Committee. The Prime Minister asked thatthis survey should be brought forward for consideration by theCabinet early in the New Year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, whether it would be prac-ticable to prohibit football pools by a Regulation madeunder the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers)Act, 1945, or whether legislation would be required forthis purpose.(2) Asked the Minister of Labour to prepare a report showingthe extent to which labour was being attracted intounproductive employment.(3) Asked the Lord President to arrange for the MinisterialEconomic Planning Committee to report to the Cabinetearly in the New Year on the general questions whichhad been raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion about thedistribution of the nation&apos;s man-power.4. The Cabinet discussed the line to be taken by the Govern-ment spokesman in the debate on India in the House of Lords that afternoon.It was agreed that it would be desirable to avoid giving any indication of the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldtake if the Muslim League did not join in the work of the Consti-tuent Assembly. For this reason it would be preferable that theGovernment speech should be made early in the debate.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had heard from Mr. Rajagopalachari that Congress did not favour thesuggestion that the disputed point of interpretation of the State-ment of 16th May should be referred to the Federal Court; butthat they might acquiesce in our interpretation of this point ifit was made clear that we intended to adhere firmly to it. It wasagreed that this might be done in the debate.Mr. Rajagopalachari had also suggested a modification of thescheme set out in the Statement of 16th May, to ensure that theconstitutions for the individual Provinces, which were to be framedby the three sections of the Constituent Assembly, should be subjectto confirmation by the representatives of those Provinces. On thispoint Ministers felt that it would be a mistake to depart at themoment from the Statement of 16th May. The point was one whichcould be considered in the Constituent Assembly if the Muslimsjoined in its discussions.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,16th December, 1946.
