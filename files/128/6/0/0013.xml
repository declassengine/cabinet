Palestine.Statement bythe chief secretary.(previous reference:CM. (46) 74thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Lord President welcomed to the Cabinet Sir JohnShaw, Chief Secretary to the Government of Palestine. Afterexpressing the Cabinet&apos;s sympathy for the Palestine Service in the losses which they had suffered as a result of the outrage at theKing David Hotel, he invited Sir John Shaw to give them his impression of the situation in Palestine.Sir John Shaw said that there was an unparalleled intensity of feeling in Palestine. On the Arab side, tne state of tensionwhich had been growing for some time had been heightened by thepublication of the Anglo-American Committee&apos;s Report and therecent succession of outrages. In the King David Hotel incidentbetween fifty and sixty Arabs had been killed, including membersof prominent families, and this had increased the tension almostto breaking point. The funerals of the victims had passed offwithout incident, but at any moment an incident might occur whichwould start serious trouble.The majority of Jews disliked bloodshed and the Jewish com-munity were, as a whole, shocked by the King David Hotel outrage.But few, if any, had openly declared their support of the Govern-ment in the suppression of terrorists. The Hebrew papers, whilecondemning terrorism, had not exhorted their readers to assist theGovernment in bringing the criminals to justice. A suggestion byone moderate newspaper that there should be a change in the leadersof the Jewish community had not been favourably received. Therewas reason to believe that the Irgun Zwei Leumi, who had been responsible for the outrage, had informed the Hagana authoritiesbeforehand of their plans and had been advised by them to alter the time from 12-30 p.m. to 2-30 p.m., when the building wouldbe much emptier, so as to reduce the number of casualties. sir john Shaw said that since the explosion he had been approached by an intermediary with the suggestion that, if the Governmentappealed to the Hagana to do so, they would deal with the terroriststhemselves. This offer had not been followed up, since it had been felt that the Palestine Government could not invoke the aid of oneillegal organisation to suppress another.As to action, the High Commissioner had proposed three things;an intensive search for terrorists, the stoppage of all immigration,legal and illegal, and the sequestration of certain Zionist funds.The Cabinet had agreed to the intensive search for terrorists andthis was being carried out. As regards the other two proposals,the High Commissioner understood that, in present circumstances,a complete withdrawal of the immigration quota would be verydifficult and he did not wish to press this suggestion. He did,however, wish to urge that steps to stop illegal immigration shouldbe renewed and that the question of the sequestration of Zionistfunds should be reopened. It was of vital importance to prevent any more illegal immigrants arriving in Palestine. There were already some thousands in the Athlit clearance camp, who formedan overdraft on the legal quota of 1,500 immigrants a month andwere released as certificates became available. The additional2,700 illegal immigrants on board the ship detained within the lasttwo days would exhaust the quota until November. The constantarrival of illegal immigrants compelled the Palestine Governmentto refuse certificates to all but a very few legal immigrants. Thusmany Jews who on grounds of hardship had a strong claim to beadmitted to Palestine were being excluded. The important con-sideration at the moment, however, was that the arrival of theseshiploads of illegal immigrants might at any moment provoke an outbreak among the Arabs. The High Commissioner hoped, there-fore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to reconsider their decision and to agree that any further ships with illegal imrni-grants should be diverted to Cyprus.
In reply to questions, Sir John Shaw made the followingpoints : (a) There had been elaborate security arrangements for the portion of the King David Hotel used to accommodate the secretariat and Military Headquarters. Unfortunately, the restof the building had remained in use as an hotel, and in the base-ment, immediately under the wing occupied by the Secretariat, wasa restaurant. The terrorists had obtained access to this through a tradesmen&apos;s entrance at the other end of the building and had made their way along a corridor in the basement. The reason why this entrance had not been guarded was not yet known. ,The Govern-ment had been aware that they were taking a certain risk in not taking over the whole hotel, though they had not feared an incidentas serious as that which had occurred. They had been reluctant to take over the whole hotel, partly because of the acute shortageof accommodation in Jerusalem and partly because they wished, asa matter of policy, to maintain a semblance of normality.(b) Though the more moderate Jews included men of positionwho might be expected to exert a good influence, such men were, inhis opinion, becoming increasingly inarticulate and unwilling to appear as the champions of the Government.(c) Both Arabs and Jews would uncompromisingly reject thenew plan of provincial autonomy. The attitude of the PalestineArabs, who were badly led and whose leaders were reactionary, was likely to be even more hostile than that of the Jews. Those Arabswho were more enlightened had not the moral courage to take astrong lead. In particular, there would almost inevitably be a violentreaction to that part of the plan which involved the immigrationof 100,000 Jews. The Arab States, whose leaders bad naturallynot quite the same degree of personal interest in the matter, wouldprobably be less hostile to the proposed settlement. Much would depend on the action taken by the Government as a result of theoutrage, and if the High Commissioner^ proposal to sequestrateZionist funds were accepted, this would have a stabilising effect onArab opinion.(d) It was almost beyond hope that Arabs and Jews would agree to sit round the same table at a conference on the governments proposals. They had been unwilling to do this at the St. James&apos;sPalace Conference in 1939, and the atmosphere was far worse now.The Government were committed to consulting the Arab and jewish representatives, but, in many respects, it would be easier to impose a scheme than to try by negotiation to get it accepted by both sides.Once imposed, both sides, after an initial outburst, might accept it.The Lord President thanked Sir John Shaw for his clear state-ment of the position. On behalf of the Cabinet, he invited him to convey to the staff of the Palestine Government their sympathy withthem in the trying circumstances in which they had to work andtheir admiration for the fortitude with which they were carryingout a task of unparalleled difficulty.Sir John Shaw then withdrew.Sequestration The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the cabinet of Zionist that, during the disturbances between 1936 and 1939, finesFunds. amounting to at least  1 million had been imposed on the Arabs.(Previous       The High Commissioner felt that in justice certain Zionist propertyReference:      should now be sequestrated and that a fine of  500,000 should become. (46) 73rd   imposed on the Jews.   The Palestine Government were faced with conclusions,     a heavy liability in respect of the damage to life and property-Minute 2.)      caused by the recent series of outrages and it did not seem unreason-able that funds up to this amount belonging to organisations suchas the Jewish Agency, whose complicity in some at least of theseoutrages had been established, should be held as security for pay-ment of this fine.In discussion the prevailing view was that in present circum-stances it would be injudicious to impose a general fine on theJewish community, many of whom were in no way responsible forthe King David Hotel outrage.[32426-6] b 2
The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed  their  conclusion   that  there   should  be  nosequestration of Zionist funds at the present time.Letter from The Secretary of State for War recalled that he had under-General taken to make inquiries about the newspaper report that a letterhad been sent by the General Officer Commanding in Palestine toofficers under his command forbidding British soldiers to hold socialintercourse with Jews. It had not been possible to get into touchwith General Barker himself, who was at present directing the search for terrorists which the Cabinet had authorised, but he understood that the letter had been sent out on his own initiative and had been given a restricted security marking. In his view, the aim of the letter had been fully justified, but he disapproved ofsome of the expressions used in it.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, though he agreed that the terms of the letter were unfortunate, he must stress the fact that the British Forces in Palestine had behaved withadmirable impartiality and great forbearance in circumstances that were most trying.In discussion, there was general agreement that, while thepurpose of the instructions had been unexceptionable, some of theexpressions used were open to serious criticism. There was evidenceof considerable feeling among Members of Parliament on thismatter, and it would undoubtedly be raised during the PalestineDebate. In these circumstances, the best course appeared to be forthe Lord President to deal with it in his opening speech onWednesday.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the british forces in Palestine were conducting very difficult and delicateoperations and that it was well established that any information which reached a Jew was liable to be conveyed to the terroristorganisations. In these circumstances, the order given by GeneralBarker seemed to be right. It was impossible in London fully to appreciate the atmosphere of Palestine and it should be realised that it was extremely difficult for the Armed Forces to avoidbecoming partisans. He had himself, however, laid great emphasis on the fact that our Forces should remain strictly neutral as betweenJew and Arab and he would take up with the General Officer Com-manding the question of the terms in which, his letter had been drafted. While he saw no objection to the Lord Presidents statingin the Debate that the Government must disassociate themselves from the terms of the letter, he hoped that it would be made clearthat General Barker had the support of the Government.The Lord President said that it was most important to avoiddoing anything which would weaken the position of the military-authorities in Palestine. Nevertheless, he felt that it would benecessary to indicate that the Government, while making allallowances for the circumstances in which; the letter had been written, and while approving the intention of the instructions, feltthat they must dissociate themselves from its ,terms. He would,at the same time, state that the Chief of the Imperial General staff was dealing with this aspect of the matter and say that it couldbe safely left in his hands.The Cabinet -(2) Agreed that the Lord President should make a statement on the lines proposed in the course of his opening speech in the Palestine Debate.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister had agreedthat the announcement of policy on Palestine drafted by the Britishand United States Delegations should be made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment alone and that President Truman should simultaneouslyissue a shorter statement. The text of this shorter statement (whichwas contained in telegram No. 406 from the United Kingdom Dele-gation in Paris) had been approved by the Prime Minister and wasArrangementsfor Debate inParliament.
now before President Truman, whose views on it had not yet beenreceived. The statement proposed that the movement of the 100,000immigrants should be initiated as soon as the decision on policy hadbeen taken after the consultations with Arabs and Jews, and iCimplied that the consultations would be completed and a decision reached not later than the 15th September.In discussion the following points were made :  (e) If the consultations were to be completed in time for adecision to be reached not later than the 15th September, thegreatest expedition would be necessary in summoning the Conferenceand in completing its work.(/) As from a given date any illegal immigrants would be counted against the 100,000 immigrants whom it was proposed to admit to Palestine under the plan drawn up by the British and united States Delegations.(g) If President Truman was unwilling to approve the pro-posals formulated by the British and United States Delegations, thequestion would arise whether the United Kingdom Governmentwere to proceed with these proposals, even without the financialassistance from the United States which was contemplated in theplan.The general view of the Cabinet was that, in any event, a full statement of the plan for provincial autonomy should be made inthe Palestine Debate on the following day.(h) It seemed desirable that both the Lord President and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs should, in their opening-speeches, give Parliament the full text of the statement agreed on by the British and United States Delegations, subject to any amencl-ments which might be necessary in view of the proposal that president Truman should make a shorter statement.(i) The Lord President said that he would preface the state-ment of the Government^ proposals with a general picture of the historical background, Which would bring out that the presentsituation was one which the Government had inherited. He wouldappeal to all Parties to join together in working out a solution. Hewould also pay a tribute to the conduct of the Armed Forces and theCivil Service in Palestine, and would make an appropriate referenceto the United States. He would, of course, make it clear that theproposals were intended to form a basis for discussion with repre-sentatives of Arabs and Jews; and it would not be possible at thisstage to indicate whether, if the two sides failed to agree on them, itwas the intention of the Government to impose them.The Cabinet (3) Endorsed the general lines of the statement which the lord president proposed to make in opening the PalestineDebate on the following day.The Cabinet then considered a report by the Chiefs of Staff(CP. (46) 306) on the steps which might be taken to prevent illegal immigration into Palestine.The Chiefs of Staff reported that it was not possible for british military authorities to take direct action to prevent the departure of ships from Greek or Italian ports, though they recommend con-tinued pressure by the Foreign Office on the European Governmentsconcerned. Nor did they consider interception and diversion on thehigh seas to be practicable, apart from the legal difficulties. Intheir view the only possible course was that the local police, aided bythe Armed Forces, should transfer the immigrants within Palestineterritorial waters to British ships in which they could be taken to cyprus or some other destination. The necessary shipping wouldhave to be provided by the Ministry of Transport.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister doubted the possibility of transferring the immigrants to British shipswithin the 3-mile limits without serious incidents. He remainedof the view that they must be allowed to land in Palestine, the women
and children being released and the adult males being detainedindefinitely in camps. Everything possible should be done toprevent the departure of immigration ships from European ports.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Office wouldcertainly consider what further pressure could be brought to bearon the foreign Governments concerned.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, while therewould be considerable political difficulties in accommodatingimmigrants in Cyprus, he did not regard these as insuperable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that guards couldbe made available in Cyprus, where there was already a garrison.It was suggested in discussion that the problem was reallyonly how to cover the next few weeks. The Government were to announce on the following day a policy which should lead in the relatively near future to the immigration of 100,000 Jews. Thisshould automatically reduce the likelihood of substantial illegal immigration. Meanwhile it could not be tp the interest of the Jewsthat there should be serious trouble with the Arabs in Palestine.Might not Dr. Weizmann be asked to use his influence to persuadeillegal immigrants not to resist transfer to staging oamps in Cypruson the practical ground that their arrival in Palestine at thisparticular moment would cause great difficulties and on the under-standing that they would be transferred to Palestine as soon ascertificates could be made available for them ?Against this, it was pointed out that the traffic was organised 1by the Jewish Agency and that Dr. Weizmann might carry little 1weight with that section of the Agency who were responsible for it. 8The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he would bear 1this suggestion in mind when seeing Dr. Weizmann that afternoon. IThe Cabinet were much impressed by the danger of serious Arab Ireactions to continued illegal immigration,  a  point on which ISir John Shaw had laid great emphasis.   There were, therefore,!strong arguments in favour of immediate and striking action.!Equally, however, they were impressed by the difficulties and risks Iof the transfer to British ships proposed by the Chiefs of Staff. IHow exactly was it contemplated that the transfer should take!place ?   Was it to be carried out off the coast of Palestine or in IHaifa harbour, which itself was not always sheltered? Would it be necessary that a British ship or ships should constantly be keptIavailable in Haifa to transfer immigrants to Cyprus?   It was!pointed out that among the latest ship-load of illegal immigrantsthere were 300 women, of whom 150 were pregnant.   If the policyof trans-shipping immigrants was to be adopted, would it not be best to let the women remain in Palestine, if necessary in clearancecamps, taking only the men to Cyprus ?The predominant feeling of the Cabinet was in favour of ascheme for trans-shipping illegal immigrants before they landed inPalestine and for conveying them to Cyprus where they could be accomodated in a staging camp. It was felt, however, that before a final decision was reached, the Prime Minister should be made aware of the Cabinefs views and that the Cabinet should have more detailed information about the manner in which a plan of thiskind would be carried out so as to minimise the risk of seriousincidents.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, inconsultation with Sir John Shaw, the High Coni-missioner for Palestine, the Chiefs of Staff and the!Minister of Transport, to draw up, for considerationby the Cabinet at their meeting on the 1st August, a plan for the operations proposed by the Chiefs of Stanto trans-ship illegal immigrants in Palestine waters andto remove them to Cyprus. \
(5) Invited the Minister of State to consider what further steps could be taken to bring pressure to bear on theforeign governments concerned with a view to stoppingillegal immigration at the source.(6) Invited the Lord President to inform the Prime Ministerof the views expressed during the discussion.Inquiry intothe Press.(previous reference:CM. (46)68thConclusions,minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 298) recommending that a Royal commission should be set up to enquire into the ownership, management andcontrol of the newspaper and periodical press and the news agencies.The Lord President recalled that at their meeting on the15th July the Cabinet had authorised him to state in the debate on broadcasting that the Government thought there was a case for considering whether there should be an enquiry into the Press.The statement which he had made in the debate had led to strongprotests in some newspapers, but the outcry against the suggestedenquiry seemed to him to be dying down and he thought it might bedesirable to announce, before the Summer Recess, that the Govern-ment proposed to set up a Royal Commission, though the actualappointment of the Commission might be deferred until after the recess.The President of the Board of Trade said that he hoped that no decision would be taken on this matter until Ministers had considered further how any enquiry would be carried out. it seemed clear that, unless the proposed enquiry were entrusted to a body set up by resolution of both Houses of Parliament under the tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, there would be no power to take evidence on oath or to enforce by legal sanction the attendance of witnesses or the production of information in writing.Moreover, the nature of the relation between the editor or thejournalist and the proprietor of a newspaper would make it verydifficult to get satisfactory evidence for the enquiry. He also feltthat before embarking on an enquiry the Cabinet should have some idea of what action they would propose to take on the results ofthe enquiry. Was it contemplated, for example, that the enquiry should lead to legislation and, if so. on what lines ?The Lo^d Chancellor said that he doubted whether it wouldbe possible to secure the services of a judge for an enquiry of thiskind.The Lord President said that he had had it in mind that an enquiry would serve a useful purpose in bringing to light unde-undesirable&apos;practices -which would cease as soon as the light of publicityhad been directed on to them. He had not contemplated that theenquiry would lead to legislation. He felt, however, that the best course would be to postpone a decision until after the summer recess, in order that further consideration might be given to thepoints raised by the President of the Board of Trade as to the com-competence of any body appointed to hold an enquiry.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer until after the Summer Eecess a decisionon the question whether an enquiry should be institutedinto the ownership, management, and control of the news-paper and periodical press and the news agencies.Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,30th Jttkj, 1946.
