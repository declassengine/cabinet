Germany. 1.   The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on the exports of      4th September the Cabinet had agreed that, in the discussions in coal from the    Berlin on the allocation of German coal exports, our representativeBritish Zone,    should propose that exports of Ruhr coal to Western Europe should(Previous       be reduced by 350,000 tons a month preferably for the periodEeference:      of fQur months from October 1946 to January 1947, if there wereCM.

Subse-quent consultations with the United States authorities had shownthat there was little prospect of any substantial increase in coal exports from America to Western Europe.   The United states authorities had also deprecated the suggestion that allocationsshould be made for one month only.   They had proposed that allo-cations should be made for six months and that the total of german exports should be reduced by 150,000 tons in each of the twomonths October and November 1946 and by 350,000 tons in eachof the four succeeding months.   The Foreign Secretary had recom-mended that, in view of the importance of securing United states support in the quadripartite discussions in Berlin, our representa-tive should be authorised to put forward the modified proposalsuggested by the United States authorities.   The Prime ministers aid that, after consulting the Control Office for Germany and austria, he had decided to modify in this sense the instructions which had been sent to our representative in Berlin in pursuanceof the Cabinefs decision of the 4th September.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the instructions which hadbeen given on their behalf by the Prime Minister.bread rationing.(previous reference:CM. (46) 70thConclusions.)2. The Cabinet considered a note (CP.

The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theSupplies. Secretary of State for India (CP. (46) 328 and 339) regarding the india. serious shortage of cereals which threatened to develop in India(Previous       in the next few months.

Despite the strenuous efforts made  since the matter had been discussed by the Cabinet on14th August, stocks would still fall considerably below the levelof five weeks&apos; consumption during September and October.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War saidthat since these memoranda had been circulated arrangements hadbeen made which would increase September shipments to india by 16,000 tons and to Malaya by 8,500 tons. As a result of ameeting of the Official Committee on Food Supplies for South-east asia effect would be given, with the approval of the InternationalEmergency Food Council, to a proposal made by Lord Killearnwhereby exports of rice from Burma during September would bedirected to areas most immediately in need of supplies, notablyIndia and Malaya, leaving countries whose needs were not so urgentto draw their supplies from Siam.      0[32426-11] b 2
The Secretary of State for India said that, taking account ofthis improvement, the shortfall below the equivalent of five weeks&apos;consumption would be at least 52,000 tons, even if supplies came up to expectations. It was not, however, safe to assume that theywould do so. For instance, the present strikes in the United states might mean that shipments from that country would not arriveto time. The Secretary of State emphasised the serious politicaleffects of famine in India at the present moment. He appreciated the great efforts which had already been made to increase suppliesbut the danger seemed to him to be still so great that further efforts should be made. In particular, he suggested that further supplies of Canadian wheat destined for this country should be diverted to India.The Minister of Food said that some 35,000 tons of canadian wheat had already been diverted to India and his Department had successfully supported measures to increase shipments to india of wheat, maize and barley from the United States, the argentine and Turkey. He could not advise the Cabinet to agree that theCanadian Government should now be asked to send any substantialfurther quantity of wheat to India. Such an approach mightjeopardise our efforts to secure an additional 40 million bushelsfrom this year&apos;s Canadian crop for the United Kingdom andcountries for whose supplies we were responsible. The most hecould do was to promise to take advantage of any further oppor-tunities that might arise to secure increased supplies for india from Canadian or other sources.The Minister of Transport said that he would be unable toprovide tonnage for the shipment of more than an additional 50,000tons of grain from North America to India in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the arrangements made at the instance ofthe Official Committee on Food Supplies for South-east asia to secure increased supplies of rice for India during september.(2) Agreed that it would not be expedient to divert to Indiaany substantial shipments of Canadian wheat destined for the United Kingdom.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to take advantage of anyfurther  opportunities   that   might   arise   to   secureincreased supplies of grain for India.Argentina. 4.   In connexion with the discussion recorded in the preceedingFinancial        minute, reference was made to the course of the negotiations which negotiations,    a British Financial Mission was conducting with the argentine government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these negotiations were not making satisfactory progress. The Argentine Governmentwere using various means, such as withholding export licences for food supplies which we urgently required, to bring pressure to bearon the Mission to accept settlements contrary to our long-term interests, particularly in respect of their sterling balances. He was satisfied that we must continue to resist this pressure, and he thoughtit might be expedient to recall the Mission at an early date. Hewas, however, willing to make some concession to the argentine government, in regard to price, in respect of our long-term meat con-tract (and possibly in regard to certain other food-stuffs) providedthat this issue was dealt with quite separately from the general financial settlement.The Cabinet Took note with. approval of the statement made by the gChancellor of the Exchequer.
British 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the  HomeNationality Secretary (CP. (46) 331) submitting the recommendations of a law. Committee which they had appointed on the 1st August to report(Previous on certain questions of policy arising from the passage of theEeferenee:      Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946.CM. (46) 76th The Committee recommended that arrangements should now be conclusions,     completed for the holding of a conference of experts from the united minute 9.)      Kingdom and the Dominions to discuss the position arising from thepassage of this Canadian Act, and that the instructions to the UnitedKingdom representatives at this conference should be based on thefollowing principles :  (i) that the United Kingdom should participate in the newcitizenship system;(ii) that this should be done by the creation in United King-dom legislation of a combined citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies which would be the gatewaythrough which the common status of British subject should be conferred upon the inhabitants of both theUnited Kingdom and the Colonies;(iii) that India (if she remained within the Commonwealth),Burma, Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia shouldbe brought within the framework of the new system ascountries having the right to enact their own citizenshiplegislation;(iv) that India, Burma, Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesiashould be invited to send representatives to the expertsconference;(v) that in the United Kingdom citizenship legislation thestatus of British subject should not be automaticallyconferred upon Eire citizens against the wishes of the eire Government, but that in order to avoid the hard-ship which would otherwise result from this new situa-tion under which Eire citizens would no longer be Britishsubjects under United Kingdom law, the experts con-ference should work out detailed provisions for inser-tion in the new legislation on the following lines : (a) a saving clause to preserve the status as Britishsubjects under United Kingdom law of eire citizens born before the new legislation came intoforce;(b) a provision to enable Eire citizens in the service ofthe Crown or resident in the United Kingdom orthe Colonies when the new legislation came intoforce to acquire citizenship of the United King-dom and Colonies without undue formality;(c) a provision (on condition of reciprocity) which wouldgive Eire citizens born after the new legislationcame into force all the rights of British subjectswhile they were in the United Kingdom or theColonies.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Civil Lord of the Admiralty said that these proposed changes in British nationality law might affect service in the royal navy, as regards both the colour bar and the recruitment of eire citizens. He suggested that arrangements should be made to keepthe Service Departments informed of the progress of the discussions at the conference of experts, so that the United Kingdom Delegationmight be made aware of the effect which possible changes in british nationality law might have on conditions in the Fighting Services.This was agreed to.(b) Would it be wise formally to invite India, Burma,Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia to send representatives tothe conference of experts before it was known whether the Govern-ments of those countries would wish to participate in theconference? It would be embarrassing if formal invitations weredeclined.
The Home Secretary said that preliminary soundings wouldbe taken before formal invitations were issued to those Governments.(c) The Home Secretary said that the experts&apos; discussions wouldprobably be protracted, and it was unlikely that legislation based ontheir findings would be ready for introduction during the course ofthe forthcoming Session.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in CP. (46) 331 as- set out in (i)-(v) above.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to proceed with the arrangements for holding a Commonwealth conference of experts on british nationality law, and to settle the instructionsto the United Kingdom representatives on the basis ofthe principles set out in (i)-(v) above.(3) Agreed that the Service Departments should be associatedwith the United Kingdom Delegation to the conference,as suggested in paragraph (a) above.civil Service. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorAbolition of of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 334) on the question whether therethe Marriage should be an alteration of the existing rule whereby married womenBar. may not normally be employed in established Civil Service posts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this question had recently been considered by a Committee of the Civil ServiceNational Whitley Council, whose report was annexed to his memorandum. The Committee had been unable to reach any agreedrecommendation for or against the removal of the marriage bar orfor its modification if retained. There were strong arguments infavour of equality of opportunity for married women, and his firstinclination had been to recommend the complete removal of the bar.It had, however, been represented to him that its complete removalmight cause difficulty in some Departments where there was muchroutine work and a rapid turnover of staff through dismissal on marriage was advantageous from the point of view both of theDepartment and of the staff. He therefore proposed, for theCabinet&apos;s consideration, compromise proposals which had beensuggested to him by the Official Side of the Whitley CouncilCommittee.   These were as follows : &apos;(i) An employing Department should not at its own discretionreject an application from an established woman civil servant to be retained on marriage; the Treasury shouldbe consulted in all cases.- - (ii) For women in the administrative class, in one of the professional, scientific or technical classes, or in one ofthe higher grades of the executive and analogousDepartmental classes, retention after marriage should beallowed automatically (subject to Treasury approval) ifthe woman concerned had completed seven or more years&apos;satisfactory service,(iii) Retention should be granted more freely to women of anygrade who married in the later years of their service.Discussion showed that there was a general feeling amongMinisters in favour of the complete removal of the marriage bar.Arguments for its continuance which had carried weight in times of widespread unemployment no longer held good now that therewas a shortage of labour. When the Government were urgingindustry to retain married women in employment, it would seeminconsistent that they should announce new rules reaffirming the marriage bar for at least the subordinate grades of the Civil Service.The compromise proposed would be criticised as drawing aninvidious distinction between different classes of women CivilServants, and it would be hard to defend against this criticism. Itwas also undesirable that in this matter too much should be left to
17CM. 80 (46).discretion : a clear-cut principle was greatly to be preferred. If,however, the marriage bar were removed, it would be necessary thatfirmness should be shown in terminating the employment of marriedwomen whose domestic responsibilities were found to interfere withthe efficient discharge of their duties as Civil Servants.Other points made in discussion were : (a) The present proposals applied only to the Home CivilService. The marriage bar would be retained in the foreign service; and the Secretary of State for the Colonies would considerthe position in the Colonial Civil Service.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited to considerwhether the time had not come to repeal the Defence Regulationrelating to the control of employment in the Civil Service.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the rule under which married women may not normally be employed in established posts in the home civil Service should be abolished.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider meansof ensuring that Departments would be able to terminate the employment of married women whose domesticresponsibilities Were found to interfere with the efficientdischarge of their duties as Civil Servants.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thedecision on these matters to be conveyed to the staff side of the National Whitley Council, and thereafter fora statement to be made in Parliament.7. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the circum-stances in which certain blocks of flats in London had been occupiedon the previous day by some 1,500 squatters. The Cabinet were informed that the buildings occupied in Weymouth Street had beenderequisitioned and handed over to the owners in January last. TheDuchess of Bedford House was still in the possession of the Ministryof Works. It had been used as a hostel for Gibraltarians and wasabout to be derequisitioned. It had been unoccupied for twelvedays but employees of the Ministry of Works were busy duringweekdays removing some Government property still in the buildingwith a view to the return of the flats to private owners in the very near future. There was a caretaker on the premises. The cabinet were informed that the door had been forced and that the caretakerhad been compelled to admit the squatters. He had summoned thePolice but they had been unable to take any steps to remove them.Many of the squatters had come long distances and it was obviousthat the operation had been carefully planned beforehand.The Attorney-General explained the legal position. As the lawstood, the only means of redress open to the owner of premisesoccupied by squatters was to institute civil proceedings to establishhis title to the premises against all or a selected few of the squatters.In such cases as those under discussion the proceedings should betaken in the High Court, and if the matter had to go for trial itmight be several months before a decision was obtained. Applica-tion might, however, be made to a Judge in interlocutory proceedings for an order for immediate possession; and if this were granted and the squatters declined to comply with it they might be com-mitted for contempt of court. It might also be possible, if sufficient evidence could be obtained, to institute proceedings for criminalconspiracy against the leaders, but the difficulty about this course was that a jury might be unwilling to convict. Criminal proceed-ings could no doubt also be taken for offences committed in thecourse of the occupation, e.g., malicious damage, or theft of coal orwood found on the premises; but even when convictions for suchoffences had been obtained the owners would not thereby recoverpossession of their premises.
The Minister of Health and the Minister of Works said thatthey had refused to receive deputations of squatters who wished toask them, to provide various facilities (e.g., gas and cooking stoves)in the premises occupied.The Cabinet recognised that at some stage it might benecessary to use a certain amount of force to secure respect forproperty. This might lead to difficulties. They felt, however, thatthere would not be for those who had occupied residential propertythe same public sympathy as for those who had occupied huttedcamps.After further discussion the Cabinet reached the following conclusions :&apos;: (1) The Home Secretary and the Minister of Works should atonce prepare a full report on the facts, copies of whichshould be sent to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. In the light of the report, the Attorney-General, after consultation with the Treasury Solicitorand the Director of Public Prosecutions, should consider what proceedings could be taken with a view torestoring the premises to their rightful owners, andshould report to the Prime Minister.(2) No facilities for cooking, &amp;c, should be given to thesquatters in occupation of the flats.(3) The Home Secretary should institute enquiries to discoverwhether the occupation of any further premises wasbeing planned by the group which had organised this operation. If so, the Police should be warned in advanceso that they might prevent such, seizure of premises and bring criminal proceedings in respect of anycriminal offences which might be committed in anyattempt to occupy premises.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Qth September, 1946.
