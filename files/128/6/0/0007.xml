Parliament. 1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thethe House       following week.of Commons. The Report stage of the National Health Service Bill wouldbe taken on the 22nd and 23rd July; and the Third Reading on the26th July.On the 24th and 25th July there would be debates in Com-mittee of Supply. One of these days would be devoted to a debate on the Coal Situation; and the other to debates on Malaya andSouth Tyrol.On the 25th July the Report Stage and Third Reading of the diplomatic Privileges (Extension) Bill would be taken. further progress would be made during the week with other Bills and orders.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Government had promised to give facilities for a debate on Palestine before the summer Recess. Satisfactory progress was being made in the consultations between British and United States officials, and itwas possible that the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments might be able to reach agreement before the Recess on apolicy for Palestine. The next step, however, would then be tohold consultations with representatives of the Jews and Arabs; andit would be most inexpedient to disclose, before those consultationsbegan, the proposals which would be put to the two sides. Hewondered whether, in these circumstances, it would be possible toget agreement among the Parties that the promised debate shouldbe postponed until after the Recess.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be difficult torefuse facilities for a debate if the Opposition or Government sup-porters pressed for it. The Cabinet were informed that ViscountSamuel was also pressing for a debate to be held in the Houseof Lords. Another material factor was that a White Paper was shortly to be presented dealing with the recent action taken againstthe Jews in Palestine; and it would be specially difficult to refusefacilities to debate the situation described in that White Paper. Apossible compromise might be to hold a one-day debate on the under-standing that discussion would be confined to the immediate situa-tion in Palestine and would not extend to theconstitutional problem.It was agreed that the Chief Whip should arrange for informalconsultations to be held with the Leaders of the Opposition and representatives of the other Parties with a view to securing agree-ment that Parliamentary debate on the long-term problem ofPalestine should be postponed until after the Summer Recess.long-termBreadRationing.(previous reference erence:CM. (46)68thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Minister of Food said that in view of the public con-troversy over bread rationing it was his duty to report to the cabinet a substantial improvement in the prospects for the Canadian wheatharvest. He had that morning received from the Canadian Ministerof Agriculture confirmation that the harvest was now expected to yield about 450 million bushels, which was about 100 million bushelshigher than any previous estimate. On these figures there was nodoubt that Canada would be able to send us considerably more thanthe 160 million bushels which we had been expecting from this source. The Minister of Food said that he had felt bound to bring this specially to the notice of the Cabinet, since it could be argued that the prospective supply situation was now such that it wouldbe safe to postpone the introduction of bread rationing for anothermonth.In discussion, it was pointed out that the bread, rationing scheme had been designed primarily as a measure of insurance&quot;32285-6]b a
against a failure of supplies in the months immediately preceding the new harvest. When the decision had been taken to introduce the rationing scheme, it had seemed that, if consumption remaineduncontrolled, the risk of a temporary breakdown in flour distribu-tion in August and September would be greater than could legiti-mately be taken. Since then, however, shipments from the UnitedStates had been coming forward well and there now seemed everyprospect that the United States would fulfil the undertakings whichthey had given to us. It could be argued that, in view of this andof the improved prospects for the Canadian harvest, it would be justifiable to postpone the introduction of a rationing scheme whichwas likely to be very unpopular both with the bakers and withhousewives.On the other hand, it was contended that the yield of theCanadian harvest had not been a factor in the decision to introducebread rationing, and that the increased supplies now promised from canada would not affect our supply position over the next two orthree months, when our stocks would reach their lowest level. Itwas still too soon to be certain how the weather would affect the yield from the United Kingdom harvest during this period. nor could the possibility be ruled out of labour troubles delaying ship-ments both from the United States and from Canada. We werebringing great pressure to bear on the United States Governmentto provide enough to meet the minimum needs of the British zone in Germany during August, on the basis that we could supply no more for the Zone ourselves : but, if we delayed the introductionof rationing in the United Kingdom, we should be conveying theimpression that our own needs were no longer so Urgent as had been represented. If any relaxation were possible, the first step shouldbe to lower the extraction rate, and thus increase the quantity of animal feeding-stuffs so as to assist in providing a more varieddiet.The view of the Cabinet was that in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons the Minister of Food should reaffirm theGovernments decision to introduce bread rationing on the 21st July.He could, however, indicate in the debate that there had been some improvement in the prospective supply situation in the autumn,and that, if these prospects were fulfilled, it might not be necessaryto maintain rationing for more than a short period.The Cabinet-Confirmed their previous decision that bread rationingshould be introduced on the 21st July.India. 3.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Viceroy(Previous       was about to reopen negotiations with the Leaders of Congress and reference:      the Moslem League regarding the formation of an Interim CoalitionCM. (46) 65th   Government in India.   He proposed to negotiate on the basis of a conclusions,     Government of fourteen members, six of whom (including oneMinute 1.)      scheduled oaste representative) would be nominated by Congress, fiveby the Moslem League, and three, to represent minorities, by theViceroy.    It was proposed to send a telegram to the Viceroyapproving the general line which he intended to take and making it clear that, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, Mr. Jinnah&apos;claim that only the Moslem League could nominate Moslems couldnot be allowed to prevent the formation of an Interim Government.The Cabinet-Approved the course proposed by the Prime Minister.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 275) regarding a request from the Canadian Government that legislation shouldbe enacted in the United Kingdom to amend the British north america Acts, 1867-1943, so as to provide for a readjustment of canadian representation in the Canadian House of Commons. TheCanadian Government were anxious that this legislation should be passed before Parliament adjourned for the Summer Recess.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thisproposal, which had been approved by both Houses of the canadian parliament by substantial majorities, would have the effect ofincreasing the numbers in the Canadian House of Commons by ten,of whom eight would come from the Province of Quebec. It was greatly to be regretted that this request had been made at suchshort notice, more particularly since it appeared that the haste was due to a desire on the part of the Canadian Government to forestallopposition from certain quarters in Canada. Nevertheless, he feltthat it would be right to meet the wishes of the Canadian Govern-ment, despite the inconvenience, if it was at all possible to do so.He therefore asked the Cabinet to agree that the necessary legisla-tion should be introduced and passed before Parliament rose.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that similar legislation in 1943 had not proved entirely uncontroversial, and that there might be criticism in Parliament of the changes proposed by theCanadian House of Commons. On the other hand, it was argued that it was not the function of the Parliament at Westminster toenter into the merits of the proposal : it was their duty to giveeffect to the wishes expressed by the Canadian Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Bill in the terms proposed should be intro-duced forthwith in the House of Lords.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Canadian Government that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would endeavour topass the Bill through both Houses before the Summer&apos;Recess, though, if difficulties arose, it might be necessaryto hold it over until the autumn.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 262) about an application for a quota of paper for book publishing received by the Board of Trade from a firmof publishers which had before the war published books on behalfof the British Union of Fascists. This application has beenconsidered by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (46)24th Meeting, Minute 5), who had come to the conclusion that theonly course open to the Board of Trade was to grant the application,though it was reasonably clear that Abbey Supplies, Limited, whowere acting with Sir Oswald Mosley, would use the paper for thepublication of Fascist books.In discussion several Ministers urged that the application should be refused. The present shortage of paper, which compelledthe Government to limit the supplies made available for such purposes as the production of textbooks or the expansion of the circulation of journals for which there was a wide and increasing demand, was a direct consequence of a war brought about byFascism, and it seemed unreasonable that a firm of publishers whoobviously intended to use any paper which they received for thepropagation of Fascist doctrines should be granted a quota merely because they happened to have used paper in the twelve months before the institution of control. Moreover, was it not illogical thatwe should spend on the purchase of paper to be used to spread
Fascist doctrines any part of our financial resources, which hadbeen so greatly depleted during the war ? Finally, the granting of a quota of paper to a Fascist publisher would inevitably increasethe suspicions of the foreign Governments, who were alreadyinclined to criticise us for failing to take adequate steps to rootout Fascism; and if, when the books had been produced, we foundourselves powerless to prevent their export to the Continent weshould be even more vulnerable to this criticism.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, however deplorablethe publication of Fascist books in the United Kingdom might be,it would be indefensible to impose a political censorship by theuse of economic controls which had been granted by parliament for entirely different purposes. If it was wrong that Fascist booksshould be published, the proper course was to take specific powerto prohibit them. It was also suggested that any action Whichmight be taken against Abbey Supplies, Limited, was likely to resultin advertising their publications, which on their merits were not likely to have a wide appeal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Board of Trade should allow AbbeySupplies, Limited, to have the quota of paper to whichthey were entitled under the existing rationing scheme.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theHome Secretary, to consider whether there was a case for prohibiting the publication of Fascist books and, if so, what steps would have to be taken to empower theGovernment to impose such a prohibition.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (46) 270) seeking authority tojaroceed with the preparation of legislation to nationalise theelectricity supply industry.The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that on the19th November, 1945, the Lord President had stated in the Houseof Commons that it was intended to introduce legislation to nationalise the electricity supply industry during the present parliament. The form of the scheme of nationalisation had beenconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on the Socialisation ofIndustries and, with the agreement of that Committee, he had had discussions with all sections of the industry. As a result he had now drawn up the scheme outlined in CP. (46) 270, the mainfeature of which was the establishment of a National electricity board, to which all the assets of the industry would be transferredand which would be responsible for the planning and developmentof electricity supply, including research, subject to general direc-tions given by himself. Generation and main transmission wouldbe directly managed by the Board, which would become the soleproducer and bulk distributor of electricity. The Board would alsobe responsible for distribution policy but would delegate detailedadministration to regional distribution boards, to whom the distri-bution assets would be allocated. Distribution had always been much less centralised than generation and, though he agreed thatthe National Electricity Board should be ultimately responsible for distribution policy, he attached considerable importance to givingthe regional boards a reasonably free hand in order that local peoplemight have some responsibility for management and development.If this were done, it would be easier to meet the opposition to thescheme which was likely to come from local authorities, who were^inclined to argue that the nationalisation of electricity distribution fcould be achieved by transferring to them all the existing privateundertakings. The National Electricity Board would consist of afull-time chairman, two full-time vice-chairmen, three part-timeOrgaiusa-tion ofElectricitySupply.(previous reference:CM. (45) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)
members, and a number of chairmen of regional distribution boards&quot;selected by him in rotation. The Fuel and Power Committee ofthe Trades Union Congress had, however, made strong representa-tions in favour of a board consisting entirely of full-time members,and there might be a case for appointing one of the three additional members on a full-time basis. Each of the regional distributionboards would have a full-time chairman and vice-chairman, withpart-time members selected from different areas of the region afterconsultation with the local authorities and possibly with organisa-tions representing local industries, trade unions and professionalassociations. As regards the number of regional boards, the LloydGeorge Committee under the Coalition Government had advocated14, but the Electricity Commissioners were inclined to think thatwith smaller regions administration would be easier and it had beensuggested that as many as 30 boards might be appointed. He was disposed to think that the right number lay somewhere between14 and 20, but had not yet formed a final view on this matter. Hewould resist any pressure for a separate Scottish national authority and it must be clear that the assets of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board would be transferred to the National electricity board, though he was prepared to discuss with the Secretary ofState for Scotland what special arrangements should be made forthe North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. The provisions relating to compensation, which would form an important part ofthe Bill, had not yet been fully worked out, but as soon as he haddetailed proposals to put forward he would subm.it them to theCommittee on the Socialisation of Industries and, if necessary, tothe Cabinet.The Lord President said that he would have preferred to seethe regional distribution organisation cliiectly controlled by theNational Electricity Board and to find an outlet for local authorityinterest through the creation of advisory councils which might havebeen given quasi-executive duties. He recognised, however, thatthe Minister had gone a long way to meet his point of view andhe was prepared to accept the proposal for semi-autonomousregional distribution boards. Though he would not oppose anincrease in the number of regional boards from the fourteen pro-posed by the Lloyd George Committee to, say, seventeen, he feltthat the Committee&apos;s proposals, which had been reached afterexhaustive consideration, should not be lightly overturned and hewould certainly not favour raising the number of regions to any-thing like thirty. He hoped that the Minister would resist any suggestion that all the members of the National Electricity board should be appointed on a full-time basis, for he was convinced thatthe Board would derive great advantages from having part-time members with contacts outside the electricity industry. Withregard to compensation, there might be a good deal of opposition from local authorities whose electricity undertakings were free from, debt and who had been applying the revenue of their under-takings towards the reduction of rates. This opposition could probably be mitigated by providing for tapering annual contribu-tions for five or ten years so as to avoid, a sudden rise in rates. TheBill must be introduced not later than February if it was to be passed during the 1946-47 Session, and it was, therefore, urgently necessary to settle the outstanding points of policy in order that instructions might be given to Parliamentary Counsel, who wouldhave a heavy task in getting the Bill ready, particularly in viewof the prior call on his time for the preparation of the legislation for the nationalisation of transport.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he acceptedthe view that there should not be a separate national authority forScotland, he must reserve the position of the North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board, who were responsible for the generation ofelectricity as well as its distribution, until, be had discussed withthe Minister what special arrangements could be made for theBoard.
The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the scheme for the nationalisation ofthe electricity supply industry outlined in CP. (46) 270and authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power toarrange for the drafting of a Bill to give effect to thescheme.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to submit any outstanding questions of policy connected with thescheme to the Ministerial Committee on the socialisation of Industries as soon as possible.Burma. 7.   The Prime Minister said that it was urgently necessaryRelease of to reach a decision about the disposal of Ba Maw, who had beenBa Maw. appointed Head of State when Burma was given independence bythe Japanese and had retained this position until the defeat of japan. Earlier in the year it had been agreed by the India and burma Committee (LB. (46) 2nd Meeting, Minute 1) that the UnitedStates Army authorities in Japan, who held Ba Maw in custody,should be asked to retain him during the period while the cabinet mission was in India. The United States Army authorities nowwished to be relieved of responsibility for him, and the Secretaryof State for Burma had reached the conclusion that he should beset free and allowed to return to Burma. His record was no worse than that of Aung San or U Saw, who had already been released,and there was a good deal of pressure in political quarters in burma for his release. No attempt would be made to impose con-ditions on him or to get any assurances of loyal behaviour, but itwould be brought home to him that the offences he had committed hadmerited the extreme penalty and that the decision of His Majesty &apos;sGovernment to exercise clemency was influenced by the fact thathe might to some extent have acted under duress and by their desire that Burman leaders should now co-operate for the orderlyprogress of their country to full self-government in the shortest possible time.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for Burmathat Ba Maw should be released and allowed to return to burma.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th July, 1946.
