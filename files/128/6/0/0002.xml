parliament. 1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thethe House      following week.of Commons. The Report Stage of the Civil Aviation Bill would be taken onthe 8th July. The Lord Privy Seal and the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Civil Aviation would speak on behalf of theGovernment; and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Supply (Mr. A. Woodburn) should be in attendance during the debate.On the 9th July there would be a debate in Committee of supply on Colonial Affairs.On the 10th July the House would consider Lords&apos; amendments to the Coal Industry Nationalisation Bill and the Borrowing (Con-trol and Guarantees) Bill. The Report Stage and Third reading of the Cable and Wireless Bill would also be taken, if time allowed.On the 11th July the Report Stage and Third Reading of theCivil Aviation Bill would be completed; and consideration of the cable and Wireless Bill would also be concluded if it had not beencompleted on the previous day.On the 12th July further progress would be made with the diplomatic Privileges (Extension) Bill.The Lord President said that it might be necessary to find time,before the Summer Recess, for debates on the B.B.C., India and palestine. It was agreed that debates on the B.B.C. and on palestine should be held before the Summer Recess. The further negotiations in India would, however, be facilitated if Parliamen-tary discussion of that subject could be postponed, preferably until after the Summer Recess. If the Opposition leaders would not agree to so long a postponement, arrangements should be made forthe debates desired in both Houses to be held as late as possible inJuly.Business m The Cabinet were informed that the main outstanding difficul-the House ties in the House of Lords on the Coal Industry Nationalisation bill of Lords. related to the composition of the consumers&apos; council, the presentation of the accounts of the Coal Board and the problem of compensation.If it were possible to find some compromise on the first two points which would satisfy the Opposition, it was likely that the third point would not be pressed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatcare must be taken in modifying the Bill&apos;s provisions about the presentation of accounts, since these would set a precedent for laterlegislation for the nationalisation of other industries. The cabinet were informed that discussions on this point were now proceeding between the. Treasury, the Ministry of Fuel and Power and theMinisters in charge of the Bill in the House of Lords. The PrimeMinister asked that, unless an agreed solution had been reachedmeanwhile, the point should be brought up for further consideration at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on the 8th July.Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (46) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Report of anglo-american committee.2. The Prime Minister said that the British and UnitedStates officials had completed on the 27th June their preliminaryconsultations on Recommendation 2 of the Report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine; but, despite his representations to President Truman, the main party of United States officials whowere to discuss the implications of the Report as a whole were still not proposing to arrive in this country until the 15th July. He had now sent a further message to President Truman urging that thedate for the commencement of these further consultations should be advanced.Meanwhile, the Cabinet should consider at an early date what could be said on behalf of the Government in the debate on palestine which must be held in the House of Commons before the summer Recess. If, as a result of this delay in the official consulta-tions, no agreement had then been reached between the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and United States, it might become necessary[32285-1] b 2
PresentSituation inPalestine.for His Majesty&apos;s Government to indicate that they were preparedto adopt a given line of policy in Palestine if they were assured ofthe support and co-operation of the United States Government. TheCabinet should consider the position during the following week, onthe basis of memoranda by the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Foreign Secretary. These should summarise the recommen-dations of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine and thedifficulties which the responsible Departments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment saw in giving effect to those recommendations, andshould outline alternative policies which might be adopted.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrangefor memoranda on the lines indicated above to be circu-lated in time for consideration by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 11th July.The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the Cabinet thelatest information about the situation in Palestine.The military authorities were now prepared to terminate their occupation of the premises of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem :they had made a careful inventory of the documents which had been removed and the damage which had been done in their occupation and search of the building, and they were prepared to compensatethe Agency for the repair of that damage. The authorities were about to begin the process of releasing those of the persons detainedagainst whom it was not intended to take proceedings. No morelarge-scale arrests were contemplated, though the search for armsand individuals continued.The Secretary of State said that it had been suggested to him that facilities might be given for a delegation of Members of Parlia-ment to go to Palestine. The South African Government had askedfor similar facilities for Jewish representatives from the Union;and the suggestion had also been made that representative Jewsfrom the United States might visit Palestine. It was the view ofthe Cabinet that no such facilities should be given for the timebeing.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies regarding the present situation in Palestine.Political 3.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordBroadcasting.   President on the subject of political broadcasting : (Previous C.P. (46) 253 : on a proposal by Mr. Churchill that politicalEeferenoe: broadcasting should be resumed; and cm.(46) 17th CP.

Copies were circulated.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should offer to enter into discussions with representatives of the Opposition andof the B.B.C. on the resumption of political broad-casting ;
Nationalisa-tion ofTransport.(previous reference:CM. (46) 35thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 225) reporting the results of the further con-sideration given by the Ministerial Committee on the socialisation of Industries to the treatment under a nationalised transport systemof traffic operated under &quot;C &quot; licences.The Cabinet considered first the general case for the restric-tion of &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles, subject to appropriate exceptions, toa radius of 40 miles.The Lord President said that, as shown by the statistics inparagraph 2 of CP. (46) 225, the great bulk of road haulagevehicles were operated under &quot; C &quot; licences and it was clearthat if no such restriction were imposed the revenue derivedby the British Transport Commission from the operation of road haulage would be seriously reduced and the successful running ofa co-ordinated national transport system would be endangered. TheCommittee therefore supported the view of the Minister of Trans-port that it was right in principle to impose a 40-mile limit, subjectto appropriate exemptions. The imposition of this restrictionwould not in his view adversely affect the small operators; and,so far as concerned political considerations, the Government stoodto gain more by imposing a restriction which was strongly supportedby the trade unions in the industry than by making concessions tothe road hauliers, whose opposition was likely to weaken when thescheme actually proposed by the Government was announced.The Cabinet agreed that, subject to suitable exemptions, theoperation of &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles should be restricted to a radius of 40 miles. It was also agreed that the needs of farmers wouldbe adequately met by the Ministers proposals, since goods vehiclesregistered in the name of persons engaged in agriculture and usedsolely for the carriage of their own goods would continue to be exempt from licensing.The Cabinet then considered the proposal in paragraph 4 of cp. (46) 225 that the Bill for the nationalisation of transport should contain a Clause giving the Minister of Transport power to direct the licensing authority to waive the 40-mile limit in par-ticular cases where this was desirable with a view to stimulating-industry in development areas.The Minister of Transport said that he recognised the need to give special consideration to firms operating in the developmentbut on grounds of sound administration he would prefer that the Bill should not include such a provision. The licensing authorities were not likely to refuse permission to a firm to operatebeyond the 40-mile range if a good case for exemption were made out; he would have power to give them general directions as to theexercise of their functions; and an applicant whose claim was rejected would have a right of appeal. If, however, the cabinet were satisfied that this exceptional treatment for the development areas should be guaranteed on the face of the Bill, he wouldacquiesce in this procedure.In discussion it was urged that, if the Minister of Transporttook specific powers in the Bill to direct licensing authorities toextend the 40-mile limit in the case of firms operating in develop-ment areas, he would find it difficult to defend the decision that a limit of this kind should normally be imposed in &quot; C &quot; licences issued to firms operating elsewhere, since it. would be contended that a firm with two sets of premises at a distance of over 40 miles,neither being situated in a development area, had just as good a(2) Agreed that Mr. ChurclhiH&apos;s claim to reply to the lord presidents broadcast of the 30th June should be resisted;(3) Subject to a minor amendment approved in discussion,agreed that letters in terms of the drafts prepared bythe Prime Minister should be sent to Mr. churchill and to the Director-General of the B.B.C.
claim to carry its goods in its own vehicles as a similar firm withpremises in a development area. It would further be contended that, if the licensing authorities could be trusted to extend thelimit in all suitable cases where the firm was operating outsidethe development areas, they could equally be trusted to deal fairlywith applicants operating in development areas. It was also suggested that the very fact that the Minister took special powerto direct the licensing authorities to grant extensions to firmsoperating in the development areas might throw doubt on their power to grant extensions in other cases.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the development areas constituted one of the most urgent and important problemsnow confronting the Government and that the Board of Trade were convinced that they would be much better able to persuade indus-industrialists to establish factories in these areas if a definite guaranteecould be given that they would be freed from this 40-mile restric-tion. There was no intention of denying extensions to firmsoperating outside the development areas, where such extensionscould be justified on the considerations set out in paragraph 3 (i)and (ii) of CP. (46) 225; and, while it was not entirely consistentto leave it to the licensing authority to deal with one type of case while providing for the intervention of the Minister in theother, the inconsistency could be justified as an exceptional measure,which could be paralleled in other spheres of administration,designed to ensure that everything possible was done to stimulate the revival of industry in the development areas.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the operation of &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles should normally be restricted to a radius of 40 miles, providedthat the licensing authority might authorise an exten-tion of the radius where, having regard to the con-siderations set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 225, theywere satisfied that such an extension was justified.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should take power in the Bill to direct licensing authorities to authorisean extension of the radius of operation in any case where, after consultation with the President of theBoard of Trade, he was satisfied that this was desirablewith a view to stimulating industry in a development area.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (46) 249) on his discussions in Canada and the UnitedStates regarding a long-term wheat contract with Canada.The Minister of Food said that, as the Cabinet were aware,the conclusion of this contract had been delayed on account of representations from the United States State Department that itwas contrary to the spirit of the proposals on Commercial Policy(Cmd. 6709) and that the announcement of such a contract at thepresent time might prejudice the passage of the Loan throughCongress. Telegrams had since been received from Washington(Nos. 4295 and 4296 of the 1st and 2nd July) containing the text of an aide-memoire on this subject from the United States Govern -ment. This set out their objections to the proposed agreement asin effect giving Canada a preferred position in the United Kingdomwheat market. While not objecting to State trading as such orto bulk purchase agreements for relatively short periods, the UnitedStates Government considered that long-term agreements for largequantities of goods tended to canalise world trade on a bilateralbasis and they suggested that the agreement would be contrary tothose sections of the proposals on commercial policy which providedthat commercial considerations should govern purchases made byState-trading agencies.The Minister reminded the Cabinet that the pressure for this contract had come from the Canadian Minister of Agriculture.World food supplies.Long-TermWheatContractwith Canada.(previous reference:CM. (46) 61stConclusions,Minute 8.)
When he arrived in Canada, however, he found that opinion was divided on the subject in the Canadian Government, some of whose members took much the same view as the United States state department; and the delay in concluding the agreement would giveits opponents in Canada a fresh chance to state their case. Never-theless, if the difficulty with the United States could be surmounted,the Minister thought that the agreement would be accepted by theCanadian Government.There was general agreement that the proposed contract wouldbe beneficial to us, and the Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned on the line to be taken in replying to the aide-memoire from the United StatesGovernment.It was suggested that a firm reply should be sent to this, as itchallenged a practice which was the basis of our food procurementpolicy. The United Kingdom Government had long-term contracts for many commodities with Dominions and other countries. If we accepted the arguments in the aide-memoire we should cripple, our efforts to even out alternations of boom and slump in primary com-modities and to stop price fluctuation. Our freedom to continuethese long-term contracts had been asserted many times in the Loandiscussions and we had received specific assurances on the subjectfrom the United States authorities. We could not afford to give way on the point.The Cabinet were agreed that the contentions in the aide-memoire could not be accepted. At the same time, the reply shouldbe. as friendly as possible. It would be preferable not to enter intoargument on principles but to emphasise the advantages of thisparticular agreement in the special circumstances of the time. Thus,it was important to the world at large that increased productionof wheat should be assured during the next few years; and theCanadian farmer, if he had an assurance of minimum prices, wouldbe encouraged to maintain or even extend his acreage of wheat.Moreover, some assurance of future demand was a reasonable com-pensation for accepting less than the market price for his wheatat the moment.The Cabinet discussed whether the reply should be sent beforethe debate on the Loan in Congress. They agreed that the balanceof advantage lay in deferring the reply until afterwards. It might,however, be advisable for a member of the British Embassy to convey to the State Department informally advice as to the lines on which our negotiations for this contract might best be defendedif criticism were directed against them in the Congress proceedings on the Loan.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the present position regarding the negotiation of a long-term contract for wheat with Canada as set outin CP. (46) 249.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for informal advice to be given to the State Department as indicated above.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade, the Ministerof Food and the Minister of State, to arrange for a con-sidered reply to be prepared to the aide-memoire fromthe United States Government on the lines indicated inthe discussion.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (46) 250) proposing that private individuals should nowbe allowed to send gift parcels of food overseas.The Minister of Food suggested that the time had now come when the existing prohibition could be lifted, subject to suitablesafeguards against abuse. He recommended that parcels might besent through the parcel post or, in the case of Germany and Austria,through the &apos;&apos; Save Europe Now &apos;&apos; Organisation, the contents to be confined to rationed foods and to be limited in quantity.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster supported theseproposals. He explained that for security reasons parcels destined,for Austria would have to be packed and despatched, not by thesenders themselves, but by the &quot; Save Europe Now &quot; organisation on their behalf; and it might be advisable to apply the same rule toparcels destined for Germany.In discussion there was general sympathy with the proposal andit was appreciated that if the scheme were introduced at once itwould enable parcels to be sent in the period of acute shortage beforethe next harvest. Ministers felt, however, that from the point ofview of opinion in this country there would be great disadvantages in introducing the scheme at the present time, when public attention was focused on the shortage of food in this country and substantialopposition was being shown to the introduction of bread rationing.In these circumstances they considered that it would be better to defer a decision on this question for, say, two months until bread rationing was working satisfactorily in this country and future prospects were clearer.The Cabinet-Agreed that the scheme outlined in CP. (46) 250 shouldnot be introduced at the present time, but could be further considered in the autumn.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Uh July, 1946.
