textiles tottbe Services.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 15thConclusions,Minute 10.)1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (46) 348) and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War (CP. (46) 351) on the provision ofadditional supplies of clothing and textiles for the Services.The Cabinet were informed that the issues raised in thesememoranda were to be further discussed at an early meeting between representatives of the three Services. In these circum-stances,The Cabinet-Agreed to defer consideration of these memoranda.Service 2.   The   Cabinet   considered   memoranda  by   the   ForeignPensions and Secretary (CP. (46) 349) and the Parliamentary Under-SecretaryAllowances. Gf State&quot; for War (CP. (46) 352) regarding the rates of ServiceBates for pensions and allowances payable to persons of Colonial originPersons of enlisted in Egypt.   These were at present two-thirds of the ratesColonial Origin payable in respect of men from the United Kingdom; and theEnlisted in Foreign Secretary proposed that they should be increased to theEgypt. full United Kingdom rates.   The lower rates were a cause of grievance in Egypt; and the cost of the change would not be large.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War argued that this concession, though it seemed small, mi ght have serious consequences. It might lead to requests for similar increases,covering pay as well as pensions and allowances, from men enlistedin Malta, Palestine and Cyprus and even from men enlisted inother Colonial areas. The principle followed hitherto had beenthat the pay and allowances of men in local forces should be related to the standard of living to which they had been accustomed. Thesemen of Colonial origin had not been accustomed to living, in Egypt,on the same standards as men from the United Kingdom.The Lord President said that the Treasury shared the WarOffice views on this matter.On the other hand, several Ministers argued that no undesirableprecedent would be established by granting this concession. A clear distinction could be drawn between these men and men recruited from Colonial territories for the Colonial forces; for the formerwere not volunteers, as were men recruited in Colonial territories,but had been conscripted under the National Service (ForeignCountries) Act, 1942. They were more comparable to Maltese, &amp;c,recruited in the United Kingdom, Who would as a matter of coursereceive pay and allowances at full United Kingdom rates.The Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty and the Parliamen-tary Under-Secretary of State for Air said that they feared nounfortunate repercussions on their Services if the proposed conces-sion were made. Maltese employed in the Royal Navy for general service received full United Kingdom rates. The same was true of men of Colonial origin enlisted in the Royal Air Force on general service conditions; and service in Egypt had counted as general service.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the governor of Malta also thought that there need be no repercussions from the concession.The Cabinet-Agreed that Service pensions and allowances in respectof persons of Colonial origin enlisted in Egypt should bepaid at the full United Kingdom rates.[32563-2]b 2
Food.AdditionalMeat Rationfor Miners.3. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a resolution passed on the previous day by the General Council of the TradesUnion Congress which, while not opposing an increase in the domestic meat ration for underground workers in the coal mining industry, recorded dissatisfaction with the procedure followed inthis matter by the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Ministerof Food.The Minister- of Fuel and Power said that earlier proposalsfor providing extra food for underground coalminers had not beenproceeded with, partly because they had been thought impracticableby the Ministry of Food and partly because the Trades UnionCongress had been opposed in principle to differential rations for different classes of industrial workers. He had, however, raisedthis matter again at a meeting on the 1st August of the ministerial committee which was reviewing the problems of coal productionand distribution during the coming winter; and the Minister ofFood had then indicated that, if his colleagues supported theproposal, he was now prepared to proceed with it on the following conditions : (i) the extra ration, of one shillingsworth of meat perweek, should be given solely to underground workers; (ii) the con-currence of the Trades Union Congress should be obtained inadvance; and (iii) any underground miner who took a main mealin a mine canteen should be compelled to surrender an equivalentunit of his extra ration. The Committee had accepted the proposal on these conditions and had invited him, in consultation with theMinister of Food, to take the necessary steps to give effect to their decision. Knowing, as he did, that the Trades Union congress were opposed to the principle of differential rations, he had thoughtit preferable to arrange for the proposal to be put to them, not by the Government, but by the National Union of Mineworkers;and it was to this procedure that the General Council of theCongress had taken exception.The Minister of Food, in confirming the statement made bythe Minister of Fuel and Power, said that he had taken the precau-tion of informing the Food Committee of the Trades Union congress of the procedure which it was proposed to follow, and in his viewno fault could properly be found with it. The Trades UnionCongress had, however, just cause for complaint against officials ofthe National Union of Mineworkers who, in public speeches made before this proposal was discussed by the Congress, had announcedthat they were bringing it forward with the approval of theGovernment.The Minister added that this concession was likely to provokedemands for additional food for other classes of heavy industrial workers.The Cabinet-Took note of the explanations given by the Minister of fuel and Power and the Minister of Food.Libya.(previous reference:CM. (46) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 354) on the policy to be followed in regardto the future of Libya.The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed likely that underthe Peace Treaty Italy would renounce her sovereignty over hercolonial possessions, and their future would remain to be settled after a year&apos;s delay by the Four Powers. An important factor inthis settlement would be the wishes of the looal inhabitants. Duringthe year the Council of Foreign Ministers were to receive recom-mendations from their Deputies, and commissions of investigationwere to visit the colonies to collect facts and ascertain the viewsof the inhabitants.
The Foreign Secretary feared that it would be difficult to finda solution for Libya which reconciled our military requirements, theinterests of Italy and France, Libyan nationalism and the regionalclaims of the Arab States. He thought that most progress was likelyto be made by dealing separately with Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.He had reason to believe that the United States Government would support this view.He now recommended that we should concentrate on securing aBritish trusteeship for Cyrenaica, so drafted as to give us thenecessary strategic facilities and leading to independence after tenyears, with an extension if necessary by agreement with the united nations.It was important that the commissions of investigation whichwere to visit the territories should be impressed by the desire ofthe people to remain under our administration. Hitherto, we hadadministered Cyrenaica with, perhaps, undue regard to the letterof The Hague Convention. To ensure the goodwill of theinhabitants we should now adopt a more progressive policy, eventhough this involved a somewhat greater expense. He, therefore,made the following proposals : (i) El Sayed Idris el Senussi, who was the acknowledgedleader of the people as well as of the Senussi religioussect, should be allowed to use the title of Emir andshould be awarded an honorary K.B.E.(ii) Steps should be taken to increase the opportunities for local Arabs to hold responsible posts in the Administra-tion.(iii) An Advisory Council for the whole country should be setup under the chairmanship of Sayed Idris.(iv) Increased efforts should be made to restore war damage and to remedy the economic disabilities of the country.He proposed that a Working Party should visit the country todraw up a comprehensive plan covering the proposals at (ii), (iii)and (iv) above. He hoped that senior administrative staff could bemade available from the Colonial Service, the Sudan and, perhaps,the Indian Civil Service to assist in these developments.The First Sea Lord said that the Chiefs of Staff thought it important that we should secure strategic facilities in Cyrenaica.They had no objection to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals for aBritish trusteeeship over the country, provided that the trusteeship agreement was so drafted as to give us those facilities.As regards the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals for a more pro-gressive policy in the administration of the country, The LardPresident reminded the Cabinet of the importance which theChancellor of the Exchequer  attached to the reduction of our over-seas expenditure. These proposals would involve considerably increased expenditure, and in the Treasury view we should not commit ourselves to more than a somewhat enlarged programme ofpublic works.As against this, it was argued that, as experience had shown,we could not hope to retain military bases in foreign countries ifwe remained disinterested in the economic and social conditions ofthe inhabitants. On the financial aspects of these matters it wasnecessary to take a long-term view.The Secretary of State for India and The Secretary of Statefor the Colonies undertook to give the Foreign Secretary all theassistance they could in providing experienced staff for the adminis-tration of Cyrenaica.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Agreed that we should attempt to secure a British trustee-ship for Cyrenaica, so drafted as to give us the necessarystrategic facilities and leading to independence afterten years, with an extension if necessary by agreementwith the United Nations.
(2) Agreed that, meanwhile, a more progressive policy shouldbe followed in the administration of Cyrenaica and&quot;&apos; approved in principle the proposals to this end made bythe Foreign Secretary in CP. (46) 354.(3) Agreed that Dominion Governments should be informed ofthese conclusions and given an opportunity for comment.Municipal 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeElections. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (46) 353)reporting that, owing to the ban on overtime in the printingindustry, there was a serious risk that in certain areas it might prove impossible to complete the printing required in time to enablethe borough elections to be held on the 1st November, 1946.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the home department explained that the position had been discussed withthe&apos; Secretary of the Association of Municipal Corporations, andit was proposed that, as soon as Parliament reassembled, legislation should be introduced to enable the elections to be held on the6th November, in boroughs where the Register could be published on the 15th October, or, where the Register could not be published by that date, 19 days after the date of its publication. Otherconsequential provisions which would be required were set out in:. paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 353.   It was also proposed that, as a precaution against the additional risk of a strike in the printingindustry, this legislation should include a provision enabling the amended dates to be varied by Order in Council.. ; Since the memorandum was circulated attention had been drawn to the provisions of the Third Schedule of the Local Govern-ment Act, 1933, which required that the annual meeting of a;-&apos; borough council should be held on the 9th November, and that three days&apos; notice should be given of the date of the meeting andthe business to be discussed. It would be necessary to provide, inthe proposed legislation, that on this occasion the annual meeting should be held, and the notices given, as soon as practicable afterthe holding of the election.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that less difficulty was expected in Scotland in completing the printing of the Registerby the prescribed date, and he did not propose any general postpone-ment of the date of the elections in Scotland. As a measure ofprecaution, however, particularly against the possibility of a strike in the printing industry, he proposed that power should be takenby Order to postpone the date of the election, either generally orin a particular area.In discussion it was asked whether it was necessary to postponeby a fixed period the elections in all boroughs throughout Englandand Wales. It might well turn out that in some areas no postpone-ment was required, while in others a delay of five days would notbe enough. Were there not advantages in the more flexible arrange-ment, proposed for Scotland, by which power would be taken to postpone the elections in particular areas, as required ? It waspointed out, in reply that there were political disadvantages indeviating from the general principle that elections should be heldon the same date in all parts of the country.In further discussion the view was expressed that the introduc-tion of any legislation for the postponement of these elections would create a difficult Parliamentary situation, in which the Governmentwould be exposed to damaging criticism. Much play could be made,both in this country and abroad, with the argument&apos; that the normalprocedures of democratic government were being stultified by an industrial dispute in the printing industry. It seemed desirablethat, before resorting to legislation, the Government should exhaustevery possibility of securing that the necessary printing work was completed in time to enable the elections to be held on the prescribed
39 CM. 83 (46).,        JQJdate. In the first instance, an attempt might be made to enlist the voluntary co-operation of the representative organisations in the printing industry, who might be willing to guarantee that the work would be completed in time. In default of such an assurance,consideration might be given to the possibility of making an order under the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Actrequiring printers to give priority, among their orders, to workneeded for the elections. It might also be possible to arrange forsome of the documents to be duplicated instead of printed. and printing capacity in London, where no elections were being held,might be used to relieve the pressure on other areas.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to consider, in consultationwith representatives of the Home Office, Scottish Office,Ministry of Labour and Stationery Office, whetherpractical measures could not be devised, on the lines indicated in the discussion, to ensure that the necessaryprinting work would be completed in time to permit the borough elections to be held on the prescribed date andthus obviate the need for introducing legislation post-postponing the date of those elections.ReciprocalAbolitionof Visas.(previous reference:CM. (46) 76thConclusions,Minute 11.)6. At their meeting on 1st August the Cabinet had deferred forthe time being a decision on proposals by the Foreign Secretary(i) that restrictions on the admission of foreign tourists to thiscountry should be relaxed, and (ii) that he should be authorised to embark on a series of negotiations for the reciprocal abolition ofvisas between this country and certain countries of Western Europe.The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theForeign Secretary (OP. (46) 350) asking that favourable decisions should now be taken on these two- proposals.On the first proposal, it was pointed out in discussion thatthe Cabinet had not asked that any positive restrictions should beplaced on the admission of foreign tourists to this country. Attheir meeting on 11th March (CM. (46) 23rd Conclusions,Minute 12) they had agreed that it would be undesirable to giveofficial encouragement to tourists to visit this country in 1946, butthey had not decided that tourists should be prevented from coming to this country and had in any event intended that positive steps should be taken to attract them here in 1947. If therefore instruc-tions had been given to Passport Control Officers abroad that foreigntourists should not be afforded facilities to visit this country, these instructions could now be withdrawn.As regards the abolition of visas, the Cabinet were informedthat the Home Secretary agreed in principle with the foreign secretary&apos;s proposal. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthere would be no advantage in relieving foreigners of the necessity to obtain a British visa if in consequence the immigration controlat the port of arrival in this country was to be made more strict.Delays at the port of arrival were more irksome than the delayinvolved in obtaining a visa before starting the journey. It wasthe general view of the Cabinet that the immigration authoritiesshould aim at a degree of control at the ports comparable to thatwhich was maintained before the war. On that understanding,the Cabinet saw advantage in a progressive abolition of visa require-ments, through the conclusion of reciprocal agreements with thosecountries of Western Europe with which we wished to promote a regular exchange of visitors.The Foreign Secretary said that he would seek to secure such agreements in the first instance with France and thereafter withBelgium and Holland and the Scandinavian countries.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th September, 1946.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that any instructions restricting the admission offoreign tourists to this country might now be withdrawn.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to open negotiations forthe reciprocal abolition of visas, in the first instancewith France and thereafter with Belgium, Holland andthe Scandinavian countries.
