1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Home Secretary (CP. (46) 265) recommending certain increases in agricultural prices. These recommendations resulted from aspecial review made by officials of the Agricultural departments with the National Farmers&apos; Unions of the United Kingdomfollowing on the decision that the agricultural minimum wageshould be increased by 10s. a week from the 14th July. the increases recommended, which were set out in the appendices to cp. (46) 265, covered not only partial compensation for higher wages costs but also special payments to producers of milk, pigs,poultry and eggs, to assist them in meeting the losses arising fromcuts in feeding-stuffs rations.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that the aimhad been to avoid acceptance of the principle of automatic recoup-ment of the higher wage costs, and to encourage the production ofthose crops which were most urgently required.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the specialcircumstances of the time, he had agreed to the proposals made in cp. (46) 265, though he would have preferred to see a wider marginbetween the amount of the price increases and the total sum requiredto recoup farmers completely for the higher wages costs.In discussion a number of Ministers expressed misgivingsabout the proposed price increases. These increases would enhancethe difficulty of keeping the cost of living at a reasonable level and,even though they did not give full compensation for the higher wages costs incurred by farmers, they did, in effect, commit theGovernment to a principle which would be disastrous if it were applied over the whole range of the economy. If the Governmentdealt with agriculture in this way, what answer could they give to demands for similar concessions from other industries, such assteel and coalmining&apos;? The adoption of this method would also make it more difficult for the Board of Trade to maintain theirpolicy of refusing to grant increases in the prices of commoditiessubject to price control to compensate for wage increases; and, ifthis policy were not maintained, a situation might arise in whichthe Government could not control the rising spiral of wages and costs. In these circumstances it was suggested that it would be preferable to compensate farmers by higher acreage payments ratherthan by price increases. Even if the whole field could not be coveredby such payments, it should at least be possible to deal in this way with wheat, potatoes and sugar beet, which represented the bulk ofthe products concerned.The suggestion was also made that the benefit of the proposedprice increases would not go to the type of farmer who most neededit: the medium farmer would receive less than his due, while thesmall farmer, who employed no labour, and the large farmer, who could afford to pay higher wages without any price increase, wouldbe overpaid.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he fully realised the dangers of a rising spiral of wages and prices. It was for this reason that he had urged at the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P. (46) 16th Meeting, Minute 5) that the Minister of Labour,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, should consider what immediate steps could be taken to prevent wage increases inother occupations from disturbing the relation between agricultural and other wages established by the recent increases in agricultural wages.Acreage payments were already being made for wheat,potatoes and sugar beet, and the possibility of providing compensa-tion by extending those payments had been carefully examined. Hewas satisfied, however, that in present circumstances an increasein the acreage payments would not produce the desired results.agricultural prices.(previous reference erence:CM, (46) 33rdConclusions,Minute 6.)
Thus, it would tend to tempt farmers to grow wheat on land whichwas best suited for barley and so reduce the total yield of cereals.The method of price increases was the method best designed tosecure the maximum production of wheat, potatoes and sugar beetfrom land suitable for these crops. As regards the incidence of the increases, it had been estimated that farmers who relied entirely onhired labour would be compensated only to the extent of 70 per cent.,while the small farmer who employed no hired labour normallyfarmed marginal land and might be regarded as entitled to a bonusas a high-cost producer.After further discussion there was general agreement that inall the circumstances it would be inexpedient on the present occasion to depart from the proposal to provide compensation by way of price increases.Other points in discussion were : &apos;(a) The Minister of Food said that he supported the proposals in view of the need to secure the maximum production of home-grown food in the immediate future. If the hope of a good canadian wheat harvest in 1946 was not disappointed, the price increaseproposed for home-grown wheat would be satisfactory; but he mustwarn the Cabinet that, should the Canadian harvest fail, it wouldbe necessary to reconsider the ratio between wheat and barley prices with a view to securing a higher production of home-grown wheat.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power suggested that the situa-tion which had arisen was due to the failure of the Government toevolve and implement a coherent wages policy. He did not believethat the constitution of a National Industrial Conference would be effective in preventing an inflationary rise in wages.(c) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theprice increases proposed could be justified as an exceptional measurerelated to the grave world shortage of food. In present circum-stances it was necessary to provide farmers with special incentives to grow the maximum quantity of the foods which were urgently needed, and also to give them some compensation for the serious losses which they would incur as a result of the cut in the feeding-stuffs rations. If the increases were put forward on these groundsthere would be less risk of the repercussions on other industries towhich reference had been made.(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that steps should be taken to prevent excessive profits from being made fromthe sale of agricultural land.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations for increases in agricul-tural prices as summarised in paragraph 26 of CP.

The LordChancellor suggested that he should try to meet this difficulty by undertaking to do his best to introduce and carry legislation on alternative Remedies before the appointed day for the entry intoforce of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill. he pointed out, however, that the Report on Alternative Remediesraised a number of difficult issues which would have to be consideredby the Cabinet.3. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed theCabinet that military and police activity in Palestine was now con-fined to the search for Jewish leaders still at large. The HighCommissioner was waiting until he could judge the attitude of theJewish community, as a result of the action already taken, before considering any further operations. The Jewish Agency&apos;s buildingshad been handed back to the Agency on the previous day : the damage to them had been assessed at  137. Some 2,600 persons hadbeen detained : by the 9th July 478 of these had been released, andfurther releases were taking place as the process of screening con-tinued. The members of the Jewish Agency Executive who hadbeen detained were still in custody. The High Commissioner con-sidered that there was ample evidence to justify their continued detention, but he would not resist their release if he obtained aguarantee of substantial reforms by the Agency. Meanwhile, it seemed that, for the moment at any rate, the influence of Dr. Weiz-mann and the moderates was increasing. Dr. Weizmann had told the Chief Secretary on the 7th July that he had held meetings withleading members of the Jewish community and had impressed on them the need for preventing any more terrorist activities. TheChief Secretary had made it clear that the basis of any negotiation with the Government must be a guarantee by the Jewish Agencythat the illegal activities of the Hagana and the Palmach would cease, the disbandment of the Palmach and the bringing of theHagana under Government supervision and control.Dr. Weizmann was leaving for England on the 16th July. Visashad also been given for Rabbi Wise and Mr. Lipsky to come to thiscountry from the United States. Mr. Ben Gurion, who represented the more extreme element, was still in Paris. There was clear evidence that he had been associated with illegal activities.The Minister of State said that it had been reported in UnitedStates newspapers that it was intended to hold a meeting of jewish agency representatives in Paris.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat everything possible should be done at this stage to strengthen the hands of Dr. Weizmann and his associates. For this purpose, itmight be advisable to hold discussions with him and other Jewishleaders when he arrived in this country, though it should be made clear that these discussions would be confined to the immediate situation resulting from recent operations in Palestine and wouldnot extend to the issues raised by the Report of the Anglo-American

For this purpose, itmight be advisable to hold discussions with him and other Jewishleaders when he arrived in this country, though it should be made clear that these discussions would be confined to the immediate situation resulting from recent operations in Palestine and wouldnot extend to the issues raised by the Report of the Anglo-American
Committee, on which there should be simultaneous discussion withJews and Arabs after the discussions with the United States repre-sentatives had been completed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that,according to the latest reports from Washington, the prospects of congress approving the United Kingdom loan were now morefavourable. It was agreed that it would be a mistake for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to issue any further public statement on palestine until the debate on the loan was completed.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Secretary of State for the Colonies would arrange for discussions to be held in London withmoderate Jewish leaders on matters connected with therestoration of public order in Palestine.Illegal The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinetimmigration.    that some 2,500 illegal immigrants were now detained in Palestine.They would be released as immigration certificates became available.This would exhaust the immigration quota until the middle ofSeptember. Meanwhile, however, there were indications thatarrangements were being made for a further ship holding 2,000immigrants to sail from Constanza. The question arose whetherthis or further ships should be diverted to Cyprus and the illegal immigrants detained there. In spite of the great disadvantages of holding large numbers of illegal immigrants in Palestine, the Secre-tary of State did not recommend their detention in Cyprus. Thiswould cause considerable difficulties there and there was always the risk that the unfortunate incidents which had occurred in the. case of the s.s. Patria some years ago would be repeated.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for strong repre-sentations to be made to the Roumanian Governmentwith a view to preventing the departure from Constanzaof this party of Jews desiring to emigrate to Palestine.(3) Agreed that ships carrying illegal immigrants to palestine should not be diverted to Cyprus.4.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : CP. (46) 258 : by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, sum-marising the difficulties which would arise in giving effectto the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committeeon Palestine.CP. (46) 267 : by the Chiefs of Staff, on the military impli-cations of the recommendations in the Anglo-AmericanReport.CP. (46) 263 : by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, sum-marising the statements made by President Truman onthe proposal for the admission of 100,000 Jewish immi-grants to Palestine.CP. (46) 259 : by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, out-lining a policy for Palestine which might be adopted asan alternative to some of the recommendations of theAnglo-American Committee.The alternative policy outlined in CP. (46) 259 was put forward with a view to remedying the deficiencies of Recommendation 3of the Anglo-American Committee, which proposed that the future constitution of Palestine should be such that one race would be unable to dominate the other, but contained no practical sugges-tions for achieving this result. Under this head the Committee&apos;sReport seemed to leave no alternative but the continuance of theexisting mandate; for it was likely to prove impossible to securePalestine.Report of anglo-american committee.(previous reference:CM. (46) 64thConclusions,Minute 2.)
a trusteeship agreement for a system of government which offeredno prospect of enabling the inhabitants to develop towards self-government and independence. The memorandum therefore putforward an alternative proposal for the creation of two semi-autonomous provinces, one Jewish and one Arab, under a centralTrustee Government. This scheme, while providing a type of con-stitution which should be immediately workable, would leave theway open for further advance either towards partition into twoindependent States, or towards partnership in a federal constitu-tion. The details of this alternative policy were set out in amemorandum annexed to CP. (46) 259.The Prime Minister said that, as the Foreign Secretary couldnot attend the Cabinet&apos;s meeting, he had asked Sir Norman Brookto go over to Paris to ascertain his views on the memoranda now before the Cabinet and on the way in which the forthcoming dis-cussions with United States officials should be conducted, tieinvited Sir Norman Brook to report to the Cabinet the results ofhis discussion with the Foreign Secretary.Sir Norman Brook said that the Foreign Secretary was anxiousto avoid being put in a position in which he would have to oppose the recommendation for the admission of 100,000 Jewish immigrantsinto Palestine. He proposed to inform the United States Secretaryof State, Mr. Byrnes, that he would not oppose this recommenda-tion, so long as there was proper consultation with representativesof the Jews and the Arabs. What he had in mind was that thereshould be a conference in London, preferably in the early part ofSeptember before the meeting of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations, at which representatives of the United Kingdomand United States Governments could discuss with representativesof both Jews and Arabs all the issues raised by the Report of theAnglo-American Committee. He proposed, however, to tellMr. Byrnes that the Arab opposition to this particular recommenda-tion about Jewish immigration would be substantially reduced ifan early announcement could be made that a substantial numberof Jewish refugees from Europe would be admitted to the UnitedStates, even though this meant enlarging the existing quota; andhe intended to press strongly for an early concession of this kindby the United States Government.The Foreign Secretary was favourably disposed towards thealternative policy outlined in CP. (46) 259, and he agreed thatthis should be explored in the forthcoming discussions with UnitedStates officials. He doubted, however, whether this scheme for provincial autonomy would provide a lasting solution of thePalestine problem. He therefore suggested that the Foreign Officeand Colonial Office should consider, with the Chiefs of Staff, whetherit would be practicable to adopt, as our long-term aim, a scheme under which the major part of the Arab province would be assimilated in the adjacent Arab States of Trans Jordan and the lebanon, and the Jewish province established as an independentJewish State, with perhaps a somewhat larger territory than that suggested for the Jewish province proposed in CP. (46) 259. he hoped that any intermediate solution on the lines proposed in cp. (46) 259 would contain nothing which was inconsistent withthis long-term aim.Special provision would have to be made for Jerusalem. he himself thought it would be advantageous to create a specialCouncil, representing all the interested religions, which wouldcontrol the Holy Places in Jerusalem; and he would like to see thisincorporated as an additional feature in the scheme outlined in cp. (46) 259, on the understanding that the administration of thecity would remain a responsibility of the mandatory Power. If hislong-term proposals were realised, he would hope that Jerusalemwould become an international area under the United Nations, thecontrol of the Holy Places remaining in the hands of such a specialreligious Council.
As regards Anglo-American collaboration in respect ofPalestine, the Foreign Secretary thought that the United StatesGovernment should certainly be pressed to promise us full politicalsupport in announcing a new policy for Palestine, in negotiatingthis with representatives of the Arabs and the Jews, and in defending it if necessary to the United Nations. He did not,however, contemplate continuing American participation in theadministration of Palestine. The United States Government shouldalso be asked for financial assistance, not only in the settlement of jewish immigrants, but also in whatever measures were agreed tobe necessary for raising the standard of living of the Arabs inPalestine. As regards military assistance, we should make it clearthat, if it became necessary to impose a solution by force, we wereneither willing nor able to do this alone and should have to askfor active American assistance. This should be used as an argumentto persuade the United States Government to join with us in seeking a solution which would not have to be imposed by force and inmaking every effort to get such a policy agreed with the Arabs andthe Jews before it was put into effect.In discussion there was general agreement that the recommen-dations in the Report of the Anglo-American Committee offeredno practical prospect of progress towards a solution of the constitu-tional problem in Palestine, and discussion turned on the alternative policy outlined in CP. (46) 259. The view was expressed that,if the Cabinet were disposed to agree that the ultimate solutionwas to be found in partition, it would be advantageous if the suggestions thrown out by the Foreign Secretary for a long-term plan were put forward at once in the forthcoming discussions asa solution of the immediate problem. If a separate Jewish Statewere created now, the Jews could be left to fix the limit for immigra-tion and to bear the whole cost of settling the immigrants. Ourown strategic needs in this area might be secured through Treatyarrangements with the Arab States which, under the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals, would be taking over the Arab parts ofPalestine. We could then look forward to early release from thepolitical and financial commitments involved by our obligations under the mandate.As against this, it was pointed out that proposals for immediatepartition of Palestine would encounter strong opposition. TheAnglo-American Committee had themselves felt unable torecommend partition as the solution. If independent sovereignStates were to be created, long and difficult negotiations would haveto be undertaken over frontiers, customs barriers, &amp;c, all of whichwere avoided by the intermediate scheme outlined in CP. (46) 259.So long as there was a central Government responsible for customs,communications and other reserved subjects, there would be much less difficulty in determining boundaries which were no more thanthe administrative boundaries of provinces and could be adjustedin the light of later experience. The intermediate scheme had thegreat advantage that it separated sovereignty from culturalautonomy. It would also afford a valuable period of actualexperience of separate administration, during which means ofsurmounting some of the practical problems of partition could be devised.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was opposed topartition and was anxious that the Cabinet should not dismiss thepossibility that, if the economic difficulties could be removed, someaccommodation might be found between the Jewish and Arabpopulations in Palestine. Improvement of the standard of living of the Arabs must be an essential part of any policy for Palestine.He would himself prefer the creation of a number of semi-autonomous regions rather than a single province for the Jews andanother for the Arabs. The most important point was, however,to secure time for a more fully considered approach to the long-term problem of Palestine.
The Chief of the Air Staff said that, whatever solution of theconstitutional problem was put forward, the Chiefs of Staff were anxious that the strategic considerations should not be overlooked.Our strategic needs in the Middle East, in respect of bothcommunications and oil supplies, depended on retaining the good-will and co-operation of the Arab peoples. The Chiefs of Staff had submitted, in OP. (46) 267, &quot;their views on the military implications of the policy recommended in the Report of the Anglo-american committee. They had not yet been able to assess the strategicimplications of the alternative policy outlined in OP. (46) 259; and,until they had had time to do so, they would not wish to be committed to support of that policy.The Cabinefs general conclusion was that it would be inexpedient to put forward at this stage proposals for the partition of Palestine into two sovereign States. the intermediate solution outlined in OP. (46) 259 was, how-ever, a constructive and imaginative plan which (subject to consideration of any objections which might be raised bythe Chiefs of Staff) should be commended to the favourable consideration of the Jews and the Arabs if United states support for it could be secured.The Cabinet then went on to consider the tactics to be adoptedby the British Delegation in the forthcoming discussions with united States officials.It was agreed that it would be inexpedient for the delegation to confine themselves to destructive criticism, on the lines indicatedin OP. (46) 258, of the policy recommended in the Report of theAnglo-American Committee. It would not be enough to adopt a purely negative attitude. At the same time, we had promised totake the Report of the Anglo-American Committee as the basis forthe official consultations, and it would be unwise for the british delegation to throw over that Report at the outset and to seek to substitute the alternative policy outlined in OP. (46) 259. Theymust seek the appropriate moment for bringing forward this alter-native plan; and this would probably come after they had exposedthe weaknesses in the recommendations (Nos. 3 and 6) of the Anglo-American Committee regarding the future constitution of palestine and future immigration policy.The consultations should therefore begin with the firstrecommendation of the Anglo-American Committee, regarding theproblem of the Jews in Europe. The Delegation should emphasise the Committees failure to make any constructive proposals underthis part of their terms of reference; and should stress the factthat the Arab opposition to the admission of 100,000 jewish immigrants into Palestine would be substantially strengthened ifthis movement began before there was any indication that othercountries outside Europe would make their contribution towardsthe solution of this problem. Mr. La Guardia had just announced his intention to propose, on behalf of U.N.R.R.A., that 120,000Jews should be admitted to the United States, all unused immigra-tion quotas being made available for that purpose. This would reinforce the suggestion which the Foreign Secretary was proposing to make to Mr. Byrnes; and the British Delegation might ask whether the United States Government would be willing to make an early announcement of their attitude towards these proposals.It was, however, important to maintain the principle that the settle-ment of Jewish and other displaced persons from Europe was aninternational, not an Anglo-American, responsibility; and thatremedial action should be taken through the machinery of the united nations. It might be some time before the United Nations estab-lished an effective organisation for handling the refugee problem as a whole; but any appeal to Governments to make an interimcontribution by receiving a proportion of these displaced personsin territories under their control should be made by the united nations, not by the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States.
The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the alternative policy for Palestineoutlined in CP. (46) 259, subject to modification to meetthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion for the creation of a council representing all the interested religious bodies tocontrol the Holy Places in Jerusalem.(2) Subject to any comments which might be received from theChiefs of Staff, authorised the British Delegation to putforward this alternative policy at the appropriate stage in the forthcoming discussions with officials of theUnited States Government.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11*A July, 1946.
