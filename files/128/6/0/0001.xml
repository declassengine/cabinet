Chiefs ofStaff.Field-MarshalMontgomery.1. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, welcomedField-Marshal Viscount Montgomery on his first attendance at cabinet since assuming his appointment as Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.Future of 2.   The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the ForeignItalian Secretary (Nos. 285, 286 and 287 of the 30th June) regarding theColonies.        latest developments in the discussions at the Council of Foreign(Previous       Ministers in Paris about the future of the Italian Colonies,Keference: Difficulties had arisen over the terms of the provision to beC.M.(46)45th inserted in the draft Treaty to give effect to the suggestion of theConclusions, United States Delegation that Italy should cede her sovereigntyMinute 1.) over her former Colonies to the four principal Allied Powers, who should within a year agree on arrangements for their future or,failing such agreement, refer the problem to the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary had objected to the proposed cession of theColonies to the Four Powers, while the Soviet Delegation had suggested a Four-Power supervisory body to assist the administra-tion of the Colonies during the interim period and this was not acceptable to the other Foreign Ministers.The Foreign Secretary now proposed to put forward a draftArticle for inclusion in the Peace Treaty and a draft of an accom-accompanying  Declaration by the Four Powers, which he thought might prove acceptable to the other Foreign Ministers. The draft Articleprovided that Italy should surrender her sovereignty over herColonies but avoided cession to the Four Powers; their future wasto be settled by the Four Powers within a year in accordance withthe accompanying Declaration. Under the draft Declaration theFour Powers agreed that the Colonies should either be granted their independence or be incorporated in a neighbouring territory or bemade subject to individual or collective trusteeship; and if thePowers were unable to reach agreement within a year, the matter was to be referred to the General Assembly of the United nations and the Powers were to agree to accept their recommendation. TheForeign Secretary drew particular attention to the last point; inbinding themselves in the last resort to accept a recommendationof the Assembly the United Kingdom Government would be taking a risk, but in his view it was one which ought, in the circumstances,to be taken.In discussion the Cabinet, bearing in mind that the generalbackground of the conversations in Paris now seemed morefavourable, were strongly of the opinion that this meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers must not be allowed to break down on this point alone, and that it would be preferable to accept asolution on the lines proposed.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the question of the italian colonies was but one aspect of the problem of our general strategic position in the Middle East a subject on which the Chiefs of staff had just completed a review which they hoped would shortly beconsidered by the Defence Committee. The Chiefs of Staff con-sidered that the draft Declaration proposed by the Foreign secretary was open to military objection only to the extent that it visualisedthe possibility of a form of trusteeship which would allow the SovietGovernment some share in the control over the Italian Colonies.This would be greatly to our military disadvantage. The Chiefs ofStaff were also concerned at the possibility that, if in discussions in the General Assembly the alternative of independence wasfavoured, it might be accompanied by demilitarisation, which againwould be to our disadvantage.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and other ministers thought that some of the Dominion Governments wouldcriticise this proposal on the ground that it gave no special share in the decision about the disposal of the Colonies to any of the active belligerents other than the four principal Powers: if theFour Powers failed to agree, the question was to be referred straightto the Assembly.   It was pointed out that both the draft Article[32264-9] b 2
and the draft Declaration would be placed before the Peace Con-ference, at which all the active belligerents would be represented,and that they would then have the right to criticise those draftsand to propose amendments. The position would, however, be easedif it were possible to include in the third paragraph of the draftArticle, and in the second and third paragraphs of the draft declaration, some provision whereby the Four Powers would actafter consultation with the active, belligerents. This point shouldbe brought to the notice of the Foreign Secretary.The further suggestion was made that, in view of the attitude which some of the,Dominion Governments were likely to take, itwould have been preferable if this proposal could have been putforward by one of the other Foreign Ministers rather than by theForeign Secretary. It was appreciated that it might be impossibleto arrange for this, but the point should also be brought to theForeign Secretary&apos;s notice. The Foreign Secretary would no doubtmake it clear, if indeed he had not already done so, that he would notbe debarred at the Peace Conference from supporting any sugges-tions put forward by other belligerent Powers, even though theyinvolved amendments to proposals which he had himself made.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a settlement regarding the future of theItalian Colonies should be sought on the lines proposedby the Foreign Secretary in telegrams Nos. 285 and 287of the 30th June.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in communicating thisdecision to the Foreign Secretary, would inform him ofthe points made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.Future of 3.   The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the ForeignTrieste. Secretary (Nos. 283 and 284 of the 29th June and Nos, 288 and 290(Previous of the 30th June) describing recent developments in the discussionsEeference: at the Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris about the future of cm. (46) 45th   Trieste.Conclusions, At the Council&apos;s meeting on the 29th June the French Delega-Minute l.) tion had put forward a tentative proposal for placing Trieste andthe neighbouring territory under an international regime for aperiod of ten years. The Soviet Delegation had indicated that theywere prepared to discuss a solution on these lines, provided thatthe international regime was permanent, not temporary. Thisindicated that the Soviet Government were now prepared toabandon their uncompromising support of the full Yugoslav claimto Trieste; and the Foreign Secretary thought that, having nowexhausted all possibility of securing agreement on the basis of theItalian claim, he should see whether an agreed solution could befound on the lines of an international regime. There were, however,serious objections to the specific proposal put forward by the french delegation; and the Foreign Secretary proposed, subject to theCabinet&apos;s views, to work for a solution on the lines indicated inparagraph 4 of his telegram No. 290. Under this scheme Triesteand the neighbouring area would be placed permanently under thecontrol of the United Nations as an autonomous territory, whoseintegrity would be guaranteed by the Four Powers. An independentGovernor would be appointed by the United Nations on the agreedrecommendation of the Governments of Italy and Yugoslavia or,failing such agreement, by the United Nations; and there would bea governing commission consisting of the Governor, the deputy governor, the Chairman of the free port of Trieste and two localresidents chosen, respectively, from the Italian and Slovene popula-tion. This commission would exercise all powers of government,including legislation. It would arrange for the election of a consul-tative assembly by universal suffrage and secret ballot. It would exercise its legislative powers in consultation with the assembly,which would also have the right to formulate proposals for legisla-tion and to submit them to the commission. The commission would arrange for the creation of appropriate organs of municipal andlocal government.   It would submit an annual report to the United
Nations, and would also refer to the United Nations any difficultiesor disputes arising in the application of the constitution. Proposalsfor amendment of the constitution would be submitted for theapproval of the United Nations.The Cabinet approved in principle the line which the foreign secretary was proposing to take. Particular points made in discussion were (a) The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff saw no objection on military grounds to the establishment of an inter-national regime for Trieste on the lines indicated in the foreign secretary&apos;s telegram. They pointed out, however, that it would benecessary to retain Allied troops in this area for the purpose of preserving public order until the proposed international regime hadbeen established and had created a gendarmerie adequate for thatpurpose. The man-power plan to which the War Office were working was based on the assumption that all British troops wouldbe withdrawn from Venezia Giulia by the end of 1946; and, to theextent that this assumption was not realised, the Army would be unable to drop to the strength planned for the end of 1946.(&amp;) It was the general view that a regime on these lines couldbe made to work if the Great Powers desired its success and theauthority of the United Nations was respected. Reference wasmade in this connection to the comparable regimes created afterthe last war for Danzig and the Saar, which were operated success-fully so long as the authority of the League of Nations was maintained.(c) Special importance was attached to the Foreign Secretary&apos;spoint that an international regime on these lines should be designed as a permanent regime. To establish such a regime on a temporary basis for ten years would encourage each of the two national groups to try to increase its influence in the area with a view to improvingits case for assuming exclusive sovereignty at the end of thetemporary period.(d) For similar reasons it was important that the inhabitantsfor their own government. Did the constitution outlined in theForeign Secretary&apos;s telegram make sufficient provision for this?Was it not desirable that full legislative powers should be exercised by a democratically elected assembly, as under the proposals tenta-tively put forward by the French Delegation? Or should it be specifically provided that the constitution would be reviewed at a specified future date ?It was the general view of the Cabinet that the constitutionoutlined in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s telegram would make sufficientprovision for self-government by the inhabitants of the area. Thus,the consultative assembly would be empowered to formulate legisla-tion for the approval of the governing commission; and provision was made for municipal and local government. There was scopehere for the development of a democratic system. And it would be preferable not to provide for the constitution to be reviewed at anyparticular date, since this might discourage the inhabitants fromsettling down to work the existing constitution. The scheme alreadycontemplated that the constitution might be amended by the united nations.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should be authorised to explore the possibility of reaching agreement on theCouncil of Foreign Ministers to an international regimefor Trieste and the neighbouring territory on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of his telegram No. 290 of the30th June.(2) Agreed that any such international regime should be estab-established as a permanent regime and not, as suggested bythe French Delegation, as a temporary regime.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theForeign Secretary to be informed of the views expressedin the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.of the area shouldresponsibility
Palestine.(previous reference:C.M.(46)61stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed theCabinet of the latest developments in Palestine. Acting under theauthority given him in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision ofthe 20th June, the High Commissioner had put into operation onthe 29th June measures for breaking up the illegal Jewishorganisations throughout Palestine and arresting the leadersresponsible for instigating and directing the present campaign of violence. On the morning of that day military and police forces had occupied buildings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, including the jewish agency&apos;s building, and had carried out searches in a number of jewish settlements. Large quantities of documents had been seized,and about 2,000 persons had been arrested for interrogation. Inthese extensive operations only 3 Jews had been killed and only13 injured had been admitted to hospital. One British soldier hadbeen accidentally shot and killed. The next steps would depend onthe results of the examination of the documents which had beenseized, but evidence had already been secured of close connection between the Jewish Agency and the Hagana.The latest telegrams from the High Commissioner (Nos. 1069and 1071) were read to the Cabinet. These gave his appreciation ofthe position on the 30th June and an account of an interview whichhe had had with Dr. Weizmann.The Prime Minister suggested that he should make a full statement on the situation in reply to a Private Notice Questionwhich Mr. S. S. Silverman, M.P., was to put to him in the Houseof Commons that afternoon. A draft of this statement was read to the Cabinet; and various suggestions for amendment of the draftwere made and approved.The Cabinet were also informed that Mr. Silverman might askfor the House to be adjourned for the purpose of debating this statement. It was agreed that, if there were a general discussion on the adjournment, the Prime Minister should reply to the debate.In further discussion reference was made to an allegation thatimmediately after the publication of the Report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine the Higher Arab Committee had met and decided that they would not countenance any violentresistance to the implementation of thai Report.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement on Palestine in the House of Commons that afternoon, inthe terms of the draft which had been read to theCabinet, subject to the amendments suggested in thediscussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to enquire into the suggestion that the Higher Arab Committee hadresolved not to countenance any violent resistance to the implementation of the Report of the Anglo-american committee on Palestine, and to report the results of his enquiries to the Prime Minister.Parliament.bread rationing.(previous reference:CM. (46) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the debate onbread rationing which was to take place in the House of commons on the 3rd July.The Minister of Food said that the only new figures that he proposed to give in the debate were his estimates of the stocks ofwheat in the United Kingdom at the end of August, and these wouldbe broken up to show how the total stocks would be distributed along the pipe-line. He would hope to show that the introduction of rationing could be amply justified because of the many uncertainfactors affecting our wheat supplies in the next few months. Thus,the United States Government might be prevented by a maritimestrike from sending us all the wheat they had promised, the weathermight make it impossible to obtain in August and September allthe home-grown supplies on which we were relying, and the good prospects for the Canadian crop might no  hp realised.   So far as
concerned Germany, he would give figures showing the amountsalready sent from the United Kingdom and would stress the factthat, unless the United States provided the monthly supply of120,000 tons of wheat allocated to the British Zone of Germany forthe next three months, they must be held responsible for theconsequences.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Minister of Food said that he did not intend to giveestimates of United Kingdom wheat stocks for any date earlier thanAugust, nor would he commit himself to giving such estimates forany future date.(b) The Lord President said that he hoped that, in dealing withGermany, the Minister of Food would not imply that the UnitedStates Government had gone back on their earlier undertakings.(c) It was suggested that the Minister of Food should explainwhy we had not been able to obtain larger supplies from theArgentine, and should stress the extent to which United Kingdomwheat supplies had been reduced to meet the needs of countries(such as India and Germany) whose peoples were in danger ofstarvation. In this connection, too much prominence should not begiven to Germany.(d) The Minister of Food said that there had been an alarmingrun on flour, and it would be unfortunate if the bread rationing scheme were to start with depleted stocks in the hands of bakers.He might, therefore, find it necessary to limit the off take of flourto the normal figures. He would also consider the possibility ofappealing to the public not to buy excessive quantities of flour, and asking retail distributors to do everything possible to ensure thatthe limited amount of flour was fairly shared during the next three weeks.(e) There was general agreement that if the debate was in committee of Supply the Minister of Food should speak first andshould also wind up the debate. The Lord President should,however, be available in case any reference were made to his mission to the United States.The Cabinet^Took note with approval of the arrangements proposed forthe debate on bread rationing on the 3rd July.SelectCommitteeon national expenditure.Publicationof SecretPeports.(previous reference:CM. (46) 51stConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Lord President recalled that at their meeting on the23rd May the Cabinet had agreed that he should arrange for thepublication of the Report on Tank Production presented by theSelect Committee on National Expenditure on the 9th March, 1944,together with the Coalition Government^ reply.Mr. Churchill had subsequently asked that he should have anopportunity of seeing the documents before they were published, andthe Minister of Supply was arranging to provide the Prime minister with a print which he might send to Mr. Churchill. Meanwhile,Mr. R. R. Stokes, M.P., had renewed his pressure for the publicationof the Report and it would be difficult to defer publication much longer. He hoped, therefore, that there would be no further delay in sending the documents to Mr. Churchill, and that it would bemade clear to him that the Government proposed to publish them ata very early date.The Cabinet-^Took note of the position.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st July, 1946.
