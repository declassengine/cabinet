Supplies for germany.(Previousjjeference:C,M.(46)93rdConclusions, ,Minute 5.)1. At the Prime Ministers invitation Sir Sholto Douglas gave the Cabinet an account of the serious situation which was arising inthe British Zone of Germany owing to the shortage of bread grains.At the present season of the year about two-thirds of the rationrequirements could be met from indigenous supplies, but the balancehad to be imported from overseas and imported supplies would be exhausted within the next ten days. Immediate needs could be metonly by borrowing grain in, or destined for, the United States Zone.He had already asked for such a loan and hoped he might obtainit. The United States authorities in Germany had, however, derivedthe impression from Washington that there were ample suppliesof grain in Canada and that the United Kingdom Governmentshould be able to secure this for the British Zone. It was vitally important that this impression should be corrected.Administration of the British Zone of Germany was gravelyhandicapped by the hand-to-mouth basis on which its food supplies were at present being obtained. Some greater assurance of futuresupplies was urgently needed. He hoped that the Foreign secretary would be able to secure this in his forthcoming negotiations in theUnited States.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Ministerof Food agreed that the true facts of the Canadian wheat position must be brought home to the United States authorities. Owing to difficulties of internal transport, it was unlikely that Canada would now be able to ship during the winter months more than the amountsrequired for the United Kingdom alone.In further discussion it was recalled that at their meetings on25th and 31st October the Cabinet had agreed that the foreign secretary should include the question of grain supplies for theBritish Zone of Germany in the general approach which he was tomake to the United States administration on the whole questionof food supplies for areas of British responsibility. As the miscon-ception about Canadian supplies had originated in the UnitedStates and not with American officials in Germany, the best coursewould be for him to cover the point in these negotiations. TheMinister of State undertook to see that the Foreign Secretary was fully informed of the facts. These should also be given to theCommander-in-Chief for use by him and his officers in discussions with United States officials in Germany.    :The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it was clear from a recent Report of the Tripartite Nutrition Commission thatthe results of short rations1 were being increasingly felt, not only inthe towns and among the poorer classes, but among all sections ofthe population. One index was the marked increase in infectioustuberculosis. Failure to maintain the present ration of 1,550 caloriesa day would have serious results; and it was most desirable thatthe ration should be increased as soon as practicable to 2,000 calories.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the latest information regarding the food situation in the british zone of Germany to be communicated forthwith to theForeign Secretary for the purpose of his forthcoming discussions with the United States administration.International[Organisations.jj(previous reference:no-M. (45) 51stjponclusioias,l&apos;minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the lord president (CP. (46) 416), the President of the Board of Trade (CP.(46) 413), and the Minister of State (CP. (46) 415) on the work and location of International Organisations.The Cabinet first discussed the general issues raised in CP.(46) 416 by the Lord President, who suggested that international collaboration was in danger of being discredited by the proliferation.of international agencies, the variety of the questions brought forward for discussion, and the weakness of the secretarialorganisation.[32746-2] b 2
In the Cabinets discussion there was general support for theview that &quot;the United Nations and the specialised agencies were Iattempting to do too much too quickly; that the number of inter-national meetings which were being held made excessive demandsoh&apos; the time of Ministers and officials of all countries; and that theresults so far achieved were far from compensating for the time and effort expended in these meetings. At the political level inter-national discussions should for the present be concentrated primarily on the urgent problems of international security and economic recovery. On the technical level there were great advantages in international contacts between experts, but it was arguable thatthese conferences should be kept separate from the United Nations,where they might be exploited for political purposes.The Cabinet also agreed on the importance of increasing theefficiency of the secretarial organisation of the United Nations andof some of the specialised agencies. The secretariat of the united nations itself had expanded rapidly in New York, and its efficiencyhad not increased proportionately. The Minister of State said thathe hoped that the Foreign Secretary would make some comment onthis aspect of the matter during the current meeting of the general assembly. There were three points which might with advantage be made.-. First, the growth of the secretariat might be limited.Secondly, permission might be sought to appoint a Deputy Secretary-General, who should be an experienced administrator. Thirdly, theUnited Kingdom Delegation might offer to submit a memorandum containing specific suggestions for increasing the efficiency of the secretariat.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a small working party of officials to draw up a report on the working ofthe secretariat of the United Nations and some of the specialised agencies; and asked that this report shouldbe submitted to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet next discussed the questions raised in CP. (46)413 and 415, viz., whether the headquarters of specialised inter-national agencies should be located at the site of the United Nationsitself and, in particular, whether the International Trade Organisa-tion should have its headquarters at the site of the United nations or in Europe.The Minister of State said that the arguments for and againstthe general principle of centralising these agencies at the site of theUnited Nations were summarised in CP. (46) 415. When theCabinet had last discussed this question on 8th November, 1945,they had not finally rejected his predecessors argument that itshould be our general aim to bring together in one place the head-quarters of the various international agencies connected with theUnited Nations. It was true that we had not since then met with much success in our efforts to achieve such a centralisation. he hoped, however, that the Cabinet would at least defer taking adefinite decision against the principle of centralisation.The following were the main points in discussion : (a) Centralisation at the site of the United Nations meantcentralisation in the United States. If too many international organisations were brought under the influence of the United States,there was a danger that this might increase the cleavage between theeastern and western worlds and reduce the interest taken byEuropean countries in international collaboration.(b) In CP. (46) 416 attention had been drawn to the high costof maintaining in the United States the headquarters staffs of inter-national organisations. As against this, it was pointed out that,while such organisations were maintained in the United States, theUnited States Government were likely to be willing to bear a largeproportion of the total cost. They were at present defraying 49 percent, of the cost of maintaining the headquarters of the united nations.
(c) Was it necessary, to lay down any general principle aboutthe location of the headLquarters of specialised agencies? would it not be preferable to deal with each case on its merits ? Thus^ therewere strong reasons for locating in Washington the InternationalReconstruction Bank and the International Monetary Fund because etheir success was dependent on the financial support of the UnitedStates. Again, it was convenient that the Provisional InternationaliCivil Aviation Organisation should have its headquarters in montreal, in view of the importance of retaining Canadian interestin the international regulation of civil aviation. It seemedimportant that the International Trade Organisation should have its headquarters outside the United States, where delegates wouldbe subject to pressure from commercial groups.(d) The Postmaster-General said that there were strong reasonsfor retaining at Berne the headquarters of the Universal PostalUnion and the International Telecommunications Union. these organisations had a long record of useful technical work, whichshould not be endangered by exposing them to the politicalatmosphere and commercial pressures which they would encounter inthe United States.(e) It was likely that the International Labour organisation would decide to transfer their headquaters from the United states to Europe. The next Conference of the Organisation would be heldin Geneva.(/) The Minister of Health said that, if a World health organisation were established, he would be strongly opposed to its headquarters being located in the United States. There was a good prospect that London might become a world centre for post-graduatework in medicine; and from this point of view he would wish the headquarters of a World Health Organisation to be establishedsomewhere in Europe. The Canadian Minister of Health, with whom he had recently discussed this question, favoured Geneva asthe site for the headquarters of this Organisation.(g) In view of the attitude of the United States government towards world food problems, it now seemed unlikely that the food and Agriculture Organisation would be able to play an effective partin securing the equitable distribution of the world&apos;s food supplies.It would, however, be inexpedient for His Majesty&apos;s Government totake any initiative towards the dissolution of this Organisation. Ifit were to continue, its headquarters and those of the international trade Organisation should be located together.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that, in discussion of the location of the head-quarters of international organisations, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not advocate the application of anygeneral principle either decentralisation or centralisation-tion at the site of the United Nations itself.(3) Endorsed the view that the headquarters of the UniversalPostal Union and the International TelecommunicationsUnion should remain at Berne.(4) Agreed that the headquarters of the International trade organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organis-tion should be located together; and that it was undesirable that the headquarters of the former shouldbe located in the United States.(5) Endorsed the view that, if a World Health Organisationwere established, it would be undesirable that its head-quarters should be located in the United States.
3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (46) 412) covering the Second Interim Report ofthe Departmental Committee on Procedure in Matrimonial Causes.The Lord Chancellor said that the main recommendation inthis report was that, while divorce jurisdiction should remain withthe High Court, County Court Judges should be appointed asCommissioners of the High Court to try divorce cases, both inLondon and in the provinces, and Judges of the King&apos;s Benchshould cease to try undefended divorce suits on circuit.The Lord Chancellor said that the number of divorce petitionsfiled in 1945 was 25,000; and it was estimated that in 1946 the totalnumber would be 40,000 and in 1947 50,000. It was clear that thisgreatly increased volume of work could not be handled by theexisting Judges of the High Court. The Committees plan, whichwas admittedly a compromise, would make it possible for the courts to handle what might prove to be a temporary increase in divorcecases without conferring divorce jurisdiction on the County Courts.The plan would command a wide measure of support in legal circles.It was, however, opposed by the President of the Divorce Court, whoadvocated the appointment of six additional Commissioners to dealsolely with divorce. The Lord Chancellor said that he disliked the presidents scheme for three reasons. First, he thought itinexpedient that any Judge should devote the whole of his time todivorce cases. Secondly, if additional Judges of the High Courtwere to try divorce cases in the provinces, there would be difficultiesof finding accommodation, staff, &amp;c, which would not arise if usewere made of the County Court Judges. Thirdly, if additional judges were appointed to cope with what might prove to be atemporary increase in divorce work, special superannuation pro-vision might have to be made for them. In these circumstances he recommonded the Cabinet to accept the scheme proposed by theDepartmental Committee, notwithstanding the opposition of thePresident of the Divorce Court.In the second part of their report, the Committee made anumtjer of detailed recommendations for simplifying divorceprocedure. The Lord Chancellor invited the Cabinet to authorise him to investigate these to see how far they could be carried intoeffect,Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in favour of thescheme recommended by the Committee. Its adoption would not preclude the eventual transfer of divorce jurisdiction to the county courts; but it should ensure that such a transfer would not bemade unless it had been found, by practical experience, that county court Judges were able to deal satisfactorily with divorce cases.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations made in the Second InterimReport of the Departmental Committee on procedure in Matrimonial Causes;(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to publish the report and totake steps to bring its recommendations into effect.Divorce.(previous reference:CM.(46)4SthConclusions,Minute 10.)Exchange 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in  their control Bill.     discussion on 4th November the Cabinet had contemplated that he(Previous        would be able to make a public statement, before the publication ofReference:       the Exchange Control Bill, setting out the broad facts of ourCM.(46)94th   overseas balance in relation to the powers sought in the Bill.   he conclusions,     pointed out that such a statement ought to be made in ParliamentMinute 6.)      and the earliest opportunity to make it would be during the debate on the Address.   He was, however, anxious to publish the Bill on13th November.    Would it be convenient for him to speak on14th November in the debate on the Address ?
The Lord President said that he was not yet in a position toadvise on the order in which the Government spokesmen should speak in this debate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that in these cir-cumstances he should proceed with his arrangements for publishing the Bill on 13th November, and should hold a Press Conference onthat day to explain the provisions of the Bill. This would be on theunderstanding that he would be given the first convenient oppor-tunity thereafter to make a general statement in Parliament onthe broad facts of our overseas balance.The Cabinet- Agreed that the publication of the Exchange Control bill might precede the general statement which the Chancellorof the Exchequer was proposing to make in Parliament onthe broad facts of our overseas balance.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th November, 1946.
