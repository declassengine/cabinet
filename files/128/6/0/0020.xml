1. The Foreign Secretary reported that the financial and commercial discussions between British and French officials had nowbeen satisfactorily concluded.On financial matters agreement had been reached about thebasis of future payments. The proceeds of the liquidation of sterling securities belonging to French nationals would no longer be used for the repayment of credits previously arranged betweenthe two Governments, but would be used for current needs; and theexisting debt to the United Kingdom Exchequer would be repaidby twelve annual instalments commencing in 1950 with interest at\ per cent.On commercial questions, there were many directions in whichthe British and French economies could be adjusted so as to reduceunnecessary competition, and for this purpose regular meetings of officials of the two Governments would be held not less than once in every three months with the following agreed objectives : (i) To review the balance of trade and payments;(ii) To examine any difficulties which might have arisen andto suggest solutions; and(iii) To consider how to prevent conflicts between the recon-struction and modernisation plans of the two countriesin accordance with the declared objectives of the twoGovernments as regards world trade and the proposalsfor an International Trade Organisation.The Foreign Secretary read to the Cabinet the draft of a communique which it was proposed to issue that evening announcing the results of these discussions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was gratified bythe results of these negotiations. The low interest rate fixed forthe repayment of the French debt to the United Kingdom was partof a deliberate policy to promote low interest rates throughout theworld. This should help us to secure a low rate of interest on the sterling balances held by foreign countries.The President of the Board of Trade said that the agreement had his full support.The Foreign Secretary said that under the machinery whichhad been set up the discussions might extend to questions of trade between the Colonial Empires of France and the United Kingdom,which offered many opportunities of fruitful collaboration. TheSecretary of State for the Colonies agreed with this view.Arrangements would no doubt be made for a representative of his department to be present when matters affecting Colonial trade were discussed.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the terms of the announcement to be made regarding the successful conclusion of these negotiations.prance.Financial andCommercialDiscussions.Squatters. . 2.   The Attorney-General informed the Cabinet that the five(Previous        leaders of the squatters who had been arrested for conspiracy on reference:       the 14th September had been committed for trial at the Old BaileyO.M.(46)81st    on the 24th September.   He proposed, if the Cabinet agreed, that conclusions,     when the proceedings began counsel should indicate that, while the minute 3.)       Government did not intend to take oppressive action, they regarded it as their duty to see that a breach of the criminal law was broughtto the notice of the courts, whose duty it was to decide what penaltyshould be imposed.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the attitude which the Attorney-General proposed that counsel should take in prosecutingthis charge.[32563-11b 2
The A attorney-General said that the case of the Minister ofWorks against the various trespassers in Duchess of Bedford Househad been heard that morning in the High Court, and the Judge hadgranted an injunction restraining them from continuing in thistrespass.The Cabinet considered what action should be taken following the grant of this injunction. The injunction applied only to thepersons named therein, but the case had been a test case and it was open to the Government and the other owners to instituteproceedings against all who remained in occupation, claimingpossession and damages. It was to be hoped, however, that as theresult of the injunction already obtained all the squatters would recognise the illegality of their action and would quit at once thepremises which they were occupying. To encourage them to do so and to ensure that they did not succeed in attracting public sympathy, the Cabinet agreed that two things were necessary.First, arrangements should be made for alternative accommoda-tion to be immediately available for them. On this The Ministerof Health said that he was advised that many had homes of theirown to which they could go. Others, however, would be homeless;and he had already arranged that the London County Council, asthe public assistance authority, would be ready to provide themwith temporary accommodation.Secondly, the squatters should be left in no doubt of the implications of the High Court decision. A full statement shouldbe issued to the press and the position might also be explained tothe squatters by other means, e.g., loudspeaker vans. The A attorney-General indicated the lines which such a statement might take. Itwas agreed that it should be issued with the authority of the PrimeMinister.Other points in discussion were : (a) Squatters should not be given any special priority on the waiting lists for permanent accommodation. One local authority was said to have announced that they would be placed at the bottom of their waiting list. It was the view of the Cabinet that localauthorities should not thus seek to impose punishment for actions for which the law provided no penalty. In obtaining permanent accommodation the squatters should receive neither advantage nordisadvantage from their action.(b) When squatters left the buildings which they had occupied,the police were entitled to see that they did not cause obstructionand could move them on. They could not, however, remove them by force to the public assistance institutions where temporary accom-modation was available for them. If they refused to move, theycould be arrested for causing obstruction, but must then be takento a police station and charged with that offence.(c) In fairness to the police and to the Ministry of Works care-takers in the buildings, who were in a very difficult position, clearinstructions should be given to them as to the manner in which theyshould deal with squatters who, having left the buildings, attempted to return to them. Should they allow a man to return who had beenout for the day to work, or one who had been out for a short timeto obtain provisions ?The A ttomey-General said that the owner of a building or hisagents were fully entitled to prevent any persons who had left thebuildings from returning to them. It was a question, however, howfar it would be wise to exercise this right to the full.Ministers agreed that some discretion must be left to caretakersand police, but the field for such discretion should be small. Care-takers and police were, of course, within their rights in preventingoccupation by further squatters of premises that had been vacatedby other squatters.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that, in view of the injunctions which had now beengranted in the test cases taken to the High Court, steps
27CM. 82 (46).should at once be taken to bring to the notice of othersquatters the illegality of their action and to urge themto quit the premises which they had occupied.(3) Agreed that proceedings for possession and damages mightbe commenced against all who remained in illegal occupa-tion of premises in this way, but that the Governmentshould offer to discontinue such proceedings against anysquatters who left voluntarily and to recommend to localauthorities that their claims to priority in the allocation of housing should not be prejudiced.(4) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of works to issue instructions to the police and to caretakers ofGovernment buildings to prevent all fresh entries or,subject to the exercise of a reasonable discretion,re-entries to premises occupied by squatters.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theimmediate issue of a statement, on the lines proposedby the Attorney-General in the course of the discussion,covering the points noted in Conclusions (2) and (3)above.3. In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, the Minister of Health drew attention to the gravity of thehousing situation in London. The Government&apos;s first housingtarget was the construction of 750,000 houses over the whole country, which would provide a separate home for each family. Butthe rate at which different areas would achieve their share of this target would not be uniform. In London progress would be seriously delayed by the extent of the air-raid damage suffered andby the need to rehouse the population further away from the centre of the city. Long before separate homes had been provided forevery London family, other parts of the country would already havemade a start with the work of slum clearance.In these circumstances, he made two requests. First, he asked that permission should be given for some London hotels which were about to be de-requisitioned to be taken over by local authorities for housing purposes. The Holborn Borough Council had recently askedleave to take over two such hotels in their area : the housing problemthere was very serious and there were strong arguments in favourof acceding to this request. Secondly, he asked that fresh efforts should be made to persuade Government Departments, and especially the Service Departments, to reduce their holdings of residential accommodation.As regards the use of hotels for housing purposes, the Ministerof Works said that under the instructions approved by Ministersregarding the priorities to be observed in the release of requisitionedpremises all de-requisitioned hotels were to be handed over to then-owners for use as hotels.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade said that there was a very serious shortage of hotel accommodation in London and they would find great difficulty in agreeing to the first of the requests made by the Minister of Health.For the purposes of the export drive it was most important thatbuyers should be able to come freely to London. Plans had also beenmade to attract to this country in 1947 about 150,000 tourists, whowould spend here a substantial amount of foreign exchange. these plans could not be carried into effect without adequate hotel accom-modation.It was, however, important that hotels when released shouldnot be allowed to stand empty, but should be immediately occupied,at least in part, even while they were being reconditioned.The retention of residential accommodation by GovernmentDepartments was a matter which had been considered on previous occasions. The view of the Cabinet was that further efforts couldbe made to concentrate staffs into a smaller total of accommodation.
Some of the Service Departments had not reduced the accommoda-tion they held by anything like the same percentage -as the reductionwhich had taken place in the staff they employed. It was also suggested that branches of some Government Departments mightbe removed to some of the large country houses which were beingde-requisitioned. The low priority given, in de-requisitioning, toflats normally let at high rentals should also be reconsidered. Therelease of accommodation of higher value would indirectly relieve the pressure on the accommodation available for people in the lowerincome groups.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would consider what further action could usefully be taken to expedite therelease of residential accommodation held in London by government Departments.Central 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeOrganisation Minister (CP. (46) 345) on the future of our Central organisation for Defence.     for Defence.The Prime Minister said that he had been reviewing thisquestion for some months past, with the assistance of the First Lordof the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.They had conferred with Ministers, senior military officers and officials who had been intimately concerned with the machinery forthe higher direction of the late war. Their conclusions were setout in the report annexed to CP. (46) 345. After reviewing thedevelopment of our defence organisation over the last forty yearsand its practical performance during the last two wars, they were satisfied that there were no grounds for any drastic recasting of themain structure of the existing organisation. They recommended,however, that some changes should be made in order to consolidate the advances made during the last ten years. The following werethe main features of their plan of post-war organisation : (i) ThePrime Minister should retain the supreme responsibility for defence,(ii) The Defence Committee should take over the functions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence and be responsible both for the review of current strategy and for co-ordinating departmental action in preparation for war. (iii) There should be a Minister ofDefence, with a Ministry, who would be directly responsible toParliament for certain defined subjects affecting the three fightingServices and their supply. His main functions would be toapportion available resources (including resources for research,development and production) between the three Services in accord-ance with the strategic policy laid down by the Defence Committee;to settle questions of general administration on which a common policy for the three Services was desirable; and to administer inter-Service organisations such as Combined Operations headquarters and the Joint Intelligence Bureau, (iv) The Chiefs of Staff Com-mittee would continue to be responsible for preparing strategicappreciations and military plans and submitting them to theDefence Committee, and the Joint Staff system would be retainedand developed under their direction, (v) The Service ministers would remain responsible to Parliament for the administration oftheir own Services in accordance with the general policy approvedby the Cabinet and within the resources allotted to them.If these proposals were approved by the Cabinet, it was contem-plated that they should be presented to Parliament in a white paper, the draft of which was also annexed to CP. (46) 345.The Prime Minister said that, by his direction, an enquiry had also been made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forWar into the possibility of amalgamating some of the administrative services, e.g., the medical services, which were now providedseparately for each of the three fighting Services. The results ofthis enquiry were about to be considered by the Defence Committee.If it were found that amalgamation was desirable, these common
29CM. 82 (46).services might at a later stage be brought under the direct adminis-tration of the Minister of Defence. He did not, however, proposethat the Cabinet should take a decision on this question at thepresent time. Even if it were decided that these services shouldbe amalgamated, it would be inexpedient that the new Minister-should assume this heavy responsibility from the outset: it wouldbe preferable that he should first be established with the more generalfunctions summarised above, and that his direct administrativeresponsibilities should be limited for the time being to those inter-Service organisations concerned with planning, intelligence and stafftraining which had developed within the Joint Staff system andwere closely integrated with the work of those staffs. If it were decided at a later stage to give him further responsibility for common administrative services, this should be made the subject ofa separate and subsequent submission to Parliament.After the Prime Minister had explained the principal features of the proposed new organisation, a discussion ensued in which themain points raised were the following :  1(a) The essence of the new organisation proposed was that itwas sufficiently flexible to allow of further development in thelight of changing needs. Ministers thought it likely that, as time went on, the position and powers of the new Minister of defence would be progressively strengthened and the influence of the service ministers correspondingly reduced. It might be found possible,before long, to abolish some of the posts of Parliamentary secretary in the Service Departments. These changes might also afford anopportunity for discontinuing the titles &quot;War Office&quot; and&quot; Secretary of State for War &quot; in favour of descriptions reflectingthe fact that this Department and the Minister in charge of it were concerned, not with war as a whole, but with the land forces only.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he welcomed the changes proposed by the Prime Minister, which would have theeffect that the Treasury would in future be able to discuss defence expenditure as a whole with a single Minister, who would beresponsible for the allocation of resources between the three services. It was inappropriate that the Treasury, through their financial control, should be drawn into assuming responsibility forthe allocation between the three Services of resources available for defence.(c) All possible steps should be taken to make clear toParliament the dividing line between the responsibilities of theMinister of Defence on the one hand and, on the other, the three service Ministers. It was proposed that the Minister of defence should be responsible for answering Parliamentary Questions on matters which were common either to the three Services or to thethree Services and the Ministry of Supply. Would it not be useful if, in addition to the definition of functions contained in the draft white Paper, some further guidance could be given to Parliamentregarding the type of Questions which could properly be addressedto the new Minister %The general feeling of the Cabinet was that it would be unwise to attempt too elaborate and rigid a definition: it would be preferable to leave it to the good sense of the House of Commons todevelop rules of practice regarding the distribution of Questionsbetween these Ministers.id) The Minister of Defence would be responsible for framing the general policy governing scientific research and development inthe field of defence. What arrangements would be made to correlateresearch in defence science with research in the civil sphere ?The Cabinet were informed that it was hoped that a singlescientist would assume the Chairmanship of the two main scientificbodies advising the Government on defence science and civil sciencerespectively. It would remain for further consideration whether,in addition, arrangements would be required to correlate these twosubjects at the Ministerial level.(e) If the new Ministry of Defence was to correlate the workof the three Service Departments, was there not a risk that the
Permanent Secretary of that Department would, acquire a positionof such influence as to undermine the authority of the service ministers ?It was explained that it was not intended that the Minister ofDefence should supervise the work of the Service Ministers. Hewould be directly responsible to Parliament for a limited range of problems; and the Service Ministers would be relieved of iheirexisting responsibility for those questions. The respective jurisdic-tions of these Ministers would therefore be exclusive. It followed that the senior officials of the Ministry of Defence would not in anyway be superior to the senior officials of the three service departments.(/) Should the Minister of Labour be included among theregular members of the Defence Committee?On the one hand, it was argued that it would be sufficient ifhe were invited to attend meetings at which matters affecting his department were to be discussed. If the Committee were to includeamong its regular members all the Ministers who were concernedwith, or could make a contribution towards, some subjects affectingdefence, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Trans-port and possibly other Ministers would have a similar claim to membership and the Committee would become too large for the efficient discharge of its business.On the other hand, it was argued that the Minister of labour had a special claim to regular membership, as questions of man-power, industrial training and industrial relations entered so largelyinto the problems of defence.It was agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the side of including the Minister of Labour among the regular members of theDefence Committee.(g) Attention was drawn to the importance of securing close collaboration between the staff of the new Ministry of Defence andthe Cabinet Secretariat.(A) In paragraph 5 of his covering note (OP. (46) 345) thePrime Minister had proposed that, before the White Paper was published, Dominion Governments should be given a general indica-tion of the new organisation proposed and an opportunity for detailed comment on the passages relating specifically to collabora-tion with the Dominions.The Secretary of State for India asked whether it was intendedto make a similar communication to the Government of India beforethe White Paper was published.After discussion it was agreed that a copy of the White paper should be communicated to the Viceroy, in advance of publication;and that he should be given discretion to show it to the Commander-in-Chief and, if he thought fit, to give some indication of its con-tents to some members of his Government.(&apos; ) The Minister of Education asked that her department should be brought into consultation in any further consideration ofthe proposals for the amalgamation of the education services inthe Armed Forces.The Cabinet next proceeded to discuss certain detailed sugges-tions for amendment of the draft White Paper.Paragraph 13. In view of the activities of the Defence.Requirements Committee in the years preceding the outbreak ofthe war in 1939, it would be wiser to omit the&quot; statement, in the penultimate sentence of this paragraph, that &apos;&apos; The only conspectusof our armed forces and their requirements was that which wascompiled for financial purposes by adding the separate componentstogether.&quot;Paragraph 20 (p).-The Chiefs of Staff had suggested that thefinal phrase in this sub-paragraph should read &quot; he will summonthe Chiefs of Staff to confer with him whenever he or they sodesire.&quot; This amendment had been suggested because it was thought that the original wording might be held to imply that theMinister of Defence might preside, as a matter of course, at allmeetings of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The Prime minister suggested, and it was agreed, that this point would be met if the
31CM. 82 (46).-final phrase of this sub-paragraph were amended to read : &quot; andhe will also preside over meetings with the Chiefs of Staff wheneverhe or they may so desire.&quot;Paragraph 30. As it was not intended to submit to Parlia-ment, in this White Paper, proposals for the amalgamation ofcommon administrative services, it was agreed that this paragraph should be re-worded as follows : &quot; The Minister of Defence will assume control of inter-Service organisations such as combined operations Headquarters, the Joint Intelligence Bureau and theImperial Defence College, and their staffs will be borne on hisVote. For the present the only inter-Service bodies to be so trans-ferred are organisations concerned with planning, intelligence and staff training which have developed out of the Joint Staff system and are closely integrated with the work of those Staffs. A studyis being made, howTever, of the possible advantages of drawingtogether certain administrative services which are now providedseparately for each of the three fighting Services, e.g., the medical services, and forming a combined organisation which would providethose services in common for all branches of the Armed Forces. If,as a result of this examination, such amalgamation were found tobe desirable, these common services might at a later stage be placed under the Minister of Defence and administered directly by him.His Majesty&apos;s Government have not reached a decision on thismatter; and if they should subsequently decide in favour of amalgamation, further proposals for this purpose would be presented to Parliament.&quot;Paragraph 31. The Chiefs of Staff had suggested the omission of the last sentence but two of this paragraph, which read : &quot;Atthe same time, the organisation on which they rely in their collec-tive capacity will be located in the new Ministry, and the Chiefsof Staff will meet under the Chairmanship of the new Ministerwhenever he or they may so desire.&quot; They thought it premature to announce that the organisation serving the Chiefs of Staff wouldbe located in the new Ministry. The Prime Minister pointed outthat this organisation must form part of the machinery placed atthe disposal of the new Minister; and it was agreed that this point might be met by substituting, for &quot; will be located in the new ministry,&quot; the words &quot;will be within the new Ministry.&quot;Paragraph 34. It was agreed that the wording of this para-graph would have to be reconsidered in the light of the amendmentmade in paragraph 30.Paragraph 40.- The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that plans for Colonial defence might assign to Colonial forcesin war duties beyond those of withstanding local attacks. It wastherefore agreed that the statement made in this paragraph aboutthe initial duty of withstanding local attacks should be amended so as to relate to the peace-time forces of the Colonies.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals set out in OP. (46) 345 for thefuture of our Central Organisation for Defence.(2) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to OP. (46) 345,subject to the amendments noted above and to any furtherdrafting amendments which the Prime Minister might think it desirable to make.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theWhite Paper, as amended, to be published shortly beforeParliament reassembled after the Summer Recess.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to com-municate to Dominion Governments a general outline of the new organisation proposed, and to invite their detailed comments on the paragraphs relating specifically to collaboration with the Dominions.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for India to send a copy ofthe White Paper to the Viceroy, shortly before its publi-cation in this country, and to give him discretion to show
it to the Commander-in-Chief and, if he thought fit, togive some indication of its contents to some membersof his Government.Burma. 5.   The Secretary of State for Burma informed the cabinet of the latest developments in Burma, where political and economicconditions had combined to produce a very grave situation. Wide-spread strikes of Government and municipal employees werethreatened; and the followers of Aung San had seized the oppor-tunity to press their political demands for a change of government policy. The Governor of Burma urgently needed guidance on theline which he should take in dealing with the situation.After a preliminary discussion, the Cabinet-Agreed that the issues raised by the Secretary of State for burma should be considered at a meeting of the India and burma Committee to be held at 10 a.m. on the following day.   The Chiefs of Staff should attend that meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th September, 1946
