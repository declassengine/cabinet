Parliament.Business inthe Houseof Commons.(previous reference:CM. (46) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)summer recess.1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.The 29th July would be a Supply Day and the Opposition had asked for a debate on the work of the Control Office for Germanyand Austria. The Cabinet were informed that members of theEstimates Committee had recently been visiting Germany and theirreport was to be published that day. It was understood that theOpposition leaders intended to confine themselves, in the debate, tothe question whether the cost of our administration in germany was excessive.In discussion it was pointed out that, even though the report ofthe Estimates Committee and the speeches of the Opposition leaders were confined to comments on the cost of administering existing policy, there was nothing to prevent Private Members from advocates-cating modifications of that policy. And it would be embarrassing to the Foreign Secretary if a wide-ranging debate on policy towards germany took place in the House of Commons on the eve of thePeace Conference and shortly before he embarked upon his proposed discussions (see Minute 4 below) with the United States authorities with a view to the modification of our present policy.It was the view of the Cabinet that in these circumstances theOpposition leaders should be asked to suggest a different subject for debate on the 29th July or, if they were unwilling to do this, atleast to do their utmost to ensure that the discussion was confined to the administration of the existing policy. The Chief Whipundertook to put the first alternative to the Opposition leaders and,if they seemed unwilling to accept it, to arrange for the foreign secretary to see them.On the 30th July, on the Second Reading of the consolidate fund (Appropriation) Bill there would be a debate on Housing.The Government spokesman would be the Minister of Health andthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.On the 31st July and the 1st August there would be a debate on palestine on the Motion for the Adjournment.The Lord President said that the House of Lords wouldadjourn for the Summer Recess on the 1st August and the Houseof Commons on the 2nd August. It was proposed that the House ofCommons should meet again on the 8th October; but, as the Houseof Lords had more outstanding business, it might be necessary forthem to resume earlier. After discussion it was agreed that bothHouses could resume on the 8th October. It was proposed that the session should be ended on the 7th November.It was agreed that, in his statement on Business that after-noon, the Lord President should announce the dates of the summer recess and the date on. which it was proposed to conclude the present session.Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (46) 72ndConclusions.)Anglo-AmericanDiscussions.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the AdditionalSecretary (OP. (46) 295) on the results of the consultations withrepresentatives of the United States Government on the recom-mendations of the Anglo-American Committee on European Jewryand Palestine. The two Delegations- had reached agreement onthe broad principles of policy set out in the statement annexed to cp. (46) 295, which was now submitted for consideration bv thetwo Governments.At the Prime Ministers request, Sir Norman Brook described the main features of the policy proposed by the two Delegations.There was general agreement with the policy proposed; and thePrime Minister expressed, on the Cabinefs behalf, appreciation ofthe skill which Sir Norman Brook had shown in conducting to sosuccessful a conclusion the negotiations with the United, states delegation.[32426-4] b 2
In discussion the following points were raised : -(a) In paragraphs 31 and 32 of the agreed statement it was recommended that, if the proposed policy was adopted by the twoGovernments, it should be presented to Arab and Jewish repre-sentatives as a basis for negotiations at a conference to be convenedby His Majesty&apos;s Government. If the results of that conference were such as to suggest that the new policy would meet with asufficient degree of acceptance in Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should proceed to put it into effect and should inform theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, at their next meeting inSeptember, that practical considerations required this to be done under the existing mandate but that they would press on withthe preparation of a trusteeship agreement and would hope to lay a draft of this before the General Assembly at its session in 1947.The Foreign Secretary and other Ministers expressed doubts aboutthe expediency of making such a report to the United Nations atthe next General Assembly in September. They feared that otherGovernments might seize this opportunity of raising difficulties,which would at least delay the introduction of the new policy inPalestine.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to consider further how best this matter should be handled in the united nations.(6) Paragraph 16 of the agreed statement proposed that an inter-denominational Council should be set up to advise the CentralGovernment of Palestine on all matters relating to the ChristianHoly Places. The Foreign Secretary said that he would have preferred that this Advisory Council should be made responsiblefor all the Holy Places in Palestine and should include representa-tives of Jews and Moslems as well as representatives of the christian churches. He asked that further consideration shouldbe given to this point.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, from thefinancial point of view, the proposals in the agreed statement were satisfactory. Apart from the cost of maintaining troops in Pales-tine, it seemed likely that when this plan had been put into opera-tion our financial commitments would be limited to meeting the deficit on recurrent expenditure in the Arab Province. All theheavy capital expenditure involved was to be met by methodsinvolving no direct charge on the British Exchequer.(d) Paragraph 6 (c) of the agreed statement contemplated thata further approach should be made to Dominion Governmentsurging them to receive a number of displaced persons from europe in territories under their control. The Foreign Secretary said thatstrong pressure should be brought to bear on Dominion governments to make a contribution towards the solution of this problem. Itwould be helpful if definite offers could be made by some, at least,of the Dominions as soon as the proposed policy had been publicly announced.(e) The Foreign Secretary also asked whether some displaced persons could not be received in colonial territories.The Secretary of State for -the Colonies said that these possi-bilities had been fully explored, in consultation with the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in connexionwith the resettlement of members of the Polish Forces and their dependants. Most of our Colonies were in tropical countriesunsuitable for the large-scale settlement of Europeans. He was satisfied that the numbers which could be settled in the colonial empire were very small, and that no further contribution couldbe expected from this source.(/) As regards publication of the proposed policy. The PrimeMinister said that he would deprecate publication in the form ofa White Paper and would prefer that the broad outlines of thepolicy should be announced orally to Parliament.   If agreement
with the United States Government could be reached in time, it   -------would be convenient for this to be done in the course of the debate a ron Palestine which was to take place in the House of Commons in ^ &quot;the following week.   There was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle (subject to further considerationof the points noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above) thepolicy for Palestine and displaced persons in Europe setforth in the statement annexed to CP. (46) 295.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedStates Government to be informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment accepted this policy in principle; that inview of the present situation in Palestine it was important that a very early announcement should bemade stating that the two Governments were agreed upon this policy; that it would be convenient if such anannouncement could be made in the course of a debate on Palestine which was to take place in the House ofCommons on the 31st July; that we proposed that anannouncement in identioal terms should be made simul-taneously in London and in Washington: and that wewould communicate to them before the end of the week the draft of such an announcement.(3) Agreed that the Prime Minister should settle, in consulta-tion with the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, the form of the public annomice-ment which might be made, if the agreement of theUnited States Government were secured, in the debate inthe House of Commons on the 31st July.(4) Invited the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs andfor India to arrange for the substance of the proposed policy to be communicated to the Governments of theDominions and of India with the request that, at theappropriate stage, they should express their support forthe policy proposed.(5) Asked the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toarrange for an approach to be made to DominionGovernments, as contemplated in paragraph 6 (c) of the agreed statement annexed to CP. (46) 295, asking themto make a practical contribution towards this problem by offering to receive a number of displaced persons from Europe in territories under their control: andpressing for specific offers to be made as soon as possible after the announcement of the new policy by the Govern-ments of the United Kingdom and the United States.(6) Agreed that, as soon as it was known that the United StatesGovernment bad accepted the policy outlined in CP.(46) 295, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies should complete the arrangementsfor the proposed conference with representatives of theArabs and the Jews, and should arrange for the sub-stance of the proposed policy to be communicated, before it was publicly announced, to those who were to attendthat conference.Arrangements The Cabinet then discussed the arrangements for the debatetor Debate in the House of Commons on the 31st July and the 1st August,in House While Members would no doubt wish to raise a number of questionsof Commons, regarding the King David tlotel incident and the White Paperconcerning the complicity of the Jewish Agency in earlier terroristoutrages, it would be best to direct the debate as far as possibletowards constructive proposals for the future. To this end, on theassumption that agreement with the United States Governmentwas reached in time, the substance of the new policy proposed in cp. (46) 295 should be announced at the beginning of the debate.
After discussion, the Cabinet (7) Agreed that the Prime Minister should open the debate onthe 31st July, that the Foreign Secretary should speakat the opening of the debate on t,he following day, andthat the Secretary of State for the Colonies should replyto the debate.Security The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet&apos;Situation. that the latest estimate of casualties as a result of the outrage atthe King David Hotel was 65 killed and 58 missing. Among these were many senior British officials and some 50 or 60 Arabs, manyof them members of prominent families. The Irgun Zvei Leuniihad now admitted responsibility for the outrage. It was believedthat the individuals responsible came from Tel Aviv.The High Commissioner had reported that the General OfficerCommanding in Palestine was now examining a plan for widespreadsearches for terrorists in places where they were known to exist,including Tel Aviv. This would entail the use of a considerablenumber of troops, and its success would depend on sufficientinformation being available. The High Commissioner consideredthat, if it were found to be practicable, such an operation would be politically more appropriate at this moment than searches forHagana arms in the settlements. In any case, if a search forterrorists was to be made, a search for arms should not precede it.If the plan was found to be practicable, about a week would berequired to complete the preparations for it. Meanwhile, he con-sidered that some immediate and striking action was necessary toprevent the Arabs from taking the law into their own hands andto maintain the morale of the British soldiers and community inPalestine. To this end he made two recommendations. First, he proposed that a fine of, say,  500,000 should be imposed on theJewish community. This would involve legislation to freeze the assets in the banks of selected institutions, such as the JewishNational Fund and the Palestine Foundation Fund. Part of these assets would then be sequestrated or held as security for the duepayment of the fine. Secondly, he recommended an immediatestoppage of immigration. This would involve the immediate with-drawal of the quota and the diversion to other countries of anyfurther ships containing illegal immigrants.In discussion, there was general recognition of the arguments in favour of immediate action. It was felt, however, that any measures taken in respect of this latest outrage should, so far aspossible, be directed only to that section of the Jewish communitywhich had been responsible for it. It was proposed to put forwardwithin a few days positive proposals in regard to the future ofPalestine and it would be a mistake to take any step which, byaffecting other sections of the Jewish community than those responsible for the recent outrages, might prejudice the acceptanceof this new policy.The Cabinet did not, therefore, favour the High Commissioner^proposal that the funds of Jewish bodies should be sequestrated.Nor did they favour an immediate prohibition of all immigration.They considered that this latter proposal might have repercussions on the policy of the United States Government, would, cause hard-ship to innocent and suffering people and was hardly consistent with the announcement within a few days of a policy which wouldprovide (among other things) for the immigration of 100,000 jews in the fairly near future.On the other hand, they were strongly in favour of an intensive. search for terrorists if the scheme which the HighCommissioner and the General Officer Commanding were con-sidering proved to be practicable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the Cabinetthat there were enough troops in Palestine to cope with any troublescaused by the Jewish community as a result of such a search.
The Cabinet next considered whether there should simul-taneously be a search for arms.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the approxi-mate location of a number of the major arms dumps was known and that confiscation of these arms would not involve a searchthroughout the whole country.Ministers agreed that at some point action must be taken toobtain possession of these arms. Such action, if taken now, would follow up the advantage gained by the action taken at the end ofJune. On the other hand, it might prejudice the chances of securingacceptance of the new policy. The Jewish community were in apathological state of mind and we did not wish to provoke a generalconflagration.The Cabinet concluded that, if the military authorities werein favour of it, it would be well, at the same time as or soon afterthe measures to be taken against the terrorists, to secure any knowndumps of arms which might be used by the Irgun, while avoiding a widespread search throughout the whole Jewish community.They did not consider that such action should be taken before the debate to be held in the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet (8) Decided that the funds of Jewish bodies should not besequestrated and that there should not be an immediateprohibition of all immigration.(9) Agreed that, if practicable, there should be an intensivesearch for terrorists.(10) Agreed that, at the same time as or soon after themeasures to be taken against the terrorists, steps shouldbe taken to secure any known clumps of arms whichmight be used by the Irgun, though a widespread searchthroughout the whole Jewish community should be avoided.(11) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to convey to the High Commissioner for Palestine the decisionsset out in (8) to (10) above.3. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatduring the Committee Stage of the Civil Aviation Bill in theHouse of Lords the Minister of Civil Aviation had been urged toagree to the establishment of a separate Scottish Corporation. TheMinister had successfully resisted this proposal, but it seemed clearthat on the Report Stage the Opposition would press to a divisionan alternative suggestion that a Scottish subsidiary of the british european Airways Corporation should be established, which wouldbe responsible for running internal services in Scotland and forsuch other services as the parent Corporation might entrust to it.The Lord Chancellor and he were inclined to think that it wouldbe expedient to accept this suggestion, though the Minister of CivilAviation was opposed to it.The Secretary of State for Scotland urged the Cabinet to agreeto the establishment of a Scottish subsidiary. The proposals of theMinister of Civil Aviation for a Scottish Division of the Corpora-tion and a Scottish Advisory Committee would not, in his view,satisfy opinion in Scotland.In discussion it was pointed out that the concessions to Scottishopinion made by the Minister of Civil Aviation had satisfiedGovernment supporters in the House of Commons and that, bothon political grounds and on merits, there were strong objections toyielding on this matter. If the Government agreed to a Scottishsubsidiary company in the field of civil aviation they would haveno answer to demands for the setting up of separate Scottish bodies in the other spheres of economic activity which were to be nationalised.
The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Civil Aviation should resist any proposal to amend the Civil Aviation Bill so as toprovide for the establishment of a Scottish subsidiarycompany of the British European Airways Corporation.Germany. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignEesults of Secretary (CP. (46) 292) on the discussions about Germany at thethe Paris recent meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in ParisDiscussions.     and the resulting situation.(Previous The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Russians had refusedEeference: to agree to implement the basic provisions of the Berlin AgreementC.M.(46)68th regarding the treatment of Germany as an economic whole and theConclusions, equitable distribution of indigenous resources. He had made a minute 1.) declaration to the effect that, if it was impossible to obtain agree-ment on these subjects, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to reorganise the British Zone so as to relieve the burden on the British tax payer. The United States Secretary of State had subsequentlymade an offer to the effect that the American Zone would co-operate with any other Zone which was willing to do so in such a way asto form an economic unit out of the two or three Zones soco-operating. This offer had been repeated by the AmericanCommander-in-Chief at a meeting of the Allied Control Council,and there had also been informal conversations on the subjectbetween the British and American authorities in Germany. there could be no doubt that from the economic point of view there wouldbe great advantages in accepting the United States proposal and arranging for a merger of the two Zones for economic &quot;purposes.While we might not thereby be able to reduce the deficit in theBritish Zone so quickly as by action on our own account, we shouldultimately be able to reduce it much further; and he hoped that within a year our liability might be reduced from the present levelof  80 million a year to  25 million. We should also have theadvantage of supplies of timber and other goods from the AmericanZone and of American support in maintaining a minimum rationlevel of 1,500 calories in our Zone.The plan involved a departure from the agreement about the jlevel of German industry; but any plan for the rehabilitation of our own Zone would mean this, and we had always made it clearthat the agreement would have to be modified if Germany could notbe treated as an economic whole.Against the acceptance of the American proposal, there wasthe danger that we should thereby increase the tendency for europe to split into two parts. He felt, however, that the action proposed would not make matters worse than they were at present; and indeed decisive action on our part might have a salutary effect uponthe Russians. There would be nothing in the scheme to prevent theRussians and the French from joining the inter-zonal system as soonas they accepted the principle of treating Germany as an economicwhole, and paragraph 11 of the memorandum (Annex B to cp. (46) 292), which would be communicated to the three occupying powers, invited them to do so.The Foreign Secretary also recalled the continued refusal of theRussians to agree to the setting up in Germany of a disarmament commission which would examine whether any war material wasbeing produced in Germany. As Annex C to CP. (46) 292 showed,there was clear evidence that this was happening in the RussianZone and it was desirable that we should make use of our informa-ftion in the hope of getting the Russians either to change theirattitude, or at least to reduce the amount of production of warmaterial in their Zone. He accordingly recommended that weshould gradually allow some of the facts in our possession to bepublished and that sometime before the next meeting of the Council
of Foreign Ministers a formal statement of the evidence, with a renewal of the request for a Commission, should be made by theBritish Commander-in-Chief.The following points were made in discussion :  (a) The fact that the United States and the British Zones ofGermany would be treated as a single economic unit would not involve abandoning the proposals for the socialised control ofindustry in the British Zone.(b) It was important that in the detailed discussions with theUnited States authorities the staff of the Control Commission shouldhave the assistance of representatives of the Treasury, the Ministryof Fuel and Power and other Departments particularly concernedwith the economic aspects of the problem.(c) Great care would be required in the use of the evidence ofproduction of war material in the Russian Zone, in order not to disclose the sources from which the evidence was obtained.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to accept in principle the American offer that the United States and BritishZones in Germany should be treated as a single economic unit and agreed that a study of the means of putting-the proposed arrangements into practice should at once be undertaken with the United States authorities.(2) Agreed that a memorandum in the terms of Annex B to cp. (46) 292 should be communicated to the Russian,French and United States Governments.(3) Agreed that judicious publicity should be given to theevidence in our possession that war material was being produced in the Russian Zone.5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the joint memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor War (CP. (46) 2s5) on the relaxation of the ban on marriagesbetween British Servicemen and foreign women.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, when the banon fraternisation had been removed, he had agreed with general eisenhower that there should be no relaxation of the ban onmarriages between British Servicemen and German women, andthat during his own tenure of office of Commander-in-Chief inGermany he had adhered strictly to this agreement. Conditionsin Germany were likely to become increasingly difficult, and Germanwomen had a strong incentive to try to get British Servicemen tomarry them. Moreover, the men themselves were living in abnormalconditions and tended to lose their sense of proportion. In his view marriage should not be allowed unless the man concerned, afterreturning to this country, still desired to marry the German woman.In discussion it was pointed Out that it had already beenagreed that if a man, after his return to this country, wished tomarry a German woman, ho objection should be raised, unless on security grounds. Thus the suggestion made by the Chief of theImperial General Staff represented no relaxation of the existing rule.The Law Officers had advised that a marriage contracted in breach of the existing ban would be valid and there was therefore nosanction, except military punishment, against the man who defiedthe ban. In these circumstances; the maintenance of the ban was likely to encourage clandestine marriages and generally to under-mine discipline, particularly since no sanction, apart from dis-missal, could be applied to the staff of the Control Commission.Again, it seemed out of the question to refuse to relax the ban in special cases in order to legitimise children, and, if no more than this were done, the only, result would be to encourage men to anti-participate marriage. While, therefore, it was most desirable that everything possible should be done tb protect British Servicemeni- 4] c
against imprudent marriages with German women, the retentionof the existing ban did not appear to be an effective method of achieving this object. The transfer of families of British Service-men to Germany should make the situation easier, and local mili-tary commanders should do whatever they could by persuasion and advice. Thus, it might often be possible to get a man to agreeto postpone marriage until he had had a spell of leave at home.The Cabinet Agreed that local military commanders should beauthorised to relax the present ban on marriages between british Servicemen and foreign women, other thanJapanese, in cases where the reasons for marriage were good and there was no security objection.Rhodesia 6.   The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theRailways.        Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP. (46) 282) about the future of the RhodesiaRailways.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explained thatin 1943 the Southern Rhodesia Government had suggested that,together with the Governments of Northern Rhodesia and the bechuanaland Protectorate, they should obtain control of the rail-way system operated by the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, which wascontrolled by the British South Africa Company. It had beendecided that, as this proposal raised important financial andeconomic issues, Sir Harold Howitt should be appointed to enquire into it. His report, which had been published, had suggested thatthe question whether the equity of the Rhodesia Railways shouldbe acquired ought to be deferred for at least five years, pendingconsideration of certain difficult issues which he had raised. Theacquisition of the equity would not only call for a payment of  2-^ to 4 millions but would mean that the Governments concerned wouldhave to guarantee the  20 millions of debentures issued by theCompany, as well as spending from  6 to  9 millions on re-equip-ment. Moreover, there were difficulties in setting up an organisation to control a railway serving- three territories with very differentpolitical status, and the attitude of Southern Rhodesia to theemployment of coloured labour would raise extremely awkwardquestions. It was accordingly suggested that the right course wasto defer a decision about the acquisition of the railways for aperiod of ten years. This would remove the present uncertainty and enable a start to be made with the necessary renewals and improvements. If the Cabinet approved this policy it was proposedto send confidentially to the Southern Rhodesia Government thedraft statement annexed to CP. (46) 282 and to ask them whetherthey would agree that a communication in this sense should bemade to the British South Africa Company. A decision on thematter was urgently needed since the Portuguese Government had asked the directors of the British South Africa Company to discussthe future of the Beira Railway with them during the followingmonth.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the proposal had the support of the Governor of Northern Rhodesia and of hisLegislative Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he saw great diffi-culties in making an announcement in the sense proposed, par-ticularly at the present time. Most of the railways in the Empirewere already Government-owned and the United Kingdom Govern-ment were about to embark on the nationalisation of railways inthis country. While he did not wish to commit himself on thequestion of finance, he felt that the possibility of devising some alternative solution should be explored further before a communi-cation in the terms suggested was sent to the Southern rhodesia government.
Points in discussion, were : (a) Merely to give the British South Africa Company aguarantee that there would be no nationalisation for ten years washot likely to put them in a position to raise the necessary sum to pay off outstanding debentures and to provide fresh capital.(6) It should not be impossible to arrive at an understanding with the Company whereby in the event of nationalisation account would be taken of any expenditure incurred on necessary work ofrenewal and improvement in the period before a final decision onnationalisation was reachedThe Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to consider in the light of the discussionwhether some alternative method of handling the problemof the Rhodesia Railways could not ;be devised.7.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Health (CP. (46) 277)drawing attention to the effect on the housing pro-gramme of the shortage and high cost of timber;(ii) a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. (46) 291) showing what supplies of softwood were likely to be obtained in the period up to June, 1947;(iii) a memorandum by  the Chancellor of  the Duchy of lancaster (CP. (46) 294) reporting on the possibilityof exporting timber to the United Kingdom fromGermany and Austria.The Minister of Health said that, unless effective action could&apos;be taken to increase the available supplies of timber, the housing programme would inevitably be held up in 1947. Even as it was,housing plans were constantly having to be changed in order to economise in timber, with the result that progress was impeded. Hewas also much concerned about the rise in the price of timber,which since 1939 had added  104 to the cost of a house. For many months now he had been pressing for increased imports of timber from Germany, but, so far, results had been extremely disappointing.He hoped that everything possible would be done to obtainadditional supplies of timber from Russia, the Baltic States and scandinavia, and he urged that drastic steps should be taken toincrease supplies from Germany. He attached particular impor-tance to increasing the German output, since it could be exportedduring the winter.The President of the Board of Trade said that he hoped itwould be possible to obtain about 25,000 standards from Russiabefore October; but no further supplies could be expected from thatcountry until June 1947, and it was most unlikely that Russianexports would reach anything like their pre-war level in 1947.40,000 standards might be obtained from Finland if we could offerthem suitable iron and steel imports in return, and it might bepossible to increase exports from Sweden in return for coal from thiscountry. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had indicatedin his paper that Austria might send us 20,000 standards, and alimited supply might also be obtained from Roumania. Even atthe best, however, there would be an acute shortage of timber for for the next year or so, and all possible steps should be taken to economise in its use. Apart from the needs of the housing programme, timber was urgently required for the packing of exports.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that during his recent visit to Germany he had made a special study of the problemof increasing the export of timber and he was satisfied thatthe targets originally fixed for 1946 could not be achieved, let alone
surpassed, unless solutions could be found for certain difficulties.These were primarily the shortage of man-power, particularly inthe supervisory grades, and inadequate food; but there were other difficulties, such as the lack of vehicles for transporting timberbetween the forest and the railhead. He had ordered a specialinvestigation of methods of recruitment in Germany and he intendedto authorise the grant of special rations of food and cigarettes toforest workers. He also proposed that steps should be taken toobtain additional supervisory staffs, to repatriate German prisonersof war who had experience in forestry work, and to secure additionalvehicles to assist in transporting timber. He was not satisfied thatenough vigour had been put into the drive to obtain more Germantimber, and he attributed this partly to the lack of liaison betweenthe North German Timber Control and the Control Commission.Discussion concentrated mainly on the possibility of obtainingadditional supplies of timber from Germany. It was pointed outthat a considerable period had elapsed since instructions had beengiven that everything possible should be done to obtain the maximumsupplies from that country. In these circumstances it was disappointment -pointing that steps had not been taken at a much earlier date to overcome the difficulties with regard to recruitment of labour, foodrations and transport, and to pursue the other suggestions whichhad now been made in CP.
