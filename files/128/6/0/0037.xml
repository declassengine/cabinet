The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP.

This difficulty had been enhanced by the fact that different Departments had beennegotiating with different industries. There was also evidence that better results were obtained when joint negotiations were carriedon with both sides of an industry. He therefore proposed that theMinistry of Labour, through their Conciliation Department,should asume responsibility for negotiations with those industries where negotiations had not begun or had reached a deadlock.Where negotiations were already in train, he would settle with theMinister concerned whether they should continue in their existingchannels or should be taken over by the Ministry of Labour. Thefact that the negotiations with the coal-mining industry were in abeyance gave other industries a further excuse for obstruction;and he felt that, even though there was no assurance that resumeddiscussions with that industry would be successful, it would greatlystrengthen his hand in dealing with other industries if he could saythat these negotiations were in progress. He therefore proposedthat he should invite representatives of the National Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers to take part with him in joint discussions.The Lord Privy Seal said that these proposals had the supportof the Foreign Labour Committee.

(46) 421) recommending changes in the procedure for negotiating with industry on the admission of Poles to civil employment.The Minister of Labour said that one of the reasons why therepresentatives of particular industries were reluctant to agree tothe admission of Poles was that each industry feared that if itagreed it might receive more than its fair share. This difficulty^had been enhanced by the fact that different Departments had beennegotiating with different industries. There Avas also evidence that better results were obtained when joint negotiations were carriedon with both sides of an industry. He therefore proposed that theMinistry of Labour, through their Conciliation Department,should asume responsibility for negotiations with those industries where negotiations had not begun or had reached a deadlock.Where negotiations were already in train, he would settle with theMinister concerned whether they should continue in their existingchannels or should be taken over by the Ministry of Labour.

The Chancellor of theExchequer, as Chairman of the Polish Forces Committee, welcomed the proposals.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he saw no objectionto the proposal regarding the mining industry, though it should berealised that the National Union of Mineworkers were not likely to[32803-1] b 2
agree to the admission of Poles to the industry unless their demands for a five-day week and extended holidays with pay were granted.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that, while hewas in general agreement with the proposals in CP. (46) 421, hethought it would be unwise to attempt to carry on negotiations withFarmers&apos; and Workers&apos; Unions jointly.The Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Minister of Labour, as summarised in paragraph 4 of CP. (46) 421, for theconduct of negotiations with industry regarding the admission of Poles to civil employment.Palestine 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the forthcoming meetingConference.      of the Zionist Congress at Basle would not be completed before(Previous       23rd December;   and until a new Executive had been appointed atReference:       that Congress there would be no Jewish representatives who couldC.M.(46)9lst    speak with full authority on future policy in Palestine.   There was conclusions,     now some reason to hope that, after the new Executive had been minute 2.)      appointed, representatives of the Jews would be willing to join thePalestine   Conference.     In   these   circumstances   it   would   be convenient if the resumption of the Conference, now planned for16th December, could be postponed until after Christmas.    TheForeign Secretary had consulted in New York with some of theArab Delegates to the Conference, and it was possible that theywould take the initiative in proposing postponement on the groundthat the General Assembly of the United Nations was likely to lastlonger than had previously been expected.    In that event HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be able to announce that the resump-tion of the Conference had been postponed to meet the convenience of all parties to the Conference.In discussion it was pointed out that, while there seemed to beno alternative to postponing the resumption of the Conference, itwas unfortunate that there should be this further delay in seeking asettlement of the Palestine problem. The internal situation inPalestine was deteriorating, and the members of the british administration and Armed Forces there were subject to increasingstrain.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the circumstances noted above, it would be convenient if the resumption of the Palestine conference could be postponed until after Christmas.united nations.Procedureon security council.(previous reference:CM. (46) 27thConcl conclusions,Minute 5.)4. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to telegrams from new York (Nos. 1768-1770 of 18th November) describing theinitiative which the Foreign Secretary had taken in promoting a discussion in the Council of Foreign Ministers on the use of the vetoin the Security Council.There was general agreement with the approach which theForeign Secretary had made to this question; and it was suggestedthat, while the conduct of the negotiations must be left to his discretion, he might be informed that the Cabinet supported the line which he had so far taken.The Minister of State reported that the Cuban Delegation atthe General Assembly of the United Nations had put forward aresolution asking for a special conference to be held to discuss theuse of the veto. The United Kingdom Delegation would oppose this resolution, if it were pressed. The Australian Delegation had alsowished to raise this matter in the General Assembly, but it mightbe possible to persuade them that it could best be handled i&quot;discussions between the Governments represented on the Council ofForeign Ministers.
The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would inform theForeign Secretary that, while they wished to leave him with every latitude in conducting the negotiations, theCabinet endorsed the line which he had taken in the dis-cussions on the use of the veto in the Security Council.&apos;d 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister oftor     Food (CP. (46) 430) proposing a relaxation of the restrictionpreventing private individuals from sending gift food parcelsoverseas.The Minister of Food recalled that the Cabinet had beensympathetic to this proposal when they had considered it on 4th July, but had decided that it would be inopportune to put it intoeffect at that moment, when there was some criticism of the intro-duction of bread rationing. He now suggested that the time had come when the ban could be relaxed. He proposed that private individuals should be allowed to send overseas each month one pahcelcontaining only rationed food-stuffs. It was not possible for us tomake bulk diversions from our own supplies to relieve the food shortage in Germany and Austria; and public feeling in this country would be relieved if it were made possible for private individuals tosend food parcels to those countries. The scheme would, however,apply to all overseas countries. If the Cabinet approved his pro-posal in principle, the details could be worked out between theDepartments concerned.The Postmaster-General and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster supported the proposal. The Postmaster-General saidthat he would not ask that the introduction of the scheme should be postponed until after Christmas.The following points were made in discussion-(a) The scheme should extend to soap as well as rationedfood-stuffs.(p) Was it necessary to limit it to parcels addressed to particular individuals These might not be the persons in greatest need. Could not the scheme be extended to parcels sent through some recognised organisation, such as the Save Europe Now Fund,for the benefit, not of named individuals, but of those whose need was greatest?It was the view of the Cabinet that the scheme should cover both these classes of parcel.(c) The restrictions proposed in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 430coulcl not be enforced by the General Post Office without assistancefrom the local offices of the Ministry of Food.(d) To reduce the risk of theft of parcels in transit, it mightbe advisable that all parcels, whether or not addressed to indi-viduals, should be sent in bulk to the country of destination.(e) The Minister of Food, in announcing the scheme, shouldmake it clear that it applied to all overseas countries.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the ban on the sending of gift food parcelsoverseas should be relaxed so as to permit the sendingabroad of limited quantities of rationed foods.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to arrange for a detailed scheme to be worked out with the other Departmentsconcerned, in the light of the discussion; and authorised him to make an early announcement about the introduc-tion of the scheme.cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st November, 1946.
