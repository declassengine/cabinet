1. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, welcomed the members of the Cabinet Mission to India on their return tothis country, and conveyed to them the congTatulations of theCabinet on the great measure of success which they had achieved by the exercise of much patience and in the face of great difficulties.The Secretary of State for India, on behalf of the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the First Lord of the Admiralty and himself,expressed his thanks to the Cabinet. He then gave the cabinet a full account of the course of the Mission&apos;s discussions in India.The result of these discussions was that both Congress and the muslim League had accepted the long-term solution proposed bythe Mission in their statement issued on the 16th May (Cmd. 6821)but that it had not been possible to form an interim coalition government. The Viceroy proposed to resume negotiations on this latter point after a short interval, during which the elections forthe Constituent Assembly would be taking place. Meanwhile, hehad formed a temporary caretaker Government of officials.At the conclusion of his account of the Mission&apos;s work the .Secretary of State said that there were doubts how far the long-term solution would work. Much would depend on the attitudeof the leaders of the two main Parties. The Viceroy was inclined to be pessimistic about this, but he himself thought that both parties would try to work the plan.The President of the Board of Trade added that one of themost striking features of the present situation in India was thechange of temper among Indian politicians. While they were still very suspicious of one another, they now for the first time seemedto accept the sincerity of our efforts on India&apos;s behalf.As regards the prospects of forming an interim coalition government, the Secretary of State for India doubted whetherCongress could now be persuaded to enter a Government on thelines set out in the statement issued by the Cabinet Mission on the16th June. On the other hand, it was equally doubtful whetherthe Muslim League could be persuaded to enter a Government onany basis less favourable to them. The problem was thus a most difficult one, and it would be necessary for the Cabinet to considerit in more detail with a view to formulating guidance for theViceroy. It was most desirable to secure a coalition government during the interim period if it was at all possible to do so.The Secretary of State said that he proposed to publish as a white Paper the correspondence which had taken place with congress and the Muslim League since the 16th May.Questions were asked about the possibility of disturbances inIndia in the near future. At one point during the course of thenegotiations certain military dispositions had been made against this possibility. Was it necessary that they should still be continued ?The views of the Mission were that the feeling of insecuritywas much less now than, it had been a month ago, but that this improvement might not last if the Viceroy failed in his attemptto form a coalition Government.The Cabinet then discussed, in the light of the statement bythe Secretary of State for India, the procedure to be followed inParliament. Parliament would no doubt expect a statement fromMinisters, which, would necessarily be of some length, and theOpposition had also asked for a debate. It would be inconvenientto hold a full-scale debate at this stage, as statements might bemade which would make the task of the Viceroy more difficult; butit was recognised that Parliament would expect to have some oppor-tunity to comment on the Ministers&apos; statement. The risk of Iembarrassment would be reduced if the Prime Minister and members [of the Mission could see the leaders of the Opposition in bothHouses before the debate took place. In any event it would bebetter, from the point of view of the negotiations in India, thai,the debate should take place soon rather than at the end. of July.India.(previous reference:CM. (46) 59thConclusions,Minute 3.)
The Cabinet-(1) Recorded their warm appreciation of the services of theSecretary of State for India, the President of the Boardof Trade and the First Lord of the Admiralty, as members of the Cabinet Mission to India.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for India to arrange forthe presentation of a White Paper containing the correspondence with Congress and the Muslim Leaguesince the 16th May.(3) Agreed that it would be necessary to arrange for a debate on India to be held in the House of Commons, andpossibly in the House of Lords, before the summer recess; and that it would be preferable that such debatesshould take place in the near future rather than at theend of July.(4) Took note that, in the first instance, the Prime Ministerand the members of the Mission would discuss theposition informally with leaders of the Opposition in both Houses.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for India to submit to theCabinet a memorandum on the guidance to be given tothe Viceroy as to the lines he might follow when herenewed his negotiations for the formation of an interimcoalition Government.(6) Took note that the question of maintaining special military dispositions to meet possible disturbances m India wouldbe further considered at the meeting of the DefenceCommittee to be held that afternoon.united nations.Admissionof Eire.(previous reference:CM. (46) 15thConclusions,Minute 11.)2. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reminded theCabinet of the policy which the Ministers most directly concerned had agreed to follow in respect of any application by the eire government for membership of the United Nations. Under thispolicy, which was described in CP. (46) 164, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were to take no initiative in the matter, but would supportEire&apos;s claim to membership of the United Nations if it were putforward, either by the Eire Government or otherwise.The Secretary of State said that there were now indications that the United States Government were disposed to favour the admission of Eire to the United Nations. It was undesirable thatthey should anticipate His Majesty&apos;s Government in encouraging-Eire to apply for membership. In these circumstances he sought the authority of the Cabinet to inform the Eire Government, throughthe High Commissioner in Dublin, that if they applied for member-ship of the United Nations His Majesty&apos;s Government would support their application.The Home Secretary said that the Government of NorthernIreland would be apprehensive that lure, if admitted to the united nations, would raise there the issue of Partition. He did not onthat account oppose the course suggested by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs; but he would wish to inform the NorthernIreland Government of the communication which was to be madeto the Government of Eire.The Minister of State said, that the Foreign Office were inagreement with the views expressed by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.The Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toarrange for the Government of Eire to be informed that,if they applied for membership of the United Nations, HasMajesty&apos;s Government would support their application.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.5th July, 1946.
