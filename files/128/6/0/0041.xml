1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.On 9th December the Committee Stage of the Exchange ControlBill would be concluded, and the financial resolution of the Cotton(Centralised Buying) Bill would be taken.On 10th December the Second Reading of the National health service (Scotland) Bill would be taken.On 11th December there would be a debate on a Motion to approve the Licence of the British Broadcasting Corporation. the assistant Postmaster-General would open the debate; and the lord president would be in attendance and could speak if required.Further progress would also be made with the Pensions (Increase)Bill, the Trustee Savings Banks Bill and the Greenwich HospitalBill.Business for 12th and 13th December had not been settled andwould have to be announced later.The Cabinet discussed what business might be taken on thesetwo days. It was agreed that no debate on Germany should beheld until after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return from the UnitedStates. It might become necessary to hold a debate on India, or onthe issues arising from the action of certain local authorities in seeking to apply the principle of the Closed Shop to all localauthority employment. It would, however, be preferable if thesedays could be devoted to legislative business. It was possible thatthe Opposition would agree that the Second Reading of the Houseof Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Bill might be taken at theend of the following week. The Statistics of Trade Bill might alsobe taken, if the Opposition were content that the Second reading debate should be held within a week of the publication of the Bill.2. The Secretary of State for Burma said that the GovernorsExecutive Council in Burma were pressing for further constitu-tional reforms, and it was desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould give some earnest of their desire to see progress made assoon as the elections had been held in the spring of 1947. With theapproval of the India and Burma Committee, he had asked theGovernor to ascertain whether his Executive Council would accept an invitation to send a delegation of four or five members to thiscountry for discussions with Ministers; and he had now learned that such an invitation would be accepted. He therefore sought the cabinet&apos;s authority for the invitation to be given and announced.The delegation would arrive in this country early in January.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Executive Council of Burma should beinvited to send a delegation to this country early inJanuary to discuss the next steps in the constitutional progress of Burma.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Burma would arrange for a public announcement to be made as soonas the invitation had been accepted.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(OP. (46) 441) covering a draft of a statement which the Ministerof Food proposed to make in the House of Commons regarding theextent to which the supply of food-stuffs to the United Kingdom hadbeen interrupted by industrial disputes in the United States andthe Argentine. The purpose of this statement was to warnParliament and the public that food shortages might develop in thiscountry during the coming months, as a result of the dislocationcaused by these disputes.In discussion reference was made to the Prime Minister&apos;sproposals for reducing the time occupied by Ministerial statements-1] B 2
after Questions (CM. (46) 101st Conclusions, Minute 1, and cp. (46) 440), and the view was expressed that there would be advantages in accustoming Parliament to a practice by whichannouncements arising from the industrial and commercialactivities of the Government were ordinarily made outsideParliament. The Cabinet agreed, however, that this particularstatement about the food situation was of such political importance that it ought to be made in Parliament.In reply to questions the Minister of Food said that the text of the statement had been discussed with His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington and with the United States Secretary for agriculture and incorporated amendments suggested by them.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Food to make in the House ofCommons a statement on the food situation in the termsof the draft annexed to CP. (46) 441.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries (CP. (46) 435) covering a draftAgriculture Bill designed to give effect to the agricultural policy announced in Parliament on 15th November, 1945.The Minister of A griculture said that from the consultations which he had held with representatives of agriculture and other interested parties he was satisfied that the broad principles of theBill would command general support. Some of its particularprovisions would, however, excite opposition. Thus, the CentralLandowners&apos; Association objected to the provisions giving securityof tenure to farmers and authorising the acquisition of land by theMinister; but these were necessary to give effect to government policy. There would also be criticism of the wide powers conferred by Clause 4, which enabled existing Acts to be modified or over-ridden by Ministerial order; but powers of this kind were essentialpending the working out of detailed plans for the marketing of theagricultural products covered by Part I of the Bill.Points in discussion were : (a) In reply to comments on Part IV of the Bill, the Ministerof A griculture said that he fully recognised that it was undesirable to encourage the provision of uneconomic smallholdings. His object would be to provide smallholdings of a reasonable size for personswho had both the experience and the capital to work themsuccessfully.(&amp;) The Minister of A griculture said that he had been pressed by the workers&apos; Unions to provide that there should be threenominated representatives of workers on county agriculturalexecutive committees; but he was satisfied that the workers&apos; interestin these committees did not justify more than two representativesas against three of farmers. It would be inexpedient to seek to evade this issue by omitting to specify in the Bill the numbers ofnominated representatives of each interest.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that any proposal togive the workers equal representation would be embarrassing to him,since he had agreed with the Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union thatthey would be content with one representative.(c) The Minister of Agriculture said that the power conferred on the Minister by Clause 86 to sell land which he had acquired wasnecessary to enable him to dispose of land needed for housing,factories or road works or small parcels of land which in themselves would have no value but could usefully be added to neighbouringfarms. The Clause would be amended to make it clear that thepower would be used only where the sale of the land would be inthe national interest.AgricultureBill.(previous reference:CM. (45) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)
(d) The Minister of A gricidture undertook to consider whetherClause 30 should be so amended as to provide some sanction againsta landlord who, having secured consent to the service of a notice toTquit on the ground that he or his dependants wished to farm the holding, subsequently let the holding to another tenant.(e) The Home Secretary explained that Part I and Clause 73of the Bill applied to Northern Ireland. The Government ofNorthern Ireland intended to introduce legislation corresponding tothe other provisions of the Bill.The Cabinet-Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) above,approved the draft Agriculture Bill annexed to cp. (46) 435, and invited the Minister of Agriculture tosubmit it to the Legislation Committee with a view to its being introduced and published before the christmas recess.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (46) 439) on future policy in Malaya submitted by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs on behalf of the Colonial Affairs Committee.On 3rd September, 1945 (CM. (45) 27th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Cabinet had approved a policy for creating an effectiveconstitutional union in Malaya with a common citizenship open toall who had adopted Malaya as their true home. The proposals to implement this policy had, however, aroused strong oppositionamong Malays and discussions had, therefore, taken place withMalay representatives to see how these proposals could be modified to meet their views. The modifications proposed as a result of these discussions were set out in a memorandum annexed to CP. (46) 439.The Cabinet&apos;s conditional approval was sought before they were discussed with the other communities in Malaya.The revised proposals provided for a &apos;&apos; Federation of Malaya &apos;&apos;instead of a &quot; Malayan Union,&quot; since the Malays objected to thelatter term. The Federation would be under a High Commissionerwith Executive and Legislative Councils, which would have powersthroughout Malaya on all major subjects. The nine States and thetwo Settlements of Penang and Malacca would retain their separateexistence and would have separate Executive and legislative councils with limited powers. There would also be a centralConference of Rulers. Provision was to be made which would, ineffect, assure to His Majesty jurisdiction throughout Malaya,though in form the powers would not be so comprehensive as underthe earlier proposals. The citizenship provisions would permitpractically all Malays and a number of Chinese and Indians whohad made Malaya their home to become citizens of the Federationof Malaya.After further discussion with the Malay representatives ofcertain points indicated in paragraph 12 of the memorandum, itwas proposed that a statement should be made in the House ofCommons on the lines indicated in paragraph 13.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed theCabinet that the revised proposals had been approved by theColonial Affairs Committee.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals for the future Constitution of malaya as set out in the memorandum annexed to cp. (46) 439; and invited the Secretary of State for theColonies to proceed as proposed in paragraphs 12 and 13of that memorandum.
6. On 26th November the Prime Minister had made a state-ment in Parliament explaining why it had become necessary toretard the rate of release from the Armed Forces under the demobilisation scheme. He had also made a broadcast on the subject on the same day.The Minister of Labour said that there was evidence that, inspite of these statements, there was still widespread misunder-standing of the position among men and women in the armed forces.The Minister without Portfolio said that, if the Minister ofLabour would let him have this evidence, he would take the matter up with the Service Departments and see that more effective steps were taken to make the text of the Prime Minister&apos;s statementgenerally available to men and women in the Armed Forces.Parliamentary 7.   The President of the Board of Trade called attention to theLabour Party,   fact that the contents of a report by a Committee of the Parlia-Eeports of      mentary Labour Party which had made a study of the cinema to-Committees.     graph industry had been published in the Press before, they had beenmade known to him or to his Department.    Other Ministersmentioned other occasions on which there had been premature disclosure of the contents of such reports.The Prime Minister said that the purpose of these Committeeswas to enable Ministers to be made aware of the views held by government supporters on particular subjects, and their reports should in the first instance be submitted in confidence to the minister concerned.The Lord President undertook to arrange that the Chairmanof these Committees should be informed of the need for avoidingpremature publication of the contents of their reports.Man-Power.Hate ofDemobilisa-tion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th December, 1946.
