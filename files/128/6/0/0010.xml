Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (46) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the Cabinet thelatest information about the explosion which had occurred on theprevious day in the Headquarters of the Government secretariat and Army Command in the King David Hotel, Jerusalem.It appeared that a lorry had been driven up to the tradesmen&apos;sentrance of the hotel; and that the occupants, after holding up thestaff at the pistol point, had entered the kitchen premises carrying a number of milk cans. They had shot and seriously wounded aBritish soldier who had challenged them; and, after placing bombs in the basement of the building, had made good their escape. the subsequent explosion had destroyed a substantial part of thebuilding. The casualties so far reported were 41 killed, 52 missing and 53 injured.The Officer Administering the Government in the absence ofthe High Commissioner had reported that a large proportion ofhis staff were dead, missing or wounded, and that this created a situation which could be handled only if drastic action were takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government. He had consulted his ExecutiveCouncil and the General Officer Commanding the troops inPalestine, and they were agreed that only two alternative courses&apos; were open. The first was to institute widespread searches for armswith a view to breaking up the Jewish resistance movement. This,in their view, would create conditions tantamount to a state of warin Palestine. The second alternative was for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to announce a final solution of the political problem. This wasthe alternative which they preferred. In view of this latest out-rage, further negotiations with the Jews seemed to be impossible;and the best course would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government toimpose their own solution of the political problem.The Prime Minister said that, although there was evidence thatthe Hagana had been implicated in some of the earlier acts of violence, there was no reason to believe that any but the mostextreme advocates of violence were involved in this latest outrage.Our earlier action against Jewish illegal organisations had hadthe effect of strengthening the influence of the more moderateJewish leaders in Palestine; and it would be a mistake to rush intoa widespread search for arms, which would be taken as a measuredirected against all the Jews in Palestine, before we had any evidence to show who had been responsible for this latest outrage.Such action might have the effect of alienating all sections of jewish opinion in Palestine. On the other hand, he thought itwould equally be a mistake for His Majesty&apos;s Government to takea sudden decision on the political problem, before the consultations with the United States Government had been completed. In his view the fight course Avas to press on with the Anglo-Americanconversations and to seek an early agreement with the UnitedStates Government on a long-term policy. If such an agreement could be reached, we should announce our joint policy and try torally the support of world opinion in favour of its adoption.The Foreign Secretary said that he also attached importanceto securing an early declaration by the United States Governmentcondemning this recent outrage. He had already&apos; suggested thatsuch a declaration should be made and he hoped that it might bemade very shortly.In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by the Prime Minister. In particular, the cabinet agreed that it would be a mistake to break off the discussions withthe United States Government. These discussions were going very well and it seemed probable that agreed conclusions on the general principles of a settlement could be formulated by the following day. The United States Delegation hoped to be able to obtain theapproval of their Government to these agreed conclusions by theend of the week; if not, it should be possible for the foreign secretary very shortly afterwards to discuss them with the UnitedStates Secretary of State in Paris and to obtain agreement on them
there. It had previously been the intention that the results of thediscussions with the United States Delegation should not bepublished before the proposed conference with Arab and jewish representatives. In the altered circumstances, however andparticularly now that statements had appeared in the Press whichforeshadowed part of the conclusions-the Cabinet felt that itwould be advisable that they should be published as soon as possible.They must first be conveyed to the Arab Governments and to therepresentatives of the Jews, but it might be possible for this tobe done in time for an announcement to be made before or duringthe debate which was to take place before the Summer Recess.The Cabinet discussed whether the White Paper regardingthe complicity of the Jewish Agency in terrorist acts should bepublished on the following day. It was argued that its publicationnow would associate the Agency with the latest outrage, with which,in all probability, they had not in fact been concerned. On theother hand, the Prime Minister was pledged to produce the white paper, and if it were postponed until the following week its publication simultaneously with the announcement of a long-term policy would be even more undesirable. The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was therefore that the White Paper should be published as arranged.On the question of a wholesale search for arms in Palestine,the Cabinet noted that the High Commissioner, the Chief secretary and the General Officer Commanding were not in favour of such acourse and considered that it would lead to conditions tantamount to a state of war. It was also argued that it would be directed against the Hagana rather than the dissident groups, namely, theIrgun Zwei Leumi and the Stern groups, who were probablyresponsible for the latest outrage, and would probably not lead tothe capture of those responsible for the outrage or even to the discovery of the arms and explosives used by their organisations.At the same time it would drive the Havana into closer association with them. Was it not more important to lead the Hagana away from extremist measures and to convince them that it would beto their own interest to root out the dissidents altogether ? It wasonly if they could be persuaded to this view that there was anysubstantial chance of preventing a recurrence of the outrages.On the other hand, it was also argued that the Hagana had themselves been responsible for some outrages and that at somepoint their disarmament would be necessary. Was not this themoment to carry it out?The Chief of the Air Staff said that he was not convincedthat the search for arms would necessarily lead to open war. Theoperations in the previous month, when a large cache of arms hadbeen found, had been very successfully concluded with hardly anycasualties. Even if the search brought the Hagana into armedrebellion, the military forces in Palestine, with appropriate rein-forcements from elsewhere in the Middle East, could deal with thesituation provided that it did not lead to trouble elsewhere in theMiddle East.The Cabinet inclined to the view that in the circumstances the balance of advantage lay in not carrying out a wholesale search for arms at the moment, but they felt that it would be well thatthe contrary view should be put once more to the High commissioner and the General Officer Commanding in Palestine, and that their considered opinion should be obtained.Whatever the decision on this point, there must be no room for the suggestion that the Government were giving way to violence.The House of Commons were bound to take a most serious view ofan incident which had led to so many casualties. A Question wasin fact being- put to the Prime Minister on the subject that after-noon. The Cabinet discussed and agreed the general lines of the reply which should be given to this Question.During this discussion the suggestion was made that the reply should include an appeal to the more moderate elements among the
Jewish population of Palestine to stamp out the dissident organisa-tions. In favour of this suggestion it was argued that only withJewish help was there a reasonable chance of successfully dealingwith these groups. The Cabinet felt, however, that this was notthe moment to place ourselves under any obligation to Jewishorganisations in Palestine.The following further points were raised : *(a) We must not forget the background from which the jewish community of Palestine was drawn. The conditions under whichthey had lived in Europe and the sense of frustration from whichthey still suffered had created in them a pathological state of mind.Nevertheless it would be the greatest mistake to lead them to believethat terrorism provided a short cut to the achievement of theiraims.(6) The fact that it had been possible for terrorists to enter the lower floors of the building in which the Secretariat and the headquarters of the troops were situated seemed to imply that adequate security precautions had not been taken. Enquiry intothis matter should be made forthwith.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the discussions with the United States Dele-gation should continue.(2) Agreed that, as soon as conclusions had been agreed withthe United States Delegation and accepted by the UnitedStates Government, they should first be communicatedto the Arab Governments and to representative Jews asa basis for discussion at the forthcoming conference,and should, if possible, then be published either before or during the debate in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.(3) Agreed that the White Paper regarding the complicity ofthe Jewish Agency in terrorist acts should be published on the following day.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to convey to the High Commissioner for Palestine the substance of the discussion on the question whether there shouldbe a wholesale search for arms, and to ask him to submithis considered recommendations on the matter after discussion with the General Officer Commanding inPalestine.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in associa-tion with the Service authorities, to institute an enquiry into the security precautions which had been and werebeing taken for the protection of vital government buildings in Palestine.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd July, 1946.
