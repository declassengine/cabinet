Repatriation 1.   At their meeting on the 4th September the Cabinet had of Prisoners invited the Lord Privy Seal, with the Parliamentary Under-of War. Secretary of State for War and the Parliamentary Secretary,(Previous Ministry of Labour, to superintend the preparation of a&apos; schemeReference: for the progressive repatriation of German prisoners of war. TheyCM. (46)79th had also invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for conclusions, War to consider what further incentives to good work could be minute 1.)      provided for prisoners remaining in this country.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP. (46) 342) covering an outline scheme of repatria-tion, a report by a Committee of officials on the question of furtherincentives, and the draft of a public announcement.The Lord Privy Seal recalled that the Cabinet had intended that under the scheme prisoners should be able to volunteer for continued employment in this country on modified terms. Onlooking into this he and his colleagues had felt that there would be difficulty in retaining prisoners on terms so modified that they hadto be separately housed from other prisoners. Moreover, the retention-tion of volunteers would cause no immediate net gain in the numbersavailable for work in this country, as others would be repatriated&apos;in their place. Accordingly, while their scheme provided that prisoners should be permitted to defer repatriation at their ownrequest for periods of six months at a time, it did not provide anyspecial inducements to them to do so.As regards the incentives to be given to prisoners for goodwork, he called attention to the proposal made in Annex II to cp. (46) 342 for a &quot;good work output bonus.&quot; He suggestedthat this might be so arranged as to amount to 50 per cent, of present earnings; these might vary between 6s. and 10s. a week.He and his colleagues also considered it important that pro-vision should be made to enable prisoners to remit money to relativesin Germany and to be assured that any credit balances accumulatedhere would be available to them in the form of reichsmarks whenthey were repatriated. For this purpose it was necessary to fix separately of exchange into reichsmarks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was ready toagree to the proposals before the Cabinet on the understanding thatthe additional payments made to prisoners would not be availableto them for spending in this country. He agreed that there shouldbe facilities for remitting money to relatives in Germany and forthe transfer of credit balances on repatriation. He thought thatthe rate of exchange should be in the neighbourhood of 15 reichs-marks to the  1.The Cabinet considered that, with a rate of exchange at this level, it would be necessary to enable prisoners to earn ratherlarger sterling sums; and they agreed that the bonus scheme shouldbe so arranged as to bring the total earnings of a good worker upto about 15s. a week.Various amendments to the draft announcement were suggested and agreed. The Prime Minister undertook to arrange for it to beissued forthwith.Other points made in discussion were :-(a) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries asked that the longest possible notice should be given to farmers before prisonersboarded, out with them were withdrawn for repatriation. TheParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War undertook thatthis should be done.(b) While it would be preferable not to state precisely thenumber of prisoners expected to be available to agriculture for the1947 harvest, an indication could be given to responsible agri-cultural organisations that the needs of agriculture during thatharvest had been kept in mind in drawing up the scheme.
((?) The Home Secretary asked that the Home Office should be consulted about any relaxation of, restrictions on the personalfreedom of prisoners.The Cabinet (1) Approved the repatriation scheme outlined in Annex I toOP. (46) 342.(2) Approved the recommendations for further incentives togood work set out in paragraph 19 of Annex II to cp. (46) 342, on the understanding that additional payments to prisoners would not be available to themfor spending in this country, that they should be allowedto transfer to relatives in Germany up to 5s. a week,and that the balance of any additional sums earned bythem should be placed to their credit for handing overto them in reichsmarks on repatriation.(3) Agreed that the &quot; good work output bonus &quot; scheme out-lined in Annex II of OP. (46) 342 should be so arranged as to bring the total earnings of a good worker up toabout 15s. a week.(4) Approved the draft announcement in Annex III, as modi-ned in discussion, and took note that the Prime minister would arrange for it to be issued forthwith.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (OP. (46) 337) suggesting the substitution ofcupro-nickel for silver in the United Kingdom coinage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that there was a world shortage of silver and it had become very expensive. Thesilver coinage had never been more than a token coinage; the valueof silver in a shilling, which before the war had been about a penny,was now over twopence. We had obtained during the war 88million fine ounces of silver from the United States on lease-lendterms, which included an undertaking to repay within five years ofa declaration by the President that the emergency was over. Wehad also guaranteed repayment of 226 million fine ounces acquired by the Government of India with a similar undertaking. TheChancellor hoped that in fact the Government of India wouldbe able to meet their obligation or the greater part of it. Towardsrepayment of our own obligation we had in this country 8^ millionounces in the form of bullion, &amp;c. The coinage contained some 200million ounces and the substitution of cupro-nickel coinage wouldprovide the silver to enable us to discharge our obligation to theUnited States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfiedthat a cupro-nickel coinage, which would cost only one-fortieth ofthe same weight of silver, would be satisfactory in appearance and use. The safeguards against forgery could be as complete as forsilver coinage.The following points were made in discussion :  (a) The change would require legislation. The Lord privy seal said that it would be preferable that this should be introduced during the current Session as soon as possible after the Recess,rather than in the next Session.(b) The new currency would be introduced gradually over aperiod of years.(c) Under the present proposals, the Government would cease to buy silver, and it would in future be bought by private tradersin the same manner as other commodities. It would be necessaryfor the Board of Trade to consider the terms on which importlicences should be given. Confidential discussions on this point could be opened at once with leaders of the bullion market.
Squatters.(previous reference:CM. (46) 80thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. ,The Cabinet were given the latest information about theactivities of squattersMinisters considered that further steps should be taken tobring it home to the public that the squatters were overriding theclaims of many people who had been waiting, a long time for houses,and that the effect of their activities would be to delay thecompletion of the re-housing programme.There was risk of these activities spreading throughout thecountry. It was therefore desirable that a strong circular shouldbe sent to local authorities by the Ministry of Health and theDepartment of Health for Scotland warning them of this possibilityand advising them in particular not to provide facilities to anysquatters who obtained possession of buildings. Full publicity should be given to the terms of this circular.The Minister of Health undertook to arrange, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland, for circulars on these lines to be issued.The Prime Minister said that he had received a report from the attorney-General on the legal position. He would arrange for this to be circulated to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of the position and of the points raised in thediscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th September, 1946.(d) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he would consider in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerwhether parallel action might not be taken in certain parts of theColonial Empire.The Cabinets-(1) Agreed that cupro-nickel should be gradually substitutedfor silver in the United Kingdom coinage.(2) Agreed that the necessary legislation for this purpose should be introduced immediately after the Recess.(3) Agreed that there should be no further Governmentpurchase of silver for coinage.
