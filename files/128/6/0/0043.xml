1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet that it had been-thought advisable to meet the request of the Opposition for animmediate debate on India. This would be held on 12th and13th December. The Government spokesmen would be the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister without Portfolio. It was hoped that this debate would be concluded in time to allow theSecond Reading of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)Bill to be taken on 13th December. Its remaining stages could thenbe taken in the course of the following week.The business proposed for the following week was : 16th-18th December : Second Reading of the Transport bill and Committee Stage of the Financial Resolution. The openingspeeches on the three days of this debate would be made by theMinister of Transport, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport. The lord president would reply to the debate. The Chancellor of theExchequer, in his speech on the second day, would explain the com-pensation clauses of the Bill; and it was hoped by this means to avoid any lengthy debate on the Financial Resolution.19th December: Report Stage and Third Reading of theExchange Control Bill.On 20th December, Parliament would be adjourned until21st January, 1947.2. The Cabinet had before them telegrams which had passed between the Control Office for Germany and Austria and the control commission in Berlin (Sugra 772 and Argus 728 and 731) and atelegram from the Foreign Secretary (Washington No. 7012) on themeans of giving effect to the Cabinet&apos;s decision that the custody ofthe principal industries of the Ruhr should be transferred to german custodians.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that, in their discussion on 19th November, the Cabinet had considered that a minister should go out to Germany to consult with the land governments about the selection of the custodians and should submithis recommendations for the Cabinets approval. On reflection, he doubted whether the time was yet ripe for a, Minister to open formalconsultations with the Germans on this matter. There were various points on which the Governments policy had not been preciselydetermined, e.g., whether socialisation was to be restricted to industries within the North Rhine-Westjohalia Land, and whetherownership of the socialised industries would ultimately be vested inthe Land Government or in a central German Government. Itwould, in his view, be preferable that these and other related points should first be explored in discussions with British officials inGermany before any formal approach was made to the Land Govern-ments. The view which he had formed on this point was reinforced by what had since been said in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s telegramNo. 7012 of 8th December.In discussion there was general support for the view that itwould be premature to open formal consultations with the land governments about the choice of custodians until the details of the socialisation scheme had been further defined. At the same time, itwas important that we should make further progress with oursocialisation plan before we became too deeply involved in Anglo-American machinery for fusing the economies of the British and united States Zones of Germany. It had already been publiclystated that we intended to pursue our policy for socialising the ruhr industries, notwithstanding the agreement for the economic fusionof the two Zones, and it was desirable that we should also annouce our intention of appointing custodians as the next practical step in giving effect to that policy. With this in view, it was agreed that anannouncement should be made through the Press that the Chancellor9-1] b 2
of the Duchy of Lancaster was visiting Germany for the purpose of discussing with his officials there means of transferring the custody of the Ruhr industries to German custodians, as a first stage in the socialisation of those industries. No formal communication need be made to the United States Government about our intention toproceed with the appointment of custodians; but a copy of the press notice could be sent in advance of publication to the United states authorities in Germany.In further discussion some comment was made on the inferencein the telegrams that the policy of socialisation was to be confined to the&apos; North Rhine-Westphalia Land. It was pointed out that,while the Cabinet had approved proposals for the socialisation ofthe principal industries within that Land, it was not to be assumed that the Cabinet had decided not to socialise any industries or partsof industries located outside that Land. There were arguments infavour of socialising the principal industries throughout the british zone of Germany. Further proposals on this point should besubmitted to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet (1) A.greed that, before any formal approach was made to land governments about the selection of German custodiansfor the Ruhr industries, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should first discuss with British officials inGermany detailed plans for giving effect to the policy ofsocialising those industries and should submit to theCabinet his detailed proposals, together with his recom-mendations regarding the choice of custodians;(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toarrange that a public announcement should be made through the Press that he was visiting Germany forthis purpose; and that a copy of this announcement should be sent, in advance of publication, to the UnitedStates authorities in Germany.Burma. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Sec reConstitutional tary of State for Burma (CP. (46) 452) regarding the proposal that position. the Executive Council of Burma should be invited to send a(Previous        delegation to London.Reference: The Secretary of State for Burma said that, after discussionCM.(46) 104th with the Prime Minister, he doubted whether it would be profitableConclusions, to communicate to the Executive Council and to Aung San a stateMinute 4.) ment on the lines which had been suggested in the cabinet discussion on 10th December. In his view, the alternatives were either to say that we were not prepared to give, in advance of thediscussions in London, the assurances for which Aung San had asked; or to give an affirmative answer on the lines which he had originally proposed in CP. (46) 448. It seemed desirable that before deciding between these alternatives, the Cabinet should havethe advice of the Governor; and he proposed that this should besought by sending a telegram in the terms of the draft annexed to OP. (46) 452.The Prime Minister first invited the Chiefs of Staff to say what troops would be available to deal with any disorder whichmight break out in BuTma.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff recalled that, in orderto assist the demobilisation scheme, it had been decided to dispersethe division held in Malaya and to accept an element of risk inSouth-East Asia: If, therefore, widespread disorder broke outthroughout Burma, British troops could not now be made availableto deal with the situation without retarding the demobilisationscheme. The most that could be done, without affecting that scheme,would be to send three battalions of infantry from Singapor
These could reach Rangoon in three weeks&apos; time. Their removal from Singapore would involve accepting some risk in Hong Kong;but it would probably be justifiable to take that risk.The Cabinet were also informed that transport and bomber aircraft could be provided in support of the ground forces; andthat a cruiser could quickly reach Rangoon. The Cabinet agreedthat it would suffice if one cruiser were within three days&apos; steamingof Rangoon.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there were no indications that the GOO Burma expected serious disorder in burma or required reinforcements. He would ask for a militaryappreciation of the situation to be submitted at once.The Cabinet then considered the draft telegram annexed to cp. (46) 452. Various amendments were proposed. In particular,it was agreed that no reference should be made to the possibilityof financial concessions to the Government of Burma. Nor shouldany suggestion be made that responsible government would be handed over to the Anti-Fascist People&apos;s Freedom League(A.F.P.F.L.), who had no electoral mandate. Emphasis should belaid on the fact that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government were readyto discuss with the Delegation every aspect of the future constitu-tion of Burma, they were not prepared to give binding assurancesin advance of those discussions.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Burma to despatch atelegram to the Governor of Burma on the lines of thedraft annexed to CP. (46) 452 amended to take accountof the points made in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Took note that the Chief of the Imperial General staff would obtain from the G.O.C, Burma, an appreciation of the possibility of serious disorder in Burma and the likelihood of his needing reinforcements.In the light of the discussion recorded above, the Secretaryof State for Burma asked what reply should be returned to a parliamentary Question suggesting that a delegation of Membersof Parliament should visit Burma.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that, if this Question had to be answered, the reply should be to the effect that the despatch of a Parlia-mentary Delegation to Burma was not considered desirable at the present stage. It should not be implied that the possibility of sending such a delegation laterwas excluded.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(CP. (46) 450) covering (i) a telegram from the Foreign Secretaryasking whether the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt couldnot be expedited and (ii) a minute setting out the views of the Chiefsof Staff on this matter.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the evacuationwas proceeding in accordance with the prescribed programme. one division was about to move from Egypt to Palestine; and. when that had gone, the British Forces remaining in Egypt would consistalmost entirely of administrative troops. The total number of these would have been reduced, by 1st April, 1947, to 32,000.In discussion, the Cabinet were informed that the number ofprisoners of war in Egypt would bereduced by 2?500 a month up toJune 1947 and thereafter by 5,000 a month. They were used in con-structing accommodation and providing; other services for British
Town andCountryPlanningBill.(previous reference:CM. (46) 76thConclusions,Minute 2.)troops.   If fewer prisoners were used for these purposes, it would befnecessary either to retard the rate of withdrawal of British troopsor to make greater use of local labour at increased cost.Reference was also made to the cost of maintaining and;guarding dumps of surplus stores in Egypt.   It was suggested thatthe Treasury should consider whether it would not be cheaper, on balance, to accept lower prices for these, on a quick sale.The Cabinet-Took note of the information given on behalf of the Chiefs jof Staff in the discussion and in the minute annexed to c.p.. (46) 450.5. The Cabinet had before them -(i) a memorandum by the Minister of Town and country planning (CP. (46) 432) covering a draft of the Townand Country Planning Bill;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Health (CP. (46) 437)suggesting certain changes in the procedure proposed forsanctioning proposals for the development or acquisitionof land;(iii) A memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (CP. (46) 454)proposing an alternative scheme for compensation for lossof development value; and &apos;(iv) a memorandum by the Lord President (CP. (46) 451)summarising the conclusions reached by the Compensa-tion and Betterment Sub-Committee of the lord presidents Committee after examining CP. (46) 432,CP. (46) 437 and CP. (46) 454.Discussion centred on the alternative schemes for compensationfor loss of development value set out in Part IV of the draft Bill andin the annex to CP. (46) 454.The Minister of Town and Country Planning recalled that thescheme in the draft Bill had been approved by. the Cabinet on1st August. He believed that this scheme could be justified on theground that, while the State was entitled to restrict the developmentof land without payment of compensation, it was reasonable to com-compensate owners who had bought land with development rights in the belief that they would be able to exercise those rights. He had originally proposed that compensation should take the form of arefund of the price paid for the development values; but, in view ofthe difficulty of arriving at the amount to be refunded where theland purchased had been partially disposed of or partially developed,the Cabinet had accepted a scheme suggested by the Treasury, underwhich the compensation was based on the current value of thedevelopment rights discounted back at 5 per cent, to the date of purchase.The Lord Chancellor said that he had regretfully come to theconclusion that the compensation scheme in Part IV of the draftBill was indefensible. The Government were entitled to stand onthe principle that owners had no right to compensation for loss ofdevelopment value; but, if it were decided to make an ex gratiapayment, everything possible should be done to distribute the sum insuch a way as to give least ground for complaints of unfairness. Itwas impossible to justify giving a large sum by way of compensation to an owner who had purchased development values shortly beforethe war, while restricting the compensation payable to an ownerwho had inherited land at the same time to a payment inrespect of the death duties which he had paid. Nor was it anyeasier to justify reducing the compensation in accordance with thelength of time for which the owner had held the land; for an ownermight have been prevented from exercising his development rights,e.g., by the terms of a lease.   He had accordingly proposed in his
alternative scheme that the Government should make available as an act of grace a global sum which would be shared among all ownersbroadly according to the development value of their land. In allcases the amount of compensation would represent a scalingdown of this value and it might be desirable to provide forless drastic scaling clown in exceptional cases, e.g., where land wasdead-ripe for development. It would admittedly be difficult to fix the amount of the global sum, but the estimate of  400 millions givenin the Barlow Report as the development values in all undevelopedland in 1937 afforded some basis for the calculation. To this shouldbe added a sum representing the redevelopment values inherent indeveloped land, and for this he had added another  100 millions.Since 1937, however, building costs had risen and development valuesmust have fallen; and on account of this he had reduced the total of 500 millions to  250 millions. It might be that some higher figureought to be taken.The Lord President said that he hoped that the Cabinet would approve the compensation scheme contained in the draft Bill. Hethought it possible to defend the distinction made between the ownerwho had. purchased development rights recently in the belief thathe would be able to exercise them, and the owner who had merelyinherited land with development rights or had taken no steps todevelop his land for 25 years or more. The Bill would in any event be most controversial, and he did not believe that the adoption of thealternative basis of compensation proposed by the Lord chancellor would make its passage any easier. That scheme would not be popular with Government supporters; and it could not be assumed that it would be accepted by the Opposition merely because itresembled the scheme outlined in the White Paper presented by the coalition Government on the Control of Land Use (Cmd. 6537).Under the Lord Chancellor&apos;s scheme, the method of distribution ofthe global sum would be left to regulations made under the Bill. but would not Parliament insist that the principles should be set out inthe Bill itself ? Again, the scheme involved the valuation of all landwith development rights and it would be impossible to carry this outin less than five years, during which time neither sellers nor pur-chasers of land would know what compensation would attach to theland and projects for development would be held up. This would be bound to affect adversely the general economic position. As regardsthe Parliamentary timetable, it would take two or three weeks to formulate clearly the details of the scheme, and he saw no prospectof embodying a revised scheme in the Bill within less than six weeks.Such a delay would mean that it would not be possible to pass theBill during the current Session, even though the Session were con-tinued into the autumn. He therefore urged that the Cabinet should accept the scheme set out in Part IV of the draft Bill.The Prime Minister said that the compensation scheme embodied in the Bill seemed to be based on the principle that there was a dis-tinction between investment in land and investment in other formsof property. But could a distinction reasonably be made betweenthe owner who had inherited land and the owner who had boughtland with inherited money? And was it justifiable to pay a rela-tively large sum by way of compensation to the land speculator whohad bought land immediately before the war, while giving no compensation to the owner who had bought land before 1919? he agreed with the Lord Chancellor that, if any compensation was to beprovided, it should be distributed among all owners of developmentrights broadly in accordance with the existing value of their rights.In further discussion there was general agreement that the* Government could not defend the distinction between investment inland and other forms of investment which was implicit in thescheme in the Bill. In all other spheres compensation was based onthe value of the assets taJken over, and it would be difficult to justify a departure from this principle, particularly when it involved hard-ship to trustees and educational and charitable institutions whose
normal practice it was to hold land as a long-term investment. Thescheme in the Bill had originally provided for the refund of out-of-pocket expenses, but it could no longer be defended even on this principle, since the decision to give compensation for the existingdevelopment value discounted back to the date of purchase meant that the sum received by an owner might be more or less than he hadpaid for the development rights.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury said that, unlessits Second Reading could be taken soon after the House reassembled,the Bill could not be passed into law by the end of July. It wastherefore essential to introduce the Bill before the Christmas recess and to print and circulate it early in January.The Prime Minister said that the general opinion of the cabinet was in favour of accepting a scheme on the lines proposed by theLord Chancellor, if the necessary re-casting of Part IV of the draftBill could be completed in time to enable the Second Reading ofthe Bill to be taken soon after Parliament reassembled after Christ-mas. This might be done if Part IV of the Bill could take theform of prescribing the global sum to be paid in compensation and requiring the Minister to prescribe by order the principles on whichthis was to be divided between the claimants and the machineryfor making that distribution. The Minister of Town and country planning, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,should make every effort to fix the amount of the global sum assoon as possible; and the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theMinister of Town and Country Planning, should arrange for hisscheme to be cast in legislative form in time for the Cabinet toreach a final decision on it at their meeting on 19th December.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a scheme of compensation for loss of develop-ment rights should be prepared, on the lines suggestedin the annex to CP. (48) 454, for incorporation in theBill in substitution for Part IV of the draft annexed to cp. (46) 432.(2) Agreed that the Bill should state the amount of the globalsum to be provided by way of compensation and shouldempower the Minister to prescribe the machinery fordistributing this sum and the principles on which itshould be distributed in a scheme which should be subjectto affirmative resolution.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theMinister of Town and Country Planning, to arrange forthe necessary redrafting of Part IV of the Bill with aview to enabling the Cabinet to resume consideration ofthe Bill at their meeting on 19th December.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th December, 1946.
