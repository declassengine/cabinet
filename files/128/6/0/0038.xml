j!an-Powe*.Civil Service &apos;1. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the continuingdemands of Government Departments for additional staff, he had decided to appoint a small Ministerial Committee to control the totalsize of Government Departments. This Committee would deter-mine a total staff ceiling for each Department at six-monthly intervals, and would act as a court of appeal if any Departmentwished to exceed its approved ceiling. The members of theCommittee would be : Home Secretary (Chairman).Minister of Defence.Minister of Labour.Financial Secretary to the Treasury.An official Committee would also be appointed, under the Chairman-ship of the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, to assist the ministerial Committee and to prepare material for it.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers decisionto appoint a Committee to control the numbers employedin Government Departments.Germany.Financing ofBritish and united StatesZones.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 89thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet considered telegrams from New York(Nos. 1840 and 1841 of 20th November and Nos. 1886 and 1887 of22nd November) reporting discussions between the Foreign Secre-tary and the United States Secretary of State on the sharing of the combined cost of financing the British and United States Zones ofGermany. Mr. Byrnes had proposed that each Government should contribute 50 per cent, of the cost over the next three years. TheForeign Secretary had explained the difficulties of our position andhad indicated that, if the United States were unable to make alarger financial contribution, we should have to consider seriouslythe possibility of withdrawing from Germany. Mr. Byrnes had.however, felt unable to increase his offer. He was satisfied that congress would not authorise more than a 50 per cent, contribution;and the Foreign Secretary and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington both felt unable to challenge his view of the attitudelikely to be taken by Congress. Mr. Byrnes had subsequentlysuggested that the two Governments might exchange Zones, and had indicated that in that event the United States Government mightbe able to contribute up to 65 per cent, of the combined cost. TheForeign Secretary thought it politically impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to entertain that suggestion; but the fact that it hadbeen made showed that the United States Government were deter-mined that on the existing basis they should not contribute morethan half the combined cost. Mr. Byrnes was, however, prepared tomake some concession about the termination of the Anglo-american agreement of 1945 under which the proceeds of exports from thetwo Zones were divided between them in proportion to the cost ofimports into each Zone. He was prepared to agree that thisarrangement should be terminated with retrospective effect as from31st March, 1946, as part of a plan for the joint financing of the two zones on a basis of equal partnership.The Foreign Secretary was satisfied that it would be impossibleto extract from the United States Government better terms thanthose proposed by Mr. Byrnes; and he asked the Cabinet to authorise him to agree that the combined cost of financing the British and united States Zones should be equally divided between the twoGovernments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this was a gravedecision for the Cabinet to take. The total net cost of financing thetwo Zones over the next three years was likely to amount to 250 million. If we accepted the basis of equal contributions, our share would be  125 million.    If this were a sterling charge, it[32803-2]
would he manageable; but our contribution would in practice haveto be made mainly in dollars. The dollar equivalent?.of  125 million,represented, over one-seventh of the total proceeds of the UnitedStates Loan. If we were forced to find this quantity of dollars for germany; we should have to revise our import programme for thesecond half of 1947 and might be forced to reduce even the pro-gramme of supplementary food imports for that period. And, even so, we should have exhausted the Loan by the end of 1948. At thesame time, the Chancellor recognised that it would be politically impossible to withdraw altogether from Germany or to exchangeZones with the United States Government. He also rejected thealternative of reversing the decision in favour of the fusing of thetwo Zones. Although this would enable us to charge the americans in dollars for the coal and steel sent from the British Zone to theUnited States Zone, it would be contrary to our policy of treatingGermany as a single economic unit, and it would be stronglyresented by the Americans. If we adopted that course, they wouldprobably make difficulties over the supply of wheat to the british zone, and our position there would then become impossible. If, onthe other hand, we abandoned fusion and refrained from chargingfor the coal and steel sent to the United States Zone, the probablecost to us would be  200 million (largely in dollars) as against 125 million. His conclusion was that we had no alternative butto accept the policy of fusion on the basis of equal contributions towards the combined cost. He recommended, however, that in agreeing to this we should stipulate that out of our share of 125 million over the next three years, we should not be asked toprovide more than  75 million in dollars or other &quot;hard&quot;currencies. It should be a condition of our agreement that the joint anglo-American Import and Export Agency should be instructedto secure supplies for Germany from &quot; soft &quot;-currency countrieswhenever they could, even if the supplies from these sources costmore than they would from &quot; hard &quot;-currency sources. he recognised that there was likely to be little scope for this in theimmediate future; but he hoped that in the second and third yearsof the period a substantial part of the food requirements of thewestern Zones of Germany might be bought from Eastern european countries in exchange for manufactured goods. If we could not secure a mitigation of the dollar burden along these lines, thealternative, in the last resort, was to insist on a right to review theoperation of the arrangement at the end of 1947.The Lord President said that the United States administration should be made to realise the immense financial burden, in terms of dollars, which they were inviting us to assume. No doubt it was true that the United States Government had to take account ofpolitical difficulties with the newly elected Congress. But HisMajesty&apos;s Government would also have political difficulties in defending an agreement to bear an equal share of the cost of financing the combined Zones. In the circumstances described inthe telegrams he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that we hadno alternative but to assume the obligation of equal financial contri-butions. He agreed that our acceptance should be made subject to conditions, as suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Hesuggested, however, that further stipulations should be made.Eirst, we should obtain a specific assurance that the United StatesGovernment would at once apply to the full the principle of poolingfood supplies for the two Zones.. They should release us from any outstanding obligations under earlier &quot; loans &quot; of wheat, flour, &amp;c,and should raise no further arguments about Canadian wheat or the diversion of supplies destined for the United Kingdom. Secondly,it should be understood that the agreement for the joint financing ofthe two Zones would not give the United States Government any right to interfere with the carrying out of British policy forsocialising the principal industries of the Ruhr. . Thirdly, it shouldbe publicly stated that all pur expenditure on the rehabilitation of
Germany would be regarded as a loan to be repaid in German goods&quot;and services in the shortest practicable time consistent with the rebuilding of the German economy.The Lord President added that he had it in mind that a comprehensive statement should eventually be made of the policyof the Western Powers towards Germany, on the basis of the agree-ment now proposed. This should be such as to leave us free to workfor the rehabilitation of Europe without constant legalisticarguments with the United States Government.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the arrangements now proposed would have the effect of bringing this country stillfurther under the economic domination of the United States. Hewould have preferred to continue our independent administrationof the British Zone of Germany; and he believed that, on a long-term view, the prospects of enabling our Zone to pay its way were better than had been suggested. The fundamental cause of theeconomic disorders in the British Zone was shortage of food. Inhis view too much reliance had been placed on the procurement offood from the United States. Supplies from alternative sources inEurope could be stimulated; and indigenous food production withinthe British Zone could be greatly increased if greater quantities of fertilisers were imported. He would, therefore, have preferred toretain our independence of action within the British Zone and to concentrate on so rebuilding its economy that the Zone would been abled by its exports to pay its way.As against this, it was pointed out that the figures submittedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer represented the net cost of financing the two Zones during the next three years, after offsettingthe proceeds of German exports; and that in these calculations afavourable view had been taken of the prospects m of restoringGerman exports within that period. Moreover, Germ any&apos;s require-ments of imported food could not be met in 1947 except from theUnited States there was little prospect of developing alternative sources of supply over the next twelve months and if we now wentback on the policy of economic fusion for the two Zones we had little chance of obtaining in 1947 the food supplies required to set the British Zone on its feet.Other points made in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Food said that the proposed conditionabout the pooling of food supplies for the British and United StatesZones should be expressed in such terms as to make it clear that theUnited States Government assumed responsibility for the procure-ment of such food supplies as were required for the two Zones from united States sources. There was a danger that, unless this wasmade clear, the United States ^Administration, while admitting joint financial responsibility for imports, might give us no assistance inthe actual procurement of food supplies in the United States.(b) What were the implications of &apos;&apos; fusion &apos;&apos; of the two Zones,particularly in regard to the internal administration of our Zone?It was explained that the primary object had been to securejoint responsibility for the external economic affairs of the two zones, particularly in the pooling of imports and exports, and forthe pooling of indigenous resources. It was not, however, intended that the adoption of this policy should give either Government theright to intervene in the internal administration of the other&apos;s Zone.(c) Special importance was attached to the point that theagreement for the joint financing of the two Zones should not beallowed to affect our policy for the socialisation of the principal industries of the Ruhr, or give the United States authorities any right to call that policy in question.It was pointed out that acceptance of the principle of equalcontributions towards the combined cost of financing the two Zoneswould leave us in a stronger position to adhere to our policy inrespect of the Ruhr than we should have had if the Americans hadbeen contributing a larger proportion of the combined cost.Moreover, Mr. Byrnes&apos;s offer to contribute up to 65 per cent, of the
combined cost if the two Governments exchanged Zones reflected theadditional price which the Americans would be ready to pay for control of the Ruhr. This implied that he expected no rights of intervention in the Ruhr if we remained in our present Zone andthe United States contributed only 50 per cent, of the combined costof the two Zones.(d) Under the proposed agreement we should be incurringsubstantial dollar expenditure on behalf of Germany, and shouldbe drawing on the United States Loan for that purpose. The Loanhad been made to meet the needs of the United Kingdom. was there not, therefore, a case for asking the United States Governmentto treat this further dollar expenditure for Germany as a separate and additional loan ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, particularly in thelight of the recent United States elections, there was no prospect ofsecuring a further loan from the United States for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if satisfactory assurances could be obtainedfrom the United States Administration on the points raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Lord President, and on thefurther point noted in paragraph (a) above, the foreign secretary might accept the proposal that the UnitedKingdom and United States Governments should makeequal contributions towards the combined cost of financing the British and United States Zones ofGermany, subject to the agreement outlined in New Yorktelegram No. 1887 of 22nd November about the termina-tion of the Anglo-American Agreement of 1945 on the division of the proceeds of exports from the two Zones.If. however, the Foreign Secretary failed to secure these assurances, he should report back to the Cabinet so thatthey might have a further opportunity of consideringthe matter.(2) Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to inform the foreign secretary of the Cabinefs views as recorded above.3. The Secretary of State for India said that on 21st NovemberMr. Jinnah had stated that representatives of the Muslim Leaguewould not attend the Constituent Assembly, which was due to meeton 9th December. The attitude of the League would not apparentlybe modified unless they could be given an assurance as to the pro-cedure to be adopted in the Assembly. Under the plan described in the statement of 16th May by the Cabinet Mission and theViceroy (Cmd. 6821) the Assembly, after a preliminary meeting, wasto :divide up into three sections, which were to settle provincialconstitutions for the Provinces included in each section and were also to decide whether any group constitution should be set up forthese Provinces and, if so, with what provincial subjects it should deal. The Muslim League required an assurance that decisions bythe sections would be taken by the vote of a majority of those presentand not by the vote of a majority of the representatives of eachProvince. The point was one with far-reaching implications, onwhich it would be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to give an assurance without antagonising the Congress Party. Intransigentstatements had been made by both Pandit Nehru and Mr. Jinnahand there was now a serious danger of an immediate breakdown ofthe whole plan for constitutional reform.The Secretary of State said that, after consultation with thePrime Minister and certain of his colleagues, a telegram had beensent to the Viceroy suggesting that he might now invite two members of the Interim Government representing Congress andtwo representing the Muslim League to visit this country with himIndia.constitutional developments.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 94thConclusions,Minute 3.)
to discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Government how best the ConstituentAssembly could be made effective. The Viceroy welcomed thissuggestion as being probably the only way of averting widespreaddisorders and bloodshed, though he doubted whether any permanentimprovement in the political atmosphere would result. Hesuggested that a Sikh representative should be included among thoseinvited to London for these consultations.There was general agreement that this proposal might succeed in avoiding a deadlock and would serve to keep the initiative withHis Majesty&apos;s Government. While the invitation should in the firstinstance be given to persons who were members of the interim government, an invitation could be extended to Mr. Jinnah if itappeared that the Muslims would otherwise feel unable to accept.It was important that at this stage we should not give the appear-ance of being prepared to acquiesce in the postponement of theConstituent Assembly.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that two members of the Interim Government repre-senting Congress, two representing the Muslim league and one representing the Sikh community should beinvited to London, with the Viceroy, as soon as possiblefor discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for India would consult the Prime Minister on the terms in which thisdecision should be announced.Fuel Supplies 4.   The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in pursuance offor Industry.    the Governments decision of 19th November, he had discussed with(Previous        the National Production Advisory. Council for Industry the fuelReference:       economy scheme outlined in CP. (46) 423, and broad agreementCM. (46) 98th   had been reached on the means of rationing supplies of coal, gas and conclusions,     electricity for industry during the coming winter.   Doubts had,Minute 4.)      however, been expressed about the wisdom of avoiding any advanceannouncement about the proposed cuts in coal deliveries;  and he now thought it would be necessary to communicate with all firmsconsuming more than 100 tons of coal per annum so that they mightbe informed of what was proposed.   It was desirable that thearrangements should now be concluded without further delay, andhe asked whether he might now settle the details in consultationwith the Board of Trade without further reference to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that further reference to the cabinet would not be necessary if the Ministers directly concerned werecontent with the scheme which it was now proposed to introduce.The Minister of Fuel and Power should discuss his scheme withthose Ministers; and in the event of disagreement the matter shouldbe brought before the Cabinet at their meeting on 28th November.Parliamentary 5.   The Prime Minister said that a special meeting of theLabour Party.  Parliamentary Labour Party would be held at 10 a.m. on Thursday,28th November.  He asked that all Ministers should make a specialpoint of being present at this meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th November, 1946.
