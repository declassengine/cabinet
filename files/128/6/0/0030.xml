1. The Prime Minister referred to the report circulated onSidky Pasha&apos;s return to Cairo after his conversations with theForeign Secretary in London to the effect that Britain had acceptedthe unity of Egypt with the Sudan under the Egyptian Crown. Itwas unfortunate that this premature and incomplete disclosureshould have been made of conversations which had been held on a personal and exploratory basis on the understanding that theycommitted neither Government and were to be treated as confi-dential. The provisional agreement reached in the course of these discussions had not in fact been limited to the question of theSudan, and even on that question had not been confined to theproblem of sovereignty. The formula proposed for the Protocol onthe Sudan, while recognising the unity between the Sudan and egypt resulting from a common Crown, declared the intention ofthe two Governments to work together for the well-being of the sudanese and their active preparation for self-government; and itspecifically safeguarded the present administration of the Sudanuntil such time as the Sudanese were able to exercise their right todetermine the future status of the territory.The Prime Minister said that in his statement in the Houseof Commons on the previous day he had tried to correct the impres-sion created by the misleading report which had been circulatedfrom Cairo. He hoped that that report would not prejudice theprospects of bringing to an early and satisfactory conclusion thenegotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.2. The Prime Minister referred to news reports of thedecision that departments of the United States Government would no longer be responsible for procuring food supplies on behalf offoreign Governments.The Minister of Food confirmed that the British Food mission in Washington would in future have to make its purchases throughthe ordinary channels of private trade in the United States. Hehad been expecting this development, and it formed part of the forecast of future difficulties which he had placed before theCabinet in CP. (46) 396. The immediate consequences of thechange were likely to be higher prices and greater difficulty inobtaining supplies.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Germany. 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignFuture of Secretary (CP. (46) 398) on the control of the principal industries the Ruhr        of the Ruhr.Industries. In this memorandum the Foreign Secretary recalled that at(Previous        their meeting on 17th April the Cabinet had authorised him to reference:      discuss with the Governments principally concerned two alternativeC.M.(46)36th   proposals for the international control of the Ruhr industries.   in conclusions,     the light of those discussions, which were summarised in the memo-Minute 3.)      randum, he now recommended that the Cabinet should reject thefirst alternative of international ownership and should declarethemselves in favour of socialising these industries under german public ownership, subject to international control.    Ownershipmight be vested either in a central German Government, Avhenestablished,   or   in   the   Land   Government   of   North   Rhine-Westphalia.    The Foreign Secretary favoured the latter course.He proposed that the existing nominated Government of this land should appoint trustees of German nationality, who would hold the title to the properties until after an elected Government had been[32698-3] b 2Anglo-EgyptianTreatyNegotiations.(previous reference:CM.

formed in the spring, when public corporations would be set up bythe new Government, after consultation with the trustees and withthe British authorities. Control over the trustees and the corpora-tions would be exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the british zone, who would have associated with him as observers representa-tives of the United States, France, Holland, Belgium and luxembourg, but not of Russia.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster suggested thatit would be better to leave open for the present the question whetherthe ownership of these industries should eventually rest with theLand Government or with a central German Government. Thepredominating influence in the Land Government would be thatof the Christian Democrats, who could not be relied upon to giveactive support to a policy of socialising key industries. Hesuggested that the socialised industries should be operated for thepresent by trustees appointed by the Zonal Advisory Council.These trustees could continue to act until it was clearer what formof central Government, if any, would be set up.The Prime Minister pointed out that objection could be raised to the appointment of trustees by the Zonal Advisory Council, onthe ground that this was not a Governmental body and that itsselection for this purpose might imply that ownership would subse-quently be vested in a central Government.(6) It was important to ensure that any arrangements now made for the transfer of these industries could not be upset whenGerman law was revived on the establishment of an effectiveGerman Government. Provision to cover this point should pre-sumably be included in the Peace Treaty. The legal issues involved should be carefully considered, in consultation with the LawOfficers, and a statement of the legal position should be submittedto the Cabinet,(c) It was not clear whether the policy recommended inOP. (46) 398 could be implemented forthwith or whether it must first be discussed with the other occupying Powers. There was likely to be a long delay if quadripartite agreement had to beobtained; and it was to be hoped that we could proceed to put thepolicy into effect after notifying our intentions to the control council.(d) It would be helpful if a clearer definition could be given ofthe powers of the trustees or corporations on the one hand and ofthe Commander-in-Chief on the other. Control of the policy and operation of the socialised industries would presumably rest withthe occupying Power.(e) Would it be expedient to allow observers from foreign government to be associated with the Commander-in-Chief in theexercise of his control of these industries % And, if so, was it wise to exclude Russian observers ?It was unlikely that their presence would make for the smoothworking of the control. The United States Government would notbe sympathetic to the principle of public ownership, and the FrenchGovernment favoured the political separation of the Ruhr from therest of Germany. The exclusion of Russian observers would givea fresh ground of grievance to the Soviet Government.The predominating opinion in the Cabinet was against theproposal to associate foreign observers with the Commander-in-Chief in his control of the Ruhr industries.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the proposal that the principal industries of the ruhr should be socialised and placed under german public ownership.(2) Invited the Minister of State and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to arrange for further considerationto be given to the points raised in the Cabinefs
discussion on the practical means of giving effect to thisproposal; and to submit to the Cabinet a further memo-randum, which should include an authoritative state-ment on the legal aspects of the matter.Ireland. 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Lord(Previous President (CP. (46) 381) and the Secretary of State for DominionReference: Affairs (CP. (46) 391).toclusfora^ ^n discussion, the Lord President amplified the account, givenMinute 5 )&apos; *n      memorandum, of conversations which he had held during hismu 6  &apos;&apos; recent visit to Eire and Northern Ireland.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that on18th September, 1945, the Cabinet had approved his proposal thatour general policy towards Eire should be quietly to restore friendly relations; and he reported that satisfactory progress had been madein pursuit of that policy. He hoped that Ministers would not over-look such opportunities as offered for promoting closer relationswith Eire. In particular, it would be advantageous to us if thelevel of food production in Eire could be increased; and he hopedthat the Ministry of Agriculture would be ready to give any adviceor assistance in their power to representatives of the Eire Govern-ment who might visit this country.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the memoranda circulated bythe  Lord  President  and  the  Secretary of  State forDominion Affairs and of the statement made by th**Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.cabinet office, S.W. 1,29*A October, 1946.
