InternationalEconomicMachineryand UnitedKingdomRepresenta-tion in theUnitedStates.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lor-dPresident (CP. (46) 215) raising certain points regarding (i) theinternational machinery for handling supply and economic questions and (ii) the organisation of United Kingdom Missions in the UnitedStates; and a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (46) 274)commenting on the points raised by the Lord President.The Lord President said that in the past year there hadrightly been a big reduction in the powerful United kingdom representation maintained in Washington during the war. It was important, however, that this should not be carried too far andhe laid special stress on the need for staff of high quality and with suitable qualifications. It was necessarily difficult to secure fullcoherence and co-ordination between the various Missions and hewas glad to see from the Appendix to CP. (46) 274 that the ambassador had this subject much in mind.The Lord President also drew attention to the danger of lossof efficiency during the process of putting on to a fully internationalbasis machinery which had been set up during the war on an Anglo-American or Anglo-American-Canadian basis, and suggested thatthe recently constituted Steering Committee for international organisations might consider this question in detail. More shouldbe done to bring to public notice in this country the activities ofmany of the newly-formed international organisations so as tosecure a proper appreciation of what they were accomplishing, andthe Overseas Information Services Committees were considering this matter.The Cabinet first discussed the organisation of UnitedKingdom representation in the United States.The Foreign Secretary said that he agreed that a very consider-able overhaul of the machinery set up in the United States duringthe war had been needed. The ultimate responsibility in Americafor the conduct of our relations with the United States lay with the ambassador and, if he was to discharge his duties properly, he must be kept fully aware of what the various Missions were doingand must be able, if need be, to exercise a measure of control andco-ordination over them. He had no doubt that the objective shouldbe the progressive liquidation of the separate Missions and thereintegration of their functions into the Embassy. He had broughtthis point to the special attention of Lord Inverchapel and hethought that the report annexed to CP. (46) 274. showed thatreorganisation was now proceeding on the right lines. He was alsotrying to strengthen our Consular representation in the UnitedStates, in particular by finding men who had the right experience and outlook for the particular part of the United. States to whichthey were to be posted.The Minister of Food called attention to the special positionof the Food Mission. So long as that Mission was engaged intrading operations on behalf of the Ministry of Food it must remaintechnically part of that Ministry, though it would, of course, con-tinue to work in the closest co-operation with the Embassy.In discussion there was agreement that the representation ofthe United Kingdom must be adequate in other parts of the UnitedStates as well as in Washington and New York. So much depended on satisfactory relations with the United States that in all branchesit was important to secure first class men, and quality was moreimportant than numbers. Representatives should not be left in theUnited. States for too long and conditions of service must be suchas to conduce to efficiency. For instance, recent rises in costs wouldhit United Kingdom officials in the United States and it would benecessary to consider some increase in their allowances. It wouldalso be helpful if United Kingdom representatives could be con-centrated to a greater extent near the Embassy, though its locationwould not suit some of the United Kingdom representatives. Asregards the position of Food Mission, this was bound, up with thes-eneral policy to be pursued in the future with regard to the purchase[32426-2]e 2
of food overseas, and it would be useful if the Minister of food would circulate a memorandum showing what he had in mind.Meanwhile no steps would be taken to amalgamate the Food Missionwith the Embassy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was ready toconsider sympathetically the points raised, including the suggestionthat a site should be acquired to enable the various Missions to be concentrated so far as possible round the Embassy. No net increasein expenditure in the United States should be necessary, since therewas still room for a considerable reduction in the total staffsemployed.Discussion then turned to the activities of the international organisations which were now in existence or in process of formation.The Minister of State said that the representatives of some countries tended to take the view that these organisations shouldbe kept as distinct as possible from the United Nations Organisa-tion so as to keep them free of political influence. He believed thatthis was a mistake, and that the wise course was to try to securethe closest co-ordination of the activities of technical organisationssuch as the International Health Organisation with the work ofthe United Nations Organisation.The Minister of Health said that functional organisations pro-vided one of the best means for international co-operation, and itmight often be a mistake to link such organisations too closely withthe political side of the United Nations Organisation.It was also urged that there was a danger that too many inter-national organisations would be created. The provision of staff forthese organisations imposed a great strain on the resources of theUnited Kingdom.The Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the policy outlined by the foreign secretary in CP. (46) 274 with regard to the organisa-tion of the representation of the United Kingdom in theUnited States.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a report tobe prepared showing the number and scope of the inter-national organisations now in existence or proposed, and indicating what steps could be taken to co-ordinate their activities and promote their efficient working.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the AdditionalSecretary (CP. (46) 281) covering a minute to the Prime minister on a point which had arisen in the Anglo-American discussions on Palestine about the boundaries proposed under the plan of provincial autonomy for Palestine.It was recalled that at their meeting on the 11th July theCabinet had approved the provincial autonomy plan described in cp. (46) 259, subject to any comments by the Chiefs of Staff. Oneof the comments subsequently received from the Chiefs of Staff wasthat no solution of the Palestine problem should be proposed whichwould alienate the Arab States, and that it was doubtful whetherthe scheme described in CP. (46) 259 satisfied that condition. TheBritish Delegation had therefore put forward, in their discussions with the United States representatives, tentative suggestions for modifying the proposed provincial boundaries with a view to makingthe scheme more acceptable to the Arabs. The United States Delega-tion had made counter-suggestions for expanding the Jewishprovince; and, after discussion, the issue had been narrowed downto the delineation of the southern boundary below Jaffa. three alternative courses were now open. First, to press the suggestionthat an area of 320,000 dunums to the south of Jaffa should beadded to the Arab province. This would have the two advantages of putting Jaffa within the Arab province, instead of leaving itas an Arab enclave within the Jewish province; and of leaving inPalestine.(previous reference:CM. (46)67thConclusions,Minute 4.)ProvincialBoundaries.
the Arab province a substantial area of Arab-owned citrus planta- ,tions which wrould otherwise fall in the Jewish province. Secondly,to suggest that the Arab province should be extended to the seaat Jaffa by a corridor which would cut the Jewish province in two.Thirdly, to accept the boundaries originally proposed in the schemeput forward in CP. (46) 259, abandoning any attempt to securemodifications designed to make those boundaries more acceptable tothe Arabs.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the first of the commentsmade by the Chiefs of Staff was that any scheme for the future government of Palestine must give us the power to control andco-ordinate the defence of the country and to maintain forces andmilitary facilities as, when and where we required. The area whichwould be transferred, under the first alternative, from the Jewish tothe Arab province included an important airfield which the Chiefsof Staff would prefer to see in Arab territory. Their preference forthe first alternative was not, however, based on this military ground.They favoured that solution because they considered that, if the boundaries were modified, as proposed under it, the provincial plan would be more likely to prove acceptable to the Arabs.The Cabinet agreed that the objective was to find a schemewhich could be put forward to Arabs and Jews as a basis for dis-cussion and would not be rejected out of hand by either party. Inthe discussions it might well be modified in various particulars.The Cabinet took note of the view of the Chiefs of Staff that on strategic grounds no solution should be proposed which wouldalienate the Arab States, but there were other considerations whichmust equally be taken into account. For instance, it was very desirable that the scheme put forward should have the backing ofthe United States Government. It seemed likely that they could be persuaded to agree to the boundary proposed in CP. (46) 259, butit was by no means certain that they would agree to one morefavourable to the Arabs.Some Ministers thought that, from the psychological aspect,the location of the boundaries would inevitably be regarded as oneof the most important factors of the scheme. It would inevitably be a point on which critics would fasten.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be wrong to regard these boundaries as international frontiers creating a seriousbarrier to normal intercourse. If the ultimate objective waspartition, then it would be a major difficulty that there should be no direct access between the Arab province and Jaffa. The scheme wasnot, however, intended to prejudge that issue. The division ofPalestine into administrative provinces would create no customsbarriers at the provincial boundaries. There would throughoutPalestine be common user of ports, roads and railways and there seemed no reason why Arabs from the Arab province should not proceed as freely as they wished to and from Jaffa, even though this meant crossing part of the Jewish province.The Cabinet agreed that they could not support the suggestionthat the Arab province should be extended to the sea at Jaffa by acorridor. While uniting the Arab province and Jaffa, this would cut the Jewish province in two and so create for the Jews thedifficulty which it solved for the Arabs. The Cabinet were alsoopposed to the suggestion that 320,000 dunums to the south of Jaffashould be added to the Arab province. A possible compromise mightbe that a smaller area, roughly to the south of the line Gedera-Sajad,should be added to the Arab province. This was the kind of pointon which a concession might be made to the Arabs in the forth-coming consultations.The Foreign Secretary suggested that it would also be advisable to be prepared&apos;to make a concession to the Jews in the area betweenHaifa and Tiberias. This might incidentally have the advantageof reducing the Moslem population in the northern Arab enclavewhich, if partition was eventually accepted, might have to be addedto the Lebanon.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United States Delegation should beinvited to agree to the boundaries between the Arab and jewish provinces put forward in CP. (46) 259, thoughit should be made clear to them that modifications ofthese boundaries might have to be made as a result ofthe consultations with Arabs and Jews.Proposed The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Governments of theConference Arab States had invited us to enter into negotiations with them on with Arabs the subject of Palestine. It was not clear precisely what was theand Jews. scope of the negotiations which they proposed, but it had, in fact,been our intention to invite representative Arabs and Jews to aConference in London to be held probably towards the end ofAugust, and he thought there was now a real advantage in inform-ing the Arab States forthwith that this was our intention. he proposed that the note to be sent to them should be shown to theUnited States Ambassador in draft.The Cabinet discussed whether the United States Governmentshould also be invited to take part in the Conference. There were indications that they would not wish to be one of the main partiesto the consultations, but would prefer that the United KingdomGovernment, as mandatory, should alone negotiate a scheme pre-viously agreed with them. They might, however, be willing to sendobservers to the Conference.The Cabinet-(2) Took note with approval that the Foreign Secretary, afterconsultation with the United States Ambassador, pro-posed to inform the Arab States of his intention to invite them to send representatives to a Conference on palestine to be held in this country probably towards theend of August,(3) Agreed that the United States Government should beinvited to send observers to the Conference, but not tobecome  jointly  responsible  for  it with the  UnitedKingdom Government.Complicity The Cabinet were reminded that in the recent debate in theof Jewish        House of Commons the Prime Minister had stated that there wasAgency in       evidence of the complicity of the Jewish Agency in terrorist out-Terrorist rages.   In reply to requests, he had promised to produce evidenceActs. for this statement.    The draft of a White Paper had now been produced by the Lord Chancellor showing clearly that leading members of the Jewish Agency had been working in co-operationwith the Irgun and Stern Groups.   The evidence related solely tothe series of recent outrages.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that a listof the incidents which had occurred and the number of casualtieswhich had been caused should be annexed to the White Paper.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that a White Paper, the text of which would be approved by the Prime Minister, should be presented as soon as possible on the lines proposed.Parliament. 3.   The Chief Whip said that as a result of his discussionsDebate on with Government supporters he was satisfied that, provided a debatePalestine. on Palestine was held before the Summer Recess, they would be content that it should be confined to the action taken by the Govern-ment to suppress disorder and should not cover the conclusions reached by the Government on the Report of the Anglo-american committee. The Opposition, however, had pressed for a two-daydebate on the 31st Jury and 1st August, and it would probablybe necessary to give at least a day and a half. If it was intendedto restrict the debate to the action taken to suppress disorder it seemed necessary that the Prime Minister should communicate theGovernments views on the wider issue confidentially to theOpposition, as had been done before the debate on India.
The Prime Minister said that it would be extremely difficult tocommunicate to the Opposition in confidence information on amatter of this kind on which certain Government supporters mightnot be in agreement with the Government&apos;s policy. It would alsobe awkward if, having had before them the Report of the Anglo-American Committee for so long, the Government were unable togive any indication of their views on it in the debate. He thoughtit would be advisable for the Foreign Secretary to come back from paris for the debate. The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should make arrangement to ensure that there was no debate on palestine in the House of Lords before -the 31st July.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to consider further at their meeting on the 25th Julywhat should be the scope of the forthcoming Parlia-mentary debates on Palestine.The Cabinet were informed that it was hoped that the british north America Bill would pass through all its stages in the Houseof Lords later in the day, and that it was proposed to try to pass it through all its stages in the House of Commons on the 26th July.The Government spokesman in the House of Commons should takethe line that the passage of this legislation was not a matter of graveconstitutional moment.The Cabinet -(2) Agreed that the Attorney-General should take charge ofthe British North America Bill in the House ofCommons.The Lord President drew the attention of the Cabinet to thefollowing Parliamentary Question by Mr. Gallacher, M.P. :--&apos;&apos; To ask the Lord President of the Council if the membersof the Advisory Committee on Scottish Broadcasting will beappointed by the Governors of the B.B.C. or by the Secretaryof State for Scotland.&quot;It seemed undesirable that a B.B.C. Advisory Committee shouldbe appointed by anyone other than the Governors of the B.B.C.,and it was proposed to answer the Question as follows :  &quot; These appointments will be made by the Governors ofthe B.B.C, who, in exercising their responsibility, will naturallytake such consultations as are appropriate. I think that theHonourable Member can rest assured that full account will betaken of any views expressed to the Governors by the Secretaryof State.&quot;   .The Cabinet-(3) Approved the reply which the Lord President proposed togive to the Question by Mr. Gallacher, M.P., about theappointment of the Advisory Committee on ScottishBroadcasting.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (46) 273) covering a memorandum prepared in the cabinet office on the use of official information in private publications byserving and former Crown servants. If the principles set out inthis memorandum were approved, it was proposed that they shouldbe brought to the notice of all persons who had held office under theCrown by means of an arranged Question and Answer. A draftQuestion and Answer were annexed to the memorandum.Points in discussion were : (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that theColonial Service, as well as the Foreign and Home Civil Services,should be mentioned in the draft Answer.(b) The Lord President pointed out that paragraph 2 (b) (ii)of the memorandum might possibly be interpreted as meaning
that it was only the publication of information about domestic affairs that might be destructive of confidential relationships. he assumed that it had not been intended to restrict the scope of thesub-paragraph in this way, and he suggested that steps should betaken to make this clear.The Cabinet Subject to the points made in discussion, approved therecommendations made in paragraph 11 (a), (b) and (d) ofthe memorandum annexed to CP. (46) 273 and invited the -Prime Minister to make a general statement inParliament on the lines of the draft appended to thememorandum.Marriages 5.   At their meeting on the 30th May the Cabinet had invitedbetween the Home Secretary to discuss the issues raised in CP. (46) 211 with british the Ministers mainly concerned and to submit revised proposals forServicemen consideration by the Cabinet.and The Cabinet now had before them a joint memorandum by theForeigners. Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for War (CP. (46) 283)(Previous reporting the results of the discussions which had taken place.  this reference: memorandum recommended that local military commanders shouldCM. (46) 53rd be authorised to relax the present ban on marriage between BritishConclusions, Servicemen and foreign women, other than Japanese, if the reasonsMinute 3.) were good and provided that there was no security objection.The Home Secretary said that the Ministers with whom he had discussed the matter were agreed that to allow members of theBritish Forces to marry foreign women could not in itself beregarded as a serious threat to security and, indeed, that therelationships which were likely to develop under the operation ofa ban on such marriages constituted a much greater threat. as explained in paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 211, a strict security checkwould be applied in each individual case.The Secretary of State for War said that, while his personal view was in favour of the relaxation proposed in CP. (46) 283, theCabinet should know that the Chief of the Imperial General staff and the Commander-in-Chief in Germany were both opposed toit on the ground that existing conditions in Germany gave such astrong incentive to German women to try to get British Servicemento marry them that relaxation of the existing ban would lead to alarge number of imprudent marriages.The Minister of Health pointed out that the proposal made inparagraph 13 (a) of CP. (46) 283 enabled the local military commander to refuse to relax the ban if he did not think that thereasons for the marriage were good. Was it reasonable to give thelocal military commander power to refuse consent on these grounds ?In reply it was pointed out that it was the regular practice togive this discretion to local military commanders in overseastheatres.In further discussion it was suggested that the Cabinet shouldnot reach a decision on the matter without first hearing the views ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The Cabinet Agreed to hear the views of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff before reaching a decision on the proposals made in CP.
