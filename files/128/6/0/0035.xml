1. The Minister of State informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the negotiations for the revision of the Angko-Egyptian Treaty.The Egyptian Delegation had been informed of the under-standings reached in the conversations which Sidky Pasha had held with the Foreign Secretary in London. It was understood thattheir attitude had been unfavourable, but they had adjournedwithout taking any final decision. It was to be assumed that SidkyPasha would now proceed to put the proposals to the Council ofMinisters and thereafter to a secret session of the EgyptianParliament.Meanwhile, the Governor-General of the Sudan would leavethis country for the Sudan on 21st November.;The Cabinet Took note of the position.2. The Minister of State said that the political situation in spain was to be discussed at the General Assembly of the Unitedrsations; and the Foreign Secretary had suggested that the UnitedKingdom Delegation might take the initiative in proposing aresolution on this subject. Consultations had taken place betweenthe United Kingdom Delegation and the Foreign Office about theform of the proposed resolution. The text of the latest draft was contained in telegram No. 1694 of 15th November from New York,which was read out to the Cabinet. After recalling that the FrancoGovernment had given material assistance to enemy Governmentsduring the late war, did not represent the Spanish people and waspursuing policies which precluded Spanish participation in thework of the United Nations, the draft resolution went on to statethat, in the interests of Spain and of world co-operation, free anddemocratic elections should be held at which representatives of all parties might seek the franchise of the Spanish people. It invited the Spanish people to bring about by this means the admission of spain to the United Nations; and recommended that, meanwhile,the existing Government of Spain should be debarred from member-ship of international agencies established by the United Nations or its members and from participation in conferences or other activi-ties arranged by the United Nations or by those agencies.The Foreign Secretary expected that resolutions calling for more drastic action against the Franco Government would be tabled by representatives of other Powers; but he believed, from informal soundings taken in New York, that a resolution in the terms whichhe proposed might secure majority support in the Assembly.The Cabinet-Endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal that the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the General Assembly of theUnited Nations should take the initiative in proposing aresolution on the subject of Spain in the terms set out in new York telegram No. 1694 of 15th November.3. On 4th November the Cabinet had reaffirmed their earlier decision that the United Kingdom Delegation at the general assembly of the United Nations should support the view that the complaint by the Government of India about the treatment of indians in South Africa related to a matter of domestic jurisdictionwhich, under iVrticle 2 (7) of the Charter, was not appropriate fordiscussion by the Assembly; and had agreed that, if this view werenot accepted, our Delegation should support the claim that thequestion of jurisdiction should be referred for decision by theInternational Court of Justice.The United Kingdom Delegation had now reported (in new york telegram No. 1668 of 14th November) that it was likely that

The Prime Minister would himself speakin the debate on the amendment, by Government supporters, onforeign policy. The Minister without Portfolio was indisposed andwould be unable to speak in the debate on conscription.

He would like to add that the government intended to publish a White Paper for the purpose of this debate.Though Ministers had yet to decide the form of this White Paper,he thought there would be general agreement that some statement should be published about the Government&apos;s economic plans. The. Cabinet agreed that a statement on the lines suggested by the lord president might be made in the debate on 20th November.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,l%th November, 1946.a majority of the Governments represented at the Assembly would favour submission of the question of jurisdiction to theInternational Court, and that Field-Marshal Smuts might not himself ask for more than this.
