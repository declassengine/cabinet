Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.200Burma. 2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the SecretaryConstitutional of State for Burma (CP. (46) 465) and the Minister withoutPosition. Portfolio (CP. (46) 464).(Previous The Prime Minister recalled that on 12th December the CabinetEeference:       had considered that no further assurances should be given aboutCM. (46) 105th constitutional developments in Burma in advance of the discussionsConclusions,     which would be held if the Executive Council accepted the invita-Minute 3.)       tion to send a delegation to London.   The Governor of Burma had now, however, reported (telegram No. 262 of 17th December) that,from conversations which he had since held with Aung San,he was satisfied that the Anti-Fascist Peopled Freedom League(A.F.P.F.L.) would not agree to a delegation visiting this countryunless an assurance were given in advance that Burma would be free to choose whether or not she remained within the BritishCommonwealth.   The position had been considered by the Indiaand Burma Committee that morning and they had agreed torecommend to the Cabinet that a statement to this effect should bemade to Parliament before the Recess.All the advice from Burma was that the A.F.P.F.L. commandedgreat influence throughout the country and that if their leaders left the Executive Council the administration of the country would beparalysed, there would be a police strike, and it would be impossibleto maintain Government without the use of force. Indian troops could not be used for this purpose, and British troops could not bemade available without serious consequences elsewhere. Onebrigade could be brought from Malaya. A second brigade couldbe made available at the cost of weakening our Forces in India ordelaying the demobilisation scheme. But, even so, the administra-tive troops required to support these brigades would be lacking if,as must be assumed, we were unable to use the Indian administra-tive troops now in Burma. Finally, even if these could have beenprovided, it would not be possible with this strength to do morethan hold Rangoon and a few other key points; and the countrysidegenerally would be outside our control.There would, therefore, be great military difficulty in attempting to govern Burma by force. Nor was it clear to whatuseful result such an attempt would lead. It would probably serveonly to strengthen national feeling in Burma and to increase theinfluence of those who advocated early secession from the BritishCommonwealth.Apart from military considerations, the political backgroundmust also be taken into account. Pledges had been given thatBurma&apos;s constitutional advance would not be prejudiced by itsseparation from India. India had now been informed that she could choose whether or not she remained within the Common-wealth, and Burma expected the same treatment. It was also desirable that we should not seek to pursue in Burma a policy[32919-3] b 21. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the week beginning20th January, 1947.On 21st January the Second Reading of the Statistics of TradeBill would be taken.The Report Stage and Third Reading of the agricultural wages (Regulation) Bill and of the Road Traffic (Driving Licences)Bill would be taken on 22nd January.On 23rd January it was proposed to take the remaining stages of the Pensions (Increase) Bill, the Trustee Savings Banks Bill andthe Greenwich Hospital Bill, together with Motions approvingPurchase Taw (Exemption) Orders.On 24th January the Second Reading of the Malta (Reconstruc-tion) Bill would be taken.It might, however, be found necessary to hold a Debate onForeign Affairs in substitution for the business proposed for 23rdand 24th January.
inconsistent with that which we had pressed the netherlands government to follow in the Dutch East Indies.In these circumstances the India and Burma Committee had felt that an assurance should be given on the lines suggested. Ifthe Cabinet shared this view, the Prime Minister suggested thathe might settle the terms of the statement in consultation with theSecretary of State for Burma and the President of the Board ofTrade.The Minister of Food said that he was counting on Burma to export IJ million tons of rice during the next season. If there werewidespread civil disturbances this would not be available, and theconsequences, directly for South-East Asia and indirectly for thewhole world cereals situation, would be most serious.While some Ministers regretted that the pressure of events hadforced the Governor to go further in his consultations with AungSan than the Cabinet had intended, and disliked in principle giving,in advance of negotiations, assurances on points to be discussed in these negotiations, the general view of the Cabinet was thatthere were strong arguments both of expediency and of principle in favour of the course proposed. It had always been intended that Burma should be assisted towards self-government. If, as itappeared, Aung San was disposed to be friendly and to work for keeping Burma within the Commonwealth, there were advantages in strengthening his position in Burma.The Secretary of State for the Colonies emphasised theimportance of securing proper safeguards for the hill tribes andShan States. He also pointed out that the proposed statement wouldhave repercussions in Ceylon, and said that he would submit amemorandum to the Cabinet on this aspect of the matter.The Cabinet-Agreed that a statement should be made by the PrimeMinister in the House of Commons on the following dayon the lines suggested by the Governor of Burma; and took note that the terms of this statement would be settled by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Burma and the President of the Board ofTrade.India.Compensationfor Membersof IndianServices.(previous reference:CM. (46)98thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Prime Minister recalled that on 19th November theCabinet had agreed that the Viceroy should put before the interim government in India proposals for the payment of compensation to members of the Services in India, when their appointments underthe Secretary of State were terminated. There were now indica-tions that the Interim Government would not accept these proposals.The India and Burma Committee had considered the position andhad agreed that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forIndia should visit India immediately after Christmas to discussthe matter with members of the Indian Government. He would be accompanied by officials of the Treasury and the India Office.The Cabinet-Took  note,  with  approval,   of  the  Prime  ministers statement.Town and country planning.(previous reference:CM. (46) 105thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. On 12th December the Cabinet had invited the Lord Chan-cellor, in consultation with the Minister of Town and country planning, to arrange for Part IV of the Town and Country Plan-ning Bill to be re-drafted on the lines suggested in the annex toOP. (46) 454. They now had before them a memorandum by theLord Chancellor and the Minister of Town and Country Planning(CP. (46) 455) covering a revised draft of this Part of the bill the Lord Chancellor explained that Clause 50 provided forthe payment of a global sum by way of compensation and for
the distribution of that sum in accordance with a scheme madeby the Treasury, which would be subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. This scheme could not be made until the necessary information about all development values hadbeen obtained in accordance with regulations made under Clause 51,and it would be some years before this information could be collected.The global figure inserted in Clause 50 would cover amounts payable under the corresponding Scottish Bill and power was taken to makethe necessary apportionment between England! and Wales and scotland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had agreed withthe Minister of Town and Country Planning that the amount ofthe global sum to be inserted in Clause 50 should be  300 million,but the Bill would also provide for additional payments, amountingto some  25 million, in cases where value payments under the war damage Act had been reduced on the ground that the war damagesustained had increased the development value of the land. Pay-ment would be made in Treasury stock. Interest at 2-^ per cent,would run from the appointed day and might either be paid in cash or as an addition to the value of the stock. Land which wasdead ripe for development at the date of the introduction of theBill would be taken out of the field of compensation and bettermentaltogether if development was permitted and was carried out within five years of the appointed day.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that he accepted the revised draft of Part IV of the Bill and was satisfiedthat the proposed global sum could be justified, if it was put for-ward as an ex gratia payment and no attempt was made to justifyit on the basis of calculations related to the estimated value ofdevelopment rights.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Lord President said that Clauses 50 and 51 would be strongly criticised on the ground that they deprived Parliament ofall opportunity of debating the principles on which compensation was to be paid and the machinery for the settlement of claims.(b) As the scheme under Clause 50 would consist almost entirely of financial provisions, should it not be subject to affirmative resolu-tion of the House of Commons only %It was pointed out that this would increase the opposition tothe Bill in the House of Lords for no purpose; for, when the bill had passed and development rights had&apos; been taken over, the Houseof Lords would have no interest in rejecting a scheme providing for payments to the owners of those rights.(c) It was agreed that, in order to emphasise the fact thatpayments were to be made ex gratia and not in recognition of any right to compensation, the shares in the global figure should be described in the Bill, not as &quot; compensation,&quot; but as &quot; payments.&quot;id) The revised draft of Part IV did not prescribe a time-limit by which the payments would be made. So long as the amountdue in respect of any particular piece of land was unknown, develop-ment of this land was likely to be held up; and it would be difficultto meet this situation by making payments on account because ofthe uncertainty as to the amount eventually payable.On the other hand, it was argued that, as a large part of thedevelopment undertaken during the next five years would be carriedout by public authorities, no large amount of &quot;desirable developmentwas likely to be delayed in practice. It was desirable, however,that payment should not be deferred for more than five years, and part IV of the Bill should be amended to provide that the payments should become due in five years from the appointed day.(e) The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that atan earlier stage he had agreed to omit from Part III of the bill provision giving planning authorities power to acquire land for planning purposes. He did not wish to press that this provision should be included in the Bill as introduced, but he might have to
ElectricityBill.(previous reference:CM. (46) 69thConclusions,Minute 6.)raise the matter again if he were strongly pressed in the committee stage to confer this power on planning authorities.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal to make available the sum of  300million as an ex gratia payment to owners of develop-ment rights, and agreed that provision should be madefor special payments to owners of land where value pay-ments under the War Damage Act had been reduced on the ground that the war damage had increased thedevelopment value.(2) Agreed that the Bill should provide that the payments tobe made to owners of development rights in accordancewith any scheme made by the Treasury under Clause 50should become due in five years from the appointed dayunder the Bill.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) above, approved the revised draft of Part IV of the Town and Country-Planning Bill; and took note that the Minister of Townand Country Planning would introduce the Bill indummy before Parliament was adjourned for the Christ-mas Recess, and would submit a revised draft to theLegislation Committee with a view to its being published5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (46) 459) covering a draft ofthe Electricity Bill; and a note by the Minister of national insurance (CP. (46) 462) on the question whether there should bea single Area Electricity Board for Wales and Monmouthshire.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the draft Bill gaveeffect to the general principles approved by the Cabinet on 18th July,and incorporated amendments agreed on by the Committee on the socialisation of Industries.The Cabinet first considered whether a single Area electricity board should be appointed for Wales and Monmouthshire.The Minister of National Insurance said that in the recentWhite Paper on Wales the Government had stated that so far aspracticable Wales would be treated as a single unit for administra-tive purposes, and they should therefore be satisfied that there were good reasons for not treating Wales as a single unit in the ElectricityBill. Even if there had to be two Boards, should not the SouthWales area be extended to include the whole of Cardiganshire ?The Minister of Health supported the proposal that thereshould be a single Board for Wales and Monmouthshire. The estab-lishment of a separate Regional Hospital Board for Wales underthe National Health Service Act, 1946, had not been incompatible with an arrangement, by which patients from North Wales were treated in Merseyside hospitals; and, even if there were a singleArea Electricity Board for Wales, it should be possible to make arrangements with neighbouring areas to ensure cheap and efficientsupplies of electricity.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that his proposal to divideWales between two Boards was based on the desire to secure a properly balanced load in each area. If North and South Waleswere combined in a single area, the relatively sparsely populated areas of North Wales would lose the advantage of being attachedto the industrial area of Merseyside. The principle of the bill was that each area should be a separate entity for tariff purposes,and for this reason arrangements of the kind suggested by theMinister of Health were impracticable. The local authorities had pressed for some 30 to 40 Area Boards instead of the 14 pre-scribed by the Bill; and, if he were to yield to the demand for aseparate Board for Wales, he would find it difficult to resist similarclaims from other parts of the country.
In further discussion it was pointed out that it was impossibleto treat Wales and Monmouthshire as a unit for the purpose of theTransport Bill, and there was general agreement that the divisionof Wales and Monmouthshire between the South Wales electricity board and the Merseyside and North Wales Electricity board should be retained. It was suggested, however, that the Minister of fuel and Power might consider further whether the dividing line between the two areas might not be so adjusted as to bring the wholeof Cardiganshire into one Area.Other points in discussion were :  (a) It was suggested that the provision in Clause 1 (6) (c)requiring the policy of the Electricity Boards to be directed to securing the avoidance of &quot; undue preference &quot; in the provision ofelectricity supplies might preclude the use of differential charges for electricity as an instrument of economic planning.The Minister of Fuel and power  recalled that he had been compelled to insert a similar provision in Section 1 (1) (c) of the CoalIndustry Nationalisation Act. It would, therefore, be difficultto omit Clause 1 (6) (c) from the Electricity Bill.In further discussion there was general agreement that theright course would be to retain Clause 1 (6) (c) in its existing form,but to add a proviso to the sub-section enabling the requirement tobe relaxed in suitable cases.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that Clause 21 had originally provided for the payment of compensation to localauthorities who had applied some of the proceeds of their electricity undertakings towards the reduction of their rates or could show thatthe severance of their electricity undertakings from their other undertakings had involved an increase in the burden of theirestablishment charges. The provision had been dropped as a resultof discussion on the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries,but he must warn the Cabinet that he would be strongly pressed toprovide compensation on these lines when the Bill was beforeParliament and he might at a later stage have to seek the approvalof the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries for some con-cession to these claims of the local authorities.(c) The Minister of Transport pointed out that the provision in Clause 21 enabling compensation to be paid to local authoritiesand certain joint boards in respect of approved capital works onwhich expenditure had been incurred after 19th November, 1945,might lead to his being asked to make a similar concession in theTransport Bill.(d) It was explained that Clause 27 (3) would require amend-ment to provide for an appeal to the House of Lords.(e) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that Clause 42 (1) (b)made provision for the discussion of matters affecting safety, health and welfare of persons employed by Electricity Boards with appro-priate organisations. He had been pressed by organisationsrepresenting workers to amend the Clause so as to provide for consultation rather than merely for discussion and had promised to consider this suggestion.The Minister of Transport said that if the Clause were soamended, he would probably have to make a corresponding amend-ment in the Transport Bill. He would not object to this, if a clear distinction was made between the machinery for settling terms andconditions of employment and the machinery for dealing with matters affecting safety, health and welfare.(/) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the Billprovided for the dissolution of all company undertakings at the vesting date. Some of these undertakings owned foreign assets,and it would be necessary to make some suitable provision to safe-guard these assets.
Shipping. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (46)(Previous ,453) submitted by the Minister of Transport in pursuance of the reference: CabinetS request of 15th October for further information on.(46)86th (i) the possibility of reducing the level of freight rates; (ii) theConclusions, steps which could be taken to recover our carrying trade, and minute 1.) (iii) the age and quality of our merchant fleet.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to arrange for the issues raised in OP. (46) 453 to be considered in the first instance bythe Lord Presidents Committee.Palestine.illegal immigration.(previous reference:CM. (46) 104thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. At their meeting on 10th December the Cabinet had invited the Lord Chancellor to consider the legal implications of theproposal, which had been put to the Cabinet in OP. (46) 434, thatcommanding officers of His Majesty&apos;s ships should be given authority to arrest on the high seas certain specified categories ofvessels suspected of carrying illegal immigrants to Palestine. TheCabinet now had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(CP. (46) 463) reporting that, after consulting the Legal Adviserof the Foreign Office and representatives of the Admiralty, he was satisfied that this proposal could not be justified in internationallaw.The First Lord of the A dmirulty said that, in view of the legalopinion which had now been given by the Lord Chancellor, he didnot wish to proceed with the proposal which he had put forward in his memorandum OP. (46) 434.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it wouldhave been of great assistance to the authorities in Palestine if ithad been possible for the Royal Navy to intercept and divert onthe high seas ships carrying illegal immigrants to Palestine. Hecould not, however, press that this action should be taken, in viewof the Lord Chancellors opinion; and he accepted the position that other means must be sought of checking illegal immigration. Therewere some grounds for hoping that the shipment of large numbersof illegal immigrants might be suspended for a time, if jewish representatives agreed to attend the resumed proceedings of thePalestine Conference.The Cabinet-Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty would not proceed with the proposals submitted in OP. (46) 434 forarresting on the high seas certain specified categories ofvessels suspected of carrying illegal immigrants to palestine.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,IQth December, 1946.The Cabinet (1) Invited tJhe Minister of Fuel and Power to ^ consider inthe light of the discussion whether the dividing line between the South-West and the Merseyside and North-West areas should not be so redrawn as to include thewhole of Cardiganshire in the South-West area.(2) Agreed that the Bill should be amended to meet the points referred to at (a), (d), (e) and (/) above.(3) Took note that the Minister of Fuel and Power would present the Bill in dummy before Parliament was adjourned for the Christmas Recess, and would submit a revised draft to the Legislation Committee with aview to its being published early in January.
