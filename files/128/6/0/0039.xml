1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business-to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.On 2nd December the Second Reading of the Cotton(Centralised Buying) Bill would be taken.On 3rd December the Second Reading of the Trafalgar EstatesBill would be taken; and the draft Unemployment Assistance and supplementary Pension Regulations would be considered.The Committee Stage of the Exchange Control Bill would betaken on 4th and 5th December.On 6th December the House would take the Second Reading ofthe Pensions (Increase) Bill,&apos;the Committee and remaining stages of the Royal Marines Bill and India and Burma Orders.In discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer raised thequestion whether the Trafalgar Estates BUI should be postponed for a time. He had ascertained that certain members of theConservative Party would refrain from pressing their oppositionto the Bill if the Admiralty were willing to buy the house andgrounds of the Nelson family; and he was in consultation with theFirst Lord of the Admiralty on this point. The Chief Whip said,however, that the official leaders of the Opposition were in any eventproposing to resist the Bill. In these circumstances the cabinet agreed that the Second Reading of the Bill should be moved, asproposed, on 3rd December.The Lord President drew attention to the extent to which thetime of the House was being taken up by statements by Ministers atthe end of Questions. He suggested that all Ministers should be reminded that this method of making an announcement should notbe adopted unless the subject was urgent and important and therewere no other satisfactory means of giving the information toParliament. A regular procedure might also be introduced for enabling the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House to knowin advance when such statements were to be made; and for enablingadvance copies to be communicated, when necessary, to theOpposition.The Cabinet approved the Lord Presidents proposal. other suggestions made in discussion were that Ministers should seek tomake such statements shorter; that greater use might be made of thedevice of giving a short oral answer and circulating a more detailed statement in the Official Report; and that Ministers should not haveundue recourse to the practice of giving at the end of Questions the answer to a Question which had been set down for oral answer but had not been reached.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would circulate to all ministers a note on the need for restricting the amount ofParliamentary time taken by statements after Questions.2. The Cabinet had before them telegrams (New Yorktelegram No. 1981 and Washington telegrams Nos. 6821 and 6822of 26th November) reporting conversations which the foreign secretary and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington had held with the United States Secretary of State and with representativesof the Jewish Agency in New York about future policy in Palestine.These showed that the Jewish Agency were pressing for some assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government were favourably disposed towards Partition as a solution of the Palestine problem. They had suggested that, if they could be given in confidence some indication that His Majesty&apos;s Government were sympathetic towards this solution, this would have a beneficial effect on the forthcoming discussions at the Zionist Congress in Basle at which it would bedecided whether Jewish representatives should attend the PalestineConference.
The Cabinet were informed that similar suggestions had beenput forward at a recent meeting of the International Committee ofthe Labour Party Executive.The Prime Minister said that, while there were indications that opinion in various quarters was moving towards Partition as theonly practical solution of the Palestine problem, it was mostimportant that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not commit themselves to support of this solution before all the alternatives hadbeen fully discussed in the resumed proceedings of the PalestineConference. It might well turn out that no agreed settlement couldbe reached and that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelledto impose a solution; but it was essential that this result shouldemerge from the proceedings of the Conference itself and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should not at this stage prejudge issues which had still to be fully discussed with representatives of the two communities in Palestine. In these circumstances he thought thatthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s conversations in New York should continueto be purely exploratory. Even his discussions with members ofthe United States Administration should be on the basis of ascertaining the probable attitude of the United States government towards the various possible solutions.The Prime Minister submitted to the Cabinet a draft of the \reply which he proposed to send  to the Foreign Secretary&apos;stelegrams.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreement with jthe views expressed by the Prime Minister and with the terms ofthe reply which he proposed to send to the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no assurance could be given to the jewish agency at this stage that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere favourably disposed towards Partition as a solutionof the Palestine problem.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to reply to the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s telegrams in the terms of the draft which he had submitted to the Cabinet.Shipping.proposed inter-GovernmentalOrganisation.(previous reference:CM. (46) 18thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (46) 433) regarding the proposed establishment ofan Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.The Minister of Transport recalled that since the war therehad been a succession of temporary bodies for international consui-tation on shipping matters. The last of these, the United maritime consultative Council, came to an end on 31st October, 1946. At its final session it had recommended that, in its place, a permanentbody should be set up as a specialised agency of the United Nations,with the following objects : (i) to provide machinery for co-opera-tion in the field of Government regulation of shipping and in technical shipping matters; (ii) to encourage the removal of all forms of discriminatory action and unnecessary restrictions by governments; and (iii) to handle any international shippingproblems involving matters of general principle that might bereferred to it by the United Nations and were not suitable for settle-ment through the normal processes of international shippingbusiness. Membership of the organisation would be open to all nations. There would be an Assembly representing all members anda Council on which, although non-maritime members wouldrepresented, special weight would be given to maritime countries.It was proposed that the Economic and Social Council shouldsummon a conference to adopt the draft convention establishing thispermanent body. Meanwhile, a Provisional Council would be setup, with the same terms of reference.
The Minister of State supported these proposals in principle,but said that the Foreign Office had certain drafting comments onthe draft convention.The following points were made in discussion : (a) Several Ministers recalled the Cabinefs discussion on 7th November (CM. (46) 95th Conclusions, Minute 2), when concernhad been expressed at the growing number of international agencies.Was it necessary that a separate agency should be established forthese purposes, with its own headquarters and secretariat ? Couldit not form part of the Economic and Social Council&apos;?As against this, it was contended that if the Shipping Organi-sation became part of the Economic and Social Council it would bedifficult to prevent the non-maritime nations from obtaining an undue influence in its affairs. The establishment of a separate bodylinked with the United Nations as a specialised agency would makeit possible to ensure that effective control remained with the maritime nations. Such a body need not have a large headquarters staff.(b) We must be careful to avoid international obligations which would impede the recovery and growth of our mercantilemarine. In particular, we should avoid any international regula-tion of seamen&apos;s wages which might involve us in bringing our ratesup to the United States level and thus sacrificing our competitiveadvantage.It was, however, pointed out that the functions of the proposedorganisation would be primarily consultative and advisory; andthere should be no danger of our being forced by its action to coursescontrary to our own interest. In any event, the risk of competition from the shipping of countries with lower costs than ours was greater than the risk of our being compelled to conform to UnitedStates standards.(c) In this connection the question was raised whether, in determining the rates of wages paid by different nations, inter-national organisations should not make allowance for the value ofthe social services which were enjoyed in different countries. Thereal value of wages in this country was substantially enhanced bythe social services available.The Minister of Labour undertook to consider this point.id) The Minister of Labour considered it important that theproposed organisation should not interest itself in matters affectingwages and conditions of labour. If it did, its activities would con-conflict with those of the International Labour Organisation.It was agreed that the activities of the two bodies would needcorrelation.ie) It would be undesirable that the site of the new organisation should be in the United States.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the recommendations of the United maritime consultative Council for the establishment of apermanent Inter-Governmental Maritime consultative organisation as a specialised agency of the united nations.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinister of State, to arrange for the official steering committee on International Organisations to considerthe points raised in the Cabinefs discussion, and for afurther report to be submitted to the Cabinet on these points.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th November, 1946.
