1.   The Cabinet considered the following memoranda on there patriation of German prisoners of war i CP. (46) 327 : by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for War, to which was also annexed a memorandum setting out the views of the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster;CP. (46) 325 : by the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministryof Labour;CP. (46) 332 : by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries;CP. (46) 335 : by the Secretary, covering a message givingthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s views on this question.The Prime Minister said that there was substantial public support for the memorial (reproduced in Appendix &quot; A &quot; to CP.(46) 327) asking that, on humanitarian grounds, a definite scheme should be prepared for the repatriation of German prisoners, ifnecessary by categories, at the earliest possible dates, and that thisscheme should be announced to the prisoners so as to terminate the uncertainty in which they were at present left. The time wasalso approaching when it would be to our advantage that thesemen should be employed in Germany rather than here; for, whenmore coal was available for use in the British Zone, a shortage ofman-power would begin to show itself in many of Germany&apos;principal industries. On both grounds, therefore, the time had come to initiate a scheme for the progressive repatriation of these prisoners. He doubted whether it would be expedient, as suggestedin paragraph 9 of CP. (46) 327, to fix a final date by which all german prisoners would have been returned to Germany or toestablish precisely the numbers to be retained for employment hereat intervening dates. It was clear, however, that all Departmentsmust now frame their man-power plans on the assumption that therewould be a progressive reduction in the numbers of prisoners avail-able for employment in this country. Agriculture, in particular,was relying extensively on prisoner labour; and, while it seemedinevitable that substantial numbers of prisoners should be retained for employment here in the harvest of 1947, other means wouldhave to be found of providing the labour required in agriculture in 1948. Steps were now being taken to bring about 160,000 Polesto this country. Most of these ought to be put to useful employ-ment while they were here; and the general policy should be tomake increasing use of Poles and other free foreign labour through-out 1947 and 1948 as the total of prisoner labour progressivelydeclined.The Cabinet considered the Departmental demands forprisoner labour in 1946-47. It was disturbing that these demands,as set out in the Annex to CP. (46) 325, showed no tendency to diminish throughout the period. Several Ministers stated, however,that if a policy of repatriating prisoners were adopted, they would reduce their demands for prisoner labour. Thus, the Ministry of fuel and Power would forego their demand for 2,500 from Novem-ber 1946 to April 1947 and 1,500 from May to October 1947. TheMinistry of Food would withdraw a demand for 1,500 for non-seasonal work; but could not at present reduce their requirement of 3,000 to 4,000 for seasonal work on food production, as theTrade Unions concerned had hitherto declined to agree to theemployment of Poles in this work. In discussion it was suggestedthat the Trade Unions might adopt a more reasonable attitude/udetowards the employment of free foreign labour when it was made clear to them that deficiencies could not indefinitely be met by theuse of prisoner labour. On this aspect of the matter the Cabinet&apos;general conclusion was that the Official Committee on the Employ -ment of Prisoners of War should review the Departmental demands in the light of the new situation which would be created by theintroduction of a scheme for the progressive repatriation of GermanRepatriationof Prisonersof War.(previous reference:C.M.(45)45thConclusions,Minute 2.)
prisoners; and that in making their allocations the Committeeshould be guided by the general principle that in the later monthsof 1947 and in 1948 the use of prisoner labour should be confined,in the main, to food production, housing and industries ancillarythereto.As regards the rate of repatriation, The Minister of Transportsaid that movement at the rate of about 15,000 a month could bearranged without detriment to the shipping programme. TheCabinet agreed that a scheme of repatriation should be worked outon the basis that, until further notice, repatriation would proceed at the rate of 15,000 a month.As regards priorities, it was agreed that a start should be madeat once with the repatriation of the anti-Nazi prisoners (&quot; whites &quot;)now in this country. In view of the local elections which wereto be held in Germany on the 15th September and the 13th October,it was important that as many as possible of these should be repatriated during the current month, and also that an announce-ment of the repatriation scheme should, if possible, be made beforethe 15th September. Among the prisoners holding no strong political views (&quot; greys &quot;), priority in repatriation should be givento those whose early return to the British Zone of Germany was required on political or economic grounds and those whose early returncould be justified by reason of family circumstances or on othercompassionate grounds. Subject to those priorities, a system shouldbe devised for repatriation by groups based, in the main, on lengthof captivity. It was important that, in working out such a scheme,care should be taken to avoid too close a similarity with the schemeof demobilisation from the British Armed Forces : it was partic-particularly important to avoid a situation in which it could be saidthat prisoners were being repatriated after a shorter period ofservice in the German forces than that for which a man was required to serve before being demobilised from the British armed forces.As regards the form of the public announcement of the scheme,it was the view of the Cabinet that it was preferable that thisshould not go into such detail about the release dates of the variousgroups that every prisoner would be able to calculate when he was due for repatriation. The main need was to satisfy British opinion and the prisoners themselves that an orderly scheme had been devised for the progressive repatriation of all prisoners save the senior officers and ardent Nazis (&quot;blacks&quot;), for whose repatria-tion no provision need yet be made; that the movement would proceed for the present at the rate of 15,000 a month, and thatthe selection would take account of the political views of the prisoners, Germany&apos;s need for skilled men, family circumstances and length of captivity. In view of experience with the demobilisationscheme, it was thought preferable that the announcement shouldnot go too closely into detail and should not look too far ahead.Other points made in discussion were : (a) Other Occupying Powers would have to be consulted in due course about the return of prisoners now in our hands whose homesin Germany were outside the British Zone. The War Office hadtaken steps to obtain information about the numbers whose homeswere in other Zones.(&amp;) Outside the United Kingdom the largest British holding of German prisoners was in the Middle East, where 104,000 were held. The Cabinet were informed that, apart from about 2,000&quot;whites&quot; who could be released in the near future, it was likely that most of these would have to be retained in the Middle Eastuntil at least the middle of 1947 for employment in the construc-tion of military installations in the Canal Zone.(c) About 4,000 German prisoners were held in Canada and about 1,500 in Australia. Dominion Governments should be informed of the arrangements proposed for the repatriation of german prisoners under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, so that they might consider whether they should
take corresponding action for the repatriation of German prisonersunder their control. This aspect of the matter might be discussedthrough the medium of the Imperial Prisoners of War Committee.(d) Some 600 German prisoners were still retained in gibraltar, in accommodation which was urgently required for thecivil population. Another 118 were detained in East Africa. Itwas desirable that any of these who were not engaged in usefulemployment should be repatriated at an early date.(e) When a repatriation scheme had been announced, it was likely that some further incentives would have to be provided ifa reasonable standard of work was to be obtained from thoseprisoners who had to look forward to a substantial further periodof employment in this country. In particular, the possibility of increased pay would have to be considered. This question shouldbe examined by a committee of officials representing the Depart-ments primarily concerned.The Cabinets conclusions were as follows : (1) Although it was not yet possible to prescribe a date bywhich all German prisoners of war would have been returned to Germany, a scheme should now be set on foot for the progressive repatriation of german prisoners under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the TJnited Kingdom.(2) All Departments should in future proceed on the assump-tion that there would be a progressive reduction in thenumbers of prisoners of war available for employmentin this country. The Committee on the Employment ofPrisoners of War should review the Departmentaldemands in the light of this decision, and in making their allocations should be guided by the general principle that in the later months of 1947 and in 1948the use of prisoner labour should be confined, in themain, to food production, housing and industriesancillary thereto.(3) The rate of repatriation from the United Kingdom shouldbe 15,000 a month until further notice.(4) In view of the local elections to be held in Germany onthe 15th September and the 13th October, the new policy should be announced as soon as possible and efforts should be made to repatriate forthwith as many aspossible of the anti-Nazi prisoners (&quot; whites &quot;) now inthis country.(5) A detailed scheme should be worked out for the earlyrepatriation of all other German prisoners, except senior officers and ardent Nazis (&quot;blacks&quot;) for whose returnno provision should yet be made. The scheme should provide for the earlier repatriation of men Avhose earlyreturn to the British Zone of Germany was required on political or economic grounds and of those whose earlyreturn could be justified by family circumstances oron other compassionate grounds. Subject to thesepriorities, release should be by groups based on lengthof captivity.(6) The scheme should include provision enabling german prisoners to volunteer for continued employment in thiscountry on modified terms.(7) Except for about 2,000 &quot; whites &quot; who would be released in the near future, all the German prisoners now in theMiddle East would probably have to be retained untilat least the middle of 1947 for employment in the con-struction of military installations in the Canal Zone.(8) Dominion Governments should be informed of this policyof progressive repatriation and invited to considerwhether parallel action could be taken in respect ofGerman prisoners held by them.[32426-^10] b 3
(9) The Lord Privy Seal, together with the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for War and the Parlia-mentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, should super-intend the preparation of a detailed scheme of repatriation on the lines indicated in the foregoingconclusions; and should submit for the approval of theCabinet an outline of the scheme and a draft of a public announcement.(10) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for war should arrange for a Committee of officials representingthe Departments primarily concerned to consider what further relaxation of restrictions or amelioration of conditions (including increased pay) could be authorised in order to provide incentives for those prisoners whowere to be retained in this country for a substantialfurther period of employment. A report from thisCommittee should be available for consideration by theCabinet at the same time as the draft announcement about the repatriation scheme (Conclusion (9) above).Germany. 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivyExports of Seal (CP. (46) 333) regarding the export of coal from the british coal from the   Zone of Germany.British Zone. The Lord pr[Vy Seal recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on(Previous the 1st August that coal exports from the British Zone should be reference: maintained at about the current monthly level of 950,000 tons .M.(46)76th pending the receipt of the report of the quadripartite CommitteeConclusions, of experts which was examining methods of increasing Germany&apos;sMinute 10.) coal production and was to make recommendations regarding theprinciples to be applied in allocating that production. It had been expected that this report would be available before the time came to make the export allocations for the period October-December;but it was now clear that the report would not be available beforefresh allocations had to be made. The Cabinet&apos;s attention hadalready been drawn to the serious extent to which the economy ofthe British Zone was declining owing to shortage of coal, and thisdecline was now affecting the political situation. In these circum-stances it would be dangerous to make export allocations at thecurrent level for the whole of the period October-December. It wastherefore recommended that, in the discussion of further alloca-tions which was shortly to open in Berlin, our representative shouldtake the line that allocations should now be made for the month ofOctober only, in the hope that the report of the Expert Committeewould be available before allocations had to be made for the twosucceeding months; and that in October a minimum quantity of3,800,000 tons of coal should be retained for use in the three western zones of Germany. If this recommendation were accepted, theamount of coal available for export in October from the british zone to countries in Western Europe would be only 600,000 tons, ascompared with the current monthly rate of 950,000 tons. A reduc-tion of this magnitude would, no doubt, be opposed by France andother Western European Powers; but the Lord Privy Seal saidthat he was satisfied that, despite this opposition, the time had come when a larger proportion of Germany&apos;s coal production mustbe retained for the purpose of arresting the decline in the economy of Western Germany.At the Prime Ministers invitation, Sir Sholto Douglas gave the Cabinet an account of the serious economic difficulties whichwere arising in the British Zone owing to the shortage of coal. Thecondition of economic distress to which the Zone had been reducedwas a fertile breeding ground for Communist agitation; and on political as well as economic grounds it was now essential that astrong stand should be made to retain a larger proportion of the ruhr&apos;s coal production for use in Western Germany.   The real
need of the Western Zones was estimated at 4 - 2 million tons ofcoal, of which 2-5 million tons were required in the British Zone;but if the whole of this amount were retained, there would be virtually no coal for export to other European countries. As a compromise, therefore, he had advocated the retention of 3 - 8 million tons for the three Western Zones, which would involve a cut of350,000 tons a month in exports to Western European countries.He believed that the United States authorities in Berlin would favour some such reduction in exports; and even the french authorities were expecting some cut, though they had been thinkingin terms of a much smaller reduction. He had no doubt that theproposal which the Lord Privy Seal had commended to the cabinet should be put forward and strongly supported in the forthcoming discussions in Berlin.Sir Orme Sargent said that this question had been consideredby the Foreign Secretary at a meeting which he had held in Parison the previous day with representatives of the Foreign Office, theControl Office and the Control Commission. He read to the cabinet a telegram (No. 674 of the 3rd September) describing the course ifaction which the Foreign Secretary recommended as a result ofthat meeting. The Foreign Secretary considered that in the forth-coming discussions in Berlin we should propose that Germany&apos;scoal exports to Western Europe should be reduced by 350,000 tonsa month for the four months October 1946 to January 1947, andthat American exports of coal to Europe should be increased bya corresponding amount. The United States Secretary of state was sympathetic to the principle of this proposal and had under-taken to examine it further. It had also been discussed with members of the United States Delegation in Paris, who had agreedthat, subject to the concurrence of their representative in Berlin,they would ask their Government to consider what increased exportscould be made available for Europe. There was therefore some prospect that, at the forthcoming meeting in Berlin, the UnitedStates representative would be able to anounce that the proposed reduction in coal exports from the Ruhr would be made up by increased exports from the United States; and at the worst heshould be able to say that the United States Government would use their best endeavours to bridge the gap by increased exports from the United States. If, however, it should prove impossibleto complete these enquiries in time for any such offer to be madeby the United States representative at the forthcoming meeting in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary considered that we should proposethat coal exports from the Ruhr to Western Europe should bereduced by 350,000 tons for the month of October only, and that consideration of the allocations for succeeding months should be postponed until the report of the Expert Committee became available.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that if, at the forthcoming discussions in Berlinon the allocation of German coal exports, the UnitedStates representative were authorised to offer increased exports of American coal to Western Europe on thelines indicated in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s telegramNo. 674 of the 3rd September, our representative should propose that the export of Ruhr coal to Western europe should be reduced by 350,000 tons a month for theperiod of four months from October 1946 to January1947.(2) Agreed that, if the United States representative had notbeen authorised to make such an offer, our representa-tive should propose a reduction of 350,000 tons for themonth of October only, as proposed in CP. (46) 333,and should ask that consideration of the allocationsfor succeeding months should be deferred until . thereport of the Expert Committee became available.
India. 3.   The   Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by theConduct of Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for IndiaForeign (CP. (46) 329) on the extent to which His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentAffairs. could discharge their responsibilities under the existing constitu-tion for the control of Indians foreign relations while the interim government held office in India.It was to be hoped that the Interim Government would beready to accept a measure of United Kingdom control in the Iconduct of its foreign affairs.   In that event, it was suggested that 1the control should be restricted to the minimum necessary to secure I(i) the fulfilment of treaty obligations entered into by His Majesty&apos;s &apos;Government as the Power responsible for the foreign relations of India; and (ii) that steps were not taken without the knowledge and approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government which might affect jthat Governments relations with foreign Powers or her essentialstrategic interests.v.   If the Interim Government were not ready to accept any suchmeasure of control very awkward situations might arise.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government might find themselves in a position in which they   would  be  regarded by foreign  Governments   as  having Iresponsibility for India&apos;s foreign policy but would be unable to Idischarge that responsibility.   It was not possible, however, to jdecide in advance what action would have to be taken in anyparticular case.The memorandum also&apos;pointed out that hitherto the relations of the United Kingdom Government with countries adjacent toIndia had to a large extent been conducted through the Govern-ment of India and to some extent had been financed by them.Under the new constitutional position fresh arrangements mustbe made and the memorandum proposed :-(a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should be ready to main-tain and staff from United Kingdom sources Missions in Kabul andKatmandu for the purpose of representing United Kingdom, as distinct from Indian, interests;(&amp;) That, in preparation for withdrawal of the Indiancontribution to diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia,investigation should be made of the consular posts in Persia whichthe United Kingdom would have to maintain;(c) That a decision in principle should now be taken to assumeas rapidly as possible direct control of, and responsibility for, thePolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf and his subordinate agencies.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the proposals contained in the memorandum. The Chancellor of the Exchequerasked, however, that the Treasury should be further consulted onthe financial aspect of the proposals made for United kingdom representation in countries adjacent to India.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals put forward in CP. (46) 329, as summarised above;(2) Took note that the Foreign Office and India Office would consult further with the Treasury regarding the total amount and the phasing of the expenditure involved inthe changes proposed in the means of representingUnited Kingdom interests in countries adjacent toIndia.
4. At their meeting on the 14th August the Cabinet had invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, what steps could be taken to check theoccupation of hutted camps by squatters.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (46) 330) reporting that, in pursuance of thisdecision, he had arranged for a Committee of officials to be appointedto keep this problem under constant review and to give guidance to regional Committees of officials which had been set up to deallocally with day-to-day problems. A report by the Chairman ofthe official Committee was annexed to this memorandum.The Home Secretary said that the situation had become lessacute since it had last been discussed by the Cabinet. Though therewould be difficulties when the time came to evict squatters who had established themselves in the camps, he hoped that fresh encroach-ments on the camps would be checked by the steps which had nowbeen taken by the Service Departments to ensure that unoccupiedcamps were not left unguarded. The arrangements by which theService Departments would in future give at least three months&apos;notice of their intention to relinquish possession of premises wouldalso tend to shorten the interval during which premises were leftuntenanted before they were taken over for a new use.In discussion, reference was made to a recent occasion on whichsquatters were said to have been able to establish themselves in anR.A.F. camp at Dawes Hill, High Wycombe, because it had been left unguarded. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forAir undertook to make enquiries into this and to submit a reportto the Prime Minister.Reference was also made to camps at Bamber Bridge andLancaster which had been earmarked for use as Training Centresby the Ministry of Education. The Minister of Works undertook to make enquiries about these camps and to inform the Minister ofEducation whether the Department previously in occupation hadrelinquished possession of them and, if so, what arrangements couldbe made for guarding them until such time as the Ministry ofEducation could take them over.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Home Secretary&apos;s memo-randum CP. (46) 330.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4:th September, 1946.
