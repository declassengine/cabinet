ForeignAffairs.PeaceConference.Anglo-EgyptianTreatyNegotiations.(previous reference:C.M.(46)76thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were glad to seethe Foreign Secretary back again after his illness. They wouldobserve that, after prolonged discussion, the Procedure Committeeof the Peace Conference had finally accepted the British compromise on the voting procedure for the Conference. He did not think thatthe struggle which had taken place on this matter could have been avoided and, on the whole, the Delegations from the Dominions were co-operating well with the United Kingdom Delegation.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to go to Paris later in the week, as it was desirable that someone should be there whowas fully aware of the background to the present Conference. Theattitude of the United States both at the Berlin Conference and inthe negotiations since then had greatly weakened our bargaining power with regard to the Balkans. It was, however, vital for us toarrive at a settlement both in Italy and in the Balkans, in view ofthe great strain which a continuation of the present situation would impose on our resources; and he was reasonably confident that, if we took a firm line, we should be able to secure the setting up of a genuine international regime at Trieste and reach a settlement inthe Balkans which would both relieve the pressure on Greece and turkey and enable us to re-establish our commercial interests in roumania.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that no further concessions would be made in the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty nego-tiations. He felt that the revised draft of Article 2 of the Treatycontained in Foreign Office telegram No. 31 represented the utmostlimit to which we could go if we were to maintain our position in theMiddle East, and, rather than yield further on this Article, weshould face the alternative of failing to reach agreement on aTreaty.The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary.Palestine.Future Policy.(previous reference:CM. (46) 76thConclusions,Minute 5.)2.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had had a long talk with Dr. Weizmann on the 2nd August.Dr. Weizmann had also visited the Colonial Office on the 6thAugust. He was a sick man and was shortly to go into hospital foran operation. He had therefore not been able to attend the meetingof the Jewish Agency Executive in Paris.Dr. Weizmann had not been unfavourable to the governments proposals for future policy in Palestine. He had, however, madethe following three points : (i) the Jewish province should not be smaller than the territory proposed for the Jewish State as a conse-quence of the report of the Peel Commission; (ii) the central administration should not continue for more than three or, at themost, five years; and (iii) the Negeb should be handed over at once tothe Jews, who would, he was confident, be able to develop it.Unfortunately, the Jewish Agency Executive, inDr. Weizmann&apos;s absence, had apparently rejected the idea ofattending the Conference to discuss the Governments proposals onthe ground that these did not form a basis for negotiation.Dr. Weizmann was not certain that this was their final view andhad asked three or four members of the Executive to visit Londonwithin the next two days, when he would try to persuade them to change their minds. He had also promised to suggest to the Secre-tary of State the names of Jews, not members of the Jewish Agency,who might be invited to the Conference.As regards the Arabs, it had not yet been possible to deliver an invitation to Jemal Husseini and his colleagues on the Arab Higher[32426-8] b 2
Committee, since they were at present in Egypt. Invitations had now been accepted by all the Arab Governments except Egypt, iraq and the Yemen.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of these statements by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.Illegal The Cabinet then considered two memoranda by the SecretaryImmigration.    0f State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 310 and 320) recording recent developments regarding illegal immigration into Palestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that there were atpresent 2,252 illegal immigrants at Athlit clearance camp, 2,232 onboard ship in Haifa harbour, and a further 2,500 believed to be ontheir way to Palestine, with more expected to follow. Those inAthlit camp and on board ship would alone exhaust the quota up toDecember. It was not possible for the Palestine authorities toguard any more illegal immigrants in Palestine and the choice nowlay between anticipating the quota by releasing a number of the immigrants in Palestine, and trans-shipping those now in Haifaharbour and any further arrivals to British ships with a view totheir removal to Cyprus. There were most serious disadvantages in both courses. The former would almost certainly lead to a clash with the Arabs, so that we should simultaneously have to facetrouble with both communities, and would also cause us embarrass-ment throughout the Middle East. The latter, apart from the like-lihood of awkward incidents, would almost certainly end any chanceof co-operation with the Jews in Palestine, if not outside it.Despite this, the High Commissioner recommended that a decision should be taken in favour of this course and the Secretary of Stateagreed with this view. There was at the moment accommodation available in Cyprus for 1,200 illegal immigrants. This could beincreased to 2,000 without much delay, and the Governor of Cyprushad been asked to make arrangements to receive up to a maximum of 10,000 persons.   The necessary transport could be made available.The Secretary of State said that he had pointed out to dr. Weizmann that the continuance of illegal immigration duringthe next few weeks must affect adversely the chances that the plan forthe immigration of 100,000 Jews to Palestine would be implemented in the near future and had asked him and his colleagues in theJewish Agency in their own interest to do what they could to bringthe traffic to an end. Dr. Weizmann had said that the present floodof illegal immigrants was due to recent pogroms in Poland andhad suggested that to meet the situation some 5,000 or 6,000 certifi-cates should be allocated forthwith out of the 100,000 which wouldhave to be granted sooner or later. Dr. Weizmann had also saidthat if the immigrants now in Haifa or on their way could beadmitted to Palestine he would do his best to bring further illegal immigration to an end. Dr. Weizmann had made light of the possi-bility of trouble from the Arabs.The Secretary of State said that Dr. Weizman&apos;s proposal was clearly impracticable and there seemed to be no alternative butto ask the Cabinet to agree in principle that the illegal immigrantsnow in Haifa harbour and any further arrivals should be sent to cyprus or some other suitable destination. Annexed to CP. (46) 320was the text of a public announcement which would be made if thisdecision were taken. The High Commissioner had been consulted about the terms of the announcement and had suggested some minor amendments. At the same time the High Commissioner had recom-mended that action and the publication of the announcement shouldbe deferred until, at the earliest, the 11th August, in order to allowtime for certain necessary preparations to be made.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, after con-suiting the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Land Forces, he was satisfied that the civil and military authorities between them had
all the resources necessary to carry out the operation of trans-shipping the immigrants and removing them in the most humanemanner possible. It was important not to regard Cyprus as the onlydestination to which immigrants could be sent, since it might wellbe impossible to find room there for all the immigrants. If thereshould be strong reactions among the Jewish community inPalestine, the military authorities would be able to handle thesituation. If, on the other hand, the immigrants were allowed toenter Palestine there would be every likelihood of trouble with theArab as well as the Jewish community, which the militaryauthorities were anxious to avoid.The Minister of Transport confirmed that two ships were being sent to Haifa, each capable of carrying 800 persons. These shouldbe adequate to deal with the numbers at present in sight. He hopedthat he would be given due notice if further shipping was needed.In discussion there was general agreement that action on thelines suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theChief of the Imperial General Staff was the only effective way of stopping illegal immigration. There was every reason to believethat if the illegal immigrants now in Haifa harbour or at sea wereadmitted to Palestine this would merely encourage more to come,and the continuance of the traffic would cause the administration ofPalestine to break down and lead to trouble with the Arabs. Inaddition to diverting to Cyprus or other destinations immigrantswho had reached Palestine, it was important that everything possible should be done to stop the traffic at source. There were signs that the steps which had latterly been taken were having someeffect. Thus, in Roumania one ship was being held up, and certainSouth American Governments were taking steps to ensure that theirconsuls did not issue visas indiscriminately. On the other hand, our ambassador was doubtful whether the Italian Government could or would take effective action, and had suggested that it might be preferable to take action through the British military authorities in italy and by the diversion of ships at sea.The First Sea Lord said that it would be impossible for theBritish naval forces in the Mediterranean to patrol the coast ofItaly in addition to their many other commitments. Moreover, ithad already been pointed out that the diversion of immigrant shipson the high seas was not feasible.Several Ministers expressed the view that it should be possibleto press the Italian Government to take effective measures them-selves, and the Foreign Secretary undertook to consider whether atelegram should not be sent to the Ambassador in this sense.The following further points were made :  (a) An important factor in considering the timing of the action and its announcement would be the probable effect on opinion in theUnited States. There was still a chance that President Trumanmight accept the plan for the future of Palestine prepared by theBritish and American experts. But news of the action now pro-posed would inevitably strengthen the forces working againstacceptance. Accordingly there would be considerable advantage in delaying action until President Truman had reached a decision.(b) Special care should be taken to secure favourable publicity for the action proposed, both in this country and in the UnitedStates. The draft announcement should be greatly strengthened.It should be less apologetic, should stress the patience which theGovernment had displayed, and should expose to the full the natureof the traffic and its implications. It should also avoid suggesting that illegal immigrants would be given priority in enteringPalestine.(c) It was essential that we should make it clear that we werenot indifferent to the very real sufferings of some of the Jews inEurope.  Should not protests be sent to the Governments of Poland,
Plans for removal ofNon-essentialBritishPersonnel.and possibly of other Eastern European countries, regarding the anti-Jewish measures which, it was alleged, were still continuing,and might not such protests be published ?The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider whether sufficient evidence was available to justify action on these lines.It was also suggested that, if such protests were, in fact, made,a reference to them might be included in the proposed announce-ment.The Cabinet -(2) Agreed in principle that those illegal immigrants now onboard ship in Haifa harbour, and any further arrivals,should be trans-shipped and removed to Cyprus or other suitable areas.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Transport and the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, to ensure that all preparatorymeasures for this move were taken immediately.(4) Agreed that the actual movement of the illegal immigrantsand the announcement of the new policy should not takeplace until the 11th August at the earliest, and that the exact date should be fixed by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in consultation with the Prime Minister,the Foreign Secretary and the other Ministers imme-diately concerned.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, afterconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to submit to thePrime Minister a revised draft announcement on thelines indicated in the discussion, and to consult with theLord President regarding the arrangements for givingpublicity to it.(6) Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue his efforts to persuade the European Governments concerned to pre-vent illegal immigrants from leaving European ports,and, in particular, to consider whether the ItalianGovernment could not be induced to take effective stepsto prevent ships from leaving Italy.(7) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether represen-tations could be made to the Polish and other eastern european Governments regarding the persecution of jews in those countries, and whether any such repre-sentations might be published.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinetthat the High Commissioner for Palestine was anxious that a plan should be drawn up for the removal from Palestine of British women and children and other non-essential personnel. He did not suggestthat a decision was now required that they should be removed, buthe thought that it would be well, in view of the possible deterioration of the situation, that the Palestine Government should be ready in case such a decision became necessary. The number involved would be about 2,000. The Palestine authorities had alreadyprepared a plan for the withdrawal of these persons as far as EgyptIt was, however, undesirable that they should remain there, and theHigh Commissioner was now anxious that a plan should be preparedfor their subsequent removal to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-(8) Agreed that a plan should be prepared on the lines suggested, and invited the Secretary of State for theColonies to take the necessary steps to this end.
Civil Aviation.Civil aircraft requirements.(previous reference:CM. (46)25thConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Cabinet bad before them a joint memorandum by theMinister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation (CP. (46)317) covering the first interim report of the interdepartmental committee on Civil Aircraft Requirements. On the basis of thisreport the memorandum recommended (i) that six Boeing strato--Cruisers should be bought at a costof about $12 million, in order to enable the UnitedKingdom to compete effectively with the United states on the North Atlantic route between 1948 and 1950;(ii) that, should any conflict arise in allocating design and production capacity in the United Kingdom, priority should be given to civil aircraft of the types enumerated in paragraph 20 of the memorandum;(iii) that the Minister of Supply should be authorised in suitable cases to encourage aircraft manufacturers to lay down production in advance of actual orders, ifnecessary, and, in appropriate cases and with suitablesafeguards, to underwrite such production; and(iv) that special steps should be taken to strengthen thetechnical staffs of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and ofthe Air Division of the Ministry of Supply.The Minister of Civil A aviation said that he was satisfied that unless a fleet of strato--Cruisers were purchased it would be impos-sible for the United Kingdom to hold her own on the North atlantic route in the years 1948 to 1950. The strato--Cruiser would operate at a speed of 300 miles per hour and an operating cost of 2\d. perpassenger mile as compared with 240 miles per hour and 5d. perpassenger mile for the Tudor I, 230 miles per hour and %\d.per passenger mile for the Constellation, and 400 miles per hourand &apos;6d. per passenger mile for the Rainbow. A fleet of six strato--Cruisers would enable 750 passengers to be carried back andforward across the Atlantic per week at a fare of  65. Thecorresponding figures for the Tudor I were 190 passengers at a fareof  110; for the Constellation, 490 passengers at a fare of  78,and for the Rainbow, 950 passengers at a fare of  58. Since by international agreement fares were fixed on the basis of the efficientoperation of modern aircraft, we should be compelled to give an exchequer subsidy towards bringing down the fares if we continuedto rely on Tudor I&apos;s and Constellations during the years 1948-50.On the other hand, if the proposed purchase of strato--Cruisers weremade we should obtain, on a conservative estimate, dollar earningsamounting to $14 million gross in the two years 1948 and 1949.The purchase price included initial outfits of spare parts, and he believed that the purchase of these American aircraft was anessential step to tide the United Kingdom over the two difficult years before the Brabazon IV came into service. There would be ampleopportunities for using the Constellations which we had alreadypurchased on other services or, failing that, of selling them overseas.He was satisfied that, despite its lower speed, the strato--Cruiserwas a better investment than the Rainbow.In discussion a number of Ministers expressed misgivings aboutthe proposal for a further purchase of American aircraft. Thefollowing were the main points made : *(a) It was recalled that at a meeting of the Committee on the socialisation of Industries on the 24th January (S.I. (M) (46)1st Meeting, Minute 2), when the purchase of Constellations hadbeen considered, the Minister of Supply had stated that any announcement that it was proposed to buy new American planes fora British air service was likely to be seriously detrimental to theexport prospects of the British aircraft industry, and that onceBritish operators had obtained American types there would be atendency for them to wish to continue to use them. He had there-fore urged that the British operators should wait for the Tudor I aircraft, twenty of which were expected to be available by October1946.   Moreover, the Lord President had stated in the House of
Plans for removal ofNon-essentialBritishPersonnel.and possibly of other Eastern European countries, regarding the anti-Jewish measures which, it was alleged, were still continuing,and might not such protests be published ?The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider whether sufficient evidence was available to justify action on these lines.It was also suggested that, if such protests were, in fact, made,a reference to them might be included in the proposed announce-ment.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed in principle that those illegal immigrants now onboard ship in Haifa harbour, and any further arrivals,should be trans-shipped and removed to Cyprus or other suitable areas.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Transport and the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, to ensure that all preparatorymeasures for this move were taken immediately.(4) Agreed that the actual movement of the illegal immigrantsand the announcement of the new policy should not takeplace until the 11th August at the earliest, and that the exact date should be fixed by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in consultation with the Prime Minister,the Foreign Secretary and the other Ministers imme-diately concerned.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, afterconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to submit to thePrime Minister a revised draft announcement on thelines indicated in the discussion, and to consult with theLord President regarding the arrangements for givingpublicity to it.(6) Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue his efforts to persuade the European Governments concerned to pre-vent illegal immigrants from leaving European ports,and, in particular, to consider whether the ItalianGovernment could not be induced to take effective stepsto prevent ships from leaving Italy.(7) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether represen-tations could be made to the Polish and other eastern european Governments regarding the persecution of jews in those countries, and whether any such repre-sentations might be published.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinetthat the High Commissioner for Palestine was anxious that a plan should be drawn up for the removal from Palestine of British women and children and other non-essential personnel.

3. The Cabinet bad before them a joint memorandum by theMinister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation (CP.

A fleet of six strato--Cruisers would enable 750 passengers to be carried back andforward across the Atlantic per week at a fare of  65. Thecorresponding figures for the Tudor I were 190 passengers at a fareof  110; for the Constellation, 490 passengers at a fare of  78,and for the Rainbow, 950 passengers at a fare of  58. Since by international agreement fares were fixed on the basis of the efficientoperation of modern aircraft, we should be compelled to give an exchequer subsidy towards bringing down the fares if we continuedto rely on Tudor I&apos;s and Constellations during the years 1948-50.On the other hand, if the proposed purchase of strato--Cruisers weremade we should obtain, on a conservative estimate, dollar earningsamounting to $14 million gross in the two years 1948 and 1949.The purchase price included initial outfits of spare parts, and he believed that the purchase of these American aircraft was anessential step to tide the United Kingdom over the two difficult years before the Brabazon IV came into service. There would be ampleopportunities for using the Constellations which we had alreadypurchased on other services or, failing that, of selling them overseas.He was satisfied that, despite its lower speed, the strato--Cruiserwas a better investment than the Rainbow.In discussion a number of Ministers expressed misgivings aboutthe proposal for a further purchase of American aircraft. Thefollowing were the main points made : &apos;(a) It was recalled that at a meeting of the Committee on the socialisation of Industries on the 24th January (S.I. (M) (46)1st Meeting, Minute 2), when the purchase of Constellations hadbeen considered, the Minister of Supply had stated that any announcement that it was proposed to buy new American planes fora British air service was likely to be seriously detrimental to theexport prospects of the British aircraft industry, and that onceBritish operators had obtained American types there would be atendency for them to wish to continue to use them. He had there-fore urged that the British operators should wait for the Tudor I aircraft, twenty of which were expected to be available by October1946.   Moreover, the Lord President had stated in the House of
Commons on the 24th January, on the authority of the ministers of Supply and Civil Aviation, that the purchase of Constellationswas a special isolated case and that once it had been made we should go bapk to British products.(6) Even after full allowance had been made for the handicap jof the war years, the British aircraft industry did not seem to beshowing enough enterprise and foresight in the development ofnew types. Was there not a tendency on the part of British manu-facturers to make forward plans on the basis of producing aircraft which would be competitive with current American types ratherthan with the improved American types which would be in theair two or three years hence?(c) Were we not concentrating unduly on the North atlantic route, and did not the attempt to compete on that route lead to an undue development of large types of aircraft which could use onlyone or two airfields in the United Kingdom ?   The development of shipping showed that it was uneconomic to devote too large a pro-portion of our resources to maintaining our prestige on this route, jjand that a surer foundation for the British aircraft industry would be the production of aircraft for use on other routes.(cl) It was doubtful whether the average passenger regarded jthe speed at which an aircraft operated as of paramount importance, fand it might well be possible to offset any inferiority in the speed Iof British aircraft by guaranteeing passengers greater comfort and 1safety, and by taking special steps to provide convenient trans- 1port to and from the airfield and to minimise customs and passport Iformalities.(e) From the point of view of our export trade, Were British (lmanufacturers not dissipating their resources over too many jjdifferent types? Thus, it was stated in paragraph 7 of CP. (46) j317 that more than 30 different types of civil aircraft were on the stocks and that Government orders for some 350 aircraft of 23 Idifferent types were outstanding.The Minister of Supply said that, since a period of five years fnormally elapsed between the date when the requirement for a new Iairliner was first stated and the date of its coming into service, Iand since in 1942 and 1943 all British resources had been concen- \trated on the production of combat aircraft, it was inevitable that 1in the years 1948-50 we should have no new British civil aircraft Icapable of competing effectively with American aircraft on the North Atlantic route. It was hoped to introduce the Tudor I, which pwas a stop-gap type developed from the Lincoln bomber, on the North Atlantic service early in 1947; but the strato--Cruiser, which.would come into service in the autumn of 1947, would completely!outclass both the Tudor I and the Constellation; and from thenlonwards until 1950, when the Brabazon IV was due to come into!service, there would be no new British type capable of competing!with the American strato--Cruisers and Rainbows. He regretted!that his hope that the Tudor I would be in service by October 1946JJhad been disappointed, but in the production of new types of air-1craft delays were inevitable owing to the need to introduce modi-lfixations to satisfy the requirements of the Air Registration Board;and of the operators as well as to ensure that the finally approved!type would be reliable. The fact that the Tudor I would not belcompetitive on the North Atlantic route after 1947 did not, of course!mean that it would be obsolete for other routes, and it was ch .i1that there would be a strong demand for it for Australian and!South American services. He believed that the Brabazon IV, which!would be a jet-propelled aircraft with a speed of about 550 miles!per hour, would be fully equal to anything which the Americans&apos;would be able to put into the air in 1950. &apos; In addition, of course!progress was continuing on the Brabazon I, the prototype of which;was due to fly in the summer of 1947. In a matter such as the.design of new aircraft, where very rapid progress was being made!it was inevitable that any particular type should be virtualljfobsolescent by the time it was brought into service, but generally
he was satisfied that the British aircraft industry would respondsatisfactorily to the demands made on it once the handicap of our having concentrated during the war on combat aircraft had been overcome. We could not afford to neglect the North Atlantic routeif we were to maintain our position in the export market and todevelop our war potential.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer had not had an opportunity of examining the proposedpurchase of American aircraft, and that before he expressed a view on these proposals he would wish to consider how much of theestimated gross earnings of $14 million in the years 1948-49 could fairly be set against the purchase price of $12 million.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that,while it was regrettable that it should be necessary to make a furtherpurchase of American aircraft at the present time, it was difficultto see any alternative if we were to retain a reasonable share ofthe North Atlantic traffic. Subject, therefore, to any views whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer might have, he suggested that thepurchase should be made. As regards the other proposals madein CP. (46) 317, it would be necessary to consider these at a later meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, orders should be placed for the purchaseof six Boeing strato--Cruisers at a cost of $12 million.(2) Agreed to resume consideration of the other proposals in cp. (46) 317 at a later date.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP. (46) 318) regarding the payment of unemploymentbenefit to citizens of Eire who had served as volunteers in theUnited Kingdom Forces.The Lord Privy Seal recalled that at their meeting on the21st March the Cabinet had agreed that Eire volunteers who hadenlisted in the United Kingdom Forces should be entitled to pay-ment of unemployment insurance benefit in Eire in respect of anycontributions credited to them during their service in the Forces,provided that administrative arrangements were made under whichthe payment of benefit could be terminated if it were possible tooffer the recipient suitable employment in the United Kingdom.Discussions had since taken place between officials of the UnitedKingdom Departments concerned, together with an observer from northern Ireland, and representatives of the corresponding EireDepartments, and a draft agreement, a copy of which was annexed to CP. (46) 318, had been initialled. The agreement, which would run for a period of two years, provided that ex-Service men andwomen who had served in the United Kingdom Forces and had returned to Eire after demobilisation, would be able to obtainunemployment benefit in Eire if they satisfied the contribution con-ditions in force in Great Britain. The administration in Eire wouldbe undertaken by the Eire authorities who would apply their ownrules for the receipt of benefit. These rules approximated closely to those in force in the United Kingdom, and the representativesof the United Kingdom were satisfied that the Eire authorities would apply them strictly. At the meeting of the Social services committee, at which the draft agreement had been considered(S.S. (46) 8th Meeting, Minute 3), it had been suggested that theagreement might be criticised on the ground that the Eire authorities would apply a more lenient test in dealing with applicants whosebenefit would be paid from United Kingdom funds, and that incertain parts of Eire where the standards of living were low therewould be a considerable temptation to ex-Servicemen to draw the-8] c
maximum amount of benefit. Against this it should be noted thatthe agreement limited the payment of benefit to 180 days and made no provision for the added days for which benefit would normally be payable in the United Kingdom. Moreover, there was no doubtthat men who had served in the United Kingdom Forces would,through no fault of their own, be handicapped in their search for employment in Eire. It would be extremely difficult to retreat fromthe agreement that had been initialled at this stage, and on thewhole the Social Services Committee were satisfied that the safe-guards for which it provided were satisfactory. The possibilityof making arrangements to offer employment in the United King-dom to claimants for unemployment benefit under the proposed agree-ment had been fully discussed with the Eire representatives, butit had been found that the practical difficulties in operating any formal scheme of this kind would be very great.A short Bill would be necessary to enable the agreement to be implemented, and it was most desirable that this Bill should be passed during the concluding weeks of the 1945-46 Session.The Minister of Labour said that the practical difficulties of offering vacancies, as a matter of rule, in the United Kingdom to applicants for benefit in Eire would be insuperable. Moreover, any formal arrangement of this kind would affect adversely the successof the present drive to recruit Irish labour for mining and agriculture in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft agreement annexed to CP. (46) 318 forthe payment of unemployment benefit to Eire citizens who had served in the United Kingdom Forces.(2) Agreed that the necessary legislation to implement theagreement should be included in the 1945-46 legislative programme.Civil Service 5.   The  Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHours and Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 299) recommending that theLeave. Treasury should open negotiations with the Staff Side of theNational Whitley Council with a view to reaching agreement on a revised scheme of Civil Service hours and leave.The Cabinet were informed that the Coalition Government had undertaken to apply to the Civil Service the provisions of theRestoration of Pre-War Trade Practices Act, 1942, and that theStaff Side of National Whitley Council were pressing for an earlyreturn to pre-war hours of work and annual leave. The pre-wararrangements were open to certain objections in that in London thehours actually worked were too low and too sharply differentiatedfrom the provincial hours. As against this, there was no provision in the arrangements for enabling office staffs to be given at leastevery other Saturday morning off, a practice which was becoming increasingly prevalent in commercial and business houses. Thearrangements proposed as a basis for negotiation were set out inparagraph 8 of CP. (46) 299. They included provisionfor allowing Civil Servants to have alternate Saturdaymornings off with a corresponding reduction in the pre-war leaveentitlement; an increase in the London hours, and a longer officialmeal interval. The proposals had been approved by the lord presidents Committee at their meeting on the 19th July (LP. (46)27th Meeting, Minute 6).In discussion it was pointed out that the negotiations with theStaff Side would have to be handled very carefully and that, in viewof the possible repercussions on conditions of work outside the Civil IService of the adoption of a scheme on the lines proposed, it would Ibe important to choose the right moment for bringing it into Ioperation.The Foreign Secretary said that he had not yet been able to Iconsider fully how the proposed scheme would affect the work of the 1

The Minister of Fuel and Power informed the Cabinet thathe had had a long discussion on the 2nd August with Sir WilliamFraser, the Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and hadimpressed on him the need for adopting an enlightened policy in thetreatment of labour employed by the Company in Persia. He had made it clear to him that His Majesty&apos;s Government would beplaced in an embarrassing position and would find it difficult to giveeffective support to the Company unless they were satisfied thatthey were doing their best to secure satisfactory conditions of workfor their employees. Sir William Fraser had declared himselfready to take any steps which the Government thought necessary. Astatement had been drafted in consultation with him and had nowbeen issued to the press by the Foreign Office, setting out the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage any practicable measuresto raise the standard of living of Persian workers. Sir WilliamFraser had asked for Government assistance in reinforcing theCompany&apos;s staff concerned with industrial relations and social welfare. The Minister of Fuel and Power was in communicationwith the Minister of Labour about this. It had also been suggestedthat the staff of the British Embassy in Teheran should be strengthened to enable them to deal with these subjects.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped to arrange very shortly for the appointment of a Labour Attache to the Embassy atTeheran.It was pointed out in discussion that recent Persian legislationlaid down minimum conditions for the employment of labour. Itwas agreed that it would be wrong if the Company came to regard the minimum so laid down as the maximum standard which they need seek to maintain.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the position.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th August, 1946.Foreign Office and that he would be grateful if there could be - t uconsultations between the Treasury and the Foreign Office before thenegotiations were started.The Cabinet Approved the scheme outlined in paragraph 8 of CP.(46) 299 as a basis for negotiations with the Staff Sideof the National Whitley Council, on the understandingthat arrangements would be made for consultation withthe Foreign Office before the negotiations were started.
