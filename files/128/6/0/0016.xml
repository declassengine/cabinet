Palestine.illegal immigration.(previous reference:CM. (46) 77thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it hadnot been possible for him to see Dr. Weizmann, as he had hoped,on the 12th August, though he had given him by letter a general indication of the action which was to be taken to stop illegal lmmi-gration. He had, however, arranged to see him on the 15th august and he understood that Dr. Weizmann would have with himDr. Goldmann, the Chairman of the Executive of the jewish agency in America. As regards the operations in Haifa, 1,200illegal immigrants had been transhipped and conveyed to Cyprus.There had been demonstrations by mobs in Haifa in the course ofwhich British troops had been obliged to fire on the mobs, withthe result that three persons had been killed; but, according to thelatest report from the High Commissioner, the situation was nowquiet. He had thought it right to instruct the Governor of Cyprusthat the guards should not resort to the use of firearms should illegal immigrants attempt to escape from the camps in Cyprus in whichthey were to be confined, but both the Governor and the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Land Forces, had represented strongly^ tohim that a restriction of this kind would make the task of guardingillegal immigrants in Cyprus extremely difficult. He had beeninformed by the High Commissioner in Palestine that the police,who were responsible for guarding the inner perimeter of the AthlitCamp, were forbidden to use firearms in the event of attemptedescapes and, having regard to the more settled state of Cyprus andthe improbability that the local population would wish to assistillegal immigrants to escape, he thought it would be sufficient ifthe military guards in Cyprus were put on the same footing as thepolice guards at the Athlit Camp.The Cabinet were informed that, in the opinion of the Chiefsof Staff, it was desirable to put the troops employed in guardingthe Cyprus camps in the same position as any other troops employedin aiding the civil power and that this implied discretion to usefirearms in the last resort. The fact that the police guarding the inner perimeter of the Athlit Camp were forbidden to use fire-arms did not seem to justify the proposed restriction on the powersof the troops guarding the Cyprus camps, particularly since the outer perimeter of the Athlit Camp was guarded by troops whowere given the usual discretion to use firearms in the last resort.The Prime Minister said that it seemed to him that the right course was to place the troops guarding the Cyprus camps in thesame position as any other troops employed in aid of the civil power.The military authorities would no doubt employ firearms only inthe last resort and, wherever possible, disturbances in the campsor concerted attempts by the immigrants to escape should be dealtwith by the use of tear gas.The Minister of Fuel and Power asked whether the Secretaryof State for the Colonies had had any reports on the conditions ofthe camps in Cyprus which the illegal immigrants were to occupy.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had every reason to believe that conditions in the camps were satisfactory, buthe would obtain a special report on this matter.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the troops guarding Jewish illegal immigrantsin Cyprus should be authorised to use firearms in thelast resort in order to deal with disturbances in the camps or to prevent the escape of illegal immigrants from the camps or while in transit to the camps.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for the Colonies would obtain a report on the condition of the camps in Cyprusin which it was proposed to confine illegal immigrants.
British 2.   The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by &quot;the somali land.     Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies(Previous        (CP. (46) 319) regarding a proposal made by the Ethiopian Govern-reference:      ment for the cession to British Somaliland of part of the QgadenCM. (46) 61st    in exchange for the cession to Ethiopia of a strip of territory,Conclusions,     including the port of Zeila, which would give Ethiopia,a.corridorMinute 5.)&apos;     to the sea.   The Ethiopian Government had also indicated thatthey were ready to convene a Conference on Lake Tana.and tohave a Boundary Commission at once to meet His Majesty&apos;governments  requirements  in  respect  of  the  rectification of frontiers on the Kenya and Sudan borders.The memorandum explained that the Ethiopian proposaloffered a good prospect of meeting, to a very considerable extent,the long-standing requirements of the British Somaliland tribesfor free and undisturbed access to grazing areas essential for theirlivelihood, and it was therefore desirable that the general principleof the proposed exchange should be accepted. From the point ofview of British Somaliland, however, there were strong arguments for ceding a narrower strip of corridor to Ethiopia than the ethiopian Government had proposed, and it also seemed unnecessary to take over from Ethiopia as much of the territory in the Ogadenas had been offered. It was therefore recommended that the replyto the Ethiopian approach should be that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were willing to consider an exchange of territory, but that the size of the areas to be exchanged and the conditions of theirtransfer would require careful study by both sides. The negotia-tions should then begin on the basis set out in Section F of the annex to CP. (46) 319.The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretarysupported the proposals notwithstanding the fact that they mightnot be welcome to the French Government and that the Chiefs ofStaff saw no military objection to them, provided that Zeila was notceded to any other Power and was developed only as a commercialport. It was also explained that it was not considered likely thatoil would be found in the area of British Somaliland proposed tobe ceded.The Cabinet-Agreed that the offer of the Ethiopian Government shouldbe followed up at once and that negotiations should be opened on the basis proposed in Section F of the Annex to cp. (46) 319.Dutch 3.   The Cabinet were informed that in July the Chiefs of StaffEast Indies.     had proposed to the Prime Minister that British and Indian troops(Previous       should be withdrawn from Sumatra as soon as the military tasksReference:      there had been completed.   They had also recommended that, if force.M.(46)14th   political reasons it should be decided that British and Indian troopsConclusions,     must remain in Sumatra until November, the activities of these minute 1.)      troops should be confined to the protection of the Palembang area,including the oil refineries, and that the sending of reinforcements to the island should be avoided.   The Foreign Secretary had, how-ever, represented to the Prime Minister that the presence of Britishand Indian troops in Sumatra had a steadying effect on the situationand that their withdrawal in the near future might prejudice the chances of a successful outcome to the negotiations between theDutch and the Indonesians.   He therefore hoped that there wouldbe no withdrawal of troops from Sumatra for at least a month, or so, by which time it should be possible to see what were the prospects of a settlement between the Dutch and the Indonesians.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had recently discussed the matter with the Commander-in-Chief, India, and that if for political reasons it was desired that Indian troops should remain inSumatra after the completion of their military tasks the Chiefs ofStaff  were  prepared  to  agree   to  their  remaining  until  the
30th November. Moreover, in view of the short interval which wouldelapse before the final withdrawal in November, it seemed doubtfulwhether it was worth while to redispose the troops in Sumatra soas to concentrate them in Palembang. It had been made clear toGeneral Spoor that British and Indian troops would definitely be withdrawn both from Sumatra and from Java by the end ofNovember.The Secretary of State for India said that the employment ofIndian troops in the Dutch East Indies was most unpopular inIndia and he had no doubt that if an Interim Government of Indianswere formed they would take an active interest in this matter andwould probably press for their early withdrawal. He felt, therefore,that there could be no question of delaying the withdrawal of thetroops beyond November and he hoped it might be possible to arrangefor their withdrawal earlier.The Minister of Food said that from the point of view ofsupplies of fats, tea and rice, it was most important that everything possible should be done to secure a settlement of the differences between the Dutch Government and the Indonesians at an earlydate.The Minister of Fuel and Power stressed the importance of safeguarding the Piadjoe refinery. Within about two months itshould be possible to complete the repair of the units damagedduring the war and the refinery would produce a substantialquantity of sterling oil.The Cabinet Agreed that for the present British and Indian troops should remain in Sumatra, but that in any case they should all be withdrawn by the 30th November.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for India (CP. (46) 324) proposing that both european and Indian recruitment to the Indian Civil Service and the IndianPolice should cease forthwith and that the offers of appointmentalready made to war service candidates under the scheme announced on the 1st June, 1945, should be cancelled.The Secretary of State for India said that the proposal madein CP. (46) 324 had been discussed by the Prime Minister with members of the Cabinet Mission to India and later by the Indiaand Burma Committee (LB. (46) 3rd Meeting, Minute 2). since then there had been an exchange of telegrams with the Viceroy fromwhich it was clear that both the Viceroy and his Council agreedthat recruitment should cease forthwith and that the offers of appointment already made should be cancelled. If the cabinet approved the proposal, it would be necessary to inform the candidates concerned as soon as possible and immediately thereafter to issue a public announcement which wculd no doubt give rise tosome criticism for the reasons set out in paragraph 3 of cp. (46) 324. It seemed clear, however, that the appointment offurther Europeans to the Indian Civil Service and the IndianPolice would be bound to provoke resentment in India and thatthere would be great unwillingness on the part of provincial governments to employ any such officers. Some compensation wouldhave to be given to the candidates to whom offers of appointmenthad already been made, but the amount involved would be much lessthan if they were alkrwed to take up their appointments and subse-quently had to be compensated. A draft of the public announcement which it was proposed to make was annexed to CP. (46) 324.In discussion it was suggested that the opening words of theannouncement should read : &quot; In view of the pending constitutional changes in India and the consequent uncertainty as to the conditionsof service, it has been decided not to proceed with the appointmentof war service candidates to the Indian Civil Service.&quot;
The Cabinet-Approved the proposal to cease recruitment to the IndianCivil Service and the Indian Police and to cancel the offers of appointment already made, and agreed that, subject tothe amendment suggested in discussion, an announcement in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 324 shouldbe made.World food supplies.(previous reference:CM. (46) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)India.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP. (46) 323) covering a letter ofthe 8th August to the Minister of Food drawing attention to theserious situation which threatened to develop in India in september and October if the rate of arrival of cereal shipments in the imme-idiate future could not be improved.jThe Secretary of State for India said that, result ofstrenuous efforts, the Government of India had succeeded in!avoiding the breakdown in the rationing system which had been;threatened earlier in the year. The situation would, however Jbecome critical if the supply position was not materially improvedbefore November, when internal supplies would be coming forward,and there was a real danger of a breakdown in the rationing scheme in September or October. He suggested that the British food mission in Washington should be informed at once of the salientpoints in the Indian food situation as described in the note appended to CP. (46) 323, and should be asked to consult urgently with theUnited States Government with a view to finding some means oftiding over the crisis. He also suggested that the Special Com-missioner in South-East Asia should be instructed to make everyeffort to increase the shipments of rice to India from Siam duringthe next few weeks, but he wished to make it clear that he did not intend that any increased shipments of rice to India should be atthe expense of supplies to other territories, such as Malaya, forwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government were responsible.The Minister of Food said that there was no material change Ito report in the general supply position.  Owing to bad weather the!amount of home-grown wheat obtained in August would be less Ithan had been hoped for.  On the other hand, the Canadian harvesthad been exceptionally early, while the consumption of flour had;:fallen by 30 per cent, during the first two weeks of rationing and,though he did not think that this rate of saving would be main-tained, it seemed clear that the continuing rate would be greaterthan the 7 per cent, which had originally been expected.   The total!United Kingdom wheat stocks at the end of August would probablyamount to 627,000 tons.  It was not possible to make a firm forecast of future supplies and stock levels until the amount of the Canadianharvest was definitely known.  The Canadian crop was a good one,though the fact that it had ripened earlier than expected might mean a diminution in its bulk; and we had now a definite contract for the supply of 160 million bushels of Canadian wheat duringthe current crop year.   This would meet United Kingdom require-ments, but we needed an additional 40 million bushels to meet therequirements of other territories (excluding Germany) which were a British responsibility, and we should not know until September!whether we could count on getting this additional quantity fro::);.Canada.  Once we could be sure of obtaining a supply of 200 million^bushels from Canada it should be possible to end bread rationingljin the United Kingdom and to lower the extraction rate.   If thepCanadian exportable surplus proved to exceed 200 million bushels,!India should have a share in the excess, but he regarded it as vitallyjimportant that there should be no diversion of Canadian shipments!destined for the United Kingdom until we had been able to makegfirm arrangements for the supply of the 200 million bushels to meejiUnited Kingdom commitments.   With regard to the shipment ofgsupplies, it should be possible to lift enough from Canadian easta
coast ports to meet United Kingdom requirements for the winter months before the St. Lawrence froze and there was no reasonto fear that United Kingdom stocks would not be maintained ata safe level throughout the winter.The following points were made in discussion  (a) The Lord President said that under the agreement whichhe had negotiated in Washington, India was to receive 1,165,000tons of bread grains for the period May to September, inclusive.596,000 tons of this had been shipped during the months of May,June and July. The balance of nearly 570,000 tons to meet this target would have to be found in August and September. Hethought that as a first step the United States Government shouldbe urged to ensure that the August programme of 304,700 tons wascarried out as fully as possible.(b) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport,confirmed that there would be no shipping difficulties in carryingout programmed shipments of wheat from Canada and the UnitedStates to the United Kingdom. If, however, there were to be anyquestion of diverting shipments, the quickest way of meetingIndia&apos;s needs would be either to divert to India some of the wheat which would be leaving Canadian ports in September, or, alterna-tively, to divert cargoes which had already been shipped to theUnited Kingdom.(c) The Minister of Food said that he understood that the food position in Germany was improving as the German harvest became available, and that it was hoped to keep the situation under control.(d) Attention was drawn to the fact that the Argentine Govern-ment were withholding export permits in respect of the 238,000tons of maize which had been purchased by the Government ofIndia. A special Indian Food Mission was about to leave london for the Argentine to go into this question. The Cabinet were informed that the refusal of the export permits appeared to be designed to influence the course of the trade negotiations now pro-ceeding betAveen representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe Argentine Government at Buenos Aires.The Cabinet considered that a special effort should be made to induce the Argentine Government to grant the export permits. the humanitarian aspect of the matter should be represented to theArgentine President and it should be made clear to him that if thepermits were not granted we should be compelled to publish thefacts. Consideration should also be given to the possibility ofenlisting United States support in this approach to the ArgentinePresident. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Buenos Aires should beinformed of the importance which His Majesty&apos;s government attached to the release of the maize and asked to advise on the best method of putting pressure on the Argentine President. At thesame time, the departure of the Indian Food Mission to theArgentine should be expedited.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Food to inform the British food mission in Washington of the salient points in theIndian food situation, as described in the memorandumby the Secretary of State for India, and to instructthem to consult urgently with the United States Govern-ment on the means of tiding over the acute crisis withwhich the Government of India were likely to be facedduring the next few weeks.(2) Agreed that for the present there should be no diversion ofwheat shipments destined for the United Kingdom.(3) Agreed that the Foreign Office, in consultation with theTreasury, should take action on the lines suggested inparagraph (d) above.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for India to arrange for the departure of the Indian Food Mission to the Argentineto be expedited.
South-East The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he hoped that IAsia. the needs of colonial territories in South-East Asia and of Hong!Kong for supplies of cereals would be borne in mind.  As comparedwith the Indian cereals ration of 12 ounces a day the ration in!Malaya was 6 ounces and in Singapore 7^ ounces a day.  The stock position was very serious, and if there was no early improvement,further cuts in the ration would be inevitable.  The supplies of riceobtained from Siam had so far been most disappointing and he!hoped that drastic steps would be taken to get larger amounts from.!that area.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War said that Iit was estimated that in the second half of 1946 Siam would export!550,000 tons of rice, of which 80,000 tons should be available in IAugust. The reason why the allocations to India during the months jof July, August and September were not greater was that Lord;Killearn had arranged a shipping programme in accordance with!which India would take the bulk of her rice allocation during that Iperiod from Burma. Delays in the export of rice from Siam had!been due partly to political difficulties, which had engrossed the!attention of the Prime Minister, and partly to a strike of Chinesemillers. The latest information was, however, that actual supplies!;from Siam during the current half year would come up to expecta-j:tions. The Special Commissioner in South-East Asia had taken all 1possible steps to increase supplies from Siam and, on the whole,;;things were going better than had been expected. As regards!Malaya and Hong Kong, the total quantities of rice allocated werelsufficient, but during the earlier part of the half year the position!might be difficult owing to the timing of the shipments. Though!statistically there seemed to be a grave shortage in these territories,!he had had a good deal of reliable information to the effect that,?owing to the availability of alternative food-stuffs, the position in malaya was not nearly as bad as the official reports suggested.The Prime Minister said that so far as he could see all possible!steps were being taken to meet the needs of the Far Eastern!territories for which His Majesty&apos;s Government were responsible!and he was inclined to think that the reports of shortages in these!territories exaggerated the gravity of the situation. At the same]time it might be desirable to ask the Special Commissioner inSouth-East Asia whether any further steps could be taken to meetthe difficulties in these areas.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask the Special Commis-jsioner in South-East Asia whether he could suggest amifurther action to improve food supplies to India and tothe Far Eastern colonial territories for which HisMajesty&apos;s Government were responsible.Broadcasting.Reorganisa-tion ofBroadcastingServices.(previous reference:C.M.(46)29thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by thejLord President and the Postmaster-General (CP. (46) 321)proposing that the scheme for the reorganisation of broadcasting services approved by the Cabinet on the 1st April should be modified so as to preserve a separate West of England region.The Lord President recalled that the reorganisation schemlwhich the Postmaster-General and he had put before the Cabinelin CP. (46) 128 had provided for the merging of the Midland and!West of England regions into a new Southern region.  This proposal had arisen from the need to provide wavelengths for the new ThinProgramme intended to serve the educated listener, while at thisame time preserving at least two medium wavelengths for thfEuropean services.   Since the proposed reorganisation had beeiannounced there had been strong protests against the proposal thaithere should no longer be a separate West of England region, an(in reply to a deputation of Labour Members of Parliament thf
Postmaster-General and he had undertaken to consider every possible means of maintaining the separate identity of this region.Under the scheme approved on the 1st April not only would theWest Country and the Midlands lose their own regional servicesbut a considerable body of listeners would receive no home serviceprogramme at all, while a very large number of those who now received the, West of England or Midland programmes would haveto take their home service from the Welsh or London or northern region. In particular, about 1\ million of the population of theMidland region would receive the Northern programme. he believed that the present volume of complaint was small comparedwith the outcry with which the Government would be faced whenthe individual listener in the West of England and in the NorthMidlands had actually experienced the effect of the reorganisation,and he was satisfied that the reorganisation scheme should be modified so as to preserve separate Midland and West of Englandregions. If this were to be done, it would be necessary to use forthe Home Services one of the British medium wavelengths at presentin use on the European Services and to substitute for this wave-length the Norden wavelength which was at present used for theB.A.O.R. entertainment programmes. This transfer would in itselfimprove the coverage of the European Services, but it should benoted that the B.B.C. were at present using for these Services a1,796-metre wavelength which was- not allocated to the UnitedKingdom under the Lucerne Convention and was causing inter-ference in Eastern Europe with Russian broadcasts. The Russians,who disliked the B.B.C. European Services, were likely to protest against the use of this wavelength at the forthcoming InternationalRadio discussions in Moscow, and there was no certainty that weshould be able to retain it. Another factor to be borne in mind wasthe attempt which was being made to secure the use jointly by theBritish and French Governments of the Radio Luxembourgtransmitter. If these negotiations succeeded, the European services would have at their disposal a share of the Luxembourg long wave-length and it was desirable that everything possible should be done to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. The FrenchGovernment were, however, showing signs of unwillingness toco-operate with us in this matter.The Postmaster-General said that, since CP. (46) 321 had been circulated, it had been discovered that it would be possible to relaythe British Light Programme from the Hamburg transmitter fromthe 1st October, when the Norden wavelength at present used forthe B.A.O.R. entertainment programme would be transferred tothe European Services. By this means it should be possible tocontinue to give a satisfactory programme to the B.A.O.R. withoutthe need to make improvements in the quality of the receivers. he hoped that it would be possible to reach a satisfactory agreementwith the Soviet Government on the use of the 1,796-metrewavelength.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War saidthat, on the assumption that it would be possible to relay fromHamburg the United Kingdom Light Programme, he saw noobjection to the proposal to transfer the Norden wavelength to theEuropean Services.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster stressed theimportance of maintaining the European Services of the B.B.C. inorder to counter Russian propaganda in Europe. With our presentresources it was only possible to cover the British Zone of Germany,whereas it was most desirable that British programmes should be broadcast over the whole of Germany and Austria. If it proved impossible to reach agreement with the Russians about the use ofthe 1,796-metre wavelength and if the negotiations for securing theuse of the Radio Luxembourg transmitter failed, the B.B.C.European Services would be wholly inadequate.The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary agreedto the proposal in CP. (46) 321 and that the Chancellor of theExchequer would be prepared to consider sympathetically any
reasonable proposals for expenditure on the acquisition of the RadioLuxembourg transmitter.In further discussion there was general agreement that, inview of the strong feeling provoked by the proposal to merge theWest of England and Midland regions, the proposals in CP. (46) 321must be accepted. At the same time, it was recognised that it was most important that the European Services should not be prejudiced,and for this purpose it seemed desirable that all possible steps shouldbe taken to secure the acquiescence of the Soviet Government in thecontinued use of the 1,796-metre wavelength and to secure the useof the Radio Luxembourg transmitter.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the scheme for the reorganisation of homebroadcasting services should be modified so as to preserve the separate identity of the West of England andMidland regions.(2) Agreed that the Norden wavelength now used for theB.A.O.R. entertainment programme should be trans-ferred to the European Services, on the understandingthat arrangements would be made to relay the UnitedKingdom Light Programme from the Hamburgtransmitter.(3) Agreed that the delegates to the forthcoming moscow conference should be instructed to raise the question ofthe 1796 metre wavelength with the Russian authorities at the earliest suitable moment with a view to securingRussian agreement to its retention by the UnitedKingdom.(4) Agreed that all possible steps should be taken to secure theuse of Radio Luxembourg either by the British andFrench Governments jointly or, if the French Govern-ment were unwilling to co-operate, by the BritishGovernment alone.Future of the assyrians.(previous reference:CM. (45) 13thConclusions,Minute 6.)7.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (46) 304)urging that a final decision should be taken on the futureof the Assyrians in Iraq and Syria; and(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. (46) 322) pointing out the difficulties of finding asuitable area for the settlement of the Assyrians withinthe Colonial Empire.It was explained that an examination of the possibility of settling the Assyrians in Eritrea, Cyrenaica, Lebanon orBaluchistan had shown that it would be impracticable to settle themin any of these areas and that it seemed clear that no suitable place for them could be found in non-British territory. In these circum-stances, the Foreign Secretary felt that the Cabinet must eitherdirect that a suitable area must be found for them in the british colonial Empire, despite the difficulties and the initial cost of settlement, or agree to leave them in Iraq, in which case generousfinancial provision should be made towards their resettlement.In the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view the alternative of settling the assyrians in the Colonial Empire was preferable. The foreign secretary had also suggested that the possibility of finding room for them in Australia might be considered.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that exhaustiveenquiries into the possibility of settlement in the Colonial Empirehad been made in connection with the problem of resettling thePoles and it was clear that, apart from the possibility of somesettlement in the highlands of British Guiana, there was no hopeof finding room for the Assyrians in any Colonial territory. He hadbeen in correspondence with the Chancellor of the Exchequer aboutthe British Guiana proposal and he understood that the Chancellorconsidered that the expenditure involved in any settlement there could not be justified.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hewould be glad to take up with the Dominions the question whetherthey could not absorb some at least of the Assyrians. At the sametime, he could not understand why it was not possible to find room for the Assyrians in Kenya or Tanganyika without detriment tothe legitimate rights of the natives of these countries, and hesuggested that this possibility should be further explored.In further discussion it was pointed out that it might also bepossible to settle Assyrians in Northern Rhodesia and it was urgedthat with modern methods of irrigation and control of tropicaldiseases it should be possible to support a much larger population in the Colonial Empire and open up a wider area for settlement byEuropeans. Was there not a tendency for white settlers in such territories as Kenya and Tanganyika to resist further immigrationin order to preserve their own privileged position ?The Prime Minister said that he felt that there should be anindependent investigation of the possibility of increased settlement in such territories as Kenya, Tanganyika and Northern rhodesia and he would discuss with the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs what arrangements should be made for an enquiry of this kind.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he would welcome an enquiry into this matter. He was, however, convincedthat if we were to give adequate protection to the rights of the natives of Colonial territories it would be impossible to carry out any extensive settlement in the Colonial Empire.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, theinstitution of an independent enquiry into thepossibilities of increased settlement in colonial territories.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to take up with Dominion Governments the question whetherthey might make land available for the settlement ofsome or all of the Assyrians.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for War (CP. (46) 326) regardingthe occupation of hutted camps by squatters.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War saidthat the primary responsibility for camps declared redundant bythe War Office lay with the Ministry of Works and it was impossiblefor the Army to provide guards for such camps. He had had dis-cussions with the Departments concerned and it had been arranged that where squatters were already in partial or full possession ofa camp which had been declared redundant the Ministry of Healthwould endeavour to persuade the appropriate local authority to takethe camp over and make it fit for occupation. The problem ofsquatting had also arisen in camps which the War Office wishedto retain. Thus, camps earmarked for Poles and their families and a Civil Resettlement Unit had been occupied. It would be extremely difficult to provide experienced British troops to guardthe camps destined for the Poles and it seemed undesirable to mountPolish guards at these camps. He also felt that the eviction ofhomeless British families in favour of Poles would not commandpublic support. In these circumstances, the only alternatives seemedto be the retention of premises now scheduled for release fromrequisition or some measure of new construction.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Works, said that only four of the camps occupied by squatters had been under thecontrol of the Ministry of Works. These camps had been emptywhen they had been declared redundant and it had not been possibleto make immediate arrangements to occupy them.   Where a camp
was destined for use as a Government training centre or somesimilar purpose, it seemed desirable that the squatters should beevicted, but the eviction of squatters in order to release a campfor occupation by German prisoners of war might give rise to serious criticism.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health, said thathitherto it had not been possible for the Ministry of Health tooffer camps to local authorities until the Ministry of Works had ascertained whether they were required for any other Governmentpurpose. This inevitably took some time and there was a danger that the camps might be occupied by squatters in the interval. Ithad accordingly been arranged that, in future, the use of campsfor housing should have equal priority with other uses and it should,therefore, be possible for the Ministry of Health to obtain posses-sion of any camps available for housing at an earlier stage. Itshould be realised that local authorities would be reluctant to takeover camps in which squatters had settled, since the squatters hadoften far weaker claims than other persons on the local authorities&apos;waiting lists for houses. Moreover, local authorities might well be unwilling to agree to take over such camps unless there were somerevision of the financial terms on which the camps were madeavailable.The Home Secretary said that, according to a police report which he had received from Bristol, the occupation of camps bysquatters had been encouraged by a member of the Bristol Corpora-tion. It was difficult to see what effective steps the police could take to prevent the occupation of camps by squatters since the seizure of the camps was as a rule carried out without the commission ofany criminal offence.The Prime Minister said that some weeks earlier the problemof squatting in Army camps had been brought to his notice, andon that occasion he had given specific instructions to the Secretaryof State for War that he should bake all possible steps in consulta-tion with the Minister of Works to ensure that camps which weredeclared redundant did not stand empty and so present a temptation to squatters. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Warand the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Works, should find out why these instructions had not been carried out and let himhave written reports on this aspect of the matter. It seemed clearthat the squatters who had occupied the Civil Resettlement Unitor the camps which were being prepared for use as training centresor teachers&apos; emergency colleges should be evicted forthwith. Onthe other hand, it would be more difficult to evict squatters fromcamps destined for Poles or for prisoners of war and these cases would require further consideration. He was not satisfied that itwould be impossible for the Army to provide uniformed guards toprevent squatting, and he also thought that the possibility of action by the police should be further explored. It was also important toconsider what steps might be taken to prevent undue publicity being given to the occupation of camps by squatters. He suggested thatthe Home Secretary should consider the problem in all its aspectsin consultation with the other Ministers concerned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to consider in the light of the dis-cussion what steps should be taken to deal with theproblems raised by the occupation of camps by squatters.(2) Took note that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor War and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofWorks, would furnish the Prime Minister with reports on the action taken to carry out the Prime Ministersinstruction that camps declared redundant by the WarOffice should not be allowed to stand empty.Cabinet Office, S-W-. 1,lA4h August, 1946.
