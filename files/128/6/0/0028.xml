1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (46) 376)submitted by the Lord Chancellor in pursuance of the Cabinefsconclusion of 20th June suggesting what modifications might be proposed in the Parliament Act, 1911, if it were thought necessaryto limit the power of the House of Lords to prevent the passage oflegislation desired by the House of Commons. The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum (CP. (46) 382) submitted by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, as Leader of the House ofLords, proposing that if legislation were introduced to restrict thepowers of the House of Lords, it should be accompanied by pro-posals for the reform of the House of Lords on the lines indicatedin his memorandum.After a short discussion, the Cabinet (1) Decided to postpone for the time being consideration of thepossibility of amending the Parliament Act, 1911, on thelines indicated in CP. (46) 376; but invited the LordChancellor to bring this matter before them again intime to enable the Government, if they decided topromote such legislation, to pass it through the Houseof Commons and have it discussed in the House of Lordsbefore the end of the 1947-48 Session of Parliament;(2) Took note that, in the meantime, the Prime Minister would arrange for proposals for the reform of the House ofLords to be considered and formulated, as recommended in CP. (46) 382.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (46) 387) covering drafts of The King&apos;s Speeches on the prorogation and Opening of Parliament prepared by a Committeeof Ministers under his Chairmanship.In discussion of the draft Speech on the Prorogation ofParliament, the following points were raised : (a) In paragraph 5 of the draft reference was made to theconclusion of economic agreements with Argentina and Brazil. Theagreement with Brazil was not considered to be of sufficient importance to warrant specific mention in the Speech; and it might give offence in various quarters if the Argentine agreement wereselected as the only one worthy of specific mention. It was agreedthat, in place of the references to Argentina and Brazil, the paragraph should refer to the conclusion of economic agreements with &quot;various countries.&quot;(b) In paragraph 19 reference was made to the arrangementsfor regular consultation with a Joint Advisory Council, repre-senting organisations of employers and workers, on matters ofcommon interest to employers and employed. A reference in these terms was likely to be misunderstood by those concerned with theNational Production Advisory Council, which also dealt with&quot;matters of common interest to employers and employed.&quot; It wasagreed that the concluding words of paragraph 19 should be amended so as to read &quot; and arrangements have been made for regular consultation with a National Joint Advisory Council repre-senting organisations of employers and workers.&quot;(c) Should the Speech include any reference to the current negotiations on Egypt and Palestine 1 It was agreed that, as these negotiations were still proceeding, it would be preferable not tomake any mention of them in the Speech.(d) Other suggestions for amendments of drafting were made and approved.In discussion of the draft Speech on the Opening of parliamentary number of suggestions for amendments of drafting were made and approved.2698-1] b 2
The Cabinet- . jApproved the draft Speeches annexed to CP. (46) 387subject to the amendments agreed upon in the discussion and to any further drafting amendments which iniafysubsequently be made by the Lord President with thePrime Ministers approval.Parliament.legislative programme for 1946-47Session.    &apos; *(previous reference:,C.M.(46)68thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president and the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (46) 393) submitting forthe Cabinets approval a final Programme of Government Legisla-tion for the 1946-47 Session of Parliament.The Lord President said that the legislative prospects for theforthcoming Session had been carefully reviewed by the legislation committee and the Future Legislation Committee; and that thelatter Committee had reluctantly come to the conclusion that timecould not be found for the passage of all the major Bills which hadbeen included in the provisional Programme approved by theCabinet on 15th July. An unusually heavy programme of legisla-tion had been handled in the Session now ending, and it was undesirable that Ministers and other Members should be subjected to the same heavy strain in the new Session. It was also desirablethat the Government should aim at bringing the next Session to anend before the Summer Recess, in order that the Session of 1947-48might be opened in time to enable substantial progress to be madewith major legislation before Christmas. This was necessary inorder to secure a proper balance between the legislative work of thetwo Houses of Parliament and also to promote the efficientfunctioning of the Standing Committees in the House of Commons.It was in these circumstances that he and his colleagues on theFuture Legislation Committee recommended that the Bills listed in Part VI of the Annex to CP. (46) 393 should be omitted fromthe Legislative Programme for the 1946-47 Session.Discussion turned mainly on the question whether the PoorLaw (National Assistance) Bill should be omitted from theProgramme.In favour of the inclusion of this Bill it was urged that, unlessbefore April 1948 some provision was made for those classes whoseneeds would not be met by the National Insurance and national health Service Schemes, a chaotic situation would arise. Inparticular the authorities now responsible for poor relief would loseall incentive to maintain scales of relief at a reasonable level, andthe cost and difficulty of substituting a scheme of national assistance for the existing poor law system would be much increased. Thoughthe Bill would contain about 80 Clauses, it was not likely to be opposed on Second Reading, or to lead to very much controversy in Committee. A further reason for passing the Bill in the 1946-47Session was that it would be possible to include in it provisions dealing with the administrative arrangements for the care ofchildren deprived of a normal home life. In view of the publicationof the Curtis Report there would be strong pressure for early legislation on this subject.On the other hand, it was pointed out that on the best estimateof the Parliamentary time likely to be available in a Session endingby August 1947, it would be impossible to pass the Poor Law(National Assistance) Bill in addition to the other Bills whoseinclusion in the Programme had been recommended by the future legislation Committee. If, therefore, the Bill were included in theProgramme, the Session would have to be continued until Octoberor November, with the result that a late start would be made withthe Bills included in the 1947-48 Programme. The postponement of the Bill until the beginning of the 1947-48 Session would stillenable it to be passed by February 1948. Thus, only a few months would be lost and the Bill would have become law before theNational Insurance and National Health Service Schemes came int&quot;
35 CM. 90 (46) jforce. Even if the Bill were passed by November 1947 it would beimpossible to bring the new system of national assistance into force by April 1948.Other points in discussion were (a) The Minister of Health said that unless a Radio-ActiveSubstances Bill were passed during the 1946-47 Session the public would be exposed to very serious risks.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that parliamentary counsel had now been given complete instructions for the ElectricityNationalisation Bill, with the exception of the portion of. the bill relating to the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Scheme.      ; ...The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Poor Law (National Assistance) Bill shouldbe included among the Bills to be introduced in the1946-47 Session if time permitted, on the understandingthat the drafting of the Bill should not be given priority over the drafting of other Bills in the Programme;(2) Agreed that the Radio-Active Substances Bill should beincluded among the medium-sized Bills to be passed inthe 1946-47 Session;(3) Subject to (1) and (2) above, approved Groups I to V of the annex to CP. (46) 393 as the Legislative programme for the 1946-47 Session, and invited the legislation committee to keep the Programme under constant review.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C.P. (46) 380) reporting the conclusions reached by theDefence Committee on the introduction of a permanent scheme ofnational service.The Prime Minister said that it was necessary that an early decision should be taken on the form of national service to beadopted from 1st January, 1949, when the transitional scheme forthe call-up of men to the Forces was due to come to an end. Anearly decision was required in order to provide the Services with abasis on which to plan their development, and also to allow timefor industrial and educational arrangements to be adapted to thecalls on man-power for national service. The Defence Committeehad reviewed the man-power required by the Services, both to carryout the tasks which would fall to them in normal peace-time con-ditions and to provide reserves which would ensure that our forces could be expanded to the requisite size for the defence of our interests immediately on the outbreak of a major war. taking account of these commitments and. making allowance for theincreased assistance which we might reasonably hope to obtain fromother members of the British Commonwealth, the Committee had reached the conclusion that neither the Army nor the Royal AirForce could draw from voluntary sources enough men to bring theirembodied forces up to the requisite strength to discharge their peace-time tasks and that, without compulsory national service, all three Services would lack the necessary reserves for expansion inthe event of war. The Committee had then sought to assess theeffect on the economic life of the country of adopting a scheme of compulsory national service. While any estimates of the future position must necessarily be speculative, the broad picture thatemerged was that, if the average output per head was no higher in 1952 than in 1939, it would be impossible simultaneously (i) tocall up the numbers of men required for national service,(ii) to achieve the contemplated degree of expansion from the 1939level in exports, investment, housing, education and. government service, and (iii) to regain the 1939 volume of goods and services for civilian use. Nevertheless, if we were to live up to our responsibilities, it seemed inevitable that we should face the cost ofpermanent compulsory service.   To offset the effect on the national
economy it would be necessary to raise the average rate of outrmtper head in the coming years and to reduce to a minimum theaverage number of unemployed. It would also be necessary toimprove the facilities for the training of young workers, to shorten the period of apprenticeship and to give considerable latitude withregard to the age at which men could render their period of service at the same time the scheme must be a democratic one and mustapply to all men, with the sole exception of those who were totallyunfit for any form of service with the Forces.The Foreign Secretary said that it had always been his viewthat there should be a permanent scheme of compulsory nationalservice. Though everything possible would be done to reduce our foreign commitments, it would remain necessary to rely on com-pulsory service to provide adequate Forces for the defence of our interests. In the past the Forces had been in great part recruited from the unemployed. This would no longer be possible in conditions of full employment and it was right that in the plannedeconomy, with its comprehensive system of social services, on whichwe had embarked, there should be an obligation on all citizens toundertake national service.In the ensuing discussion the following were the main points that arose : (a) The Minister of Health asked on what basis the require-ments of the Forces were estimated 1 Was it in fact practicable tomake any real assessment of the numbers required in 1952?In reply it was explained that, so far as concerned the Army,the estimates allowed for the manning of overseas garrisons and forreserves of two divisions in the Middle East and four divisions inthe United Kingdom/Germany area. It was true that any estimateof the likely commitments in 1952 was bound to be in the nature ofa guess, but the numbers allowed for were considered to be theminimum necessary to enable the Army to discharge the tasks withwhich it was likely to be faced. Moreover, unless a scheme of compulsory national service were adopted the necessary reserves would not be available to enable the Army to expand immediately on the outbreak of war; and it could not be assumed that in a future war there would be a period of grace during which expansioncould be carried out. The same considerations applied to the Navy,which had not only to maintain ships at sea for policing duties andtraining, but also to provide the necessary reserves for an immediateexpansion of the Fleet and the Fleet Air Arm on the outbreak ofwar. A future war was likely to begin immediately with formidableU-Boat and aircraft attacks on our communications. The RoyalAir Force were in much the same position, and calculated that theywould have to face a high rate of wastage in air crews from theoutbreak of war.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that we could nolonger rely on having readily available the man-power resources ofIndia, which had hitherto provided not only trained Forces ready for immediate service in war but also an immense reservoir of recruits.(&amp;) Was it essential that the period of call-up should beII years rather than one year ? According to the estimates givenin paragraph 4 of CP. (46) 380, the number of men actually servingat any one time, if the period of national service were fixed at-1 years, would be 968,500. Looking to the fact that we were hopingto be able to discharge our commitments in 1947 with Forces not greatly exceeding 1,200,000, would it not be difficult to justifymaking provision for Forces amounting to nearly one million menin ordinary peace-time conditions ?It was explained that the adoption of a period of \\ years would enable the Services to make a much more economical use of the  men called up. At least six months were required to trainconscripts and, if the period of service were only one year, it wouldbe  virtually  impossible  to  use conscripts  on  foreign  service
Moreover, the effectiveness of the reserve Forces would be greatly-diminished, since it would not be possible to give men adequatetraining in many of the technical branches. The extra six months would also provide an opportunity for the selection and training of young men as officers.The Prime Minister said that, if a period of one year were adopted to begin with, it would be impossible subsequently to raisethe period to \\ years. On the other hand, there would be nodifficulty in reducing an initial period of 1^ years should thissubsequently be found expedient. The legislation providing for theNational Service Scheme could be so drafted as to allow this to bedone by order.(c) The Lord President and the President of the Board ofTrade pointed out that unless a spectacular increase in productivityper man-hour could be secured, it would be impossible to provide forthe Services the number of men indicated in paragraph 4 of cp. (46) 380 while at the same time achieving the contemplatedexpansion in exports, investment, housing, education and Govern-ment Service, and regaining by 1952 even the 1939 volume of goods and services for civilian consumption. In these circumstances itwas essential that all possible steps should be taken to stimulate anincrease in productivity, and it would be necessary to exercise thegreatest caution in considering any proposals for reduction in thehours of labour.The Foreign Secretary said that the position might be eased ifImproved health services enabled workers to continue longer in pro-ductive employment, if there were an increase in the employment ofwomen in industry and if the length of apprenticeship were reduced and training schemes for industry improved. Better rehabilitation-tion services should also reduce the hard core of unemployed.The Minister of Labour said that he did not see why theunemployment figure could not be kept down to the existing levelof about 380,000 instead of the 500,000 which had been adopted forthe purpose of the calculations in CP. (46) 380.id) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the adoption ofa scheme of compulsory service seemed to him to be inevitable. Thecost of maintaining Forces of the order of 968,000 embodied servingmen, together with a munitions labour force of 600,000, would,however, be of the order of  700 to  750 million. This would impose a heavy burden on the taxpayer and there could be little hope of reductions in the present level of taxation.(e) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, though pro-vision was made for deferments, it was apparently contemplated that there should be no exemptions from compulsory service. Mightit not be found expedient to exempt altogether men engaged incertain essential industries, such as coalmining, where the labour force was likely to remain at a dangerously low level for aconsiderable time ?It was pointed out that under the proposed scheme men wouldbe able to perform their national service at any time between the ages of 17^ and 25. In these circumstances it should be possible,at least for a time, to avoid undue depletion of the man-power of vital industries, while at the same time maintaining the principle of universal national service.(/) The question was raised whether the reserve provided forin paragraph 3 (b) of CP. (46) 380 would include men trained toundertake Civil Defence duties in the event of war.It was explained that the training which men would receiveduring their period of national service would fit them to undertakeCivil Defence duties in the event of war. It was also suggested thatthe possibility of training women in Civil Defence should not be overlooked.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24*A October, 1946.The Prime Minister said that it seemed to him that the cabinet were agreed that a permanent scheme of compulsory national service should be adopted; that the period of embodied service should be1-J years, at least to begin with, and that there should be a liability for a further 5\ years&apos; service in the reserve. In these circum- jstances, he thought that the right course was to announce in TheKing&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament that the government intended to introduce legislation providing for a scheme of com-pulsory national service in the 1946-47 Session. He suggested thatthe Cabinet might at an early meeting have a further discussion onthe subsidiary questions raised in paragraph 8 of OP. (46) 380, onwhich decisions would have to be taken before the government spokesman explained the proposals in the Debate on the Address.The Cabinet--(1) Agreed that a permanent scheme of compulsory nationalservice for men should be brought into force from 1st January, 1949, and that an announcement of theGovernments intention to introduce the necessary legislation should be made in The King&apos;s Speech on the:Opening of Parliament:(2) Agreed that the legislation should provide for a maximum period of 1^ years&apos; embodied service with a liability fora further 5\ years&apos; service in the reserve, and should givepower to reduce the period of \\ years&apos; embodied service by order should it later be found expedient to do so;(3) Agreed to resume consideration of the subsidiary questionsset out in paragraph 8 of CP. (46) 380 at an early meeting.
