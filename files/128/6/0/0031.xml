1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.On 4th November the Lords amendments to the national health Service Bill and the Atomic Energy Bill would beconsidered.On 5th November there would be a debate on Home and overseas Trade. The President of the Board of Trade and his parliamentary Secretary would, speak on behalf of the Government.On 6th November the House would consider any Lords amend-ments to the remaining Bills now under consideration by the Houseof Lords.It was contemplated that Parliament would be prorogued on 6th November, and that the new Session would be opened on12th November.It was pointed out that on various matters exciting publicinterest during the next Session there would be pressure in Parlia-ment for Government action which could not be taken withoutpassing legislation not included in the Government&apos;s legislative programme for the Session. It would assist Ministers to resistsuch pressure if at the beginning of the Session the Prime minister could make an authoritative statement explaining that the Parlia-mentary time available for legislation would be fully occupied bythe programme of legislation already approved by the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that either he or the Lord president would take an opportunity of making this position clear duringthe course of the debate on the Address.The Cabinet considered means of ensuring that, during theforthcoming Session, the time available for oral answers to parliamentary Questions was more equitably distributed between departments.It was agreed that a disproportionate amount of time was atpresent being spent in disposing of the Questions which came firston the Order Paper. Suggestions made for relieving this situationincluded the following. Greater use might be made of the deviceof marshalling the Questions in such a way that each Minister hadto answer only a limited number (say, twenty) consecutively.Ministers might follow more strictly the practice of declining togive, in answer to Questions, information already available inofficial publications. A further attempt might be made to persuadeMembers to put down a larger number of Questions for writtenanswer. Mr. Speaker might be asked to give less latitude for supplementary Questions.The Cabinet further agreed that all Departments should beready to take their turn in accepting the additional obligation ofweek-end work involved in having their Questions taken early onthe list on Mondays.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Whip to consider the suggestions putforward in the Cabinets discussions, and to continue had discussions with a view to securing a more equitable distribution between Ministers of the; time available foranswering oral Questions.2. The Minister of Health said that the House of Lords had carried a number of amendments to the National Health service bill. Most of these he could advise the House of Commons toaccept; but there were some which he must resist. Pirst, aprovision had been included requiring the London County Councilto delegate certain of its Health Service functions to the councils of the Metropolitan Boroughs. This would upset the administra-tive scheme of the Act, and would be resented by boroughs outside london.  Secondly, the provisions governing the payment of doctors-4] b 2
had been so amended as to exclude payment by salary. This change was contrary to agreed Government policy. Thirdly, the House ofLords might carry an amendment,. to be moved that day, whichwould add to the Bill a special provision about the treatment ofthe deaf. The Ministry of Health were proposing to include, amongthe appliances which could be provided free of charge under thenew Health Service, a standard appliance providing an aid tohearing; and an assurance to this effect would be given when thepoint was debated in the House of Lords. The provision of thesestandard appliances would have the effect of protecting the publicfrom quack remedies. It would, however, be wrong to add to a Billconcerned with administrative machinery a special provision dealing-in isolation with the treatment of one particular aspect of ill-health0.If, therefore, this amendment were carried, the House of commons should be advised to reject it.The Cabinet-Agreed that the House of Commons should be advised todisagree with the House of Lords in the particularamendments mentioned above.3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the PrimeMinisters memorandum (CP. (46) 380) on the introduction of apermanent scheme of national service, and also had before them amemorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (46) 403) regardingthe position of the medically unfit and the conscientious objectorunder this scheme.The following were the main points raised in thediscussion : (a) Application of the scheme to. Northern Ireland. ThePrime Minister recalled that, in spite of the wishes of the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland, the scheme for compulsory militarytraining introduced in May 1939 had been limited to Great Britain;and, when the question had arisen in 1941 of extending to NorthernIreland the system of compulsory military service in war, the WarCabinet had decided that such an extension would be inexpedient,though the Government of Northern Ireland still desired it(W.M. (41) 54th Conclusions, Minute 2). Thus, the existing national Service Acts applied only in Great Britain.It was the view of the Cabinet that any permanent scheme ofnational service should be similarly limited to Great Britain. TheCabinet were informed that the man-power figures included in cp. (46) 380 had been based on the assumption that the scheme of compulsory service would not apply to Northern Ireland.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the permanent scheme of national service should not be extended to Northern Ireland.(b) Period, of embodied service. It was pointed out thatcriticism of the scheme was likely to centre on the proposal for aperiod of one and a half years&apos; embodied service. Much of the criticism would be avoided if the period could be fixed at one year.The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on24th October that the longer period was necessary for the. timebeing to provide the numbers required for the Armed Forces, toallow for an effective period of training and to enable conscriptsto be employed on overseas service. The period of embodied servicecould be shortened subsequently if conditions changed; but it was important that it should be fixed at one and a half years at the outset of the scheme.(c) Deferment of apprentices and students . Great care wouldbe required in defining the conditions for the grant of deferment.The Minister of Labour explained that under the transitional
arrangements for call-up to the Forces deferment was granted only where there was evidence that a genuine and satisfactory apprentice-ship existed. The same test would be applied under the permanent scheme. Negotiations were also proceeding with individual industries with a view to shortening the customary periods of apprentiship and ensuring that apprentices were given effectivetraining throughout the whole period. It should be possible toobtain the support of the National Joint Advisory Council in thismatter.(d) Liability. for refresher training. Emphasis was laid onthe importance of providing for flexibility in the arrangements forrefresher training, with a view to reducing the disturbance to thecivil economy; and it was suggested that consideration might begiven to the possibility of fixing, instead of a miximum period ofrefresher training for each of the years during which conscriptswould remain liable, a total maximum period of training for whichthey would be liable over the whole period of h\ years. It wouldthen be possible to work out detailed arrangements which would meet the varying requirements of the different Services and thedifferent branches within each Service with the minimum inter-ference with civilian activities.(e) Treatment of medically unfit men. The Minister of Laboursaid that it had not been the practice either during or since thewar to call up men placed in Groups III and IV. He had gathered,however, from the discussion on 24th October, that it was the wishof the Cabinet that the permanent scheme should cover the largest possible proportion of the male population, and he had therefore proposed in CP. (46) 403 that under that scheme any men in grade III who were suitable for employment on sedentary duties in the Services should be called up for service.The Prime Minister pointed out that, if the call-up of men in grade III had to be determined by the extent to which the services would be able to make use of them, it would become necessary toapply a selective call-up between men of more or less the samephysical condition. This would give rise to great difficulties. Itwould be preferable to restrict the call-up to men placed in GradesI and II, but to lower slightly the standard for Grade II. the revised standard should be fixed by the Ministry of Labour in con-.&apos; sultation with the Service and Health Departments.(f) Treatment of Conscientious Objectors. It was pointed outthat in war-time, when almost all forms of work contributed tothe nation&apos;s war effort, it might be reasonable to grant a man exemp-tion from military service without requiring him to undertake some form of work other than his normal occupation; but in peace-timethe paramount consideration seemed to be to ensure that the man who objected to performing military service should not by remaining in his normal occupation gain an advantage over his fellow-workers who were called up. The simplest way of achieving this would beto require conscientious objectors to undertake some form of nationalservice other than their normal occupation.On the other hand, it was argued that there would be great advantage in adhering to the existing rules for the treatment ofconscientious objectors, which had worked smoothly throughout thewar. Under these rules the great majority of conscientious objectorshad in fact been required to undertake, some other form of nationalservice as a condition of exemption from military service, but ithad been possible in exceptional cases to grant unconditionalexemption.The general view of the Cabinet was that all conscientious objectors should be liable to direction to some form of nationalservice other than their normal occupation, but that in exceptional cases it should be possible to grant unconditional exemptionL32698^4] B 3
(g) Training for Civil Defence. There was general agreement that men called up to the Forces should receive adequate trainingin civil defence.(h) Services&apos; Education Schemes. There should be full con-sultation with the Ministry of Education on schemes for vocationaleducation in the Services.(i) Form of Announcement. The Prime Minister said that he proposed to outline the scheme in his speech in the debate on the address. A White Paper describing the scheme in greater detailcould be published concurrently with the National Service Bill.The Cabinet-(2) Subject to the points made at (d), (e) and (/) above, approved the recommendations of the Defence Committee on thesubsidary questions set out in paragraph 8 of CP. (46)380.(3) Invited the Man-Power Committee to consider whether, inorder to achieve as much flexibility as possible in thearrangements for refresher training, the period forwhich men would be liable could be defined, not as amaximum of three weeks a year, but as a maximum totalperiod to be served during the 5^ years.(4) Took note that, in his speech in the debate on the Address,the Prime Minister would outline the governments proposals for the introduction of a permanent schemeof national service; and agreed that a White Papergiving a more detailed description of the scheme shouldbe published simultaneously with the National service bill.Albania.Freedom of passage inthe CorfuStrait.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that on 15th Maytwo British cruisers passing through the Corfu Strait betweenAlbania and Greece were fired on by Albanian batteries. In the diplomatic exchanges following this incident the Albanian Govern-ment alleged that our ships had no right to be in their waters.This allegation was ill-founded; for, apart from the fact that theswept channel passed through Albanian waters, international usageallowed the right of innocent passage of warships through terri-torial waters. Moreover, both merchant ships and warships had always enjoyed the right of innocent passage through straits con-necting two portions of the high seas, unless otherwise provided by international agreement. The Albanians had been finally informedthat we should continue to exercise the right of using this channelconferred by international usage and that, if they fired at us, weshould fire back.Since May His Majesty&apos;s ships had not, in fact, used the sweptchannel until 22nd October, when two British destroyers passing through it hit mines and suffered serious damage and casualties.As a result of this incident the Foreign Office gave notice to theGreek and Albanian Governments that fresh minesweeping opera-tion would be carried out in the near future in this swept channel.This operation was due to start on the following day, 1st November.The Mediterranean Zone Board of the International Mine ClearanceBoard had agreed to it, but it would be carried out solely by british forces. Fighter cover and other defensive measures had been pre-pared in case the Albanians took offensive action.The Albanian Government had now lodged a protest, both withHis Majesty&apos;s Government and with the United Nations, allegingthat their national rights had been violated by the passage of theBritish destroyers through the Strait on&apos; 22nd October, and alsoclaiming that their territorial waters should not be violated by shipsundertaking the clearance of mines.
The First Lord of the Admiralty asked the Cabinet to decide&quot;whether, in view of this protest, the mine clearance operations should proceed, as planned, on the following day : whether it shouldbe deferred for, say, 24 or 48 hours; or whether it should be abandoned.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, The First sea lord said that the Corfu Strait was an established internationalwaterway between two seas, precisely similar to the Strait of Boni-facio, between Corsica and Sardina. In both cases the channel for shipping ran in the territorial waters of the countries on each side.The Corfu Strait was used before the war as a matter of normalroutine by the shipping of the world, and was particularly useful for small craft, which could take advantage of the sheltered&apos; waters.The existing swept channel had originally been cleared of mines in1944. It had been notified in various official pamphlets issued bythe Mediterranean Zone Board of the International Mine ClearanceBoard, copies of which had been communicated to the AlbanianGovernment. Their claim to exclude us from the right to mine-sweep the channel was tantamount to claiming the right to close the channel as an international waterway.The Minister of State suggested that our political position in meeting the Albanian complaint to the United Nations would be stronger if we had first invited the Albanians to sweep the channelthemselves.In reply, it was pointed out that the Albanians had noresources for minesweeping; and that, even if they had, a request that they should sweep the channel themselves would cut across theinternational arrangements for mine clearance. The appropriateorgan of the International Mine Clearance Board had already agreed that the channel should be swept and had authorised theBritish naval authorities to carry out the operation.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the protest lodgedwith the United Nations, he would wish to have the foreign secretary&apos;s views before finally deciding whether the minesweepingoperation should proceed. He would also wish to know whetherthe Soviet representative on the Mediterranean Zone Board, of theInternational Mine Clearance Board had been present at theBoard&apos;s meeting when the minesweeping operation was authorisedand, if so, what attitude he had taken on this matter. We shouldbe better able to meet criticism in the United Nations if we knew that the Soviet representative on the Board had assented to theoperation. Enquiries should at once be made on these two points and, until the results were known, the minesweeping operation should be postponed.The Cabinet-(1) Decided that the proposed mine clearance operation in theCorfu Strait should be postponed for the time being,and invited the First Sea Lord to give instructionsaccordingly.(2) Invited the Minister of State, in consultation with the FirstLord of the Admiralty, to explain the position to theForeign Secretary and ascertain his views.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to ascertain and inform the Prime Minister whether the Soviet repre-sentative on the Mediterranean Zone Board of theInternational Mine Clearance Board was a party to thedecision that this mine-sweeping operation should becarried out by the British naval authorities.(4) Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio and the First Lord of theAdmiralty, to determine the further action to be takenin the light of the reports obtained in pursuance of conclusions (2) and (3) above.
Food.(previous reference:CM. (46) 91stConclusions,Minute 1.)CerealSupplies.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister olFood (CP. (46) 399) on the prospective supplies of wheat and floulfor the United Kingdom during the period up to September 19471This showed a probable world deficit of cereals for the crop yeal1946-47 of several million tons. Our own stocks, at 1,034,000 tons!were already below the prudent minimum and the supplies aipresent assured to us and to the territories for whose supplies we;iiad direct responsibility were not enough to prevent them falling]lower. To maintain our own present level of consumption we needed!400,000 tons more than were in sight between now and next!September. To enable us to dispense with bread rationing wjshould need a further 436,000 tons. The Minister of Food!recommended that the Canadian Government should be asked tcltake vigorous steps to induce producers to market during the crop!year a larger quantity of wheat. Our additional needs could not!however, be wholly met from Canada and it was to the United]States that we must look for the balance of our requirements. Anfearly high-level approach should be made to the United States!Government on the subject. Until we were assured of our own!supplies, the present bread rationing scheme must continue and it!should be simplified and enforced more rigorously. There could!also be no diversions from our stocks to Germany, India or elsewhere!while our own position was as precarious as it now was. The!&apos;United States Government must be persuaded to provide enough for Ithe needs of those areas as well as for our own needs.In discussion it was recalled that when the Cabinet had considered on 25th October the prospective supplies of food-stuffsgenerally they had agreed that the Foreign Secretary should discussthe position with members of the United States administrationduring his visit to the United States. The present memorandum should be regarded as an amplification in regard to wheat and flourof the general position which had then been considered, and thefacts stated in it should be before the Foreign Secretary in makinghis representations to the United States Government. The UnitedKingdom requirements must be set against the background of thegeneral world position.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) The Lord President and the Minister of Food recalled that members of the United States administration had urged upon themin the summer that the United Kingdom Government should notresort to bread rationing. They Could, therefore, be pressed to make available the supplies required to enable us to dispense withrationing by September 1947.(b) In making his representations the Foreign Secretary must also have in mind the needs of the British Zone in Germany and ofIndia.  It must be for him to decide how best to present the case.The Secretary of State for India reminded the Cabinet of thelextreme seriousness and urgency of India&apos;s needs.As regards the British Zone in Germany, it was recalled thatbh 21st October (CM. (46) 89th Conclusions, Minute 3), the Foreign!Secretary had undertaken to make an immediate request to theUnited States Government to pool on an equitable basis the565,000 tons which had been allocated to the British and UnitedStates Zones for the current quarter.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that these repre-sentations had not been successful. From a telegram which he had just received from Germany it seemed likely that the United states authorities had made a small allocation to the British Zone with aview to bringing pressure on us to extract wheat for Germany from canada. They believed that Canada had a surplus which she Iwished to use to regain some of her export markets outside theUnited Kingdom; and they wished to break down the Canadian ruleagainst allowing their wheat to go to Germany.The Minister of Food said that there was no question of any surplus being available from Canada to supply the needs ofGermany.
IllCM. 93 (46). The Cabinet agreed that it was important that the true facts of the situation should be explained to the United States authorities by the Foreign Secretary, and that great pressure should be broughtupon them to agree to a pooling of supplies between the two Zones.No diversion from United Kingdom stocks could provide enoughto make adequate provision for the British Zone; and, if any suchdiversions were made, the United States administration would be led to suppose that our situation was less serious than it really was.While our own position was as precarious as it now was, there couldbe no diversion of wheat or flour from the United Kingdom toGermany or to India. If the position changed the matter could bere considered by the Cabinet. Meanwhile, British officials inGermany, in their contacts with representatives of the UnitedStates, should take care to avoid giving the impression that therewas any possibility of obtaining from United Kingdom stocksfurther supplies of wheat for the British Zone; and they should loseno opportunity of making it clear that the deficit in both the Britishand United States Zones would have to be made good by supplies from the United States.(c) Australian wheat and flour was at present being sent onlyto India and to areas of United Kingdom responsibility in theFar East. This diversion had been made to meet the short-termemergency; but the Australian Government were anxious not to lose their connections in the United Kingdom market and would liketo resume shipments to this country. There was general agreement that it should be our long-term aim to bring some of Australia&apos;^wheat to the United Kingdom, leaving India to seek replacementfrom the Argentine or the United States. This would have theadvantage of increasing the proportion of our own needs which wecould meet from within the sterling area. A start should be madewith this process as soon as conditions allowed.(d) The Cabinet agreed that bread rationing must be continued for the present.The Minister of Food said that the present scheme, while itwas generally acceptable to the public, placed a severe burden onthe bakers and was very difficult to enforce. He was considering whether a more effective scheme could be devised, and would bringdetailed proposals before the Cabinet at a later meeting.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of State to inform the foreign secretary of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Food, to arrange for the detailed statement in CP. (46) 399 on the needs of theUnited Kingdom for additional supplies of wheat and flour to be made available to him so that he might make use of it in the representations which he was to make tothe United States Government about the world food situation as a whole.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Food, to continue his efforts to obtain from the Canadian Government anincreased allocation of Canadian wheat to the UnitedKingdom.(3) Agreed that bread rationing should continue for thepresent and took note that the Minister of Food would submit to the Cabinet proposals designed to simplify the scheme and to enable it to be more rigorouslyenforced.(4) Agreed that while the United Kingdom position was asprecarious as it now was there could be no diversion ofwheat or flour from the United Kingdom to the british zone of Germany or to India.
Production of 6.   The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by the Secre-Ground-nuts tary of State for the Colonies and&quot;the Minister of Food (CP. (46)in East 402) regarding a project for the large-scale growing of ground-nutsAfrica. in East Africa,The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that a mission had recently visited Africa to examine this project. Their report Ishowed that production of 50,000 long tons of shelled nuts could Ibe attained in 1948, rising to 530,000 long tons from 1951 onwards.A capital investment of the order of  25 million was involved forthe whole scheme, but the revenue derived should be sufficient to repay the capital fairly rapidly. It was suggested that a specialsection of the Ministry of Food should be set up forthwith to initiate the scheme, using as agents an experienced commercialcompany, such as the United Africa Company, but that as soon aspossible a United Kingdom public corporation should be established,receiving its capital as a loan from the Treasury.Before the Government decided to embark on the full scheme,more time was required to consider its implications more fully. Inview, however, of the immediate shortage of oils and fats, it was proposed to make a start at once with the relatively small-scale development projected for the first year so that a small crop mightbe obtained early in 1948. This would involve the expenditure of up to  3 million on clearing bush, obtaining the necessary machinery and buildings, and procuring seed for the first year&apos;s crop.The Minister of Food emphasised the importance of developingEmpire sources of oils and fats. We could at present supply only60 per cent, of our rationed requirements from within the Empire.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that up to  3 million should be made available for the initial stage of the project, on twoconditions : (i) that responsibility for the project would be under-taken by the Ministry of Food, and (ii) that the crops would beavailable for our use and would not be merged in an internationalpool. The Minister of Food said that these conditions were, .        accepted.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) The finance for this project would not be provided fromthe Colonial Development and Welfare Fund.(b) It was understood that excavators, crawler tractors andother machinery would be required for clearing the bush.   Could: &apos; this equipment be obtained without interference with other urgentclaims ?, , . The Minister of Food said that he recognised that there couldbe no question,of using on this scheme equipment required for theworking of open-cast coal and other urgent United Kingdom pro-grammes. He was, however, advised that a good deal of the equipment required could be improvised from material available in africa.The Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies andthe Minister of Food to initiate a scheme on the lines indicated in CP. (46) 402, up to a total cost of  3 million,on the understanding that this would not involve inter-ference with other schemes already approved, such asthe working of open-cast coal, for which the same type ofspecial equipment was required.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,31st October, 1946.
