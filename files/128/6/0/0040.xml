Germany. THE Cabinet had before them telegrams from the ForeignFinancing of Secretary (New York telegrams Nos. 2150 and 2151) reporting theBritish and discussions which he had held with the United States Secretary ofUnited States State, since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 25th November, about theZones. proposals for the joint financing of the British and United States(Previous       Zones of Germany.    They also had before them a note by the reference-      Secretary (CP. (46) 438) covering a memorandum summarising the cm. (46) 100th resuite OI&quot; those discussions and annexing drafts of the proposedConclusions     agreement for the economic fusion of the two Zones.Minute 2) &apos; These papers showed that the Foreign Secretary had not beenable to secure all the assurances which the Cabinet, by their decisionof 25th November, had asked him to obtain before signing theproposed agreement. First, Mr. Byrnes had rejected the proposal that the burden on the United Kingdom in terms of dollars andother &apos;: hard &quot; currencies should be limited to  75 million. He had said that there was no possibility of persuading Congress to accept such a limitation; and the Foreign Secretary considered that on thispoint his answer must be regarded as final. Secondly, the alterna-tive of limiting to one year the period for which we should be committed under the agreement had also been rejected. Althoughthe draft provided that the agreement should be reviewed at annualintervals, it did not in terms empower us to terminate it at theend of 1947. Thirdly, no specific assurance had been given that theeconomic fusion of the two Zones would not prejudice our policy for socialising the principal industries of the Ruhr. the americans had stated that they would raise no objection to thispolicy provided that the initiative for it came from the Germans;and the Foreign Secretary considered that it would be inadvisable to press for further assurances on this point in view of the predominantly Republican character of the new Congress.On the other hand, the draft agreement met our conditions(i) that the joint Anglo-American Agency for controlling theimports and exports of the two Zones should be instructed to ensurethat imports should be drawn from &apos;&apos; easy-currency &apos;&apos; countries tothe fullest extent practicable; (ii) that the United states authorities should at once give full effect to the principle of poolingfood supplies for the two Zones; (iii) that the United states authorities should assume responsibility for procuring such of thefood supplies for the two Zones as had to be drawn from the UnitedStates; and (iv) that all expenditure by the two Governments onthe two Zones should be recovered from future German exports inthe shortest practicable time consistent with the rebuilding of theGerman economy on healthy, non-aggressive lines.The Prime Minister said that he had had a telephone conversa-tion with the Foreign Secretary since these telegrams were received.The Foreign Secretary was fully satisfied that these were the bestterms which could be obtained from the United States Government,and that it would be useless to press the demand for a specificlimitation of our dollar commitment. He still considered that wehad no alternative but to go forward with the policy for economicfusion of the two Zones; and he asked for authority to conclude theagreement on the basis of the drafts annexed to CP. (46) 438.The Minister of Fuel and Power again put forward the argument, which he had advanced at the Cabinets previous discussion, that&apos; the proposed agreement would have the effect of bringing this country still further under the economic domination of the United States. He also suggested that it would destroy all hope of securing agreement with the Soviet Government for treatingGermany as a single economic unit, and would encourage the viewthat the division of Europe into eastern and western spheres of influence was inevitable. On both grounds he would have preferred that we should retain our independence of action within the british zone; and he believed that in the long run it would be possible forus so to organise our Zone as to enable it to pay its way. He recog-nised that during the next six months we should continue to be dependant on the United States for food supplies for the British
Zone; but he believed that thereafter our dollar difficulties shouldbe substantially less -partly because we should have developedalternative sources of supply and partly because the United states would eventually be compelled to reduce prices in order to preservemarkets for their exports.As against this, it was pointed out that in the preamble to theproposed agreement the two Governments declared that it wasspecifically designed as a first step towards achieving the economic unity of Germany as a whole, and that they would be ready at anytime to discuss its extension to either of the other two Zones. Whilethe long-term prospects for the British Zone might be favourable, itwas difficult to see how it could survive the coming winter withoutsupplies from the United States; and, if we now turned back onthe policy of economic fusion of the British and United StatesZones, we should have no assurance that the United States Govern-ment would in fact make available the supplies of food and rawmaterials which were required before the process of regeneratingthe economy of the British Zone could begin.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that, while theUnited States Government were asking us to pay a high price forthe agreement, our dependence on them for essential supplies forthe British Zone in the immediate future was so great that it wasonly through the policy of economic fusion of the two Zones thatwe could hope to re-establish the economy of the British Zone.There was therefore no practical alternative but to take the bestterms we could get under an Anglo-American agreement for theeconomic fusion of the two Zones.The Cabinefs main discussion then turned on the questionwhether further assurances should not be obtained from the UnitedStates Government about our freedom (i) to pursue the policy ofsocialising the principal industries of the Ruhr, and (ii) to terminate the agreement if it were found to place too great a strain on our dollar resources.As regards the Ruhr, it was agreed that we could not restcontent with the American statement that they would not objectto socialisation of the Ruhr industries if the initiative came fromthe Germans themselves. Government supporters in parliament would look jealously on provisions of the agreement which appearedto imply that industry in the British Zone would pass under thecontrol of an Anglo-American agency. And it could not be denied that a combination of American finance and German industrial organisation might well create, in a few years&apos; time, a formidablecompetitor for our own export trade. If, as the Cabinet were assured, there was nothing in the proposed agreement which wouldenable one of the two Governments to intervene in the internal administration of the other&apos;s Zone, it was most important that thisshould be made clear from the outset. If, for the reasons given in new York telegram No. 2151, it was thought inexpedient to press for the inclusion of an explicit statement to this effect in the agree-ment itself, we should at least make it clear to the United StatesGovernment that this was our understanding of the position andthat we should be obliged to say so in reply to the questions whichwould certainly be asked on this point when the agreement was announced in Parliament.As regards the duration of the agreement, paragraph 12 ofthe draft, though it provided for an annual review, appeared to imply that the agreement could not be terminated except by mutualconsent. On the other hand, it was arguable that either party toan agreement of this kind was free to withdraw from it if circum-stances changed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential that the United States Government should be left in nodoubt that our ability to operate the agreement would depend onour power to provide the necessary dollar resources; and that, if a situation arose before the end of 1949 in which the pressure on our dollar resources made it impossible for us to find the dollars required under this agreement, we should have no alternative but to-21 b 2
withdraw from the agreement unless it was so modified as to meetthe new situation.   To avoid any risk of recrimination over this ata later stage, the Foreign Secretary should put this on record in a personal letter to the United States Secretary of State.Further points made in discussion were : (a) An early opportunity should be taken of explaining to theBritish public the effect which our efforts to rebuild the german economy were likely to have on the standards of life in this country.(b) Adjustments might have to be made, not only in ourdomestic programmes, but in our other overseas commitments,e.g., in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.(c) The conclusion of this agreement would make it even more necessary to find means of improving our overseas balance of trade;and the Treasury should expedite the preparation of the report onthis for which the Cabinet had called at their meeting on 4th November (CM. (46) 94th Conclusions, Minute 5).(d) Our future policy in respect of the export of coal fromGermany should be governed by the need of implementing this new agreement, even though that meant that no coal could be delivered to France in 1947. The conclusion of this agreement would compel us to adopt a firmer line with the French, whose political andeconomic policies for Germany were incompatible with the purposesof the agreement.(e) The adoption of the policy of economic fusion of the two zones would probably involve some strengthening of our adminis-trative machinery in the British Zone, particularly on the economicside. It would also involve modification of the existing agreement on the level of German industry; and we could not allow this to beheld up by undue delay in securing quadripartite agreement.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that the Foreign Secretary shouldbe authorised to sign the agreement, on the basis of the draftsannexed to OP. (46) 438, subject to his putting on record in a letterto the United States Secretary of State, before the agreement was signed, his understanding of its implications as regards (i) thecontrol of the Ruhr industries, and (ii) our liberty to withdraw from the agreement if our dollar situation made it impossible forus to continue.  As regards the Ruhr, this letter should make itclear that it was our understanding of the agreement that each ofthe occupying Powers  remained  responsible  for  the internal administration of its Zone and for the organisation of industrywithin that Zone.  As regards duration, the letter should state that,while it was our intention that the agreement should continue untilamended by mutual consent, we thought it right to put it on record that a situation might arise before the end of 1949 in which the pressure on our dollar resources made it impossible for us to find the dollars required for Germany under the agreement and that inthis event we should have no alternative but to withdraw from theagreement unless it were so modified as to meet the new situation.Other circumstances might arise which would necessitate an imme-diate review and adjustment of the agreement, e.g., if either theFrench or the Soviet Government desired that the arrangement should be extended to their Zones.  While paragraph 12 of the draftprovided that the agreement should be reviewed at yearly intervals,it was our understanding that, if there was any substantial changein circumstances which called for adjustment of its provisions,either party to the agreement might ask the other to bring the changed  circumstances under  review.    The Foreign   secretary should make it clear in his letter that, if either of these two points were raised in Parliament, we should explain that this was our understanding of the position and that the United States Govern-ment had been so informed.The Cabinet- I(1) Invited the Prime Minister to authorise the Foreign!Secretary to conclude an agreement for the economic!fusion of the British and United States, Zones of!
Germany, on the basis of the drafts annexed to -CP. (46) 438, subject to his putting on record, in a personal letter to the United States Secretary of State,His Majesty&apos;s Governments understanding of theposition as regards the Ruhr industries and the duration of the agreement, as set out above.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the text of theagreement to be presented to Parliament as a white paper as soon as it had been signed.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the conclusionof the agreement, to announce it on the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s behalf in answer to a Private Notice Question inthe House of Commons.note telegram was sent to the Foreign Secretary in pursuance of Conclusion (1)above. Later in the day the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequerwere in touch with the Foreign Secretary on the telephone and it was arranged that His Majesty&apos;s Governments understanding of the position as regards the ruhr industries and the duration of the agreement should be embodied, not ina personal letter to the United States Secretary of State, but in two replies whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer could give in Parliament in answer to supple-mentary Questions on 3rd December after announcing the conclusion of theagreement. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would be in a position to state thatthese replies had been shown to and were accepted by the United StatesGovernment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1946.
