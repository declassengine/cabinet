MOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD

C.M. (64) 5th Conclusions

(17th January, 1964 - 10.30. a.m.)

MR. IAIN MACLEOD&apos;S ARTICLE IN THE &apos;SPECTATOR&apos;

At the opening of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY (Mr. R.A. Butler) made a short statement about an article by Mr. Iain Macleod, M.P. which had appeared in the edition of the &apos;Spectator&apos; published that day. This article had contained Mr. Macleod&apos;s version of the events immediately preceding the appointment of Sir Alec Douglas-Home as Prime Minister in October; and it had been sharply critical of certain aspects of the manner in which, as Mr. Macleod saw it, this appointment had taken place.

The Foreign Secretary said that he had seen the article but had refused to make any public comment upon it. He hoped that all members of the Cabinet would adopt the same attitude. He did not propose to offer any observations to the Cabinet on the substance of the article; and he felt that the Cabinet&apos;s right course was to reaffirm their support for the Prime Minister in his efforts to lead the Government forward to the General Election.

THE PRIME MINISTER thanked the Foreign Secretary for these remarks. There was no further discussion.
