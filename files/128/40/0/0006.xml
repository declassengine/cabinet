C.C.(52) 98th and 99th ConclusionsCl8th and 20th November, 1952 - 11.30 a.m.)&quot;^pjRVH. THE&amp;KE.OF WINDSORjlpftendance atfMiS CoronationAt the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 18th November, THE PRIMEMINISTER said that H.R.H, the Duke of Windsor, whom he was seeing that afternoon, was likely to ask whether he should not be invitedto attend the Coronation.     The Prime Minister said that it might become necessary for him to tender advice to The Queen on this point,-and he would be glad to know his colleagues&apos; views.     He himselfthought it would be quite inappropriate for a King who had abdicatedto be present as an official guest at the Coronation of one of his successors.     A clear distinction could be drav/n between the coronation and the funeral of a member of the Royal Family, whichit would be natural for the Duke of Windsor to attend.The Cabinet endorsed the view expressed by thePrime Minister.At their meeting on 20th November, the Cabinet were informed that the Duke of Windsor had accepted the Prime Ministerssadvice that he should not seek to be present at the Coronation.The Duke thought, however, that it would be necessary for him tosay something on this point in reply to questions by press correspondents.     He proposed to say that it vrould not be in accord with constitutional propriety or usage that the Coronation of the sovereign should be attended by any other Ruler or former Ruler,,THE PRBE MINISTER said that he had commended the line which the duke of Windsor wa3 proposing ia take in reply to Press enquiries onthis point.At their meeting on 18th November the Cabinet were informed that, while the Labour Government vrere in office, the duke of Windsor had obtained permission to transfer from his ownfunds in this country a sum of  80,000 vrhich he needed for thepurchase or building of a property, in France.     It wa3 understood-1-
that this sum had he en found insufficient for the purpose and that the duke would he seeking permission to transfer a further  40,000,,THE ERTHE MINISTER said that, if the Duke raised this matter in conversation with him, he proposed to suggest that he should discuss it with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,At their meeting on 20th November the Cabinet were informedthat the Duke of Yfindsor had raised this question and was to discuss it with the Chancellor.     In the course of a short discussion several ministers expressed the view that, if it was in the public interest that the Duke of Windsor should make his home outside the UnitedKingdom, it was unreasonable that he should be denied facilities for transferring his own money from the United Kingdom to the country inwhich he proposed to establish himself.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER said that he accepted that view and would be guided by it inhis conversation with the Duke of Windsor.
