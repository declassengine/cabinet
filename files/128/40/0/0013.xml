ImiTOP secret no CIRCULATION RECORD1   EQUAL-PAI &apos;.j Previousullfeference:p. (54) 22nd.m Conclusions)-   C.0.(54) 24TH CONCLUSIONS(31st March, 1954   -   4.00 p.m.).&apos;. &apos; THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that since the Cabinet&apos;discussion on 24th March he had reviewed the various pledges given on behalf of the Conservative Party in respect of equal.pay.     Therewas &apos;no doubt that the Party was deeply committed;;   and, if they failedto make a start on this during their present term of office,, it wouldcertainly be very difficult to frame a suitable statement on thesubject for inclusion in the Party Manifesto at the next generalelection.     Ministers would then face.the choice of repeating theformula&apos;used in 1951 or of saying that they no longer favoured theprinciple of equal pay;   and neither of these alternatives was atall attractive.     He had weighed very carefully the objections which;. had been put for7,-ard in. the Cabinet&apos; s last discussion;   but he was disposed to think that, on balance, the better course would be tomake some move towards the adoption of a gradual scheme for theintroduction of equal pay in the - non-industrial Civil Service.     Bythis means he thought that the Government could retain the initiative and would be able to control the pace of the development.     If itwere decided to go forward on this basis, he could make a balancedreference to this subject in.his Budget speech, indicating his willingness to begin the application of the principle of equal payin the non-industrial Civil Service on two conditions - first, that agreement v/as reached with the Civil&apos; Service Staff Associations onthe details of the scheme, and, second, that the scheme would bebrought into full operation by instalments over a period of five years,during which the Government would be able to consider the possibilityof granting some compensating allowances to married men with, large families.     The cost of such a scheme in the Civil Service would be
about  2 millions in the first year, rising to about  13 millionswhen it was in full operation.     It would then be for the BurnhamCommittees to consider the application of the principle to teachers,&apos;and there was good reason to hope that they would adopt a gradual.   - &apos;     &apos; - V:-:&apos;..  &apos;..v:-.  .-,     .-. , -      .. -&quot;scheme comparable to that introduced in the Civil Service. -He expected that this would start within a year. .   The application of :the principle to the National-Health Service would follow, perhaps alittle later.The main points made in the discussion which ensued may be&apos;, summarised as follows. ;On the political aspect there was general agreement that theintroduction of the scheme outlined by the Chancellor of the exchequer was ribt likely to win more votes than it lost at the next&apos;generalelection.     In this connection it was recognised that the scheme would fail to give full satisfaction to the advocates of equal pay,partly because of its gradual application and partly because it wasnot to extend to industrial Civil Servants.     On the other hand, some ministers still felt that some votes.might be lost at the electionif by then the Government had taken no steps to redeem their pledgein respect of equal pay.     And there was general agreement that, if no action were taken meanwhile, the Conservative Party would find itdifficult to know what should be said on this subject in the PartyManifesto at the election.The Cabinet accepted the view that&apos;a limited scheme of thiskind corild be introduced without any great risk that it would cause .the principle of equal pay to be applied generally throughout industryTo that extent the proposal would not directly impose any new burden on industry.On the other hand, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADErepeated his argument that, in so far as it increased-publics-expenditure, this scheme would postpone the time when industry could  .hope to gain relief from the existing burden of taxation.     He urgedthat this argument should be weighed, not in relation to the cost of
the first year&apos;s instalment ( 2.millions) but to the much larger sumwhich the scheme would inevitably impose on the Exchequer and therates when it was in full operation ( 36.25 millions).     Industry-would have little confidence in the Government&apos;s will to reducepublic expenditure if they embarked on such a scheme at the presenttime.     And, unless substantial reductions could be made in public   -expenditure there was little hope of any reduction in taxation.It was his duty to warn the Cabinet that, unless the burden of/taxation could be redticed, British industry would be unable to meetthe increase4**e competition vAtich it was now encountering in world markets from&apos;Germany and Japan.In further discussion reference was made to the possibility that the Government would find it necessary, during the nextParliamentary session, to make some improvement in old-age pensions.The. suggestion 7/as made that in that event there might be something to be said for delaying the introduction of this limited scheme for equal pay so that it could be brought in, together with an improvementin old-age pensions, in the last session before a general election.It was pointed out that the adoption of both these plans would increase the difficulties of securing any reduction in taxationbefore the next election. -.     THE PRIME MINISTER,summing up the discussion, said that therewas certainly some risk that the&apos; Chancellor of the Exchequer mightexpose himself to a charge of inconsistency if he introduced thisscheme for applying the principle of &quot;equal pay in the non-industrial civil Service at a time when he was about to call for drasticreductions in the volume of public expenditure.     But the chancellor was in the best position to judge whether some reference to thisscheme was necessary to round off the picture which he was to present
in his forthcoming Budget.     He thought that the Cabinet would be content to leave it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take afinal decision on this matter in the light of the views expressedby his colleagues in the Cabinet&apos;s two discussions on the subject.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE .EXCHEQUER said that .. v.- it had been helpful to him to have these discussions with his colleagues, and hewould reflectcfurther on the views whichthey had expressed before reaching a.final decision on this matter.Cabinet.

TOP SECRET&apos; NO CIRCULATIOISr BECOKDC.Cc(54) 24th Conclusions,, M&amp;na%e 3*(31st March, 1954 - 4 pamo)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY recalled the Cabinet&apos;s decision of25th August, 1953 that it was very desirable that the German documentsdealing with the approaches which German agents had made to the Duke of Windsor in 1940 in Spain and Portugal should not be published during the duke&apos;s lifetime0    In pursuance of that decision the Prime Minister had seen the British Editor (Miss Lambert) of the series of captured Germandocuments which was being&apos; published under the official auspices of theBritish, French and United States Governments j   and she had accepted theCabinet1 s view that publication of these documents affecting the Duke of Windsor should be delayed,,The Foreign Secretary said that, if we were now to agree thatthe whole collection of German diplomatic documents which had fallen into jAllied hands at the end of the war should be returned to the custody ofthe German Federal Government on the conditions set out in C0(54) 109,we should make it a condition of our agreement that this particular file of papers relating to the Duke of Windsor should be retained in ourcustody in the United Kingdom,,     As the other Governments concerned were anxious to secure our agreement to the general proposition, there was agood prospect that they could be persuaded to accept this condition,,He proposed to negotiate privately on that basis with the German federal chancellor and the United States Secretary of StateeThe Foreign Secretary recalled that there was reason to believe Ithat copies of some of these documents might already be in private hands,in the United States or elsewhere.    His proposal would not thereforeexclude all possibility of publication, but it should at least excludepublication under official auspices.THE PRIME MINISTER saia that he hoped that the Foreign secretary would be able to persuade the German and the United States Governments toaccept the solution which he proposed.
