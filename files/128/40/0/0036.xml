The duke of Edinburgh had recently been interested in the extension ofthe activities of flying clubs and in that connection had shownparticular interest in a single-seater light aircraft known asthe Rollason Turbulent.   He had expressed a wish to fly this aircraft himself from a suitable airfield - not as a means oftransport from one point to another, but in order to gain first-hand experience of its operation.    The Secretary of State forAir. said that this proposal involved no new principle, as the duke of Edinburgh had flown solo in a number of differentaircraft in the past.   Subject therefore to the views of theCabinet he saw no reason to raise objection.to this proposal,provided that suitable safety precautions were observed.   Forexample, the flight would be limited to an area within sight ofthe airfield, as the aircraft carried no radio;    it should takeplace when the weather was clear and not liable to suddendeterioration;    and no other flying would be allowed at the airfield while the Duke of Edinburgh was in the air.Discussion showed that there was&quot;general agreement in theCabinet that no objection need be raised to this proposal.The Cabinet -Authorised the Secretary of State for air to arrange for H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburghto make a flight in a Rollason Turbulentaircraft, subject to the safety precautionswhich he had outlined to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th October, 1959.
