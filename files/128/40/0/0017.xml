Malenkov.    The President had said that this project would not create any difference between the Governments of the United Statesand the United Kingdom or alter his confidence in the PrimeMinister &apos;s dedication to the principles which had united the twocountries in time of peril and now constituted the best guarantee of world peace.

Malenkov except on a basis of full equality.He had also been reassured by the Prime Minister&apos;s insistence thatthe Soviet Government should give proof of their sincerity by deedsas well as words;  and he had agreed that it would help to re-establish public confidence if the Russians would undertake to ratify the Austrian Treaty and to co-operate in the Atomic BankPlan.The Prime Minister said that he was gratified by theterms and the tone of the Presidents message.The Cabinet were also informed of a conversation whichthe Foreign Secretary had held with VI.
