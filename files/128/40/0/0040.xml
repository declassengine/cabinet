102- CABINETThe following should be read in conjunction with c.C.(63) 39th Conclusions, Minute 3,CPrinted Version)THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he was himself thesubject of some of the rumours to which the Prime Minister had referred.     In one respect the allegations in question might involve him in some difficulty;    for the rest he completely deniedthem.&apos;     He realised, however, that in the present situation his presence in the Government might embarrass his colleagues;    andhe therefore proposed to discuss with the Prime Minister whether .the circumstances required him to tender his resignation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as he had emphasised inthe recent Parliamentary debate, he had sought, and would continueto seek, to deal honourably, justly and prudently with the difficult personal issues which confronted him.   &apos; He had nevertaken action against a colleague on the basis of rumour alone;and he would refuse to accept any Minister&apos;s resignation on thegrounds of unsupported allegations.     If, however, a Ministerjudged in his own discretion that his right course was to resign,he might feel compelled to.accept that resignation.     He would discuss the circumstances further with the Commonwealth Secretary,who had acted both wisely and honourably in being prepared to take his colleagues into his confidence on a personal and privatematter.The Cabinet -: Took note that the Prime Minister would give further consideration-, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary, to the latter&apos;s-    personal position&apos; in relation to an enquiry :of this kind..Cabinet Office, S.W.1.20th June, 1963
