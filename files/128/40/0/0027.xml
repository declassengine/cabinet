HOST Cffi-IFIDEI-TTIAL RECORDCABINETCM. (56) 39th Conclusions(5th June, 1956 - 11.00 a.m.)THE PRTxE MINISTER said that, in view of one or two particularinstances which had come to Ms notice, it would be necessary for him toissue some, genera], guidance on the question whether a Minister, while holding office, could properly continue to participate in the pension scheme of a firm with which he was associated before he took office.In deciding that general guidance should be given on this point he would find it helpful to know what personal problems of this kind had actuallyarisen.     He would therefore be glad if any member of the Cabinet who had had occasion to consider what action he should himself take about pension rights of this kind would send to him, through the Secretary of theCabinet, a note of any arrangements which he had made to deal with sucha situation.     The Leaders of the two Houses of Parliament and the chief whip were making similar enquiries of Ministers of Cabinet rank and of junior Ministers.     The Prime Minister said that, when all the relevant information was available, he would decide what general guidance shouldbe issued,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he hoped it would be found possible to cover the type of case in which it was desired thatcontributions to a firrp.&apos;s pension scheme should continue to be paid,both by the Minister and by the firm, while the Minister held office.Prom the enquiries which he had already made, it seemed likely that,if this type of case could be covered, few difficulties would arise.Cabinet Office, S.W.1..5TH JUNE, 1956.
