NO CIRCULATION RF.CORD24C.C.(53) 1st Conclusions.(6th January, 1953 - 11.0 a.m.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh p!&apos;,.had now successfully completed the first stage of his flying training and was anxious to proceed to the next stage, with the ultimate object ofbeing able to fly his own communication aircraft, e.g. a Dove or a Devon.THE CHIEF.OF THE AIR STAFF explained that two further stageswould be needed before training was completed.    In the first stagetraining would be in a Harvard aircraft, and in the next in an Anson.H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh had shown himself an apt and proficient pupil.In discussion, the following points were made:-(a) The Duke of Edinburgh had said that he had no intention oflearning to fly jet aircraft and that he would not at any time pilotan aircraft in which The Queen was a passenger.(b) The Duke oi Edinburgh would obtain no practical benefit from the elementary training which lie had so far received on light aircraft.In the Harvard aircraft which it was now proposed ho should learn to fly, there would also be an instructor and the risks were therefore no more than those already taken.    If The Duke of Edinburgh ultimately wishedto fly his own aircraft of the Dove or Devon type, he could have theassistance of a co-pilot.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thought the Cabinet&apos;should raiseno objection to the extension of the flying training to be given with.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh on the understanding, already given, that hewould not fly jet aircraft and would not pilot an aircraft in which The Queen!was a passenger. He suggested, however, that when the next stage of trainingin the Harvard aircraft was completed theCabinet should review the matter again. He undertook to communicate the Cabinet1s decision to the PrimeMinister.mI
The Cabinet -Agreed that no objection should be raised with.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh undertaking an extended course of training in Harvard aircraft;and that the position should again be reviewed when this stage of training was completed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.7th January, 1953-
