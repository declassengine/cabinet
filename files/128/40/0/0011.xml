C.C.(53) 80th Conclusions

(18th December, 1953 - 3 p.m.)

ALAN NUNN MAY (Previous Reference: C.C. (53) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 10.)

THE HOME SECRETARY recalled that, on his release from prison at the end of 1952, Alan Nunn May had undertaken not to leave this country for a period of 12 months. During that time, despite the efforts of the Ministry of Labour, no suitable employment had been found for him. His funds were now running low; and, unless he could find some work here, it was possible that in the New Year he might decide to go abroad. He had possibilities of suitable employment in India and in Scandinavia. It would be a shock to public opinion, both here and in the United States, if he left this country. In the public mind his departure would be linked with the disappearances of Pontecorvo, McLean and Mrs. McLean; and in the United States it would provide a fresh occasion for criticism of British security arrangements. In these circumstances the Home Secretary considered that further efforts should be made to find suitable work for May in this country; but the Ministry of labour were satisfied that these would not be successful unless they could be assisted by some use of public funds. Suitable employment could be found for him here if, for example, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research were free to subsidise an employer willing to engage him or if he were given a direct grant for personal work on agricultural research. An expenditure of something between £500 and £2,000 a year might be required. The Home Secretary said that, while he disliked this course, he thought it was a lesser evil than allowing May to seek employment abroad.

THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he understood that the Minister of Labour shared the Home Secretary&apos;s view; but he himself found difficulty in accepting it. May&apos;s knowledge of atomic matters was now so out-of-date that it would be of no value to a potential enemy; and the objection to his proceeding abroad was one of appearances only. This could, if necessary, be publicly explained. It would be much more difficult to explain why a man who had been a traitor to his country should be given


employment by, or under the auspices of, a Government Department. He would be most reluctant to agree that May should be employed or subsidised by a Department under his control.

In discussion the Cabinet were assured that direct employment by a Government Department would not be necessary. Thus, there was a crystallographer in Cambridge who, being a Communist, was ready to give May employment if he could be assured of further expansion of the work which he was already doing for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research; and, if the Department gave him a promise of further orders, no direct payment need be made to May from public funds. That particular plan was, however, criticised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the ground that it would involve the Government in negotiations with a third party who, being a Communist, could not be expected to be reliable. It seemed preferable that, if any arrangement of this kind had to be made, it should be with May direct.

After some further discussion, the Cabinet reached the conclusion that it would be contrary to the public interest that May should go abroad in search of employment; that it would be justifiable to incur some modest expenditure from public funds for the purpose of securing his continued residence in this country, at any rate for another 12 months; and that the arrangements for this purpose should be made direct with May himself, the money being found from secret funds.

The Home Secretary undertook to arrange that Alan Nunn May should be provided, from secret funds, with means which would enable him to remain in this country, at any rate for another 12 months. Cabinet Office, S.W.l.
