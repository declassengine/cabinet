TOP secret copy No..6PERSIA(previous reference:C.C.(52) 74thConclusions,Minute 6).C.C.(52) 7 6th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex( 7th August, 1 952 - 5. 30 p. mOThe Cabinet resumed their discussion of thepossible course of political developments in Persia.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, since theCabinet&apos;s last discussion on 29th July, the american ambassador ana H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires in Teheranhad jointly reviewed the internal political situation andtheir views had been communicated \o the State Department.They both agreed that it was unlikely that any alternative to Dr. Mussadiq&apos;s Government could be brought into power at the present time except perhaps by a militarycoup djctat and that Generals Zahedi and Hedjazi seemedto be the most likely persons to bring about such a development.

It was thought likely that he would himself made a similar approach to the United States Embassy,and this might stimulate further American interest in thepossibility of a development along these lines.Until it was known whether the situation was likelyto develop in the direction of a military coup cl &apos;etat,it was important that the United States Government should not make any unconditional offer of financial assistance to dr.  Mussadiq.    This was a further reason for openingdiscussions with the United States Government regarding theba.sis of a fresh approach to the Persian Government on thelines indicated in C.(52) 276.The Cabinet -Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th August, 1 952.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. .It is issued for the personal use of...//p.??r^r...&quot;Jhyr^y?A-^ci      c^-y -
