TOP secret no CIRCULATION&apos;RECORDC.C.(54) 22ND CONCLUSIONS. \... (24th March, 1954   -. 11.30 a.mV)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had been&apos; considering whether he should announce in his Budget Speech a Government decision tointroduce the principle of equal pay in the non-industrial Civil Service.The Government were pledged to make a start on this &quot;as soon as theifleconomic and financial condition of the country permitted&quot;, and had inmm1951! expressed the hope that it would be possible to take the first step .111during the lifetime of the present Parliament.     Ministers would wish tommmbe able to claim, in a General Election, that as a result of their oolicies* &quot; fill[1!mthere had been a marked improvement in the economic and financialcondition of the country.     The Labour Party had already pledged themselvesto make an immediate start on the introduction of equal pay in the CivilService if they assumed office after the next Election.     The Government,could hope therefore to secure some electoral advantage If they made asbart with this before the Election.     Apart from these political arguments, Wlthe Chancellor said that he himself believed that on the merits there wasa strong case for applying the principle of equal pay in the Civil Service.The scheme which he had in mind was that equal pay should beintroduced gradually,  by annual instalments, over a period of years,beginning on 1st October, 1954.   On this basis the cost in the initial .years would be relatively small - of the order of  2-3 millions in the firstfull year.     If, however, as he expected, the principle was extended tothe health service, teachers and other&apos;local government services, the eventual annual cost, when it was in full operation, would beonce the process had started, there would be strong pressure to completeit within a shorter period.     Vhatever the basis on which it was originallyannounced, he thought it likoly that it would be in full operation within
3-5 years.     He also recognised that, once the principle had b^en appliedto the non-industrial Civil Service, it was bound to be extended to teachers and to local government services generally.In discussion the following particular points were ma.de:-(a) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that,  so long as it was not proposedextend the principle to industrial civil servants, he could not object to thlproposal.      He would however be obliged to oppose most strongly any suggestlfor extending it to industrial civil servants;    for that would lead to itsrapid and widespread extension throughout industrial employment.THE COLONIAL SECRETARY said that it could be demonstrated thatWmthere was a clear distinction in this matter between the public service andindustry.     Equal pay was not applicable, as a principle, to industry,he believed that,  if the proposal were confined to non-industrials in public Hservice,  it need not have repercussions on industry generally.(b) THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION said that, if the principle were appli,Hraiin the Civil Service,  th&apos;: burnham Committees woidd be bound, to recommend its fej;application to teachers.     This extension might, however,  be delayed for abo BjHIMAMSa year;    and the Government would be in a position to prevent the adoption,for the teachers,  of any scheme more generous or less gradual than that jproposed for the Civil Service.(c) THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that, once the principle was conceded in respect of the Civil Service, it must be assumed that it would have to beapplied in due course to the National Health Service.      This extension mightbe delayed for a time;    but he believed that equal  pay would be in full operation throughout the Health Service within 3 years of Its introduction in the Civil Service.m(d) THE MINISTER OF HOUSING said that the introduction of equal pay inMlocal government sen/ices would involve additional expenditure from localIrates of something between ?.o and  9 millions.     This would imoose a heavier  Bmr-jropo^tion-.!te burden cn the rates than it would on the Exchequer.     Thisproposal would therefore strengthen the case which he had made,  in 0.(5-0  111Jjfor reform of the existing system of local government finance.

He also recognised that, once the principle had been appliedto the non-industrial Civil Service, it was bound to be extended to teachersHand to local government services generally.In discussion the following particular points were ma.de:-(a) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that,  so long as it was not proposed -extend the principle to industrial civil servants, he could not object to thproposal.

This extension might, however, be delayed for aboia year;    and the Government would be in a position to prevent the adoption,for the teachers, of any scheme more generous or less gradual than that proposed for the Civil Service.(c) THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that, once the principle was conceded in respect of the Civil Service, it must be assumed that it would have to beapplied in dtie course to the National Health Service.

This would impose a heavierproportionate burden on the rates than it would on the Exchequer.     Thisproposal would therefore strengthen the case which he had made, In 0.(5-4-) Hljfor reform of the existing system of local government finance.
(e)       There was general agreement that,  once the principle of equal pay had been applied to women in the Civil Service, it would not be.practicable to delay the full application of the scheme for as long as7 years.     That being so, there was much to be said for the view that, ifthis project was to be launched at all, it should be presented from the outset as a scheme which would be completed within 3 or U years.On the political, aspect, it was argued that the proposal wouldbe well received by the-!men&apos;s Section of the Conservative Party;    andsome Ministers thought it might have electoral advantages.     Othersconsidered that it would not xvin votes at the next Election:    indeed, itmight even lose some;    but it was recognised that the Conservative Partymight be ab some disadvantage electorally for not having introduced equal pay when in office - as compared with the Labour Party, whose spokesmencould maintain that they would have introduced it If they had been in power.     In this connection the view was expressed that at the Electionthe Conservative Party would i^robably find themselves compelled to promise,if returned, to bring equal pay into full operation in the Civil service at once and this, if it had to be done, would be   more disadvantageous than to have begun before the Election its gradual application by a number of annual Instalments.Further discussion showed a general disposition to accept this as a necessa^r evil which,  if it were not introduced by a conservative government, would inevitably be brought into operation as soon as theLabour Party came into office.     That being&apos;so,  some Ministers felt that theConservative Party might take whatever political credit might be availablefor sponsoring the change.     As against this, a few Ministers considered thatthe change would be both undesirable on its merits and of doxibtfulpolitical advantage to the Party which introduced it.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that he would stronglydeprecate the introduction of equal pay&apos;for women in the public service.The cost.of the scheme, when in full operation, would be over  36 millions.No one could deny that the competitive power of British Industry was beingsteadily undermined hy the heavy burden of taxation, and that the national
Cabinet Office, .S.W.1.24IH -MARCH, 1954.interest.demanded that the weight of this burden should be reduced.      Ifthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had  36 millions to spare, there were many-ways in which it could be used to benefit British industry and, through it,the national economy as a whole.     The Chancellor had, however, warned hiscolleagues that,  if increased taxation was to be avoided, means must befound in 1954- of securing substantial reductions in Government expenditurein 1955-     Was it logical or consistent, while seeking those economies, to embark on a project which would eventually involve a net addition to public expenditure of over  36 millions?     These reductions could not be secured without changes in policy which would be unpopular and would have to bejustified on the ground that the economic condition of the country was such that strict economy must be enforced.     In these circumstances ministers would not find any difficulty in explaining why the Government had failed tocarry out their pledge to introduce equal pay in the Civil Service &quot;as soonas the economic and financial condition of the country permitted&quot;.     It was true no doubt that there 7;as substantial political pressure for theIntroduction of equal pay.     But there was nothing new in this.     For years past Governments ?riiich had been committed to the principle of equal pay ..&apos;had contrived to avoid applying It in practice, even though proposals to doso would have been carried by a substantial majority in the House of Commons.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he wouldre-consider this matter in the light of the views expressedIn the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and-would take an opportunityfor further consultation with his colleagues at a meetingof the Cabinet&apos; in the following week.
TOP SECRET MO CIRCULATION RECORD &apos; .SC.C. (54) 22ND CONCLUSIONS-(24th. March, 1954 - 11.30 a.m.)THE .CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, in spite ofthe efforts made to reduce&apos;them, food subsidies were now running atthe rate of  300 millions a year.     Of this total,  200 millions wereattributable to the support of home agriculture.     This v/ould be plain&apos; from the revenue accounts;   and he would have to declare in his.&apos;.Budget jspeech his determination to find more effective means of limiting theExchequer support for home food production.&apos;.:.; It-would be helpful if hecould indicate what particxilar means he proposed to apply for thispurpose.     There were two possibilities.     One was to reduce the subsidies directly:,   the other was to apply the principle of levysubsidies.     The main commodity to which.this principle might beapplied in the immediate future was flour.     He would like to recoverby means of a levy the cost of the guarantee on home-grown wheatestimated to be  14..6 millions in 1954/55.     The levy.would be imposed &apos;on all flour manufactured in the United Kingdom and on all importedflour and would result In the addition, of just over Id. to the-price ofa;32 lb. loaf and of between Id. and ^d. to the price of 1 lb. of flour.These price increases would represent an addition&apos; of about 0.34- to thecost of living index figure.     If this system 7/ere adopted, the levycould start to operate from 1st October, 1954 and the retail prices of bread and flour Would go up from that date.     This would entail &apos;legislation before the summer recess.THE PRIME MINISTER said&apos;that - the electors might find itdifficult.to follow the arguments about the relative merits of reducingthe subsidy on bread.or imposing a levy on flour.     But an increase of id. irt the cost of the 3i lb. loaf was something which every electorcould understand and most could criticise.     It was a well-known politicsargument, that an increase in the price of bread caused more bread to be -
eaten by the poorest people and thus bore most hardly on the poor.For&quot;when food prices rose, the poorest people ate less of the more expensive foods and more bread.     There could, be no doubt about thepolitical disadvantages of increasing the price of bread.In discussion the following points were made:-(a) .      However small the calculated increase in the cost of liviiindex figure, there was no doubt that the lowest paid; workers wouldpress for increased wages if the cost of bread went up.(b) Though there had been a levy on flour before the war,:it would be more difficult to defend such a system now when there was an Exchequer subsidy on bread.     It would not be easy to:justify asystem by which the Government simultaneously exacted a tax and offered a subsidy in respect of the same commodity.(c) Some saving could be secured on the bread subsidy if,as now seemed likely, therewere a fall in the world price of wheat....The benefit of this could be retained by the Exchequer and not passed on to the consumer.(d)       It would be dangerous to indicate in the Budget speech that a levy on flour was under consideration.as one of the methods of reducing the level of Exchequer support to British agricultureiThe Government would then be pressed to announce an early decision, andin the meantime political capital - would, he made out of the fact thatthey had even considered imposing a tax on the people&apos;s food.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hewould consider this problem further, in the light ofthe Cabinefs discussion.     It would be useful if theEconomic Policy Committee could also discuss some of themore detailed aspects of the problem at their meetingon the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.&apos; 2ATH MARCH, 1954.
