TOP SECRETIffCopy No.cabinet confidential annex cc(54) 47th Conclusions, Minute 4(7th. July, 1954 - 11. 30 a.m.)^washingtonItalksm (Previous^Reference:l;C.C.(54) 44th$Conclusions,:-lkinute 1)&quot;$Proposedf Meeting with&apos;M. MalenkovTHE PRIME MINISTER said that in the provate conversations which he had held with President Eisenhower during his recent visit to Washington he had again canvassed the possibility&apos;of an informal meeting of Heads of Governments, on a three-power or four-Power basis.    The President had at first seemed ready togive this serious consideration and had discussed the possibility that, if such a meeting were held in London, he might attend theopening, and perhaps the concluding, stages - being represented inthe interval by the Vice-President and the Secretary of State.Towards the end of the visit the President had been rather lessforthcoming, possibly as a result of consultations with his Secretaryof State, and had given the impression that it would be difficult for him to assent to such a meeting at the present time having regardto the state of public opinion in the United States.    Nevertheless^at his Press Conference on 3 0th June, he had said publicly that on.this question he differed more in emphasis than in substance fromthe views which had been publicly expressed by the Prime Minister.He had recalled that he had always expressed his readiness to confer with anybody if the deeds of the other side convinced him that therewas sincerity there.    He had also said that the United States weresincere in their search for peace and that, if there were any proof that the other side would keep their agreements, he thought that&quot;all of us would be quite content to do almost anything to advance that cause&quot;.The Prime Minister said that, While these-conversations with jthe iSrfiaidfiiitlfeaiJnssMteS fcbottiteepus^siHiity.&quot;oifaimeeting on a three-Power or four-Power basis, he had formed theimpression while in Washington that the President would not be sur-prised if he sought an opportunity for a bilateral meeting withM. Malenkov.    When he had previously suggested this in May, 1953,the President had deprecated such a &quot;solitary pilgrimate&quot;.    Butmuch had happened since then, and he believed that the president would not now seek to dissuade him from undertaking such a mission.On his journey home he had decided, after consultation with theForeign Secretary, to send a personal message to M. Molotov askinghow the Soviet Government would view the idea of a friendly meeting&quot;with no agenda and no object but to find a reasonable way of livingside by side in growing confidence, easement and prosperity&quot;.Such a meeting might be the prelude to a larger re-union, though hehad no warrant to say this beyond his own hopes.    The draft of his proposed message had been seen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who had suggested some valuable improvements;  and the messageThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........^.:..rfy^r...
had been despatched to Moscow on 4th July (Foreign Office telegram to Moscow No. 873).     On his return to London the previous evening he had received a friendly reply which included the statement that,in the view of the Soviet Government, such a personal contact might serve to pave the way for a broader meeting, if this were acceptedby all the parties interested in easing international tension andin strengthening peace.    Later in the evening he had discussed this exchange of messages with the Foreign Secretary8 the lord president, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the. Minister of housing.    With their agreement he had conveyed to president eisenhower the substance of his message to M. Molotov and the text of the latter&apos;s reply and had invited an expression of the presidents views (Foreign Office telegram to Washington No. 3209).M. Molotov&apos;s message had been delivered in person by the Soviet Ambassador in London.    The Prime minister had taken the opportunity of making it clear to the ambassador that his was a personal message on which the Cabinet had not yetbeen consulted, and also that it had been sent without specific prior consulation with President Eisenhower.It would be for the Cabinet to decide, whenPresident Eisenhower&apos;s views were known, what further message should be sent to M. Molotov.    If a definite proposal for a meeting were to be made, place and timing would be important.    The meetingcould hardly be held before the proceedings of the Geneva conference had been brought to a head, and this might mean that it could not.take place before the middle of August.    He would be reluctant togo to Moscow, and he hoped that the Russians might agree to cometo Stockholm or Vienna.    As regards a larger meeting, it was evident that the Americans would not assent to this unless theRussians gave some practical proof of their sincerity,,    It was hishope that they might be persuaded to indicate for this purpose a firmintention to conclude a peace treaty for Austria.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that theCabinet should now await the expression of the Presidents views.They should also take account of the probable reactions of this project upon public opinion in Europe.    Such a meeting was likely to arouse particular apprehensions in Western Germany.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he had had anopportunity for reflection since seeing these messages on theprevious evening.    He was glad that the Cabinet were not being askedto express a final opinion that day, for he would certainly wish to reserve his opinion until President Eisenhower&apos;s views were avail-able.      If the President were critical of this project, that wouldweigh heavily with him.     For in present circumstances He thoughtit more than ever important to avoid anything which might seriouslyimpair the partnership between this country and the United States.At the end of the discussion THE PRIMEMINISTER said that the texts of his exchange of messages withM. Molotov and of his message to President Eisenhower would be circulated to members of the Cabinet for their personal information.He would also arrange for his Private Secretary to make available
to any member o  the Cabinet who wished to see them the earliermessages which he had exchanged with President Eisenhower onthis subject in 1953.The Cabinet - ...(1)     Agreed to resume their discussion ofthis question as soon as the Prime minister had received a reply to his message to president Eisenhower.At the Prime Ministers requestLORD CHER WELL, gave the Cabinet a summary report of thediscussions which had been held in &quot;Washington and Ottawa on atomicquestions.The Americans had indicated their readiness toco-operate more fully with us in future over the whole field of atomic energy development.    For the moment this full co-operation was precluded by the terms of their legislation, but most of thesebarriers would be removed by the amending legislation which, it was hoped, would be passed before Congress rose for the summer recessMeanwhile, the Americans had undertaken to provide us with full information of the effects of their hydrogen bombs.    They were alsoready to give us details of the dimensions and characteristics oftheir bombs, so that RoA.Fn aircraft could be adapted to carry theUnited States type of bombi    They were anxious to collaborate with us in the interpretation of intelligence about atomic research and production in the Soviet Union.    To the extent that this involved-disclosure of their own atomic secrets, this had hitherto been pre-cluded by the, terms of their legislation;  but it was now hoped thatthere could be closer collaboration in this when the amending legislation had been passed.The Americans were anxious to proceed withtheir plan for an international pool of uranium for the developmentof the civil use of atomic energy, despite the refusal of the SovietGovernment to co-operate in this scheme.    In view of the extentto which the Americans were now prepared to assist us in thedevelopment of our atomic projects, it had been thought inexpedient to offer further opposition to the Atomic Bank Plan.    We had there-fore agreed that international discussions might go forward, but some time was likely to elapse before an effective international agreement was concluded.The Canadian Government had undertaken to explore the possibility of providing us with supplies of tritium,which would enable us to expedite the production of atomic weapons &apos;in this country.The Cabinet   -(2)      Took note of this statement byLord Cherwell.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.7th July, 1954.
