(52) 25thiff Conclusions,Mi Minute 2 andIP 57th Con-p elusions,If Minute 6)The Cabinet had before them memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 223) and the Minister of housing and Local Government (C.(52) 226) on the measures necessary to redress the adverse balance of payments.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at an informal meetingon 30th June the Chancellor of the Exchequer had discussed withsome of his colleagues a proposal to introduce a modifiedversion of the External Sterling Plan which the Cabinet had previously considered on 28th and 29th February.   The discussion at this informal meeting had made it clear that there was unlikely to be any large body of opinion in the Cabinet in favour of undertaking at the present time the hazardous operation of setting sterling free at a floating rate of exchange.   TheChancellor had therefore decided not to press this proposalupon the Cabinet at the present time.   Nevertheless, our external financial position was most precarious:   it had been estimated that, unless drastic measures were at once introduced,our reserves of gold and dollars would have fallen by another 175 millions by the end of 195?..   The Chancellor therefore proposed, in C. (52) 223, that with a view to balancing our overseas accounts we should modify the defence programme,transfer more of our capital investment to productive industry and make further cuts in imports;   and that all these measures shouldbe announced before Parliament rose for the summer recess.It was also proposed that, in working out the policy proposalswhich the United Kingdom Government would place before theCommonwealth Economic Conference in November, ministers should keep prominently in mind the need for some satisfactorymeans of working as rapidly as possible towards the convertibility of sterling.   A Cabinet Committee had beenappointed, under the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Chairmanship, to supervise the preparations for this Conference;   and theChancellor would doubtless discuss with that Committee how thequestion of convertibility could best be handled in relation to theConference.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hewart /as seriously concerned about the threat to sterling.   He hadreceived from the Bank of England a formal warning that if nochange were made in the existing system, under which the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area carried the whole strainof the adverse conditions which the sterling area countries were facing in their overseas accounts, there would be a grave risk to the currency and to the economy of the United Kingdomand the sterling area.    It was the considered view, not merely of the Governor but of the whole Court of the Bank of England,-1-
that changes should now be made in our external financialsystem which would have the effect of taking some of thisstrain off the reserves.   The Chancellor said that this view wasshared by other financial authorities whom he had consulted,including Sir Edward Peacock and Sir Richard Hopkins.   Afteranxious consideration he had himself accepted that view.   he took strong exception to the comments on the Bank ofEngland which were made in Part I of the memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C.(5Z) 226) and hethought it a.matter for regret that the Minister should have usedsuch language.The Chancellor said that he would himself have preferred to strengthen the currency by making at once the changes in our external financial system which had been recommended by the Bank of England;  but he had decided not to.urge this course against the judgment of his colleagues in theCabinet.   It was, however, his duty to warn them that the currency would be in jeopardy throughout the summer, andpossibly until the end of the year.   He would not be preparedto accept the responsibility for introducing a further forceddevaluation of sterling to a lower fixed rate of exchange.This made it all the more necessary that drastic action shouldbe taken, and announced, before the summer recess with a viewto bringing our overseas accounts more nearly into balance overthe second half of the year.Discussion then turned on the measures which should betaken to balance our overseas accounts.   The main points raised were as follows:-(a) In addition to other import cuts which had been underdiscussion, it was now hoped that imports of timber in the second half year could be reduced by 86,000 standards, which representedan expenditure of S.5j millions.   This would involve a reductionof timber stocks which would have to be made good in 1953,unless other decisions were taken which resulted in a reducedconsumption of timber.(b) THE LORD PRESIDENT expressed the view that thereshould be no further cuts in food imports which would involve any reduction in the level of food consumption in this country.There was some scope for economy by running down stocks;but any further worsening of the national diet would, in hisopinion, lead to loss of productive efficiency,(c) Care would have to be taken in framing the public announcement of these further measures to redress the balanceof payments.    If too much prominence were given to the proposedrestrictions on imports, the Government would be open to the criticism that they were pursuing a purely negative policy.    Itwas important that the statement should also have positive and constructive features.  -From that point of view it would be valuable if the public announcement of the plans for holding theCommonwealth Economic Conference in November could form part of the general statement on the economic situation to.bemade at the end of the month.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that positive measures forredressing the balance of payments would be the most effective method of maintaining confidence - action would be more effective than words.   During the course of the next two weeks the Cabinet must devote to the consideration of these measuressuch time as was necessary in order to enable a full statementof Government policy to be formulated for use in the debate on theeconomic situation which was to take place in the House ofCommons before the end of the month.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of the economicsituation at meetings to be held in the folio wing week.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1. ,11TH JULY, 1952.
