The greater part of thePresidenfs message was concerned with the situation in Indo-Chinaand the representation of China in the United Nations.    In his reply the Prime Minister proposed to press for a more definite expression of the Presidenfs views on some of the practical aspects of his proposal for a meeting with M. Malenkov.    He intended to make itclear that he would not accept an invitation to meet in Moscow andthat, although a meeting in Stockholm or Vienna would be acceptable,the best plan would be to meet at Berne after the Geneva Conference.He also proposed to make more plain his intention to ask the russians to give some definite proof of their sincerity, as a preliminary to a wider meeting - e.g. an undertaking to ratify the Austrian treaty and, perhaps, a promise to co-operate in the Atomic Bank Plan.He would urge the President to give him his views on these specific proposals before the Cabinet were asked to decide whether a formalproposal for a two-Power meeting should be submitted to the SovietGovernment.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he wished tomake it clear that he was opposed in principle to the idea of holding high-level meeting with the Russians without the participation ofthe United States.    He had explained this to the Prime Minister ina private letter which he had sent to him after his speech in theHouse of Commons on 11th May, 1953, and nothing which had sinceoccurred had changed his opinion on this point.     The projectedmeeting, if it took place, would be an important act of foreign policyjand, if he remained in the Government, it would fall to him, as leader of the House of Lords and spokesman for the Foreign office in that House, to defend it publicly.    This he would be unable to do.Therefore, as at present advised, he.feared that he would have to resign from the Government if it were in the event decided that thePrime Minister should go forward with this project for a bilateralmeeting with M. Malenkov.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in their further discussions on this question, the Cabinet would wish to keep in mind the view which the Lord President had expressed.    For the moment,-however, he preferred to await a further expression of president eisenhower&apos;s views;  and he was not proposmg to ask the Cabinet that day to take a final decision on the matter.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of..........9^.\..j^T..TOP SECRET Copy No...4fr...
Cabinet Office, S.W.1.10th July, 1954.In further discussion Ministers recognised thatthey could not take a final decision on the expediency of proposingsuch a meeting until they knew the outcome of the negotiations onIndo-China which were now to be resumed at the Geneva Conference.If those negotiations resulted in an agreement from which the UnitedStates Government expressly dissociated themselves, it was arguable that a bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and M. Malenkovwould at that moment give the impression that an even wider breachwas being created between the United Kingdom and the United States.On the other hand it was arguable that in those circumstances - and,perhaps even more, if no agreement of any kind were reached atGeneva - it would be re-assuring to public opinion throughout theworld that a further opportunity was being created for discussions with the Soviet Government which might yet avert the danger of world war.    In either event it seemed clear that a final decision must await the outcome of the resumed negotiations at Geneva.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that theForeign Secretary should take the opportunity, while at Geneva, tomake it clear to M. Molotov that this project could not proceed further until the outcome of the Geneva Conference was known.He might also put to him the advantages of Berne as a possiblemeeting-place.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that somethought should also be given to the questions which the Russians were likely to raise, if such a meeting were held.    How would they react,for example, to the suggestion that they should give an undertaking to ratify the Austrian Treaty?    Were they not likely to counter thisby pressing the suggestion for a European security guarantee whichthey had put forward at the Berlin Meeting - a suggestion which, as ministers would remember, was designed to prevent the establish-ment of a European Defence Community.    As an alternative to thecreation of that Community, they would probably suggest that a united Germany should be admitted to the North Atlantic treaty organisation, and that the Organisation should thereafter be widenedto include the Soviet Union.    As regards the project for a broadermeeting, we must be prepared for them to press the suggestion thatthis should be on a five-Power basis, including Communist China.The Foreign Secretary suggested that further thought should be givento all these questions while he was in Geneva.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion ofthese matters at a later meeting.
