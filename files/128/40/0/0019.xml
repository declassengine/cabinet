C.(54) 52ndConclusions)C.C.(54) 53rd Conclusions (/kt^\(26th July, 1954 - 11. 3 0 a. m. )THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since the Cabinet had last discussed on 23rd July his suggestion of a bi-lateral meeting with the Russians, the Soviet Government had publicly proposed anearly conference of all European Governments to consider theestablishment of a system of collective security in Europe.    Thiscreated a new situation, especially as it was clear from its terms that the Soviet Note had been drawn up after the end of the geneva conference.    It was evident that the primary purpose of the SovietGovernment, in making this public proposal at this time, was to influence the attitude of the French Parliament in their forthcoming discussion of the Treaty for the establishment of the european defence Community.     But he was satisfied that he could not proceedwith his proposal for a bi-lateral meeting with the Russians while this suggestion of a much larger meeting of Foreign Ministers wasbeing publicly canvassed.    He had therefore prepared a revised draft of his proposed message to M. Molotov indicating that thelarger meeting which the Soviet Government had now publicly -proposed did not seem to accord with the plan for an informal bi-lateral.meeting which he had previously had in mind, and asking whether this Soviet proposal was intended to supersede his plan.He proposed to include in this revised message a reference to theplace and time which he had been intending to propose for a bi-lateral meeting: this would have the advantage of making it clearthat he had not been prepared to attend a meeting in Moscow.    TheForeign Secretary had independently prepared an alternative draft,which was similar in substance though somewhat different inwording.     The Prime Minister read the two drafts to the Cabinet.He said that, if the Cabinet approved the substance of the proposedmessage, he could settle the wording in consultation with theForeign Secretary.In the course of a short discussion it was agreed that anew situation had been created by the publication of the Soviet note of 24th July.     Though it seemed unlikely that this Soviet proposal would be acceptable to the Governments of Western Europe, itsrecipients must be given time to consider it and the position must be reviewed again in the light of their response.     Meanwhile,
it - as desirable that M. Molotov should be given to understandthat the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal for a bi-lateral meeting wouldbe held in abeyance while the Soviet Note was under consideration.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would send a personal message to M. Molotov making it clearthat his proposal for a bi-lateral meeting withM. Malenkov must be regarded as held in abeyance pending the outcome of the soviet proposal of 24th July for a conference of all european Governments on the creation of asystem of collective security in Europe.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.26th July, 1954.
