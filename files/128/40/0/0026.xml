:0P SECRETMOST OOIIEIDEMIAL RECORDCABINETC.I.T. (56) 2gth Conclusions(27th March, 1956 - 12 noon)THE PRIME MINISTER said that H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh had now had a substantial experience in flying helicopters, and was assessedas a first class helicopter pilot.     He had expressed a wish to fly ahelicopter from the deck of an aircraft carrier.     There was no doubt ofhis competence to do this, nor was it regarded as a specially dangerousflight.    His instructors had, however, thought it right to refer thesuggestion to the Air Ministry, and the Secretary of State for Air had asked for the Cabinet&apos;s guidance on the point.Discussion showed that it was the-general view of the Cabinetthat, although any extension of the Duke of sairiburgh&apos; s flying activitiesincreased the risks which he was accepting, there were no sufficient ground^for objecting to this particular proposal,,   . The Prime Minister might takea suitable opportunity to ascertain whether The &quot;Queen herself was concerned at tho additional risk involved in a flight of this nature;   but, unlessHer Majesty felt anxiety about it, It would be preferable that no objectionshould be raised to it. . .The Cabinet - &apos;Agreed that, subject to this informal consulta-tIon with Her Majesty The Queen, no objectionneed be raised to the suggestion that.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh should fly a.   helicopter from the deck of an aircraft carrier.Cabinet Office, S.V.r,l.6th April, 1956.
