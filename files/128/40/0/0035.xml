CABINETMOST f^agm.^IAtJSSCOi^(11th March,        - 11.00 a.Eu)JICAL !SiE PBB3E MUSISSSH suggested feat fee Cabinet siiould review feemicmpolitical situation.    The Covernrent had done well to weather the politics!storms of the past year.    Bust they **- and fee country * were now confronted with&apos; a difficult and baffling situation.    He could not remember a time when a Government was faced with so many intractable problems iOn the home front fee Governments popularity was waning - as wasnatural after six years in office.   They i?ouLd have a difficult time in theforthcoming by-elections - not because of any revival of Liberalism, but because of the widespread feeling of frustration and indifference amongConservatives.    it was arguable feat fee Government should m to the countryand put their position to fee test.    The long-testa interests of feeConservative. Party would certainly cot bo served if the Government appearedto be clinging to office, without certainty of purpose, as BalfOur*sGovernment had done in fee dcya before fee great Liberal victory of 1^06.Some people were already saying feat it would be better for fee Governmentto resign now, before they lost further  round, so that, fecy might be in a stronger position to win the next Election but one after a farther periodOf Labour rule.The international scene was equally grim.    la feia country publicopinion in favour of a meeting of Heads Of Government Was gathering force.But fee diplomatic exchanges in preparation for it were not going forward as quickly or as constructively as feey might.    We could not alone secure featthe meeting took place - and our Allies were leas favourably disposed towardsit than we were.    In the Middle East fee situation was worsening.  King Send,on whom fee United States Government placed so much reliance, seemed likelyf      to prove a broken reed.    We ourselves ware cokjpqUgcI by circumstances
to lend our support to regimes which were obsolete, decadent and reactionary and, on the other side, the tide of nationalism was running fast. In Asia the situation in Indonesia was deteriorating.  Events there suggested that the United States had been mistaken in pressing the Dutch to withdraw too soon and too fast. In North Africa we faced a dilemma.  If we persuaded the French to withdraw prematurely, as the United States wished, Communism might gain a foothold there, as it had in Indonesia.  If, on the other hand, we encouraged the French to stay, they might well pursue reactionary policies which would provoke a violent reaction.  In Europe we had no certainty of being able to maintain our forces in Germany and, if we were obliged to withdraw them, the North Atlantic Alliance would crumble.  Finally, in our Colonial Empire, we faced intractable situations in Cyprus and in Malta.

The Government had two political alternatives - to persevere until the end of the present Parliament; or to seek a fresh mandate from the electorate, and risk political defeat. He himself favoured the first course. But, if the Government were to follow it, they must do so in the confidence that their policies would succeed and that some at least would bear fruit before the end of the present Parliament.  On the important issues they must show resolution and certainty of purpose. At the same time, however, they must be ready in other matters to avoid unnecessary unpopularity. They must make greater efforts to secure a wider measure of popular support.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had no doubt that the right course was for the Government to persevere under the Prime Minister&apos;s leadership. They were at present passing through a difficult transitional stage: they needed another year in order to get over the worst period of the Rent Act and the Agriculture Bills. Similarly, in economic affairs, they needed time in order that their policies might bear fruit. Concessions could then be made in the Budget of 1959. On defence policy and disarmament they must either succeed in obtaining some easing of international tension or, if that could not be secured, they must bring public opinion round to face, unitedly, the military risks.  For that again more time was needed.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed with this view. He believed that the Government&apos;s policies were sound, and time would prove this.  In economic affairs we now had a better chance than ever before to achieve a period of stability in wages and prices.  The Rent Act would, in time, be shown to


be a sound measure. In foreign affairs we needed time in which to wear down present hysterical mood of pacifism. Balfour&apos;s Government, to which the Prime Minister had referred, was divided on a great question of principle: but the Ministers who had resigned from the present Government had gone on matters of detail. On all questions of principle the Government were united. They were at one in their confidence in the policies which they were pursuing

THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, while agreeing with this, said that the Government must use all the techniques of publicity to convince the public that their policies were sound. He also made the point that, although the Government&apos;s popularity was waning, there was no evidence of any increasing desire for a Socialist Government - at recent by-elections the majority of votes had been cast in favour of anti-Socialist candidates. But the results of future by-elections were likely to be unfavourable and, as a result of the recession in the United States, the level of unemployment in this country might well rise in 1959. Therefore, if useful results flowed from the forthcoming Commonwealth Economic Conference or from a meeting of Heads of Government, he would not himself exclude the possibility of seeking a fresh mandate from the electorate before the end of the present Parliament. That being so, he was inclined to think that the Government should, from now on, lose no opportunity of increasing their popularity in the country.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that we were now on the verge of getting the national economy into a sounder state than it had been at any time since the end of the war. It would be wrong to throw that chance away by adopting "popular" policies too soon. The purchasing of consumers was still high; and, if existing policies were reversed too soon, a further inflation might easily be started. He was satisfied that the risks of relaxing too soon were much greater than those of relaxing a little too late. He agreed that the Government would be in political difficulties in the months ahead. Resentment at the result of the current review of farm prices would continue for some months. The Agriculture Bills, on the other hand, were likely to cause more difficulties in Parliament than in the country.


THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the Government would certainly be in rough water in the months ahead. Six months ago he had hoped that public opinion would by now have begun to swing in favour of the Government. It was now clear that there was no prospect of such a swing in 1958. Some argued that the position of the Conservative Party would be strengthened in the long-term if the Government went to the country without further delay. This, in his judgment, was a mistaken view. The international situation made it essential for the present Government to remain in office, even if this involved some risk to the long-term position of the Party. If an Election were held now, he believed that the Labour Party would win it, even though the majority of the total votes cast were anti-Socialist. Such a result would, in his opinion, be most damaging to the national interest - first, because of its effect on the international situation; and, secondly, because confidence in sterling would be so greatly shaken that the Labour Government would be obliged to introduce extreme measures of economic control. For these reasons he strongly supported the Prime Minister&apos;s view that the Government&apos;s duty was to continue in office until near the end of the present Parliament.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that the national economy was in a healthier state than was generally supposed. When the time came to relax restrictive policies, the right course would be to do so on a selective basis. It was worth considering whether it would not be advisable for the Government to announce in advance what specific relaxations would be made if a deflationary situation developed. These should, in the main, be measures directly related to local unemployment. Such an announcement would have a reassuring effect and would help to convince the public that the Government were in control of the situation. It might also be useful if the Government could take a new initiative towards the removal of strategic controls on trade with the Soviet bloc. An imaginary move in that direction might give a lead to public opinion throughout the Free World and might help to divert public attention from the controversy about nuclear weapons. Finally, he suggested that the Government should decide whether it was to


their advantage that an agreement on the establishment of a European Free Trade Area should be reached before the next Election. If the negotiations were to be brought to a conclusion before then, it might be necessary for us to find some means of resolving our political difficulties with the French (over North Africa) and the Germans (over support costs).

THE COLONIAL SECRETARY said that it would be highly undesirable for the Government to go to the country at the height of the controversy over agricultural policies and at a time when no solution of the Colonial problems in Cyprus and Malta was yet in sight. This, in his view, ruled out the possibility of an Election in 1958.

THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT agreed that the Government must continue in office until nearer the end of the Parliament. But, if they were to do so, they must make further efforts to unite their supporters, in Parliament and in the country. With this in view he had three suggestions to make. First, it would be useful if the Cabinet could hold further frank discussions of the political situation from time to time. Secondly, all Ministers in charge of Departments might be asked to consider whether there were any practical measures within their sphere of responsibility which might help to encourage and unite the Government&apos;s supporters. Thirdly, the Government should avoid being forced into a defensive position: their supporters would be greatly encouraged if they went over to the offensive and took a more aggressive political line.

THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE said that, as he saw it, there were only two possible solutions which would justify an early Election - (i) if the Government achieved some outstanding success in the international sphere; or (ii) if it became clear that there would be widespread unemployment in 1959. He was concerned at the wave of pacifist feeling which was sweeping over the country. He believed that this could only be checked by convincing the public that the Government were sincerely and purposefully seeking international agreement on disarmament. A conclusive reason for deferring an appeal to the electorate was the growing influence which the Prime Minister himself was exercising on public opinion. This was one of the Government&apos;s most valuable assets. Time was needed to allow it to develop to the full.


THE MINISTER OF POWER said that there were no signs of any increased desire for a Socialist regime. The Government could gain in strength if they took the offensive against Socialist policies.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND supported this suggestion. More speeches might also be made about the value of the Commonwealth, and the role of the United Kingdom in it. These could be founded on the success of the Prime Minister&apos;s Commonwealth tour, which had made a deep impression on public opinion.

THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION said that the Government&apos;s standing in the country was suffering at the moment as a result of an unusual aggregation of unpopular measures. Restrictive economic policies naturally had a depressing effect. On the other hand it was desirable that the Government should not go to the country until some time after the point at which relaxation became possible. The Government must have time to develop the theme of an expanding economy before the next Election. This was a strong argument for deferring the Election until nearer the end of the Parliament.

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR agreed that it was the Government&apos;s duty to continue in office . In international affairs the Prime Minister&apos;s special relationship with the leaders of the United States Administration was a most valuable asset, and it was important that he should be able to continue to use his personal influence at this critical time. On the home front, the position was not so bad as many people thought. Public opinion was still pre-occupied with the dangers of rising prices and disturbed industrial relations: but, in fact, prices were not now rising and industrial relations were better than they had been for some time past. The swing of opinion against the Government was not among people in the higher income groups: it was among the skilled workers and lower middle classes. It was these sections of opinion which had become discouraged, especially since the restrictive economic measures of September, 1957. It should not be forgotten that, to win an Election, the Conservative Party needed the support of about 3 million trade unionists and their families. Therefore, both in foreign and in economic affairs, the Government must seek to rebuild the sense of hope for the future, and of confidence in Conservative policies, which these people formerly had.


.SHB aUiHCBILOH OF TIE JJUCHJT 02 LAIKShSTSR Bade two points,   First,he -suggested that fee. real reason for fee swing of public opinion; againstthe Government was the general sense of fatigue end frustration which&apos; hadsteadily gained ground in the last eighteen months.   To counteract feat,some emotional success was needed.   The Prime  Jinister*s Coraaonwealfe tourhad already mads a contribution towards this.   Secondly^ it was importantfeat fee Government should&apos; show confidence in their own policies.    Sigaaof indecision or Wavering did much harm.    Ministers should show no hesitation in defending the Sent Act- and fee Government&apos;s defence policy,,, SUB MINISTBH OF mWLQEmm supported this View.   In all feecircumstances it was surprising that fee Socialists had not gained moreground in fee last year.   If the Government shaved firmness and resolution and confidence in.their.policies, feey could recover fee ground -whichthey had lost.THE SEEMS  SUEKiTSIl said that he Was grateful for the -support whichMa colleagues had given him in the course of this useful discussion.-He himself had no doubt that the Government wist Isold firmly to their purpose and policies, and he was glad to be assured feat this was feeunited view of the whole Cabinet.  He would, reflect on the suggestions which had been put forward in the course of fee discussion and would consider what practical steps could be taken to strengthen fee Government&apos;aauthority in fee months ahead.Cabinet Office^ S.W.I.13th March, 1958
