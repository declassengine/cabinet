HO CIRCULATION RECORDTOP secret cabinet(CC.(53) 50th Conclusions)Confidential Record of Cabinet discussion on 25th August, 1953.The Cabinet had before them an un-numbered memorandum by thePrime Minister covering a series of telegrams sent to theGerman Foreign Office in 19A0 from the German Embassies in Madridand Lisbon regarding the activities of H.R.H. the Duke of Windsorin Spain and Portugal in that 3^ear.    These revealed that theGermans were at that time anxious to keep the Duke in Europe witha view to their making use of his services in securing peace between germany and this country and that they would have been prepared,in return, to assist him to regain the Throne.    These documents hadbeen found in the archives of the German Foreign Office which came into the hands of the United States Army at the end. of the war.General Eisenhov;er had then handed them over to the United StatesBBSIG8 PalAmbassador in London, v7ho in turn had o-sssed them to the ForeignPOffice.   It now appeared, however, that a microfilm copy of thedocumentshad been made before the originals were handed over to theBritish, authorities and that this had nassed into the. control,of the t^an of British, French and American historians The had &quot;ce.enmade responsible for the publication of the captured Germandocuments.    Under on agreement made between the three Governments InJune, 1946, these historians were all or/ed complete freedom to select&quot;on the basis of the highest scholarly objectivity&quot; which of thecaptured documents should be published;    and they proposed that this correspondence about the Duke of Windsor should be included in volume X of the series of captured German documents which was to bepublished in 1954 under the official auspices of the British, Frenchand United States Governments.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was nol, nersuaded that there
was any historical need to&quot;publish this correspondence, at any rateduring the lifetime of the Duke of Windsor.    Its publication would certainly be damaging to .the Duke and would cause himunnecessary distress.    He had therefore written personally to President Eisenhower&apos;and M. Bidault asking.if they would join with him in prohibiting official publication of the correspondence.President Eisenhower had promised full co-operation and the chiefAmerican historian had been instructed that, If his British colleagtasked that these documents should, after all, be omitted from theforthcoming volume, he should acquiesce.   On the other hand, it wasnot known whether the British historian, Miss Lambert, would beprepared to make such a request:    indeed it had been suggestedthat, if this attempt v/ere made to limit her discretion, she might feel obliged to resign her position.    No reply had beenreceived from M. Bidault.    And the United States had warned us that the existence of the documents was widely known both inthe United States and in this country;    that copies of theactual documents might even be in private hands;    and that intervention to prevent the Inclusion of these documents in theofficial publication might provoke unofficial publication, atleast of the substance of the documents and possibly of theactual /texts.   The Prime Minister said that It had been represented to him that, if this story was likely to be published in any event, it would be even more embarrassing if it couldbe said that the United Kingdom Government had attempted toprevent its publication.    While he saw the force of this argument,he still considered that a determined attempt should be made toprevent the official publication of these documents.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the arguments for and against Intervening to prevent official publication werenicely balanced.   When he had first heard of this matter he had thought that every effort should be made to avoid officialpublicntion.    But now thnt ho had read the documents he was not sure that their publication would be so damaging to the Duke
of Windsor:    they did little more than show that he had beenuflattered by evil counsellors into thinking that he might be ableto be of assistance in securing a negotiated peace.    He also attached importance to the warning that if official publicationwere prevented, the story might be disclosed from unofficialsources - with the added interest which it would gain from thefact that official publication had been prevented.&apos;  The Lord President said that he had seen the Britishhistorian, Miss Lambert, and he believed that she might be moremHpaccommodating than had been suggested earlier in the discussion.Certainly she would not welcome an attempt by one of thethree Governments to limit the discretion which they had previouslyaccorded to the historians to decide on objective historical grounds    piIwhich documents should be oublished.    But she had herself made theillmsuggestion that publication of this correspondence might be delayedif the documents of the Weimar Reoublic were oublished in advance of    HiIthe volume at present planned for publication in 195-4-    If it SImwere decided that the Weimar papers should be published first, this might postpone the issue now unde^ discussion for as long asfive years.In further discussion there was general support for the viewthat a determined effort should be made to prevent official. publication of these do curoents during the lifetime of the Duke of Windsor.    It was further agreed that, if publication could not be1prevented, some official statement&apos; should be issued simultaneously with a view to reducing the damage which these messages might causepIf released alone.    This might include a report by the Minister ofLabour on the mission to Portugal which he had undertaken in 1940at the Prime Minister&apos;s request with a view to ensuring that the Dukeand Duchess of Windsor left Europe without delay for the Bahamas.B1THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he would wish to prepare such a reportfand leave it on record for the future even if the documents were notto be published shortly;    for there was much -which he could say,
from the personal contacts which he had established at the time with the persons principally concerned, which would put intoproper perspective the reports which the German agentshad written for their employers.The Cabinet -(l)   Agreed that it was very desirable that these documentsregarding the approaches which German agents had made tothe Duke of Windsor in 1940 in Spain and Portugal shouldnot be published during the Duke&apos;s lifetime.(2)    Invited the Prime Minister and the Lord President toarrange for a further approach to be made to theBritish editor, Miss Lambert, with a view to delaying the publication of these documents in the series ofcaptured German documents which was being publishedunder the official auspices of the British, French and united States Governments.(3)   Took note that the Minister of Labour v/ould prepare,for publication simultaneously with the publication ofthese documents, a report on his mission to Portugalin 194-0.(A)    Agreed that, if official publication could not be prevented, the   Duke of Windsor should be shown inadvance the documents which were to be published.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.28th. August, 1953.
