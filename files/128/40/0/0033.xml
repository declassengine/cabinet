C.C.(57) 65th Conclusion

(10th September, 1957 - 11.00 a.m.)

Syria (Previous Reference C.C. (57) 64th Conclusions, Minute 1)

The Cabinet had before them telegrams No. 1745 of 7th September, 1756 of 8th September and 1764 to 1769 of 9th September from Washington together with Foreign Office telegrams No. 3546 and 3547 of 9th September to Washington.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the United States Government had now elaborated their Middle East policy in the form of the memorandum contained in Washington telegram No. 1745. If they could be assured of our support for this policy, they proposed to instruct their representatives in Turkey, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon and Jordan to communicate orally to the Governments of those countries the action which the United States would be prepared to take in certain eventualities. Their proposals envisaged financial and military assistance for these States in the event of either overt or subversive action by Syria designed to destroy their independence, together with an undertaking to meet any request for the use of United States armed forces in the event of intervention by the Sino-Soviet bloc, either directly or through the organisation of "volunteers".

In consulting us about these proposals the United States Government had shown an encouraging desire to re-establish the close Anglo-American co-operation which had existed during the war. It was clearly in our interests to encourage this tendency. As a result of the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion the United States Secretary of State had been informed that we were in principle in agreement with the general policy which the United States intended to adopt. It was now necessary to consider the terms in which the United States proposed that this policy should be communicated to the Governments of the


Middle East States concerned, particularly in those cases in which they intended to say that we had been consulted and were in complete agreement with their proposals.

The extent to which it would be necessary for the United Kingdom to be actively associated with the implementation of these proposals would be a matter for subsequent discussion with the United States Government. They had agreed that their memorandum should be regarded merely as a working paper and had at no time enquired what action we should be prepared to take ourselves in the event of hostilities breaking out in the Middle East. We should undoubtedly be asked, however, by the Middle East Governments concerned, particularly Turkey and Iraq, how far we were prepared to give active support to the United States policy and what form this support might take.

The three main issues on which the Cabinet should reach clear decisions were, therefore, whether we should support the United States proposals as elaborated in their recent memorandum; whether we endorsed the terms in which these proposals were to be communicated to the Middle East Governments concerned; and to what extent we should commit ourselves to participate in implementing them.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the main choice lay between attempting to contain the situation in Syria or retrieving it by more direct action. An effective policy of containment would be difficult in view of the weakness of the neighbouring States which would be primarily responsible for carrying it out. The right course, therefore, would be to support the United States preferences for direct action. It was encouraging that the United States were prepared to interpret the definition of aggression under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter as including acts of subversion by Syria and the employment of Sino-Soviet "volunteers" in any hostilities which might develop. In the proposed communication to the Turkish Government, however, the United States undertook to support Turkey if the latter felt compelled


to react to armed provocations which implied a serious throat to hercsainational integrity ana independence, This offer saa&amp;e the effectivedecision largely e - if not wholly, dependent on en act of ^udgmsnt &quot;bythe Turkish Government themselvess.  They would certainly wish to knowusnether we ware prepared to give a cemjparable undertakings2n discussion the following points were made?-(a) She United States instructions to their representatives inthe Middle East countries concerned contemplated that only in the caseof Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon would it be explicitly stated that theUnited States had consulted the United Kingdom and that we were incomplete agreement with their policy,    here were certain advantages in not disclosing too widely the extent to which we were acting infull collaboration with the United States Government in this mattersIt would be open to us to take separate action in Jordan and laraelto indicate our general support of the United States proposals withoutrevealing the extent of our earlier consultation with the United States(b) She United States memorandum of policy (Washington telegramNo. 1745) indicated that, if any of Syria&apos;3 Arab neighbours, responding to provocation;, took action under Article 51 of the Charter of feeUnited Nations, the United States would, upon request and pursuant tothe Middle East Eesolwtlon approved by Congress, extend to such countries eeenomiQ and military assistances  It was arguable that thisconceded the initiative too far to countries which conoid notnecessarily be trusted to act with a due sense of responsibility sadthat it would&apos; be desirable that the decision on fee cclrcamstaness whichwould $ratify the provision of such assistance should be reserved morestrictly to the United States end ourselves.  On the other hand, theterms of the United States draft ccsajunicat&amp;on to fee Governmentscancerned indicated that the United States intended in the event oflocal hostilities between Sysia and one or more of fee neighbouringStates, to confine their assistance to military supplies and that feeis?

In these circucnatances the UnitedStates statement of intention could probably be aoceptecU . But, althcthe initial Intervention of the United States might be confined tothe supply of &amp;rms9 it would be impossible for than, once they were engaged to this extent, to allow the countries at war with Syria toba defeated^ even if this required the active participation of Unite?States force so  Although the United States Goveraaftsnt did not belief that the Soviet Union would deliberately seek to ecsnand a Middle Bas1conflict into a global wary a progressive extension of the area ofhostilities was a risk which its must take into account in formulatingour own policy.(c)     It was essential that the position of the United Kingdomsad the United States should, from the outset, be clearly stated interms of international law*  We should jointly maintain, that a State -was not necessarily precluded from taking action to defend itself untits enemy had openly -resorted to the use of fcree9   Aggression couldrightly be interpreted as including a clear intention on the part ofthe enemy to take iasoinent aggressive action.   It could also be interpreted as including internal subversion no less than external attack.She proposed United States undertaking to  Suzkey to provide assistantif ihQ Turkish Government felt compelled to react to armed provocatloishould, therefore $ be construed as requiring the Turkish Gowmaontto satisfy the United States and ourselves that they were genuinelythe victims of. provocations   and to this extent the terms in whichthe United States proposed to communicate their intentions to theTurkish Government would not give the latter an unfettered discretion to invoke United States assistance.-EQP SEGKEJ
TOP SEGEE2(d) The ultimate consequences of the United  States policy wereunpredictable.   It was perhaps unlikely that any of the neighbouringStates would regard the United States proposals as on open invitation to embark on hostilities with Syria.   Those proposals&apos; might, indeed,.result in little more than a containment of Syria.  On the other hand,in the event of hostilities breaking out, the Soviet Union sight reasthy direct intervention and open warfare between the United States andthe Soviet TMon ExLght results   It could not he assumed that in this event the United Kingdom, if unreservedly associated with the UnitedStates, would have the unanimous support of the CcnmoniBealth or thatthe Soviet Union would refrain from attacking this country.   For these reasons it would he desirable that our support for the United states should, as far as possible, bo described to the countries concerned interms of our intention to fulfil cur obligations under the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and the Bagdad Pacto  It would,however, be important tliat we should not appear to be half-hearted inour endorsement of the United States pdicyj   and H.M. representatives in the countries concerned should make it clear that that policy hadour full support, although wa should need to take political considera-tions into account in deciding the form vhich that support might takeat any particular ^xaicturee(e) The public presentation of our ease would need carefulconsideration in due course * The draft of a suitable public statement should be prepared and agreed with the United States Govemmento  Thiswould afford a convenient opportunity for emphasising the extent tovshich our endorsefaent of action by the United States would be inconformity with our obligations under H.A.T.O. and the Bagdad Pact.- (f )    - .The reaction of the Soviet Union to the United states policy might take the form of fomenting disturbanoes in areas other than theMiddle East,,  An assessment should be made of the possibilities ofsuoh action..TOP SEOEHC
