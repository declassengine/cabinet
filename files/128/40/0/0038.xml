TOP secret no CIRCULATION RECORDCO. (60) 11TH CONCLUSIONS(22nd February, i960 - 12 noon)THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet thatPrincess Margaret desired to marry Mr. Anthony Armstrong-Jones,and that The Queen proposed to give hex- consent to the marriageunder the Royal Marriages Act, 1772.The Cabinet expressed their pleasure at the news thatPrincess Margaret intended to marry.    There was general satisfaction that The Queen proposed to give her consent to this marriage.Discussion then turned on the question whether it wasnecessary that, in giving her consent to the marriage, The Queenshould act on the advice of Ministers.   The Royal Marriages Act,1772, was an obscure and unsatisfactory statute.   It was by nomeans clear whether the Sovereign&apos;s action under it should be taken on the advice of Ministers.   Consent to the marriages of personscovered by the Act but remote from succession to the Throne hadoften been given without Ministerial advice;    and it had sometimesbeen argued that the question whether Ministerial advice was required turned on the nearness of the person concerned to the succession.    On the other hand, it was the fact that assent to the marriage of the present Queen had been given without Ministerialadvice, .though she was at the time the Heir Apparent.   The cabinet had been informed in advance, but no formal advice had been tenderedby Ministers.The precedents therefore suggested that, while the Sovereignwas -under no obligation to seek Ministerial advice beforeconsenting to the marriage of a member of the Royal Family, theCabinet would normally be informed in advance of the proposed marriajof a person close in succession to the Throne.   This, moreover,was something more than a courtesy;   for Ministers had a duty
9Sto safeguard the succession to the Throne and to protect the sovereign from unfavourable comment, and it was right that theyshould have an opportunity to consider whether it was their duty to tender negative advice in such a matter.   On the whole it seemed likely that the proper view of the constitutional position under theAct of 1772 was that the Sovereign could act under it withoutMinisterial advice but that Ministers could expect to be given anopportunity to tender negative advice, if ever the occasion aroseto do so, on a proposed marriage by a person close in the succession to the Throne.The Cabinet recognised that these considerations would affect the form of the submission which the Prime Minister shouldmake on this occasion to The Queen.   It would be inexpedient thatthis should be so phrased as to appear to constitute a precedent for tendering formal affirmative advice under this Act.   On theother hand, it seemed desirable that it should not appear to exclude the possibility that Ministers might tender negative advice on some future occasion.   Ministers had a duty to protect the sovereign, and they should preserve-their right to do so ifoccasion should ever arise.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in all the circumstances he would propose to inform The Queen, in writing, that he hadacquainted the Cabinet of the proposed marriage and of Her Majesty&apos;intention to give consent under the Act of 1772 *   He would, then goon to advise that The Queen should be pleased to cause her consent to be signified under the Great Seal and to be declared in Councilin accordance with the Act.   Finally, he would say that arrangements&apos;would be made, subject to The Queen1s approval, for the necessary steps to be taken in due course.
The Cabinet agreed that a submission on these lines would reflect their view of the constitutional position.The Cabinet -(l)   Expressed their pleasure at the forthcomingmarriage of H.R.H. Princess Margaret.(2)    Took note of the terms of the submissionwhich the Prime Minister proposed to make to The Queen about the formalities underthe Royal Marriages Act, 1772.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.11th March, i960^/&quot;Circulated to The Queen and Prime Minister orilyJJ
