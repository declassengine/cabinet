ECK52HO-CIRCULATION KECORD  .    g.teC*C.(52) 23rd.- 24th&quot;-and 25th Conclusions(23rd and 29th February, 19321&apos;At three meetings on 28th and 29th february the Cabinet discussed proposals by the Chancellor of theExchequer for arresting the drain on the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area.   For the purpose of these discussions they had before them a draft memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer outlining his plan and summarising its-main advantages and disadvantages, a -memorandum by the Paymaster General developing his objectionsto this plan, and a second memorandum by the Chancelloroutlining the alternative courses which would have tobe followed if his original plan were not adopted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his first memorandumsaid that there were still no signs of any slackening in the rate at which the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling&quot;-area were,being depleted.    In the past eight weeks the reserves had dropped by $521 millions, and had now fallen to a figure of$1,800 millions, which represented only three and a half weeks&apos;turnover of the sterling area&apos;s transactions with the rest ofthe world.    The rate of loss should fall in the next fewmonths, as the various measures taken to arrest it camefully into operation;    and, if every element in the planapproved by the Commonwealth Finance Ministers at their meeting in January worked favourably, the drain on the reserves might be checked in respect of the second half of1952.    It was, however, by no means clear that we couldscrape through until then;    and, even If we did, theremainingre3erves would by then be so inadequate that the sterling area would collapse at the first adverse turn of.events.   In these circumstances he considered that drastic action should be taken now to protect the currency.    after considering various alternatives he recommended the adoptionof a five-point plan, as follows:-(i)    TThile preserving the nominal official parity of$2.80 to the   sterling, 7/e should abandon theexisting margin (^2.73 - $2.32) and use theExchange Equalisation Account to secure themaximum stability in the international value of sterling.   This would mean that we shouldpublicly accept the principle of a variablerate of exchange.    Privately, we should resolveto use the sterling area reserves for the purposeof keepinr the rate initially within limits ofabout fifteen per cent on either side of the officialparity of $2.80, i.e. within a range of $2.AO - $3.20.Commonwealth Governments and Banks could be Informedprivately that this was our objective,  but our intention would not be made public or communicatedto any other Government or monetary authority within or without the sterling area.(ii)    All foreigners&apos;  sterling balances would beblocked, except for American and Canadian accountsalready convertible into dollars.    Ten percent ofthese balances would be classified as &quot;external&quot;sterling which, together with any sterlingearned subsequently, would be convertible into gold,dollars, or other currencies at the current rate.
(ill) The present structure of the sterling area wouldbe maintained.   The, United Kingdom and other sterling area countries would retain full exchange control, and citizens who were allowed to acquireforeign exchange would buy it in the market.(iv) Not less than eighty per cent of the sterling balances held by other sterling area countries wouldbe held in funded form, so that they could not beused for current transactions..(v) The London gold market would be re-opened so as toprovide a free market against external sterling.The price of gold would not be related to theofficial dollar price, but would fluctuate freely.Residents of sterling area countries, except goldproducers, would not be allowed to operate in thegold market.The following advantages were claimed for this plan.   the drain on the gold and dollar reserves would cease automatically:we should lose gold and dollars only to the extent that weintervened in the market to prevent the exchange rate from falling too far.    &quot;Cheap sterling&quot; operations would be virtuallyeliminated.   Payment for our exports to countries outside the sterling area would be made only in external sterling, gold or foreign exchange which could be sold in the London market.   the strain of the balance of payments deficit would fall, not on the reserves, but on the exchange rate.    It was true that depreciation of the rate would have an immediate and direct effect on theinternal economy, in the form of rising prices of food and rawmaterials;    but this process would itself bring into play forces which in the Ion.: run would tend to brin;- the economy into    ^balance.    For rising inrort prices would raduce the consumptionof imports,    and a fall in the exchange rate would increase the competitive power of our exports and encourage industry to concentrate on the manufacture of exports.    At the recent meetingof commonwealth finance Ministers it had clearly emerged thatsterling could not survive on an inconvertible basis, and this plan would be regarded as a major step on the road to convertibilitThe funding of sterling balances, though it might initially bea shock for the holders, would remove the greatest potential danger to the sterling area reserves and would strengthenconfidence in sterling.    After the initial ministers had been takenit would be easier to strengthen the reserves by borrord-ng, andthe Chancellor proposed to seek loans from Canada, from theInternational Monetary Fund and by pledging the dollar securitiesheld by the United Kingdom Government in the New York market.On the other hand, the plan would mean a large new departurein policy and would involve serious risks.    It would   meanabrogating our monetary and payments agreements with non-sterling countries.    It would be a shock to the Commonwealth members of the sterling area, and might bring one or two of them to the pointof deciding to leave the sterling area altogether.    It woulddisrupt the European Payments Union, and would therefore be viewed with&apos; mixed feelings by the United States Government.Finally, so far as concerned the internal economy of the UnitedKingdom, it would mean abandoning the principle of stability in internal prices and -/rages;    there would in the initial stagesbe seme rise In the cost of living and some measure of
unemployment;   and there would &quot;be a continuous process of change.. and re-adjustment, much of which would be painful.    Nevertheless,/the plan offered an opportunity for the United Kingdom Governmentto take a constructive and powerful initiative in the world,econony; \ and all the . indications, were that, if this opportunity$ijipJMci-r/r i: was - not taken in the near future, we should be forced at a later$&amp;f^&amp;fW::&apos; stage, when the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area had3p!o;-%vv --&quot;fallen to a much lower level, to take action which had all the unfavourable features of the plan now proposed without any of itsfavourable possibilities.    The Chancellor therefore recommended&quot;;    that action an these lines should be taken as quickly as possible. and announced at the same time as the Budget.The Paymaster-General in his memorandum argued thatthere were no sufficient grounds for the violent reversal ofpolicy proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    TheGovernment had always been given to understand that the drainen the reserves would continue during the early months of.1952.The remedial measures which they had taken in November had!     never been expected to produce their effect until the end ofFebruary;    and the Commonwealth Finance Ministers hadnot yet had time to arrange for their Governments to put into operation the further measures upon which they had agreed at their meeting in January.    The only new facts were the failure of the UnitedStates Government to provide us with the J^JOO millions of aidon which we had been relying and the doubt whether the european payments Union, would be able to honour its obligations if weachieved a credit balance.    Fundamentally our difficulties were due to failure to balance our trade.    The Chancellor&apos;s proposals were not addressed to that problem.    They would not make it easier for us to achieve a trade balance:    indeed,  the variablerate of exchange would have the opposite effect.    If the ratefell by 20-0,  ve should have to export 2$?  more in order to pay for the same quantity of imports.    And the fact that our export prices would   be more competitive would nob help us if,  as was largely the case,  the volume of our export trade was limited by difficulties of supply rather than of price.    So far as concerned our internal economy there were grave political objections to the Chancellor&apos;s plan.    If it helped to improve the balance of our trade accounts, it would do so only by increasing the prices of imported food and materials to an extent which compelled people to restrict their consumption.    This methodof rationing imports by the purse would be difficult to defend,and in any event would not produce results in,time to solve ourproblem.    Rather than run the risks involved in the Chancellor *splan,  the Paymasber-General suggested that the immediate crisisshould be met by still further reduction in imports, by a further expansion of exports, by borrowings from the United States andthe International Monetary Fund, by Budgetary.action to prevent afurther fall in confidence in sterling,and,  above all, by strong pressure on other sterling area countries to reduce their importsfrom hard-currency sources.Discussion showed that opinion within the Cabinet wasrJ^&apos;V divided, on the. expediency of proceeding at once with - the planproposed by the Chancellor of the-Exchequer.The following is a summary of the main arguments advanced in support of the Chancellor&apos;3 proposals:-(a)      It was not claimed for this plan that it wouldill itself redress the trade balance of the sterling area.    It was1 essentially a plan to protect sterling.    The Chancellor &apos;3ipV/&apos;.&apos;--, financial advisers believed that there was bound to be an exchangett%j:.:;.;-\&apos;-        crisis before mid-summer, and they thought that this was likely $;V.-V&apos;       to develop shortly after the publication of the figures showing(it:-:.^-r-;.;     -   the state of the reserves at the end of the first quarter.    Itwas for this reason that the Chancellor v/ished to introduce hisplan at the time       the Budget.    A further reason for this wasIV. -j   &apos;
that, to gain full effect, measures for&apos;remedying&apos;, the economicsituation.should be announced,simultaneously,so that they couldbe seen as part of a comprehensive policy.    The Government had    &apos;already been placed at a disadvantage through.having to announce       &apos;their economic proposals piecemeal;   and the Chancellor had       -.   ://&apos;..indicated that the final instalment of these measures would be     , ,.&apos;announced at the time of the Budget.(b) The arguments advanced by the Paymaster-G-eneral againsta variable rate of exchange seemed to be based on the assumptionthat our trade would not&apos; be balanced.    But his arguments in favourof maintaining the present fixed rate of exchange seemed to bebased on the assumption that our trade would be balanced in thesecond half of 1952.    He assumed that, with a variable rate ofexchange, we might expend our reserves in seeking to prevent therate from falling below $2.40.    But if, in fact, our tradingbalance improved in the second half of the   year, the rate would automatically rise well above $2,40.(c) It was admitted that the adoption of the Chancellors&apos; plan would involve a risk of high prices and unemployment inthis country.    But,  if the drain on our reserves continued to&apos;the point at which we could no longer control the situation, theconsequences for our internal economy would be even more serious.If we could   no longer pay for our imports,  acute shortages and widespread unemployment would be inevitable;    and the wholeeconomy would then be threatened with immediate collapse.(d) A moderate rise in the price of imports would have a salutary effect in bringing home to the people of this country the reality of the economic situation in which they were living.Under the planned economy the Government themselves assumed responsibility far varying the pattern of consumption by makingadjustments in iim. ;rt programmes.    There was something to besaid, politically,  for moving towards the system by whichindividuals were influenced, by the operation of the pricemechanism, to make their own adjustments to changing economic circumstances.    This latter system had the further advantage thatit enabled people to adjust themselves more gradually to changing circumstances and avoided the violent upheavals which seemedinseparable from Government planning.(e) Sterling was at present over-valued, with the resultthat no-one would hold sterling if he could avoid doing so.In these circumstances the large sums at call in the sterling balances were a grave threat to the stability of the currency.It was very difficult to maintain stability with these vastliabilities overhanging the market.(f) It was unreasonable that the people of this country should be asked to accept increased hardships and sacrifices,in order to redress the United Kinrdom balance of payments, if   -all their efforts could be frustrated by unrestricted drawingson the sterling balances held by countries like Australia whose-inroads on the reserves were not regulated by. any formal agreement.There was a 3trong case for restricting Australia &apos;s right to drawdown the central reserves of the sterling area.(g) The Paymaster-General suggested in his memorandum thatour financial position was too weak to -/arrant our taking the risks which the Chancellor &apos;s plan entailed.    If it were in fact soweak, and the Chancellor&apos;s plan were not adopted, it would not belong before the reserves of the sterling area were wholly exhaustedand we should then face imminent econo)nic collapse without any policy for dealing with that situation.
&apos;.     On the other side, the following considerations wereurged against the. adoption of:the Chancellor&apos;s plan:-(h) Though it was - certain,that it would involve very graverisks, there vas no certainty that it would succeed,    The rateof exchange, once freed, would he bound initially to fall-sharply;and,  if the Exchange Equalisation Fund -were used for the purposeof holding it at $2.40,* a substantial- portion of the remainingreserves might be expended in this.operation.    Some - Ministers  -feared that the reserves might be depleted more rapidly in thisway than by continuing to use them to meet the deficit in.thebalance of payments.(i) It would be a serious blow to other commonwealth governments if this plan were announced so soon after the Meetingof Commonwealth Finance Ministers in January, when it had been-agreed to make a very different approach to these.problems.    Theywould naturally expect that, if action on these lines had been,in contemplation, it would have been mentioned at that Meeting.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said&quot; that he had in fact given an indication, at the end of the Meeting, that the measures thendiscussed might not be sufficient and that, if the situationcontinued to deteriorate, much more drastic action might have tobe taken before the end of the year.    Since then,  in a telegram   -to Commonwealth Finance Ministers which he had circulated-tothe Cabinet on 11th February (C. (52)  33) , he had drawn attentionto the increasing gravity of the situation. -   -(j)      The European Payments Union was unlikely to remaineffective for very long, but the adoption of this plan would dealit an immediate death-blow.    This would accord ill with the * .Government &apos;s efforts to make plain their sympathy with themovement towards European unity.    It might even be regarded asinimical to the el forts of the North Atlantic Council toestablish a sound economic foundation on which to build up the defensive strength of Western Europe,    This aspect of the policywouldvcertainly be distasteful to the United States Government.(k)      This plan would do little to ease our fundamentalproblem of balancing the trade of the sterling area.    It might,however, suggest that the Government were prepared to see this problem solved by the expedients cf the nineteen-thirties.    reliance on monetary measures would be thought to point to large-scaleunemployment;    and the Government would be exposed to all thewell-worn criticisms directed on that account against theConservative Party.(l)      Those of the economists in. Government service who hadbeen consulted about the plan vrere opuosed to   it.(m)      The adoption of the plan would have the immediate result of producing a general restriction of world trade.    Manyof the countries which now bought exports from us because theycould pay for them in a soft currency would be unwilling to go onbuying if sterling became a hard currency.    Many of those who now spent sterling in order to save dollars would turn to dollar sources of supply.    The deficit in&apos; our dollar balance  of payments would thus be increased;    the exchange rate would fall:    and this in turn would mean higher prices and more unemployment in thiscountry.(n)      The compulsory funding of sterling balances held by commonwealth and foreign countries might be construed as amountingto a banker&apos;s default and -would impair our international credit.(o)      The adoption of the plan would give rise to very great political difficulty.    public opinion in this country was whollyunprepared for such measures.    The sudden reversal of the economic
policies which had been pursued for the last twelve years, andin particular the abandonment of the objective of seeking stability in internal prices and wages, would come as a severe shock to public opinion.    Under democratic government with universalsuffrage such violent reversals of policy were hardly practicable.Even if the c^aa for this ohange were abundantly olear on the merits, there would be very great difficulty in persuading thepublic to.accept it.    Moreover,  the adoption of this policy would create an unbridgeable, gap between the Government and the/Opposition;    and, if it were thought possible that an even moregrave economic crisis might develop later in the year,  it wouldbe unjustifiable to take at this stage a step which might excludeall possibility of forming a National Government to handle that situation.Special attention was given, in the discussion, tothe effect which the proposed policy might have on theGovernments of the other members of the Commonwealth..   THECOMMCNWEALTH SECRETARY said that the proposal to freeze 80^ oftheir sterling balances vould come as a great shock to these governments, particularly as no indication of this possibilityhad been given at the recent Meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers.    If, however, due notice was given it was unlikelythat it would cause any great political upheaval in theCommonwealth.    For Pakistan and Ceylon it might well prove to be the turning-point at which they.decided to leave the sterling area, though there would be no question of theirleaving the Conunbnwealth on this account.    Australia v/ould behard hit by it, but her Government must realise that she was over-spending and could not expect to go on doing so.    It wasconceivable,  though unlikely, that she might seek independence of the sterling area.    New Zealand would accept the decision ofthe United Kingdt .i Government.    South Africa would not object:she would welcome the re-opening of the London gold market.India, if the proposals were carefully presented.to her, mightwell accept them if she could be assured that they would not prevent her from obtaining sufficient capital for the development plan to which she was committed.    Canada, though not a member ofthe sterling area, would welcome the plan.On the other hand.it was pointed out. that under theChancellor&apos;s plan the Commonwealth members of the sterling area would be left free to spend at will some 20;  of their sterling balances and. that some of. them would not therefore be under anygreater restraint than that already imposed by the existing agreements limiting their drawing rights on those balances.From this point of view the most significant gain v/ould be the restraint to be imposed by this plan on Australia &apos;s use of hersterling balances;    for her drawing rights were not at presentthe subject of any agreement and her overseas expenditureconstituted the greatest current threat to the stability of the sterling area.Towards the end of the discussion it became clearthat many members of the Cabinet entertained serious doubts aboutthe expediency of proceeding at once with so violent a change ofpolicy as that proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    Atan earlier stage in the discussion it had been suggested that theChancellor&apos;s plan might be carried out in two stages - first aevere Budget,  including a sharp increase in the Bank rate&apos;andorastic reductions in the defence and housing programmes;    and,secondly, at the end of March,  a further conference of Common-wealth Finance Ministers to produce an agreed plan for dealing withthe problems of the sterling balances, the variable rate of exchangand trade agreements between the sterling area countries the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER regarded &quot;this particular&quot;compromiseas impracticable,    He did not think it would be possible to&apos;
reach agreement, in a Commonwealth conference, on so Draconiana plan as this.    Any drastic action to save the currency would have   -to he devised in secret;    and, although every effort should he made-to carry other Commonwealth countries with as, the paramount needfor secrecy would make it impossible to give them more than afew days in which to consider such a plan.    A financial operationof this kind necessarily involved national credit and confidence in the financial position of the United Kingdom as the banker forthe sterling area;   and it would become impossible to carry out-such an operation&apos; if confidence were weakened in advance as aresult of lengthy discussion of alternative plans at a conferenceattended by representatives from all the Commonwealth membersof the sterling area.    In the Chancellor&apos;s view the decision wasone for which the United Kingdom Government must take primary responsibility.-   He himself still believed that on balance the wisercourse would be totake this action immediately and announce itas part of the Budget proposals.    He recognised, however, that other Ministers would prefer to wait, in the hope that either theposition would improve to such an extent that no such action wasnecessary or that, if it continued to deteriorate,  they could atleast claim that they had been compelled to take this step by force majeure. - He also appreciated the political difficulties ofmaking so violent a reversal in economic policy and accepting the risks which it entailed of rising prices and increasing unemployment.If the Cabinet were not prepared to accept these risks and difficulties,&apos; the adoption of his plan must at least be deferred -though, for himself, he believed that the Government would be forced into some such action before the summer was over and hewould have preferred to choose the constructive course of takingthe action at a time when there was still hope of securing positive advantage from it rather than wait until action was forced upon him and the prospects of wringing practical advantage from itwere correspondingly less.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the&apos;discussion,  said that there was a clear division of opinion within -the Cabinet on the merits of the Chancellor&apos;s proposal.    ManyMinisters, with every desire to help the Chancellor in hisdifficult task, remained unconvinced that the advantages whichmight be gained from the adoption of this&quot;plan,  if all went well,outweighed its manifest disadvantages and dangers.    So long as there was so large a division of opinion within the Cabinet onthe merits of the plan, it would be hazardous for the chancellor to proceed with it.    His own conclusion was that, at the presenttime,  there was not within the Cabinet a sufficient body of support for this plan to enable the Chancellor to launch it with confidence that he had behind him the conviction, as well as the loyalty,of his colleagues.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that at thisstage he ought to put plainly before his colleagues the alternative course which he would feel bound to follow if he was unable toproceed with his plan for protecting the currency.    The cabinet should realise that this  alternative policy v/ould itself involveaction which in some respects might prove quite as unpalatableto public opinion as the consequences which might have followedfrom the adoption of his original plan.    Political difficultiescould certainly not be escaped by preferring.the alternativeline of policy;    and the economic consequences might prove tobe equally unpleasant.    It would have to be announced that theGovernment&apos;s first objective was to redress the balance ofpayments, and all Government policy v/ould have to be related tothat primary objective.    The main headings of his alternative policy v/ould be as follows.(i)      He v/ould have  to introduce a severe Budget which would include a substantial reduction in the food subsidies and a numberof other unpopular measures.
A : (ii) The Bank rate would have to,beraised to U% - and this wouldcertainly evoke the familiar cry that the. Conservative ,Party had-put ,.; -.,themselves In the hands- of the Bankers.&quot;    &apos; ,lifem(iii).  There would have to be a further cut in defence production,in&quot;order to relieve the strain on.the metal-using Industries and--enable,.them to increase their/exports.    Alternatively,-or in addition, we v       ::    /;should have to-try. to&apos;sell for dollars some of the military equipment-.   .which was now being.manufactured for our own use. .  .(iv)    If. the Cabinet were unwilling to allow-the price mechanism &apos;to operate-automatically to reduce consumption, further use would have to bemade of   physical controls and the;mechanisms of.economic planning. -In particular,.a further eut of  200 millions would.have to be made in&apos;import programmes.   This meant that - wheat stocks would probably have tobe reduced-to a level representing t m weeks&apos; -consumption, that stocksof sugar would have to be run down,.and that further cuts must be made,in imports of animal feedingstuffs and raw materials.   Imports of sdft-wdod -.would have to be further reduced, and the housing programme might have&apos; tobe cut back.    Open general licences to import would have to be suspended.There would have to be a cut in tobacco imports, and the&apos; Service programmes for accumulating reserves of oil would have to be delayed.--: (v)    Further limits would have&apos;to be placed on the freedom of privatetraders to.import goods from Europe.    These restrictions would fallparticularly on imports of machinery, textiles and -food.     This furtherreversal of the policy of liberalising European trade would bring us to thepoint at which some of the other European countries would take retaliatory action against our exports.    The policy which we should be forced tofollow would hasten the collapse of the European Payments Union.(vi) Other Commonwealth Governments would have to be urged to take action, even more drastic than that upon which they had agreed at the.recent Meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers, to reduce their Importsfrom countries outside the sterling area and to expand their exports tothose countries.    Soraa alternative method of dealing with their -sterling balances might also have to be considered.    It must be assumed that theywould be unwilling to fund these balances if the balances held by foreign -countries in London remained free of restriction.    It might, however,  bepossible to. secure some extension of payments agreements limiting theirdrawing right s. .- . &apos; --&apos;.&apos;-&apos;. .-&apos;:.&apos;--&apos;- -(vii) Further cuts in-investment would be necessary. . The housing programme might have to be reduced.    And, in order to discourage      ,investment in new machinery, the depreciation allowances for income tax purposes might have to be cancelled.At the third of these meetings, on 29th February, the Cabinet gaveparticular attention to the cuts which would have to be made, under this alternative policy, in the import programmes.   They had before them a.,note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer setting out a tentative listof measures for reducing imports and expanding exports with a view to&apos;,checking the deterioration in the United Kingdom balance of payments.In&apos;a preliminary discussion of these measures the following points.weremade:- -The Minister of Defence would need to satisfy himself that he couldovercome the objections which the Chiefs of Staff had previously raised to the proposal that wheat stocks should be reduced to the level of ten weeks&apos;  consumption.Strong objection was   raised to the proposal to reduce the import of
coarse -grains. As there was loss.prospect of increased suppliesof imported meat, it was ,the:,raore; important&apos; to build up the&quot; pig.,population in this country. .   &apos;.- &apos;.. &apos;i:&apos;i&apos;v::j:v,&apos;V-;&quot;.&apos; Proposals for reducing. the import of softwoods :must,be , 1&apos;-.7 carefully considered in relation to .the needs of the houslng:i:&apos;::^;i;::&apos;-^::programme.over the next three years&apos;. ^Ministers were most--reluct ant! to reduce the target figures;which they had approved for the-housing- programme. - - ;        - --.;\^:V.&apos;.;&apos;v      - ::\ .--        /:. &apos;-&apos; .-. /;- - -&apos;     .h&apos; Imports of cotton should; not&apos; be&quot; reduced beyond- tne^point -&apos;..Vat which spinners &apos; would begin t of ind difficulty, in getting - the types of cotton they required.- -- ...A group of Ministers under the Chairmanship of theMinister of Defence should consider how a contribution of about.  ^0 millions could be-made, at the expense of defence production, ;   1towards the easing of the balanceof payments problem. --The same group of,Ministers should also consider the .(proposal to save overseas expenditure of  5 millions by delaying the&apos;programmes of.the Services for accumulating reserves of oil.&apos;;-&apos;-     \ The measures proposed for reducing imparts from Europe   &apos;: ..,.should be carefully considered.with a view to reducing to a minimum- the risk of retaliation against our own export trade.&apos; The. final conclusions reached by the Cabinet as aresult of their discussions at these three meetings may besummarised as follows:- &apos; ...(l) Ministers reaffirmed their desire to dispense as soon aspracticable with the system of physical controls -- and to move, as opportunity offered, towards therestoration of a more free economy In which the rev/ould be scope for the operation of the price mechanism.In particular, they endorsed the view that the sterling area could not be preserved indefinitely on a basis-&apos;: &apos; of inconvertible sterling, and they agreed that no- . opportunity should be lost of moving tov/ards the ultimategoal of convertibility of sterling. They were not satis-fied, however, that the present moment was opportune- for the.introduction of a plan, on the lines originally -.   proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for making some, part of our sterling reserves convertible at avariable rate of exchange.(2)       The Cabinet agreed, however, that some action on theselines might be taken at a later stage - either if thecircumstances became,more favourable for the introductionof such a policy, of if the Government found themselvescompelled, by a continuing drain on the gold.and dollar reserves of the sterling area, to take urgent -action to protect the currency.   The alternative. , &apos;-. courses to be followed In the meanwhile should thereforebe so framed as to conform as far as practicable withthe Govemmenfs ultimate objectives.(3) &apos; The Chancellor of the Exchequer should frame his budget in accordance with the.alternative policy which he had outlined towards the end of the Cabinet&apos;s discussions.(U)       In his Budget speech the Chancellor of the exchequer should make it clear that it would be the first objective of Government policy to re*&quot;dress the adverse balance ofpayments, since a sound rearmament programme could onlybe built upon a foundation of adequate economic. .-strength. -.-:-\:-\
u(5)      The Minister of Defence, with the assistance of the Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, should discuss withthe Service Ministers and the Minister of - Supply thepossibility of making a contribution of about  40 millionstowards the easing of the balance of payments problem by making military equipment available for sale to dollar countries or by setting free productive capacity which couldbe used for the manufacture of exports;   and should submit his recommendations to the Cabinet.(6)     The Minister of Defence should consider, with the same group of Ministers, the proposal to save overseas expenditure of 5 millions by delaying the Service programmes for .accumulating reserves of oil;    and should report his recommendations to the Cabinet.(7)     The Chancellor of the Exchequer should discuss with theDepartmental Ministers concerned his other proposals for reducing imports, and should submit to the Cabinet at an-early date a considered plan for reducing imports and expanding exports with a view to checking the deterioration in the balance&apos;of payments.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1. ,March, 1952.
