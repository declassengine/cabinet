(54) 84th Conclusions(Cth December, 1954 - 11.30 aD m. )DUKE OFI WINDSOR1i (Previous rI Reference:C.C.(54) 24thj Conclusions)The Cabinet considered an unnumbered memorandumby the Foreign Secretary about the publication of capturedGerman documents describing the approaches which Germanagents had made to the Duke of Windsor in Spain and Portugalin 1940.When this question had last been discussed by theCabinet on 31st March, 1954, the historians who were editingfor publication a selection of captured German documents were willing to delay for a long time the publication of the volumecontaining this correspondence about the Duke of Windsor,    InJuly, 1954, however, the United States and French editors had changed their minds, and had adopted a plan of work whichwould have the result that the volume containing this correspondence would be published in 1956.    Efforts to.dissuade them from this course had failed0     The memoranduminvited the Cabinet to consider (i) whether we should acquiesce in the course now proposed by the historians, but show the papers to the Duke of Windsor so that he might be prepared forthe disclosure;   or (ii) whether further representations should now be made to the United Spates and French Governments inthe hope of securing their agreement that the proposed publication should be delayed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since the foreign secretary?s memorandum was written, he had taken anopportunity of discussing the matter informally with the DukeI of Windsor.    His Royal Highness was not specially disturbed at the prospect of this disclosure.    While he thought itI unfortunate that the historians should think it necessary to publish these papers, he was not anxious that furtherV efforts should be made to prevent or delay publication.     Hewould be ready to issue a personal statement as soon as the disclosure was made.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he had also  had some recent conversations with the Duke of Windsor on;i this subject.    His Royal Highness was satisfied that it wouldbe preferable not to make any further attempt to interferewith the normal course of publication.II\\./f. The Cabinet were also informed that the main factsI of this story were likely to be disclosed in a forthcomingpublication of the private papers of General Walter Schellenberg.11? the German agent primarily responsible for making the
approaches to the Duke of Windsor in 19400    It was expectedthat this book would be published, by a private publisher, in the spring or summer of 19560    It v/as likely therefore that themain facts would become widely known before the officialpublication of the German documents,The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances nofurther attempt should be made to delay the publication of thevolume of captured German documents containing this correspondence,,    It wass however, important that ministers should be warned well in advance of the date on which thisvolume was to be published;, so that the Duke of Windsor mightbe advised to be ready with the personal statement which hewas proposing to issue and so that any other practicable steps might be taken to induce responsible newspapers to put the disclosure in a proper perspective^The Cabinet -(1) Agreed that no further attempts-should be madeto delay publication of the volume of capturedGerman documents containing the correspondenceabout the approaches made to the Duke of Windsorin Spain and Portugal in 1940.(2)  Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange that Ministers should be warned well in advanceof the date on which this volume was to bejxiblished.Cabinet Office, SoW0l.10th December, 1954.
