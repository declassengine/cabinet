JMalenkov(PreviousReferencesC.C.(54) 50thConclusions)THE PRIME MINISTER said that, now that the geneva Conference was over, the Cabinet must decide what &apos;further communication should be made to M. Molotov inreply to his message of 5th July.    After discussion with theForeign Secretary he had prepared a draft telegram, whichhe read to the Cabinet.    This suggested that it would be useful if, before an official proposal was made, agreement&apos;could be reached informally about the time and place for ameeting.    It proposed that the meeting should not take place before the early part of September, and that it should be heldin Berne, Stockholm or Vienna.    It also threw out thesuggestion that other Ministers, besides the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary* might attend.The Prime Minister&apos; said that it might be convenientthat he should carry this matter a stage further on a personalbasis, and he asked whether the Cabinet would be content thathe should send a personal and private message to M, Molotovin the terms of his draft.In the discussion which followed it was argued thatsuch a communication, though expressed as a personal message from the Prime Minister, must now be regarded asengaging the collective responsibility of the Cabinet.    Sincethe Prime Minister&apos;s return the Cabinet had been fullyconsulted on this matter - indeed this was stated in the draft message - and any further communication must be taken as an expression of the Governments view. .This led to further discussion of the constitutionalaspects of this matter which the Cabinet had considered attheir meeting on 8th July.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when, in the courseof the return voyage from his visit to Washington, he had reached the conclusion that the time was ripe for suggestingsuch a meeting, he had thought it better that he should himselftake the responsibility for making the first informal approach to the Soviet Government.    He had thought it would be preferable that the Cabinet should not be in any way committedat that stage, and that he should first explore the possibilityon a purely personal basis.    He had thoughts and still thought,that it was perfectly proper for him to do this without prior
consultation with the Cabinet.    For the idea of such ameeting was not novel.     It had been mentioned in his speech in Ithe House of Commons on 11th May, 1953.    More recently,in the debate in the House of Commons on 5th April, 1954, theGovernment had accepted an Opposition motion welcoming&quot;an immediate initiative&quot; by the Government to bring about ameeting between the Prime Minister and the Heads of theAdministrations of the United States and the Soviet Union.The Prime Minister circulated a paper containing someextracts from speeches made in that debate, and drewparticular attention to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement, inwinding up the debate, that when the Government thought therewas the least chance of such a meeting being fruitful theywould not hesitate to go for it.    In the light of this it had.seemed natural that he should explore the possibility of pro-ceeding with a project which, as his colleagues well knew,had been in his mind for some time past; and he was notprepared to admit that there was anything unconstitutional inthe course which he had taken in making his preliminaryapproach to M. Molotov on a purely personal basis.    Before    Isending his message he had discussed the matter fully withthe Foreign Secretary and had gained the impression that,while he would not himself have initiated this project, he did not disapprove it.     If he had disapproved, he could haveinsisted that the matter should be referred to the Cabinet.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it had been his view that the Cabinet should be consulted before the messagewas sent, and he had made this clear to the Prime Ministerat the time.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,  1when he had received the draft of the proposed message, hehad understood that it had been sent to him for his personalcomments only.    It would have been possible, though verydifficult, for him to have consulted the Cabinet at that stage,and he must accept personal responsibility for having decided not to do so.    He had sent to the Prime Minister a full account Iof the circumstances in which he had received, and commented Ion, the draft message: this was on record and could be madeavailable to any of his colleagues who wished to pursue thataspect of the matter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not beprepared to abandon the practice, which he had followed formany years, of conducting personal correspondence with Heads Iof other Governments, and he could not accept the view that thedespatch of his original message to M. Molotov involved any constitutional impropriety.    He was sure that there were manygood precedents for actions such as this, in which preliminaryenquiries or pourparlers had been carried out by a PrimeMinister or a Foreign Secretary without prior consultationwith all members of the Cabinet.    Indeed, there must havebeen many occasions on which a Prime Minister or a foreign secretary had taken far more decisive action than this withoutthe knowledge of all members of the Cabinet.
THE MINISTER OF HOUSING suggested that theCabinet should now look to the future rather than the past.He himself shared the view originally expressed by the lord president that the Prime Ministers message to M. Molotovwas an important act of foreign policy which engaged the collective responsibility of the Cabinet and that the cabinet should have been consulted before it was sent.    There seemed,however, to be little profit in prolonging discussion of theconstitutional aspects of the matter.    What the Cabinet had now to consider was how they could best deal with the situationwhich now confronted them.    THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, THECOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY and THE colonial secretary spoke in the same sense.    There was generalagreement that the Cabinefs discussion should now cen&apos;reon the action to be taken in the situation which had now beenreached.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that, though he hadbeen the first to raise the constitutional aspects of this matter,his main concern now was with the international consequences of going forward with this project for a bi-lateral meeting between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.    Somebelieved that the greatest threat to world peace came from theRussians.    He himself believed that the greater risk was thatthe United States might decide to bring the East/West issue toa head while they still had overwhelming superiority in atomic weapons and were comparatively immune from atomic attack by Russia.    He considered that during that period the supremeobject of our policy should be to preserve the unity andcoherence of the Western Alliance.     Could we expect the americans to respect the unity of that Alliance if, without their agreement, we embarked on bi-lateral discussions withthe Russians ?    Was there not a great risk that they would thereby be encouraged to pursue independent policies and totake less account of our views on international affairs?The Soviet Government had that morning published a longstatement on the results of the Geneva Conference.    though they welcomed this as proof that outstanding international difficulties could, with goodwill, be solved by peaceful means,they had gone out of their way to contrast the attitude of theUnited States with that of the other Western Powers and tosuggest that American policy had an aggressive purpose.In view of this it would surely be most inopportune and most damaging to Anglo-American relations to embark, without consultation with the United States Government, on bi-lateraldiscussions with the Russians.    It was his view tha.t hofurther approach should be made to the Soviet government without full consultation with the United States and othermembers of the Western Alliance.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his message hadnot been sent without any consultation with the United states administration.    While he was in Washington he had held manyinformal talks with President Eisenhower about the prospects of arranging a three-Power or four-Power meeting at thehighest level, and he had also mentioned to him and toMr. Dulles the possibility that he might propose a bi-lateralmeeting with M. Malenkov as a personal reconnaissance with
a view to a later meeting on a broader basis. Though, hehad not said anything about the timing of such a bi-lateralmeeting, they certainly had known that it was in his mind.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that his colleagues were entitled to a clear expression of his views on thisquestion.    He did not himself believe that any good would comefrom a bi-lateral meeting with the Russians at the presenttime.     Oh all the main topics for discussion at such a meetingthere was no prospect that any agreement could be reached.On European questions there was no sign that the russians were ready to modify the uncompromising attitude which theyhad adopted at the Berlin Conference.    On Germany, inparticular, their attitude was unyielding.    The proposalswhich they were likely to put forward at such a meeting were quite unacceptable to us, e. g. their plan for the abolitionof atomic weapons, their own security plan for Europe and thedemand that the Chinese PeopleJs Government should at once be recognised as the proper representatives of China in theUnited Nations.    It was evident from the report of the latestconversation which the French Prime Minister had had withM. Molotov (Foreign Office telegram No. 1781 to Paris) thaton all these topics the Russians were still maintaining a whollyuncompromising attitude.     On the other hand the PrimeMinister was most anxious to make a personal attempt to discover, by conversation with the Russian leaders, whethera three-Power or four-Power meeting at the highest level would help to preserve world peace, and was convinced thatsome result might be achieved by this personal contact withthe Russian leaders.    As the Prime Minister, with all hislong experience, felt so strongly that the attempt was worthmaking, the Foreign Secretary was ready to acquiesce - solong as the meeting was not held on Russian soil.    For his part, therefore, he had not wished to raise objection to thedespatch of a further message to M. Molotov in the terms ofthe draft which the Prime Minister had read to the Cabinet.But he agreed that, before any such message was sent, itwould be wise to study the announcement which the SovietGovernment had issued that morning on the results of the geneva Conference.    If the Russians were about to intensifytheir propaganda about the aggressive intentions of the UnitedStates, it might be more difficult to go forward with this project at the present time.  It might be expedient that weshould take the line that we could not attend a meeting withthe Russians while they continued to use their propagandamachine for violent attacks on the policy of our Americanally.     For this reason he suggested that the Cabinet mightdefer their decision until he had had an opportunity to studymore closely the announcement by the Soviet Government towhich the Lord President had drawn attention.There was general agreement in the Cabinet thatthere would be advantage in postponing a decision on thisquestion until the following week, so that Ministers might have time to reflect further and to consider the significance of this statement by the Soviet Government.
5SIn further discussion the following points were also raiseds-(a) Reference had been made to the effect which a bi-lateral meeting with the Russians might have on Anglo-american relations.    Recount should also be taken of the effect of sucha meeting on public opinion in Europe.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, if it were decided to go forward with this project, the French and german governments would have to be told in advance of the line we proposed to take and of the results we hoped to achieve.These preliminary explanations to the French and the germans would need very careful handling.    There was little doubt thatthe meeting would be a shock to public opinion in these andother countries of Western Europe.It would be specially important that French opponents of the European Defence Community (EJD.C.) should not begiven the opportunity to use the meeting as a pretext for further delay in ratifying the E.D.C. Treaty.    If the project wentforward, no announcement of the meeting should be made until after the French Parliament had completed their proceedings on the Treaty.(b) In considering what further reply should be sent tothe Soviet Government, account must be taken of the possibility that the Russians would at some future date disclose the factthat the approach had been made or even publish the corres-pondence.    We might be put in an embarrassing position if itwere disclosed that, having made this offer, we had then with-drawn it.    This seemed to be an argument for making afurther suggestion to the Russians on the lines of the draftprepared by the Prime Minister,(c) It was at least possible that, if a further offer weremade on these lines, the Russians would decline it or would insist that the meeting-place should be within the Soviet Union.That being so, it was for consideration whether the nextmessage to the Russians should not be a formal, rather thana personal, communication,     For we might wish at some stage to disclose the reasons why this project had not come tofruition and we might feel precluded from publishingcommunications expressed as private and personal messages.In this connection it was argued that the Governmentcould not escape responsibility for these overtures on the basis that they had been made in personal correspondence betweenthe Prime Minister and M, Molotov.    Any further message which was sent would be sent after full discussion by theCabinet and would engage the full collective responsibilityof Ministers.    In any event the Government would certainly be held responsible by public opinion, whatever the form ofthe correspondence.(d) There was reason to believe that, since Stalin1 sdeath, power in the Kremlin had been shared by a number ofRussian leaders.     If this were so, it might increase the reluctance of MM. Malenkov and Molotov to attend a high-level
meeting outside the Soviet Union.     It was with this in mind that the Prime Minister was proposing to say in his messagethat he might wish to bring with him to a meeting one or two other ministers in addition to the Foreign Secretary.    The Russiansmight perhaps be more willing to attend a meeting on neutralground if it could be attended by others of their leaders inaddition to MM. Malenkov and Molotov,(e)   Several Ministers said that, as this project had now been carried so far, the balance of advantage seemed to lie on the side of sending a further message to the Russianson the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.    They agreed,however, that it was desirable that members of the cabinet should have an opportunity to reflect further on the questionover the week-end and should resume their discussion earlyin the following week.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of thisquestion at a further meeting on 26th July.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.24th July, 1954.
