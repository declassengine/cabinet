SubjectActs of Violence Against Civil Aircraft
Acts ofViolenceAgainst CivilAircraftSECRETThe Prime Minister said that the Cabinet faced a difficult and complex decision as the result of a series of incidents in whichrepresentatives of the Arab Fedayeen terrorist organisation, the popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), had takenpossession by force of several civil aircraft and were detaining two ofthem at Dawson&apos;s Field, an airfield in Jordan, together with theAmerican, German and Swiss nationals among their passengers, ashostages for the release of Fedayeen imprisoned in the federal german Republic, Switzerland and Israel. Although no british nationals seemed to have been involved in these incidents, our interests were affected in two ways. One of the aircraft concerned had been the property of the Israeli airline, El Al; and, when the attempt on it had been made en route from Amsterdam to New Yorkon 6 September, the pilot had been able to make a forced landing at heathrow Airport, where one of the PFLP terrorists, a woman namedLeila Khalid, had been taken into custody, her male accomplicehaving been killed by the Israeli security guards during the strugglein the aircraft. She was now being held in this country; and it was clear that her release was an essential element in the bargain whichthe PFLP leaders were trying to strike as the price of the surrender of the aircraft and the individuals whom they were detaining in jordan. But the position had been still further complicated by thefact, of which news had reached London only a few minutes beforethe Cabinet assembled, that the PFLP had just seized a BOACaircraft in the course of a flight from Bombay to Beirut. Pendingthe receipt of more detailed information, we could only suppose thatwe too were now in the same position as the United States, Germanyand Switzerland in that the Arab terrorists now held one of our aircraft and a considerable number of our nationals as additionalhostages.We must assume that the PFLP were capable of carrying out their threat to destroy the aircraft and the individuals whom theycontrolled if their demands were not satisfied; and in thesecircumstances we had endorsed a United States initiative that we,they, the Swiss Government and the German Government should consist-ordinate our response to the Fedayeen ultimatum by discussions at berne. We had agreed to use the International Committee of theRed Cross (ICRC) as our intermediary with the Fedayeen and hadacquiesced in a United States proposal authorising the ICRC to offer the release of Leila Khalid, together with the terrorists held by the swiss and German authorities, in exchange for the hostages and aircraft held at Dawson&apos;s Field. The Government of Israel were notat present a party to this proposed transaction, although many ofthe hostages were Israeli nationals and the PFLP ultimatum had121371A 2
made contingent demands for the release of Fedayeen held by Israel.The Red Cross, however, were only prepared to negotiate with the fedayeen for the release of all the hostages, including the Israelinationals. A Red Cross representative, M. Rochat, had already made contact with the Fedayeen; but the only significant reportfrom him so far was that he believed that the 72-hour time limitattached to the Fedayeen ultimatum might be extended. TheGovernment of IsraePs intentions in relation to the ultimatum were,probably deliberately, being kept obscure. But, although they had sofar refused to countenance any exchanges with the terrorists, theymight ultimately be ready to participate in the negotiations. Inaddition they might fear that their hostages might be sacrificed inthe interests of the other nationals concerned; and this might account for an approach which they had made to us that morning for the&quot; provisional arrest&quot;, in the context of our Extradition Treaty, ofLeila Khalid.As regards the legal position Leila Khalid was at present simplybeing detained; and no charges had so far been preferred against her.It would be the duty of the Attorney-General to decide, in the lightof the reports which he received from the police and the airportauthorities about the circumstances in which the aircraft made aforced landing at Heathrow Airport, whether an offence had been committed within British jurisdiction and, if so, whether he shouldprosecute Leila Khalid. The Cabinet should bear it well in mind that the Attorney-General, in reaching his decision on these issues,was constitutionally required to act solely on the basis of his own judgement of the evidence laid before him, although he was entitled,in his discretion, to take account of such wider considerations ofpublic policy as might be relevant.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the ICRCrepresentative, M. Rochat, was due to meet the Fedayeenrepresentatives again at 4 p.m. that day. He had already indicated that he doubted whether the Fedayeen would in fact implement theirthreats on the expiry of the present ultimatum. There were nowsome indications that the Government of Israel might eventually beprepared to take part in the discussions at Berne. The german authorities, on the other hand, were showing signs of wishingunilaterally to release the Arab terrorists whom they held; and wewere seeking to dissuade them from doing so. We had not yet takenformal cognisance of the request of the Israeli Government for the&quot; provisional arrest &quot; of Leila Khalid; and it would be desirable to ask them forthwith that this request should be suspended in view of thenegotiations for the release of the hostages which were now in trainand the danger that, if the Fedayeen suspected that we mightsurrender Leila Khalid to Israel, those negotiations might be gravelyendangered.
In discussion the Cabinet were advised that it was beginning tobecome questionable how much longer Leila Khalid could be detainedwithout charges being laid against her. Moreover, if extraditionproceedings were instituted, even this element of discretion would beremoved, since such proceedings could be stayed only by actioninstituted in the British courts, even if that action were subsequentlyabandoned or withdrawn. On the other hand it might be possible,under the Aliens Order 1953, for her to be held for five days before being charged; and the Home Secretary and the Attorney-general should seek to clarify the position in this respect, pending develop-ments in M. Rochat&apos;s negotiations in relation to the PFLP ultimatum.Meanwhile we should seek to promote a debate in the security council of the United Nations, on the basis of an appropriateResolution, despite the risk that this might merely exacerbaterelations between Israel and the Arab States. It was also very urgentto decide whether there was any action which could be taken inrelation to the BOAC aircraft which had been seized by the PFLPshortly before the Cabinet met and was now within 30 minutes&apos; flyingtime of Beirut, where the terrorists intended to have it refuelled before proceeding elsewhere. The Fedayeen had apparently occupied thecontrol tower at Beirut Airport and were threatening to destroy theaircraft if refuelling operations were impeded. It could be argued that we should not appear, by remaining wholly inactive in this situation, to be ready to concede to any measure of blackmail whichmight be brought to bear upon us. On the other hand it would be dangerous to try to limit or control the discretion of the captain ofthe aircraft in judging what course of action would be most likely toensure the safety of his passengers and crew. On balance, the wisestcourse would be to send an urgent message to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Beirut and, if possible, directly to the aircraft throughBOAC wireless channels, advising the captain that he should be guided by his own judgment; and the Lebanese authorities should be requested by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to comply with the wishes of the captain so far as possible. BOAC might also suggest to the captain that he should try to persuade the terrorists that it might wellbe unsafe for him to attempt to land the aircraft at Dawson&apos;s field and that he should be allowed to take it to some recognised airport.Meanwhile, the Corporation should take urgent action to divert other british aircraft from Beirut or from any airport in the area whichmight be under the control of the terrorists.The Cabinet then considered means of providing additionalprotection for aircraft and airports in this country. The President ofthe Board of Trade said that it would be virtually impossible and
prohibitively expensive to try to ensure total security against sabotageat London Airport. But within the limits of available manpower and security services our precautions had already been intensified,particularly as regards the control of passengers boarding aircraft,although traffic was inevitably being delayed as a result of theadditional measures now being taken.In discussion it was agreed that the security of other airports inthis country, especially Prestwick and Gatwick, should be urgentlyreviewed. It was also for consideration whether in presentcircumstances British air services to the Middle East should bemaintained and, if so, whether Arab passengers should continue tobe accepted. Any action in this connection, however, might preferablytake the form of critical examination of passenger lists rather than ageneral boycott of air services to the Arab States as a whole. Thequestion of security aboard British aircraft should also receive urgentattention; in particular we should seek to clarify the attitude ofBritish airlines and aircrews to the introduction of armed securityguards. Such guards had apparently foiled several attempts to takeforcible possession of El Al aircraft, although the risks involved wereamply illustrated by the most recent case at London Airport, whenthe use of armed force by the Israeli security guard might have caused a major disaster if a hand grenade carried by one of the terroristswhom he was overpowering had not accidentaly failed to explode.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that further action must now wait on the progress of M. Rochafs negotiations inBerne. But all members of the Cabinet should hold themselvesavailable to resume discussion of the situation at short notice; andin the meantime the action which the Cabinet had approved shouldbe put in hand without delay.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the President of the Board of Trade, toarrange, as a matter of great urgency, for appropriatemessages to be conveyed to the Government of the lebanon and to the captain of the British aircraft whichhad been forcibly seized while approaching Beirut,designed to ensure, so far as possible, the safety of the passengers and crew.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to request the Government of Israel to suspend their application forthe provisional arrest of Leila Khalid under ourExtradition Treaty with Israel.
(3) Invited the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General togive further consideration to the period for which it wouldbe permissible to hold Leila Khalid in detention.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to give urgent consideration to the various measures which had beensuggested in their discussion for the intensification of thesecurity of British aircraft and airports.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9 September, 1970.
