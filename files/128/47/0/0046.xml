The Council had met the unions informally on Fridayafternoon; but it had emerged that they were not prepared to explore the formula devised by Mr. Feather but were concerned onlyto reinstate direct negotiations. After the informal meeting hadended, the Secretary of State had met both parties. It was clearthat no progress had been made and that the unions were not atpresent prepared to call for a resumption of normal working. they intended to hold a meeting on Sunday, 13 December, of the tradeunion side of the industry&apos;s National Joint Industrial Council (NJIC)and had asked that representatives of the Electricity Council shouldbe available in case the unions wished to get in touch with them.These developments had been considered on the previous eveningby the Ministers most closely concerned, who had concluded that,unless the unions were prepared to call for an immediate resumptionof normal working, the Cabinet should be invited to consider whetherthey should now advise the Proclamation of a State of Emergency.Public opinion was hardening against the electricity workers;and the appointment in present circumstances of a court of inquiry into the dispute might appear as a weakening of the Governmenfsstand, particularly if normal working were not at once resumed. If,however, an inquiry were established, it would be essential that itshould be required by its terms of reference to have regard to thenational interest and to the impact of industrial action by the manual workers on the economy as a whole. In Northern Ireland theelectricity authorities, without the knowledge of the NorthernIreland Government, had offered a pay increase of 15 per cent onthe basis of retrospective adjustment in the light of any settlementreached by the electricity authorities in Great Britain with theirworkers. This offer, however, had been rejected; and the NorthernIreland Government had reported on the previous evening that, asa result, they might be without electricity after 11 p.m., wxcept perhaps for essential services, for which the unions had undertaken to maintain supplies.  In these circumstances the Northern Ireland
Government had sought, and had been given, authority to avail themselves of the help of Servicemen stationed in the Province tothe extent necessary to maintain supplies so far as possible, especially for essential services; but in the event it had not so far been necessary to call on Servicemen.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said thatelectricity demand that morning had been rather lower, while thesupply remained unchanged. No electricity cuts were thereforeforeseen at the moment. He had discussed with the Chairman ofthe Electricity Council, Sir Norman Elliott, the possible course ofevents following the previous day&apos;s discussions with the unions.Sir Norman Elliott thought there was evidence of disunity on theunion side and of increasing concern about their public position. he believed that, following the meeting of the union side of the NJICon the afternoon of Sunday, 13 December, they might wish to resume direct negotiations and that there might then be some chanceof reaching a settlement on the basis of a comparatively smallimprovement in the Councils last pay offer, designed mainly toenable the unions to end industrial action and to secure a speedysettlement without an undue sacrifice of their prestige. Sir NormanElliott had made no firm proposals, however, about the degree ofconcession which might be required for this purpose.In these circumstances the Cabinet would wish to considerwhether a concession which would still leave the percentage valueof the pay increase below 11 per cent would be publicly defensible.Such an improvement of less than 1 per cent in the original offermight be provided, or example, by raising the increase in basic ratesfrom 40s. to 42s. 6d. and providing, in addition, an advanceallowance to those workers who were awaiting the implementation of productivity schemes on the understanding that they consented towork-study. Agreement on such a basis, however, might well not prove feasible. The leader of the union side had appeared readyon the previous day to reach a settlement only on the basis of anincrease of as much as 50s. in basic rates, together with a productivityallowance; and his colleagues might wish to stand out for even higher increases.The Secretary of State for Employment said that in his judgmentthe chances that the unions would be willing to reach a settlement on the following day were small. There were nevertheless arguments for authorising the Electricity Council to reach a settlement notexceeding an 11 per cent increase if the opportunity occurred. Theirrepresentatives had so far played their part loyally and well in thenegotiations and had forthrightly rejected all suggestions that theywere acting on Government instructions. In order to maintain their
integrity and morale it might be desirable not to deny them areasonable further measure of negotiating discretion, especially since they could be relied on to hold to their assurance that they wouldnot propose any improvement in the CounciFs existing offer unless and until the union representatives had shown beyond doubt thatsuch an improvement would lead to a final settlement. Nevertheless,there remained some risk of failure to reach an agreement; and oncean improvement had been tabled, any subsequent court of inquiry would inevitably start from a higher base than if the Council wereinstead asked to rest firmly on their present 10 per cent offer.In discussion it was emphasised that public opinion was nowmoving strongly in favour of continued resistance to the extravagentdemands of the unions. The unions themselves could hardly beimpervious to this influence, although the fact that their members were able to maintain their earnings during the go-slow gave themno inducement to resume normal working. In these circumstances the public would regard the appointment of a court of inquiry atthe present juncture as a retreat by the Government; and it was generally agreed that this course should not be entertained for thetime being. It was recognised, however, that it might be difficult torefuse a request by the unions for the appointment of a court of inquiry if they undertook to resume normal working.Although the Chairman of the Electricity Council did not wholly dismiss the possibility that the meeting of the trade union side of the NJIC on the following day would lead to a negotiated settlement within tolerable limits, the refusal by the NorthernIreland workers of the offer of a 15 per cent increase in earningsmade it extremely unlikely that a settlement at any lower level wouldbe acceptable to the unions in Great Britain. It was agreed thatthe Electricity Council should not volunteer any additional offer,since, even if it were rejected, it would nevertheless raise the levelof the pay increase likely to result from a court of inquiry if onewere ultimately set up. It was more difficult, however, to decide theappropriate response in the unlikely event of the unions proposing a settlement involving an increase of no more than 11 per cent on earnings with the addition of advanced productivity payments. Onthe one hand, a court of inquiry, if it were ultimately appointed,might well recommend an increase of more than 11 per cent; and itwould therefore be impolitic to reject the opportunity of settling thedispute on the basis of a lower increase without an inquiry. Asagainst that, the acceptance by the Electricity Council of a negotiated settlement involving only a marginal increase on their existing offer would be liable to be publicly regarded as a defeat forthe Government in their efforts to contain inflation. Moreover, even
if a settlement could be obtained by an addition of no more than per cent to the Councifs existing offer, the unions would seek to exaggerate the size of the advantage which they had obtained eventhough this could be countered by concentrating attention on the marginal nature of the addition rather than on the absolute amount involved. In these circumstances it would probably be best that, ifthe union side made an offer within limits which might be judgedworthy of consideration, the representative of the Electricity council should undertake to refer it to the management side, even though this would entail some risk that the Council would appear not to bea wholly free agent despite their insistence that the Government werenot seeking to influence their judgment.On the alternative assumptions, however, that in the event theunions did not make any offer which the Electricity Council could resonably be expected to entertain, it was for consideration whetherthe Council should withdraw the offer which they had already made.This offer had been described by Government spokesmen at the time as reasonable; but an offer which was reasonable in the course of negotiation was not necessarily reasonable as a continuing offer afterthe workers had disrupted production. On the other hand a withdrawal of the offer in current circumstances would be likely tobe regarded as provocative, particularly by the many workers whowere probably seeking to be relatively restrained in theirinterpretation of the work-to-rule; and it might therefore be liableto do more harm than good. It would be a different matter, if acourt of inquiry were set up, for the offer to be formally withdrawnfor the purpose of the inquiry. That possibility remained open forconsideration.In further discussion it was suggested that the Chairman of theElectricity Council should send a letter to every worker, warninghim of the possible consequences of industrial indiscipline andflagrant breach of contract. On balance, however, it was agreed thatit would be preferable that any letter of this kind should be directedprimarily to making clear the precise terms of the offer which theCouncil had made.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was important that no step should be taken to alienatethe very strong public support which was manifesting itself forresistance to the extravagant claims of the unions. No action to setup a court of inquiry should be taken for the present. It would be preferable that the Electricity Council should not volunteer any additional offer; and if, as seemed improbable, the unions putforward after their meeting on the following day a new proposal which was not entirely undeserving of examination, it would be
CM 46 (70)appropriate that the Council&apos;s representative should confine himself,so far as possible, to undertaking that it would receive consideration.After that meeting had taken place the Secretary of State for employment should meet representatives of the Council and theunions separately in order to ascertain the position. He should againask the union representatives if they were prepared to recommenda resumption of work. If they were not, they should be asked tqreconsider this decision; but if they were, he should indicate thathe would consider the position against a further meeting with union representatives on Monday, 14 December.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Employment to be guided accordingly.The Cabinet then considered the advisability of proclaiming a Stateof Emergency. They were informed that arrangements hadprovisionally been made for a meeting of the Privy Council at p.m. that day and that, if an Emergency were proclaimed, it mightbe convenient to arrange the Parliamentary debate on the emergency regulations on the following Thursday, 17 December. TheRegulations would remain in force for one month; and parliament would accordingly not need to be recalled during the christmas recess in order to renew them, if that should be necessary.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that consideration had been given to making three Orders under theEmergency Powers. The first would prohibit the use of electricityfor advertising and display purposes. It would not be reasonable,however, for this prohibition to apply during the coming week-endsince some firms would be unable to give effect to it until thebeginning of the following week but would meanwhile be guilty ofan offence if the Order were effective immediately. The order should therefore be made forthwith but should take effect from monday, 14 December. The second Order would prohibit the useof electricity for domestic space heating, subject to a wide range ofexceptions, for example where no other form of heating was available. There were arguments, however, for deferring it until thesituation had deteriorated further. The third Order would regulate the use of electricity by industry. Certain essential services wouldbe excluded from its scope; and provision would have to be madefor the continued use of electricity in other cases for long enough toallow machinery to be run down without damage. It was notpossible, however, to discriminate between non-priority industrialusers; and most industry would be brought to a halt. Accordingly,this Order, too, should not be made until it became essential.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Order relating to domestic space heating would be virtually unenforceable. It was not required for the present; andfurther consideration should be given to its implications, particularly as regards the elderly and the sick and infirm.(b) A comprehensive prohibition by Order of the use ofelectricity for industrial purposes appeared to be unnecessarilysevere; and some means should be found of discriminating more precisely between industries on the basis of relative priorities. TheSecretary of State might take discretion under the Order to selectparticular industries for restriction or for exemption. It might alsobe possible to restrict the use of electricity for industrial purposes inparticular areas or at particular times in such a way that theavailable supply was distributed rationally.ifi) The use of electricity for street lighting could be prohibitedby an Order. But the interests of safety called for specialdiscrimination; and it was probably preferable to rely on the voluntary exercise of discretion by local authorities.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that The Queen should be advised to proclaim a State of Emergency that afternoon, and that an order prohibiting the use of electricity for advertising and display purposes should be made immediately the Emergency Regulations were inforce, to come into effect on 14 December. The content and timing of possible Orders relating to restrictions on the use of electricityfor space heating and industrial purposes should be further considered by the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies.Restriction of street lighting should be left at this stage to the voluntary discretion of local authorities. It would be appropriate for the Home Secretary to make a statement on television that evening, explaining the effect of the Proclamation of a State ofEmergency and of the Order concerning advertisement and displaylighting. He should also make it clear, while avoiding specific reference to electricity for space heating or industrial use, that further Orders would be made as the situation required; and thatno question of using troops in power stations at present arose. TheSecretary of State for Social Services should issue a statement onthe use of stand-by generators for hospitals.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that The Queen should be advised to proclaima State of Emergency that afternoon.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tomake an Order immediately under the Emergency
CM 46 (70)Regulations, to come into effect on Monday,14 December, prohibiting the use of electricity foradvertising and display purposes.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to broadcast on television an explanation of the implications of the Proclamation, theEmergency Regulations and the Order concerning theuse of electricity for advertising and display purposes.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to issue astatement concerning the use of stand-by generators forhospitals.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to reinforce his request to local authorities that street lighting should be severely restricted.(7) Took note that the Ministerial Committee on Emergencieswould give further consideration to the content and timing of possible Orders prohibiting the use of electricityfor space heating and for industrial purposes.
