rhodesia the approach to Mr. Smithand OtherProblems121592a 2SECRET1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP (70) 67) dealing with a possibleapproach to Mr. Ian Smith and with other problems arising fromthe existence of the present regime in Rhodesia.The Prime Minister said that, in the absence of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary who had had to fly to Cairo to attend thefuneral of President Nasser, it would be desirable to deferconsideration of the approach to Mr. Smith and to confine discussion to the other questions outlined in the memorandum.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that thePost Office were anxious to discontinue their present practice ofsurcharging certain Rhodesian stamps which were regarded asinvalid. The practice was an irritation to individuals in this country;it was irregular and illogical in its incidence; and it made no effective contribution to the United Nations sanctions policy, since the hardship which it entailed fell exclusively on individuals in thiscountry. A decision to end the surcharge should therefore be announced as soon as possible. The Post Office considered that they already possessed the necessary discretionary powers for this purpose,whereas the Law Officers&apos; preliminary view was that it would benecessary for the Post Office to take powers by publishing a charges scheme in the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes.In discussion there was general agreement that the surchargeshould be ended. But the way in which this should be effectedshould be further considered by the Law Officers, in the light of anew submission from the Solicitor to the Post Office.On the subject of Rhodesian divorces The Lord Chancellor saidthat hardship was being caused in a few cases in this country becausethe United Kingdom courts were unable to accept the validity ofjudgments by Rhodesian courts presided over by judges appointedsince the illegal declaration of independence. In the case ofMrs. Adams, mentioned in paragraph 7 of CP (70) 67, the UnitedKingdom courts could neither recognise a divorce granted by sucha court in Rhodesia nor at present exercise jurisdiction themselves.A comprehensive solution to the problem, whereby the UnitedKingdom courts would be given discretion to recognise the judgmentsof unconstitutionally appointed Rhodesian legal authorities, could giverise to political difficulties in that it would be likely to be represented as implying recognition of the illegal regime and, therefore, asicontrary to the Security Council Resolution on which the currentsanctions policy was based. The immediate difficulty could be overcome, however, by giving the United Kingdom courts jurisdiction
in divorce applications from individuals with a Rhodesian domicileor three years&apos; total residence in this country, in Rhodesia or in both countries, subject in all cases to a residential qualification of sixmonths in this country. Such a change in the law could be effected by an Order in Council under the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Order in Council would require an Affirmative Resolution indue course. The draft, which had been approved by the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, could meanwhile be shown in confidence by the latter to the Lord President of the Court of Session.The Cabinet noted that the action which they had endorsed to mitigate hardship as regards the postal surcharge and divorcejurisdiction would be liable to increase the pressure from otherindividuals, including holders of Rhodesian Government stock, whohad received no payment since 1965, for some corresponding redressof their grievances. It was agreed, however, that there was no basis for any change in present policy towards these individuals.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,without prejudice to the Law Officers&apos; final consideration of themeans by which the postal surcharge should be ended, the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Minister of Posts and telecommuncations and the Attorney-General, should decide the timing of the necessarypublic announcement. The Ministers concerned should also agreethe timing of the release of information about the decision onRhodesian divorces. In both cases they should bear in mind thedesirability of avoiding, so far as possible, any renewal of claims onthe Government from holders of Rhodesian stock.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, the Lord President of theCouncil, the Minister of Posts and telecommuncations and the Attorney-General to proceed accordingly.(2) Agreed to resume discussion on CP (70) 67 at their next meeting.OverseaAffairsSituationin theMiddle East(previous reference:CM (70) 24thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that LeilaKhaled and the Fedayeen prisoners held by the Governments of theFederal German Republic and Switzerland had now been flown to cairo in a Royal Air Force aircraft. The United Arab Republic,pleading their preoccupation with the funeral of President Nasser,had initially asked us to delay sending them until 3 October. Butthey had subsequently agreed to accept them: and the aircraft had reached Cairo in the early hours of that morning.
The Minister of State for Defence said that the medical units which had been standing by in Cyprus had now been flown intoAmman and were operating under the protection of the JordanianArmy.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that on29 September the Soviet controller at the Berlin Air Safety Centrehad informed his British, United States and French colleagues thatthe Soviet authorities were closing to air traffic part of the air space in the northern and central air corridors giving access to Berlin. Theperiod selected for the intended closure was one during which noscheduled airline services would normally be using the corridor.Nevertheless, the Western Ambassadors in Germany had consideredthat the Soviet action was both illegal and provocative in intention.They had therefore made an immediate protest to the SovietGovernment and had recommended to their respective governments that, as on previous occasions when the Soviet authorities had attempted to interfere with the freedom of air navigation in the Berlincorridors, aircraft of the three Western Powers should undertakeprobing flights. The United States Government had initially been reluctant to take this action but had later agreed to do so. TheFrench Government had subsequently said that they would be unableto undertake a probing flight, ostensibly because no French aircrewwas available; but flights had been made by British and american aircraft. Finally, the Soviet authorities had cancelled the closure of the air corridors, alleging that it was the result of a faulty decision taken at a relatively low level of authority. But their action hadevidently been deliberate and intended to test our reactions.The Minister of State for Defence said that this was the firstinterference with traffic in the Berlin air corridors since 1965. TheWestern probing flights had taken place without incident, except thata surface-to-surface missile had been seen to be fired, presumablyas a demonstration. There had also been a few close approachesby Soviet military aircraft to civil aircraft in the corridors.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthis action, like current Soviet activities in Cuba and the installation of further missiles in the Suez Canal Zone in violation of the cease-fire, showed that the Soviet Government had not abandoned their traditional policy of continuously probing for weak points in theWestern positions. They might have speculated that the combination of a new Government in Britain and the renewed tension in the middle east provided an opportune moment to test the firmness of purposeof the Western Powers by a sudden challenge in a different area. Thefact that we had reacted rapidly and vigorously should have a salutary effect on the current four-Power discussions about Berlin.
Aid agreement the Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of State for Defence andof the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Malta: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that agreementFinancial ^ad now been reached with the Maltese Government on the divisionof the balance of aid still available to Malta under the 1964Agreement, during the period of five years ending on 31 March,1974. 75 per cent of the balance would be made available by wayof gift and 25 per cent by way of loan. The subsidiary arrangementsstill remained to be worked out in detail: but we should also be making a contribution in respect of the capital development of the dockyard and the restoration of historic buildings.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that thepresent situation in regard to aid to Malta was unsatisfactory and could not be allowed to continue indefinitely. Although we mustdischarge our existing obligations, we must be on our guard againstassuming any additional commitments. Since the defence facilities provided by Malta were now primarily of interest to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), it would be logical thatNATO should assume financial responsibility for them.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.public expenditure(previous reference:CM (70) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)InvestmentIncentivesSECRET3.* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (70) 66) proposing changes in the system of investment incentives.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordance withthe Governmenfs declared policy, he proposed to end the systemof investment grants; grants would not be paid on expenditure incurred after 31 October, 1971. In their place, he proposed tointroduce a new system of depreciation allowances, available to bothmanufacturing and service industry, under which it would be possiblefor 60 per cent of expenditure on investment to be written off for tax purposes in the first year. In the development areas, free depreciation would be allowed on all immobile plant and machinery and the existing 40 per cent initial allowance for new industrial buildings, which was at present due to end in April 1972, would be
CM 25 (70)continued indefinitely. Ships would continue to attract free depreciation and, in their case only, investment grants would continueto be paid on expenditure incurred up to 31 October, 1972, under existing contracts. In addition there would be an adjustment in therate of corporation tax.In discussion, the following main points were made:(a) It had never been demonstrated that public expenditure on investment incentives was really effective in securing a higher levelof investment. Industry&apos;s investment intentions were influencedmuch more by expectations about profitability and the future growth of demand. The Chancellor^ proposals would add to public expenditure in 1970-71 and 1971-72 and would produce onlyrelatively modest savings in subsequent years. It might be preferable to aim for substantially larger savings to give greater scope for reducing direct (particularly personal) taxation so as to help to restoredynamism to the economy. By this means and reforms in the structure of corporate taxation, we should provide a better climatefor increased industrial investment and encourage industry to financeit primarily from retained earnings and from private savings throughthe capital market.(b) In presenting the Governmenfs decisions on public expenditure to the public, it would be necessary to show that the reductions had not fallen disproportionately on the social servicescompared with industry.(c) The transitional arrangements proposed by the chancellor would give manufacturing industry a big incentive to accelerate itsinvestment plans in order to complete expenditure on them withinthe next year, at an extra cost to the Exchequer of perhaps  60million. To some extent this boost to investment would be desirable,but it might cause a sudden upsurge in imports of plant and machinery which would be damaging to the balance of payments.The aim of transitional arrangements should be to make reasonableprovision for companies who had already entered into contracts onthe basis of the investment grants scheme before its abolition was announced. However, in the case of ships, even a two-year period would not allow all existing contracts to be completed; the shipping industry would lose at least  80 million in grants which it had nohope of offsetting from investment allowances.id) The Chancellor^ proposals would substantially reduce the differential incentives for manufacturing industry to invest in thedevelopment areas; at the same time they would spread the availableassistance even more thinly. When they were announced, it wouldbe essential for the Government to be able to show that they would
nevertheless be continuing to operate a strong regional policy. TheGovernment were pledged to make greater use of the local employment Act and to accelerate improvements in the infrastructureof the development areas. The Governmenfs commitment to endexisting discrimination against the service industries need not be interpreted as requiring them to extend new incentives to these industries; and instead of making them eligible for free depreciationin the development areas, it might be preferable to devote a similarsum to provide selective assistance under the Local Employment Actto encourage industry to locate new employment-generating projects in these areas, and to additional expenditure on infrastructure there.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer would wish to review his proposals inthe light of the points made in discussion, and the Cabinet shouldresume their discussion in the following week. The ministerial committee on Regional Policy and the Environment should thereafterconsider how the effect of the Governmenfs decisions on thedevelopment areas could best be presented in the light of other proposals relating to regional development and placed in the context of the Governmenfs approach to regional policy as a whole.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministefs summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) To review his proposals in the light of the cabinets discussion, and to reconsider in particular (a) The transitional arrangements for the abolitionof investment grants for ships.(b) The possibility of bringing the entitlement togrants for other investment to an end with effect from the date of his proposed announcement.(c) Whether, in place of his proposal to allow free depreciation to service industries in development areas, an equivalent sum mightbe devoted to improving the infrastructureof development areas and to selectivefurther assistance to suitable projects underthe Local Employment Acts.(d) The desirability of securing a greater overallsaving from the change from a system of grants to investment allowances, with aview to securing a better balance between
public expenditure(previous reference:CM (70) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)HousingFinanceSECRET4.* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (CP (70) 64) about housing finance.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thathousing policy required major reform. At present council housesmade up one-third of the total housing stock. While there were alarge number of privately rented dwellings, this sector was rapidlydeclining and most of the tenants concerned were in no positionto buy their own houses. If rents were raised to economic levelsthey would seek council houses. The public sector might then riseto some 50 per cent of the total. Rents in both sectors were nowlow and this discouraged owner-occupation. The 1965 Rent Act,which provided for &quot; fair rents &quot; in part of the private sector, had worked well where it applied. The main features of his new proposals were a general move to &quot; fair rents &quot; in both the private and thepublic sector. This would narrow the cost differential betweenbuying and renting accommodation, and should encourage owner-occupation, including the purchase of council houses. It would alsoencourage private landlords to maintain their property adequately.The increases involved would, however, be very large. He therefore proposed that there should be a national minimum scheme of rent rebates and allowances covering needy families in rented accommodation in both the public and private sectors, administered by the local authorities. Though this would involve an extensionof personal subsidies into the field of private housing, it was essential if a move to fair rents in the private sector was not to be accompaniedby serious hardship to poorer families and greatly increased demandfor new council houses. The move to fair rents should also bespread over a period to reduce the impact. If the annual averagerent increases towards the fair rent level were limited to 10s. Od. aweek (with a maximum of 15s. Od. for any tenant), there would besavings at current prices in public expenditure terms of the orderof  135 million in 1974-75 and  215 million in 1975-76.   If thethe public expenditure savings in respectof industry and the social services andmore scope for reductions in direct taxation.(ii) To circulate a further paper, for consideration attheir meeting on 6 October.
average rent increases were limited to 15s. Od. a week (with amaximum of  1 for any tenant) the savings would be  205 million in 1974-75 and  280 million in 1975-76. His proposals would deprivelocal authorities of much of their existing discretion in housing policy. Increases in rents and the proposed rebates for the poorerfamilies would have to apply uniformly to England and Wales asa whole. The overall effect of the proposals would be that authoritiesin the poorer inner areas of cities such as London and Liverpoolwould gain at the expense of some of the authorities with a largestock of council houses built in the 1930s and 1940s. He had it inmind to make a statement which would place these major reformsof housing policy in perspective, making clear their constructiveapproach while providing a background for some reference to possible savings in the White Paper which it was proposed to publishat the end of October.In discussion considerable support was expressed for the general approach proposed, but the following points were made:(a) The proposals had not yet been discussed with the Secretaryof State for Scotland. While it was hoped to follow the same general approach there as was proposed for England, rents were very low and as the privately rented sector was small with council housingalready forming half the housing stock it would be difficult to move to &quot; fair rents &quot; in the public sector. Proposals for basing rents onpooled historic costs were under consideration. It was emphasised,however, that such an approach in Scotland would intensifyresistance in England and Wales to the full move to &quot; fair rents &quot;.(b) Further consideration should be given to the principle ofgiving allowances to the tenants of private landlords. While theproposals would, in the public sector, make a welcome transfer ofsubsidisation from the house to the family in need, and while the rents of the poorest private tenants were already subsidised throughsupplementary benefits, there were arguments of principle againsta general extension of rent subsidies. The right policy was so toincrease rents in the public sector that those who did not qualify forrebates and who could afford ownership or economic private rentsmoved out, leaving accommodation available for those who genuinelycould not afford the economic rent. On the other hand, this wouldbe a long process and in the meantime there would be severe hardshipunless council building was substantially increased or the burdenof subsidising tenants was left on private landlords.(c) A scheme for subsidising needy families in private rented accommodation would also raise administrative problems. its administration would presumably require a substantial staff.Moreover, even if the scheme were conceived as a transitional one
it might in practice prove permanent. On the other hand, it was argued that the problems of administration had been considered,and that no insuperable difficulties were expected.id) If decisions in principle were reached on housing policy, itwould be possible to make allowance in the proposed public expenditure White Paper for the savings which could reasonably be expected, without going into detail, perhaps by using a globalfigure covering the savings from these changes, those from the move to an agricultural levy scheme, and possibly some other items.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hehad some doubts, which were shared by some members of theCabinet, about the proposal to provide rent allowances for needyfamilies in private accommodation. The Minister of Housing andLocal Government should circulate a further paper setting out indetail how the proposed scheme might work. He should also give some further indication of how he proposed that owner-occupationmight be encouraged. He and the Secretary of State for scotland should also arrange for officials to consider whether their differingproposals for reform could be reconciled.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Scotland, and the Minister ofPublic Building and Works, to report on the machineryfor administering a national minimum scheme of allowances for needy families in private rented accommodation, and on proposals for encouraging owner-occupation, to enable the Cabinet to consider the matter further at the beginning of the following week.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government andthe Secretary of State for Scotland to arrange for officials to give joint consideration to the proposals for reform of housing finance which they had currently underconsideration.General The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would resume at thebeginning of the following week their discussion of public expenditure and related changes of policy, including the proposalsfor additional expenditure and the balance of the proposals as awhole, bearing in mind the need to provide scope for the abolitionof selective employment tax and the reductions in personal taxationto which the Government were pledged. In the meantime theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1 October, 1970.might consider further with the Ministers concerned the outstandingproposals for additional expenditure to see whether agreement couldbe reached in respect of some of them.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chief secretary, Treasury, to discuss the proposals for additional expenditure with the Ministers concerned, onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(4) Agreed to resume their discussions of public expenditure onMonday 5 and Tuesday 6 October.
