CM 7 (70)CONFIDENTIALChancellor of 1. The Cabinet expressed their deep sorrow at the suddenthe Exchequer death of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the previous evening;and they paid a warm tribute to the outstanding services which hehad rendered to Conservative Governments and to the conservative party in the past. They directed that a message of sympathy shouldbe conveyed on their behalf to Mrs. Macleod.Anns for south Africa(previous reference :CM (70) 6thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered the terms of an Opposition Motioncriticising the Parliamentary statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary on the previous day about the export ofarms to South Africa. They decided that no useful purpose wouldbe served by tabling an amendment to this Motion for the purposesof the debate on the following day and that the governments supporters should be advised simply to vote it down.The Government might be pressed in the forthcoming debate togive greater precision to the undertaking by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary to make a further Parliamentary statementbefore any action was taken to give effect to the government&apos;s intention to permit in principle the export of arms to South Africa.If so, the Government should seek to retain the maximum of freedom of action up to the point at which the grant of an export licence was in question; but they should be prepared, if necessary,to indicate that no individual licences would be issued until theHouse of Commons had been given a further opportunity to considerthe matter.National docksdispute(previous reference:CM (70) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Minister of Transport said that the London PortEmergency Committee had unanimously concluded that a cargo ofbananas in a partly unloaded ship in the Royal Group of docks wasnot important enough to justify the use of Servicemen, in face of thecomplete refusal of the local dockers to deal with them. It seemed likely, however, that Servicemen would be needed shortly to unloadfood in the London docks; and there might then be a withdrawal oflabour by tugmen, lockgate men and others in support of the dockers.The possible requirement for Servicemen to undertake the further work which would be necessary in those circumstances was beingurgently examined. Elsewhere in London dockers were unloadingcargoes of food and hospital equipment or had indicated willingness to11426A 2
unload food next week. In other ports, the main change since theprevious day was that dockers at Felixstowe had decided to join thestrike. Services to the Channel Isles were working; and supplies forthe Shetland Isles and the Orkneys were being loaded. At Barry,where it was desirable to unload certain cargoes of bananas promptly,it was thought that, if Servicemen were assigned to this task, theimporters would probably be able to arrange transport from the docks.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that theprice of meat had begun to rise and supplies at Smithfield Marketwere beginning to run short. The larger stores expected to hold their prices for meat this week but to have to raise them in the following week by something like 6d. to 8d. a lb. Supplies of chilled meat inthe docks would need to be unloaded later in the week and could perhaps be sent to markets outside London for distribution, thusavoiding the risk of precipitating strike action by the SmithfieldMarket porters. In general, the Governmenfs efforts to avertunnecessary increases in food prices appeared to be having some success.The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity saidthat the Court of Inquiry into the dockers&apos; pay dispute had begun tomeet that morning and would be taking evidence until Thursday.He expected to see the final draft of their report on the following monday; and it would probably be published on 29 July. He would discuss with the Lord President of the Council the formalarrangements for publication when Parliament was in Recess.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that a Government decision of principle on theuse of Servicemen in the docks to handle perishable food cargoeswould be preferable to a number of separate decisions on individualcargoes at different ports. The Home Secretary and the Minister ofTransport should therefore arrange to see Mr. Jack Jones, theGeneral Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union(TGWU), later that day, and should invite him to indicate clearlyhis union&apos;s attitude towards the unloading of perishable food cargoes.This approach to the union and Mr. Jones&apos; response should be made public. If Mr. Jones was able to commit his union to a consistentpolicy of co-operation in dealing with perishable cargoes at all themain ports in question, the Government would accept such anundertaking, provided that it was recognised as being for theGovernment, not the union, to decide which cargoes needed to beunloaded. If, however, Mr. Jones was not able to give an undertaking to this effect, it would be necessary to introduce Service labour intothe docks, and to emphasise in public statements the dockers&apos;responsibility for the consequences, including price increases.  The
SECRET*4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP (70) 19) reviewing the situation in Northern Irelandand seeking the Cabinefs general approval for a plan which had beenput to the Home Secretary by the Northern Ireland Prime Minister,Major Chichester-Clark, during the latter&apos;s recent visit to London.This involved, initially, the re-establishment of police control in theBogside area of Londonderry by the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC), supported in the initial stages by British military police (RMP)and, as a second stage, if the first element of the plan succeeded, aban on marches in the Province for the rest of the year.The Home Secretary said that the Orange Day celebrations inthe Belfast area had passed off quietly, thanks to effective security arrangements and the exertions of the army and RUC. As a result,there had been a reduction in tension; but the situation remaineddangerously unstable. A recrudescence of violence by the roman catholics might weaken the position of the Prime Minister of theIrish Republic, Mr. Lynch. Another danger was pressure on theNorthern Ireland Prime Minister from the right wing of the UlsterUnionist Party and the Rev. Ian Paisley&apos;s Protestant Unionists.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.secret cabinet accepted that this approach might entail leaving someperishable cargoes to spoil while the general TGWU assurance wasbeing sought; but, if this happened, it should be made clear to thepublic that the cause of the loss was the dockers&apos; strike and their refusal to handle the consignments at risk.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Home Secretary:(i) In consultation with the Minister of Transport, to seek an assurance from the Transport and general works Union about their willingness toco-operate in unloading perishable cargoes.(ii) In consultation with the Lord President of the Counciland the Minister of Transport, to arrange publicity for the action at (i) above.(iii) To   arrange  for  further  consideration  by   the ministerial Committee on Emergencies of theaction to be taken by the Government in the lightof the outcome of the representations at (i) above.
Major Chichester-Clark&apos;s position was by no means secure and a fewmore defections might cause his Government to fall. In this situation,the Northern Ireland Prime Minister had concluded that someinitiative by his Government was urgently necessary but that actionwhich was directed-or would be thought to be directed against one section of the community must be counter-balanced by action againstthe other. He had accordingly put forward the plan outlined in theHome Secretary&apos;s memorandum. The re-establishment of police authority in the Bogside would be regarded as a blow to the roman catholics: but this would be offset by the ban on marches until theend of the year, which would be seen as being directed against theProtestants since the period of the ban was one in which traditionallyonly Protestant marches were held. If there were a violent reaction in the Bogside to the proposed patrols by unarmed members of theRUC accompanied by the RMP, the Army would have to providesupport. There were obvious risks in this; but the danger of allowing the present situation to continue were at least as great. The chief constable of the RUC, Sir Arthur Young, was in favour of the plan;and, if the Cabinet gave it their general approval, the operationaldetails could then be worked out by the Northern Ireland SecurityCommittee and the decision to put it into operation would be taken at the appropriate moment by himself and the Defence Secretary inconsultation with the Government of Northern Ireland.The Defence Secretary said that in general, and subject to theviews of the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland(GOC (NI)), he was in favour of the course of action proposed,provided that it was clearly understood that, if joint RUC and RMPpatrols attempted to enter the Bogside and were repulsed, therewould be no alternative to deploying the army to establish full controlof the area.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the PrimeMinister of the Irish Republic had publicly committed himself totrying to secure a ban on the Protestant marches which were due totake place in Londonderry on and around 12 August. If these werein fact banned, this would strengthen Mr. Lynch&apos;s position.The Chief of the General Staff said that the situation in theBogside was different from that in the Roman Catholic Falls Roadarea of Belfast. In the Falls Road area the Army had establishedfull military control and were only now beginning to hand over to police patrols. In the Bogside, however, although there was somepatrolling of the periphery, the Army had never penetrated into thecentre of the area and the police had not exercised control over it fora long time. The GOC (NI) favoured an attempt to re-establishlawful authority in the Bogside on the lines proposed, although henaturally regarded it as essential that the Army should provide
support in the background. There was some difference in approach,however, between the GOC (NI) on the one hand and the NorthernIreland Prime Minister and the Chief Constable of the RUC on theother. The GOC (NI) thought that the operation should be preceded by a period of publicity and negotiation, after which the combinedRUC/RMP patrols would be deployed in strength. MajorChichester-Clark and Sir Arthur Young favoured a gradual build-upof patrols without any preliminaries. Under their proposals, theoperation could begin immediately; but if the GOCs approach wasadopted, the preparations would take about ten days. these differences on tactics and timing were to be further discussed that day at a meeting of the Northern Ireland Security Committee. Meanwhile,it should be feasible to withdraw immediately two of the additionalbattalions which had been sent to Northern Ireland in connectionwith the Orange Day marches. Not only were they urgently requiredelsewhere, but the presence of larger numbers of troops than werestrictly necessary tended to add to the tension. The GOC (NI)considered that he could hold the situation in August with the forces which would then be available to him if the marches were cancelled,as proposed by Major Chichester-Clark. If, however, the marcheswere not cancelled or if attempts were made to hold them in defiance of a ban, one of the two battalions which it was now proposed towithdraw might have to be retained in Northern Ireland or sent backthen.In discussion there was general agreement that the dangers of allowing the situation to drift were at least as great as, if not greaterthan, the risks involved in an initiative on the lines proposed. In any event, the present position in the Bogside could not be allowed tocontinue indefinitely. Subject to the outcome of that day&apos;s discussion in the Northern Ireland Security Committee, it seemed likely that the tactics of gradual penetration of the Bogside advocated by theNorthern Ireland Prime Minister and the Chief Constable were more likely to be successful than the approach suggested by the GOC (NI).It was important that, if the operation in the Bogside was undertaken,it should be strictly related to the main objective of re-establishingGovernment authority in the area and should not comprise a majorsearch for arms. The use of police from Great Britain to re-establishcontrol of the Bogside had been considered; but this would be liableto damage the morale of the RUC and to undermine the sense of independent responsibility which we had been at pains to foster atStormont. A good deal of the trouble arising out of the recentmarches in Londonderry had been due to the contingents fromProtestant Lodges in Scotland, who tended to be more aggressivethan the local Orangemen.   If the marches were not cancelled,
therefore, it would be for consideration whether measures could betaken to reduce or eliminate Scottish participation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewere risks in taking an initiative on the lines proposed; but thesemust be weighed against the dangers of allowing the situation todrift. The arguments were finely balanced; and, by taking actionin the Bogside and banning Protestant marches, we might precipitatereactions which could result in the collapse of both Major Chichester-Clark&apos;s Administration at Stormont and Mr. Lynch&apos;s Governmentin the South. If we were then compelled to take over the governmentof the Six Counties, possibly in the face of the active opposition ofan extremist Protestant faction, we should face a very dangerous situation indeed. Nevertheless, the Cabinet agreed, subject to theresolution of the problems of tactics and timing under discussion inthe Northern Ireland Security Committee, that the balance ofadvantage lay in taking action on the lines proposed by MajorChichester-Clark. The Home Secretary should inform the NorthernIreland Government accordingly; and the Defence Secretary should instruct the military authorities to take the appropriate measures.The Cabinet agreed that, provided that there was no majordeterioration in the situation over the next few days, two of theadditional battalions sent to Northern Ireland in connection with the july marches could be withdrawn early in the following week, as recommended by the military authorities. The position might haveto be reviewed, however, if the August marches in Londonderry werenot cancelled or if there were indications of an attempt to promotethem in defiance of a ban by the Northern Ireland Government.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary toproceed on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up.SECRETPay of the *5.  The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Privy SealHigher Civil (cp (70) 13) about the a of the Higher civil Service and by theServiceLord Chancellor (CP (70) 14) about the salaries of the higher judiciary.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Standing Advisory Committeeon the Pay of the Higher Civil Service (the Plowden Committee) had recommended in their Ninth Report of May, 1969, substantial* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
increases in the pay of the Civil Service grades above the rank ofAssistant Secretary but had reluctantly proposed that the increases should be implemented in three annual stages if the government thought that necessary. The previous Administration had acceptedthe Report in principle, had paid the first stage of the pay increases in July 1969 and had announced in March 1970 their intention of paying the second stage from 1 July, 1970. Arrangements would bemade accordingly unless the Government now chose to reverse their predecessors&apos; decision. The Plowden Committee had made a further report on 16 June. This had recommended that, as was usual, the grades up to and including Assistant Secretary should receive from1 April, 1970 an increase of 8  per cent in parallel with the central pay increase granted earlier in the year to most grades of thenon-industrial Civil Service. It had also recommended the earliestpossible payment of the third stage to complete the implementation of the proposals in the Ninth Report, in order to establish the levels of pay which the Committee had thought right in mid-1969 and toavoid inflicting a further absolute loss of pension on those in their last years of service. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy(EPC) had endorsed in principle his proposal that therecommendation for an increase in the pay of grades up to and including Assistant Secretaries should be accepted; that the second stage of the increases for the grades above that level should be paid asfrom 1 July, the increase for Under Secretaries being calculated at8  per cent rather than 6-2 per cent; that the third stage increases for the Higher Civil Service should be paid from 1 January, 1971;and that these increases should all be announced before the summer recess. EPC had invited him, however, in submitting these proposals to the Cabinet, to deal more fully with their possible repercussions on other groups in the public sector.The recommendations in respect of the Higher Civil Service werejustified on merits. They were based on an independent assessmentby the Plowden Committee, whose report was not susceptible to the type of criticism which could be advanced against the most recent report of the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration(the Kindersley Committee). Even the third stage represented, onthis basis, only the minimal standard necessary to bring the higher civil Service into line with outside salaries in mid-1969; and the rateof wage increases elsewhere had increased substantially since then.Quite apart from the adverse effect on the pension rights of those concerned, it was important to re-establish correct vertical relativitieswithin the Service. There was some disquiet among civil servants,who regarded the present proposals as a test of the new governments attitude; and it was important to retain the goodwill of the staff inSECRET11426 B
relation to the implementation of the reforms recommended by theCommittee on the Civil Service 1966-68 (the Fulton Committee).Although there was a case for implementing the third stageimmediately, it should be possible to persuade the Staff Side toaccept implementation from 1 January, 1971.As regards the salaries of other comparable groups in the public sector, the direct consequential increases for National Health Service(NHS) administrators and the lower judiciary, who had establishedlinks with the Higher Civil Service, should be accepted. While therewas no logical link between the salaries of the Chairmen and membersof the Boards of nationalised industries and those of the higher civil Service, the former had been the subject of an inquiry by theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI), who had recommended a pay increase which was being put into effect in three stages. The last of these would have been brought into effect from april, 1971; but in the circumstances the sensible course would be to implement this increase also from 1 January, 1971.It would be possible to maintain, as regards the higher judiciary,that the appropriate course would be to arrange for their pay to be reviewed in the light of the decisions on the pay of the Higher CivilService either by a new independent body if this could be established in reasonable time or by an ad hoc interdepartmental body reportingto Ministers. Further discussions between the Civil service department and the Lord Chancellor^ Department, however,suggested that it would be reasonable to agree that the salaries inquestion might be increased to  14,000 from 1 January, 1971, with consequential increases for the salary of the Lord Chief Justice andother members of the higher judiciary, including those in Scotland andNorthern Ireland. The NBPI might be asked to carry out an earlyreview of the pay of the senior officers of the Armed Forces, in thelight of the changes for the Higher Civil Service, under the standingreference of Service pay.These increases as a whole would, no doubt, result in pressure for increases in the salaries of Ministers and Members of Parliament;but a review of these should await the establishment of new machineryfor reviewing the most senior and sensitive public service salariesgenerally.The Lord Chancellor said that, if the third stage of the increases proposed by the Plowden Committee were paid to the Higher CivilService in January, 1971, the puisne judges, whose salaries as recently as June 1969, were  1,400 above those of Permanent Secretaries,would fall  2,500 below them. Unless the judges were paid at least the same as Permanent Secretaries from that date, very seriousdissatisfaction would be liable to develop. This would seriouslyjeopardise recruitment at a time when the reforms of the judicial
system required additional manpower. Incomes at the Bar and in industry and commerce were substantially higher than those whichthe judges could command; and there was a danger that existingjudges as well as potential recruits might be attracted to the latter,with far-reaching implications for the impartiality and independence of the judiciary as a whole. He therefore recommended that, if thethird stage increases for the Higher Civil Service were implementedfrom 1 January, 1971, the puisne judges should also receive  14,000from that date, with appropriate increases for the Lord Chief justice and other members of the higher judiciary. Any further review oftheir salaries should take place later as part of whatever general arrangements were made for the review of the most senior andsensitive public service salaries.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The increases proposed for the lower judiciary and the NHSadministrative staff followed an established link. The latter, togetherwith the proposals as a whole, would make it marginally more difficultto persuade the doctors to accept less than full implementation of the Kindersley Report; but no serious repercussions were expected.(b) While there was a case for inviting the NBPI to make an urgent report on the pay of senior Service officers, this had fallenso far behind that of the Higher Civil Service that it might be preferable for a decision on the appropriate increases to be taken without a further reference.(c) It would be possible to resist pressure for an immediatereview of the salaries of Members of Parliament and Ministers, atleast until new machinery had been established for reviewing themost senior public service salaries generally.(d) Senior local government officials might be expected to press for comparable increases. While the Government were not directly involved in such negotiations, the outcome would affect the rate support grant. It might be appropriate, however, to considerwhether the rate support grant might in future take account mainly of the level of total wages and salaries appropriate to the needs ofthe authorities, leaving them more freedom in determining numbers and salary levels within those totals.(e) It would be helpful if more general guidance on incomes policy in the public sector could be made available before a reply tothe teachers&apos; salary claim had to be made in September, particularlyin view of the comparatively low level of salaries for posts of highresponsibility in the teaching profession.(/) Unless coherent arrangements were made for reviewingsensitive salaries in the public sector, proposals would continue to beput forward on differing and unrelated bases, with consequential
leap-frogging among the various groups. Moreover, the impact ofsuch increases on lower-paid workers would be reduced if they were clearly the outcome of established machinery.(g) There would be substantial presentational advantages indelaying the announcement of these increases until after the Courtof Inquiry into the current docks dispute had reported. There was,moreover, no objection to the announcement of the increases duringthe Parliamentary Recess. It would be unfortunate, however, if itwere not possible to announce the Governmenfs decisions on theproposals when the Plowden Report was published; and it would be helpful if the new arrangements for compensation for redundancy inthe Diplomatic Service which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary was discussing with the Lord Privy Seal could be published at the same time.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the proposals by the Lord Privy Seal to extend tothe Assistant Secretary and equivalent grades the central pay increaseof 8^ per cent from 1 April, 1970; to implement the second stage of the increases proposed by the Plowden Committee for civil servantsabove that level from&apos; 1 July, 1970, the increase payable to Under-Secretaries being fixed at 8^ per cent; to pay the remaining third stage increases to both the Higher Civil Service and the chairmen and members of the nationalised industry Boards from 1 January,1971, and to accept the direct consequential increases for the NHSadministrators and the lower judiciary. They also agreed that thepuisne judges should be paid  14,000 from 1 January, 1971, withappropriately adjusted increases for the Lord Chief Justice and othermembers of the higher judiciary including those in Scotland andNorthern Ireland. While there were advantages in referring the pay of the senior Service officers to the NBPI, further consideration should be given to this question by the Secretaries of State for defence and for Employment and Productivity, in consultation with the lord privy Seal. Action to review the salaries of Members of parliament and Ministers should be deferred if possible, at least for some time.No announcement of these decisions need be made beforeParliament rose for the Summer Recess. An announcement shouldbe made, however, when the Plowden Report was published; the precise timing could be considered in the light of developments in the dock strike and the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry. The lord privy Seal might prepare an appropriate statement in consultationwith the Ministers concerned; this should cover the outcome of thefurther consideration being given to the pay of senior officers of the armed Forces and, if possible, of the discussions on compensation.In the meantime, the Lord Privy Seal might consider with the Headof the Home Civil Service whether it would be appropriate to let the
CONFIDENTIALRetail price 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofof milk gtat;e for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food (EPC (70) 7), proposing that the retail price of milk should beraised on 30 August by Id. per pint.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that theprevious Government had increased the guaranteed price for milkat the 1970 Annual Review and had acepted increases in distributors&apos;costs (mainly wages) and profit margins. These had placed additionalcharges on the Milk Fund operated by the Ministry of Agriculture,in which returns from retail sales were balanced against the cost ofthe guarantee to producers and the costs of distribution, any resultantdeficit being met from the Consolidated Fund. The maximum retail price of all grades of milk and the margins at all stages of distributionwere determined by the Government in order to ensure that theconsumer paid no more for milk than was necessary to implement the guaranteed price and to meet reasonable distributive margins.11426General Secretary of the Staff Side of the National Whitley Councilknow in advance what was proposed.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Endorsed the proposals in paragraph 10 (a) to (c) andparagraphs 9 (i) and (ii) of CP (70) 13.(3) Agreed that the salaries of the higher judiciary should beincreased from 1 January, 1971, on the basis indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretaryof State for Employment and Productivity, in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal, to give further considerationto the possibility of referring the salaries of senior officersof the Armed Forces to the NBPI.(5) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider, in consultation withthe Prime Minister, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, the Lord President and the Secretary of Statefor Employment and Productivity, the most appropriatetiming for the publication of the Plowden Report and theform in which the Governments decisions should be announced in a simultaneous public statement.
In the absence of an increase in the retail price the new costs would put the Milk Fund into substantial deficit by the end of the year.While an increase of Id. a pint at the end of September would justcover the increased costs, it would be preferable that the increase should take effect at the end of August. This would yield anadditional  4 - 5 million, which might allow an increase in the producerprice at the next Annual Review to be accommodated without afurther increase in the price to the consumer. Moreover, the soonerthe increase was made, the more clearly it would be seen to be the automatic consequence of decisions taken by the previous government, who had, in fact, already announced that an increase would be needed in the autumn.In discussion it was suggested that, since an increase at the endof September would suffice to balance the Milk Fund, an earlierincrease might be taken as implying that there would be a further increase in producer prices; and, while a modest increase in the costof milk itself could be met from the surplus, there was a danger thatthis would be taken as an invitation to agricultural interests to press for a review of other prices, which had a direct impact on public expenditure. It might also appear contrary to the Governmenfsattitude to other price increases to allow this increase to take place before it became essential merely in order to provide a degree of insurance against future cost increases. On the other hand therewere substantial advantages in an early announcement which wouldmake it clear that the increases were a direct consequence of the policies of the previous Administration. There would, moreover, be advantage in having some funds in hand which might be used toincrease producer prices in the autumn rather than in waiting untilthe normal Annual Price Review, when rather larger increases mighthave to be conceded. The Cabinet would be considering, in thecourse of their review of public expenditure, the future of the existingwelfare milk scheme. Unlike higher milk prices, the withdrawal of welfare milk could be expected to reduce consumption; and milkproducers would be liable to object strongly, unless it were thenpossible to allow them some increase in the producer price.In further discussion the following points were made (a) The Minister of Agriculture was considering whether or not it might be appropriate to review in the autumn the guaranteed prices for beef and cereals as well as the producer price for milk.(b) The price increase for milk would add about  0-5 million a month to the cost of providing milk in primary schools.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the retail price of milk should be increased byId. per pint. There were advantages in arranging for this increase to take effect at the end of August and so providing a small surplus in the Milk Fund which might be available to accommodate an
confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury, (CP (70) 18) about proposals by the national coal Board (NCB) to raise the prices of coking, industrial and electricity coals in order to break even on colliery account in 1970-71and to avoid breaching their statutory deficit limit of  50 million.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that two courses of action were open to the Government. They could permit a price increase which would eliminate the allowance made in the Board&apos;s estimates for the settlement to be reached in the autumn on the miners&apos; currentwage claim; or they could accept a sufficient price increase now toavoid the risk of needing a further increase for at least another year.Successive price increases were damaging; and an increase of 12J percent was the least which offered a reasonable prospect of escapingthe need for a second increase within months. Restricting theincrease to 12^ per cent would also put the NCB under pressure tokeep down the cost of the autumn wage settlement, since they wouldbe informed that the Government did not contemplate legislationallowing them to exceed the present statutory limit on their accumulated deficit and they would be urged to take other actionto reduce costs on the lines indicated in paragraph 9 of CP (70) 18.On the other hand the Government must avoid being placed in theposition of having to subsidise coal consumers from public funds.increase in the producer price either in the autumn or in the courseof the next Annual Price Review. If the Minister of Agriculturedecided that it would be helpful to review the producer price of milkor the guaranteed price for other commodities in the autumn, heshould bring his proposals forward in time for them to be considered as part of the review of public expenditure. In the meantime heshould consider, in consultation with the Lord President, how thedecision to increase the retail price of milk might best be publiclypresented in order that it might be clearly seen to be a directconsequence of decisions taken by the previous Administration.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theLord President, to arrange for the decision to increasethe retail price of milk by Id. per pint to be announced,and the necessary Order to be laid, before Parliament rosefor the Summer Recess.
Higher prices could also help to bring coal demand into betterbalance with coal supply and to encourage the industry to concentrateeffort at the most economic collieries. Coal stocks were expected to fall to low working levels this winter; and we were not well placed to face a miners&apos; strike. It would be unrealistic to make no allowance in current price changes for a wage concession this autumn; and theGovernment lacked powers to control either prices. or wages.Nevertheless, it was important both for the NCB and the NationalUnion of Mineworkers to realise that higher wages must be related to higher productivity.In discussion it was argued that it would be undesirable inprinciple to allow a price increase now which anticipated thesettlement to be made in the autumn on the miners&apos; current wageclaim. If the Government endorsed the proposed increase, theymight be held to have accepted the allowance of 16 per cent which theBoard had included for this settlement; and their acceptance of evena 12^ per cent increase, as proposed in CP (70) 18, would allow fora 10 per cent wage settlement. This might merely weaken the NCB&apos;resolution to secure a lower settlement. It would be especiallyunfortunate if the allowance for increased wages which was includedin whatever price increase the NCB were authorised to put to the consumers&apos; Council should become public knowledge; and theGovernment should in any event ensure that they were dissociatedfrom it.To exclude the provision for impending wage increases altogetherwould be unrealistic; but there was a case for confining any immediateprice increase to, say, 10 per cent in order to compel the NCB to try to confine the wage settlement in the autumn within this limit. Onthe other hand this would be likely to necessitate a second price increase later; and, given the extent of the NCB&apos;s accumulated deficit,it would be difficult on that basis to insist on the conditions suggestedin paragraph 9 of CP (70) 18. The public impact of a 12^ per centprice increase would be little different from that of a 10 per cent increase; and it was of paramount importance to reduce the costsfalling on the Exchequer by way of subsidies to meet avoidabledeficits or to provide unnecessarily high protection for the coalindustry. These issues would need further consideration in the context of the forthcoming Coal Industry Bill and the review of fuel policy which the Minister of Technology already had in hand.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the best course might be to allow the NCB to put their proposals to the Consumer Council, on the clear understandingthat the Government were not committed to endorse them and reserved the right to consider further what increases they would accept.  The National Board for Prices and Incomes were expected
Postal chargesp.to report on the efficiency of the coal industry during the course ofthe next month. Meanwhile, the Minister of Technology shouldmake it clear to the Board that the Government did not necessarilyapprove their proposals; and he should bring forward for separate consideration the consequential effects of higher coal prices on thecharges for electricity and steel. The Cabinet would also wish to giveearly consideration to current measures of coal protection in the lightof the review of fuel policy which the Minister of Technology hadalready put in hand.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister of technology to be guided accordingly in relation to theNational Coal Board&apos;s price proposals.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology to circulate an earlymemorandum on fuel policy and the measures ofprotection and support for coal.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury, (CP (70) 16) about the proposals of the PostOffice Board to increase postal rates by 2d. next January, to 6d. and7d. for second and first-class mails respectively, and to convert thenew charges to 2^p and 3p on decimalisation.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the proposed increases would yield some  130 million in a full year and were necessary to eliminate current and prospective losses on the postal services and toenable the Post Office Board to meet their current financial objective of covering costs and securing a return of an additional 2 per centon their expenditure. Without the increases there would be anaccumulated deficit of  263- 296 million by March, 1973, accordingto whether wage settlements averaged 5^ per cent or 8 per cent perannum; and the shortfall compared with the financial objective wouldbe greater still. Even if no allowance at all were made for futurewage increases, there would be a shortfall of about  250 millioncompared with the financial objective. At current wage rates anincrease of only Id. on postal rates instead of 2d. would leave a shortfall  on target of  107 million. His conclusion was that the PostOffice Board should be authorised to consult the Post Office Users&apos;National Council on their proposals but that, pending the Council&apos;sreport, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications shouldformally reserve the Governments position and, when the increases were eventually agreed,, the Government should state their view thatno further increases in postal tariffs should be needed for at least
another three years. The Minister of Posts and Telecommunicationsmight also wish to consider the need for a longer-term study of the postal services, including their organisation and management, thefuture of the two-tier system and the consequences of possiblecross-subsidisation of postal services from telecommunicationsrevenue. Cross-subsidies tended, however, to lead to a misallocationof resources and had adverse effects on efficiency. If the cost of postal services were not borne by the user, there would be a loss to theExchequer of up to  130 million a year, equivalent to, say, 3d. in the pound off the income tax.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the Government should raise no objection to thePost Office Board putting their proposals to the Post Office Users&apos;National Council. An oral Parliamentary statement on this subject would be undesirable; but the Minister of Posts and telecommunications-cations should consider with the Lord President of the Councilwhether, in response to a written Parliamentary Question, theGovernment could let it be known that the proposals which the PostOffice would be putting to the Council had been formulated by them under the previous Administration and that the Post Office had, ontheir own authority, already put in hand the printing of new stamps.The Post Office claimed to need higher charges even if there was nofurther wage inflation; but, pending further consideration in the lightof the Council&apos;s views, the Government were not to be assumed tohave endorsed the increases proposed by the Post Office Board or tobe committed to them.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister of posts and Telecommunications to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office, SWA,21 July, 1970.
