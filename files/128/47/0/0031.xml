The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP (70) 89) attaching a note by officials on the manpowerwhich would be needed to maintain essential services disrupted by thestrike of local authority manual workers.The Home Secretary said that at their last meeting, the cabinet had asked for an urgent reassessment of the opportunities for anearly Government initiative to maintain or restore essential public services disrupted by the strike; and the note attached to CP (70) 89had been prepared in response to this request. The official committee on Emergencies had considered the note earlier that day and, with some qualifications, had generally endorsed it. the assessment indicated that, provided the use of Servicemen did notalienate supervisory staffs or maintenance workers or otherwise leadto a major extension of the strike, sewage disposal and sewagepumping services could be maintained at those places in Englandwhere water intakes were threatened or there was a risk of sewageflooding, by the use of some 550 drivers, 550 craftsmen and 1,200unskilled men from the Armed Forces, and that offensive quantitiesof rubbish could be removed by the use of a further 100 drivers,200 unskilled men and 100 mechanical equipment operators. Therewould be small additions to these numbers for similar action inScotland and Wales. If local authorities did not co-operate,emergency regulations would be needed to permit the operation byServicemen of plant and equipment; but regulations would not benecessary if the Servicemen went in by invitation of the localauthority. A further 1,000 stokers and 250 drivers would be required if the ancillary workers in National Health Service hospitals, witha parallel pay claim under negotiation, were also to go on strike.The two sides in the manual workers&apos; pay dispute were to meeton 20 October and the outcome could not be predicted. However,if the sewage treatment works at Swindon and Reading went onadding to the pollution of the River Thames, as at present, therewould shortly be a very serious risk to public health, through theeffects on the water supply downstream. He and the Secretaryof State for the Environment proposed later on that date to explainthis situation to representatives of the manual workers&apos; trade unions,and to say that, unless by 20 October there was an assurance that theworkers in question would co-operate in manning the Swindonand Reading sewage works, the Government would have to act, inorder to avert a risk to public health.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that pollutionof the Thames would pose a significant new health hazard, whichCONFIDENTIAL
secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theCanadian authorities had now recovered the dead body ofM. Laporte, the Quebec Minister of Labour, who, together withMr. Cross, the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner in Montreal,had been held as hostage by the Front de Liberation Quebecois(FLQ). But two notes which had been received from Mr. Cross and appeared to be in his handwriting suggested that he was still alive.Despite the murder of M. Laporte, the Canadian Government had decided to maintain their offer to release five so-called political prisoners and to allow the kidnappers to leave the country if mr. Cross were returned. We had been considering whether therewas any further action which we could usefully suggest to theCanadian Government; but we had reached the conclusion that itwould be wrong to press them to offer the FLQ more for the releaseof Mr. Cross than they themselves had been prepared to offer forthe return of both M. Laporte and Mr. Cross, and that we must therefore leave them to deal with the matter as they thought best.The new United Kingdom High Commissioner had now taken up his post in Ottawa and would maintain close contact with theCanadian authorities.It might be necessary in due course to give further considerationto the introduction of some form of financial protection, perhapsOverseaAffairsKidnapping inMontrealPreviousReference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute 1could be averted if the Swindon and Reading sewage works wereoperated with the help of Servicemen. If this situation were put tothe trade unions, they might respond by manning the sewage works,and thus earn themselves some popularity in time for Wednesday^meeting of the two sides in the pay dispute. The same trade unionsrepresented manual workers in the water supply industry, for whom they had submitted a claim for a large increase in pay. On previous occasions, the water supply employers had shown willingness to concede larger pay increases than the local authority employers, andthis year they could argue the need to meet criticisms from theNational Board for Prices and Incomes of their industry&apos;s pay structure. Their capitulation could weaken the resistance of thelocal authority employers. He and the Secretary of State for employment accordingly proposed to see representatives of the waterindustry employers to urge them not to make an inflationary payaward.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statements by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for the Environment.
CM 31 (70)by way of an insurance scheme, for officers of the Diplomatic Servicewho were exposed to hazards of this kind and for their dependants.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that thedecision of the Canadian Government to remain ready, even afterM. Laporte had been murdered, to discuss terms with the FLQand to maintain their earlier offer represented an act of veryconsiderable political courage; and we could hardly press them to go further.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give further consideration to the problems involved inaffording more adequate financial protection to officersof the Diplomatic Service who were exposed toexceptional personal risks and to their dependants.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to review the arrangements forthe protection of the personnel of the Canadian high commission in this country and to consider whether the precautions already in force should be intensified.presentation of DefencePolicyDraft WhitePaperCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of Statefor Defence (CP (70) 87), to which was appended the draft of a white Paper setting out the main decisions which had been taken in fulfilment of the Governmenfs undertakings on defence.The Defence Secretary said that the draft White Paper, whichhad been accepted, subject to minor amendments, by the defence and Oversea Policy Committee on 16 October, summarised the steps which the Government had taken to fulfil their pledge toprovide a continuing military presence in South-East Asia and toimprove the capability of the Armed Services. For the Royal navy the principal measures to be announced were the adoption of the anti-ship guided missile system EXOCET and the decision to retainHMS Ark Royal in service until the late 1970s. For the army the main decisions were to expand the Territorial and ArmyVolunteer Reserve and to retain the Brigade of Gurkhas. The RoyalAir Force would now, as a result of Government decisions, havefour additional squadrons of Jaguar close support aircraft.  It was
proposed that, in order to cater for the convenience of theParliamentary timetable, the White Paper should be published at.30 p.m. rather than 3.30 p.m. on 28 October and to transfer Ministryof Defence Questions in the House of Commons from Wednesday,28 October, to Thursday, 29 October.In discussion there was a general welcome for the defence secretary&apos;s paper. The following main points arose in discussionof the text:(a) It was for consideration whether the reference in paragraph 8of the draft to a consultative commitment in the event of externalattack on Malaysia and Singapore should be more closely alignedwith the formula about &quot; externally-inspired aggression &quot; which hadbeen considered during the Defence Secretary&apos;s recent discussions with the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and singapore.(b) It would be important in presenting the White Paper toemphasise that the substantial results which had flowed from the government&apos;s review of defence policy were solidly based on asearching review of all programmes; and it would therefore benecessary to be ready to exemplify, either in the parliamentary statement or in Press briefings, some of the deferments, referred to inparagraph 40 of the draft, which had been accepted in order to contain the Defence Budget within the published targets.(c) There would inevitably be some comment about the absenceof any decision to accelerate the rate of construction of nuclearhunter/killer submarines. The Conservative Party&apos;s undertaking to reverse the decision on this point which had been taken by theprevious Administration as an economy measure in January 1968had been widely publicised. This undertaking had been madefollowing an appraisal of the financial consequences on the basisof costings provided by the previous Administration, from which ithad appeared that the results of accelerating the rate of constructionfrom one boat in every 15 months to one in every 12 months wouldbe by no means insupportable. The problem had now been examined, however, in the light of detailed information about theeconomics of nuclear submarine construction, the naval manningsituation and competing claims on resources. This information,assessed in the light of expert military advice, had led the defence secretary to the conclusion, which the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee supported, that the rate of nuclear hunter/killersubmarine construction should remain at one every 15 months; andany public criticisms of the Governmenfs action in this regard shouldbe met by a straightforward summary of the facts which led to thedecision.   In the longer term, however, it might be necessary to
CM 31 (70)consider, in conjunction with our allies, whether the plannedsubmarine resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation were likely to be adequate to meet the Soviet threat.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposed White Paper, subject to resolution by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the defence secretary of the drafting point on paragraph 8 which had been raised in discussion. He would himself consider, in conjunction with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, whether there would be value in their discussing with Malaysian Ministers, during the course ofthe forthcoming meeting of the United Nations General assembly in New York, some recent indications that the MalaysianGovernment might be wishing to reconsider the arrangements nowbeing envisaged as a replacement of the Anglo-Malaysian defence agreement.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.SECRETAircraftIndustryAirbuses andthe RB 211Engine    previous reference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute (j*4. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Minister of Technology (CP (70) 77) and a note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (CP (70) 74) covering a report by officials on airbuses and the RB 211 engine.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that therewould be a large world market probably more than a thousandsales for aircraft for the size of the BAC 311 and the EuropeanA300B, and it was reasonable to assume that a substantial share ofthis market would be captured by the BAC 311. The present estimateof the cost to the Government of developing the BAC 311 with anRB211-61 engine was  144 million. The Government could not expect to get back the whole of this outlay even if the upper estimateof assumed sales was achieved. Nevertheless if they wished tomaintain a national aircraft industry capable of manufacturing largecivil subsonic aircraft and large civil aero engines this double projectoffered the best chance of doing so and it would produce considerableearnings of foreign exchange. It would still be possible to maintain an aviation industry in this country if a decision were taken against
the BAC 311 and its engine but our industry would then drop out of major civil aircraft manufacture at a time when the French andGerman Governments were seeking to take over European leadershipin this field from the United Kingdom. He considered that, in any event, the Government expenditure involved would be justified by direct economic benefits but the case for it was greatly strengthened by the importance of maintaining our present position in theEuropean aircraft industry at a time of movement towards an integrated European industry. In his view the Government should therefore support the BAC 311 with its -61 engine. As to theimmediate financial problems of Rolls-Royce, the Cabinet were aware that there had been discussions between the Chancellor and himself and the Governor of the Bank of England and between the latterand Rolls-Royce and various City financial institutions. The upshotof these discussions showed that there were broadly two courses open.The Government could decide to limit its support to Rolls-Royce towhat was needed to complete the -22 engine for Lockheed; if so,they would have to provide nearly all the  60 million required sincethe City institutions had made it plain that they would be willingto provide very little money themselves in these circumstances. Inthis event Rolls-Royce would no longer produce large civil aero engines and its future size and scope would be much diminished.Alternatively, the Government could decide to support the BAC 311and the -61 as well as finding what was required to complete the-22 engine. The City institutions would in these circumstances beprepared to find  20- 25 million towards the salvage of the -22 engineso that the Governmenfs immediate financial commitment would beless but their longer-term commitment would be much more than under the first course. And Rolls-Royce and BAC would have been maintained throughout this decade in the large civil aircraft business.He would be discussing the future of the Concorde project withM. Mondon, the French Minister of Transport on the following day.If a decision were taken today to proceed with the BAC 311 he would feel bound to inform M. Mondon accordingly but if no decision were taken today he could listen to any proposals that the FrenchGovernment might make for participation in the A300B project andreport back. However, progress on the A300B had not beenpromising to date and at this stage in its development the UnitedKingdom aircraft industry could only play a minor role in the project.Hawkey Siddeley Ltd. were already manufacturing wings for theaircraft. The suggested A300B-7 powered by the -61 engine didnot appear to be an attractive proposition: it was most unlikely thatany airline other than BEA would buy this version of the Europeanairbus and BEA put it third in their list of choices after the BAC 311and the Lockheed TriStar. If we attempted at this late stage to get
back into the European airbus project the most we could expectwould be to take over work which Dorniers had recently given up and perhaps some European support for the cost of development ofthe -61 engine.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if they were unableto disengage from Concorde over the next few years and if it were decided now to provide the financial support requested for the bac 311 and -61 engine there was virtually no prospect whatever of achieving the savings in expenditure in support of industry (includingthe aircraft industry) which had been set out in the White Paper on public expenditure which was now with the printers. They must assume in the present context that public expenditure on Concordewould continue long after next March. Although the BAC 311 hadfar better sales prospects than Concorde it was a demonstrablyuneconomic use of national resources and even on the highestestimate of likely sales the Government would not see its investmentback. It was true that there would be substantial earnings of foreign exchange but at a very high resource cost. It was clear that, if theGovernment did not support the -61 engine, Rolls-Royce would nolonger remain a manufacturer of large civil aero engines, but support for the -61 would only keep Rolls-Royce in the &quot; big league &quot; for alimited time until the next project reached the stage at which massiveGovernment support was demanded. In the absence of the BAC 311BE A would buy the Lockheed TriStar with the -22 engine and thusbring considerable assistance to Rolls-Royce. In the past 10 years the Government had provided  74 million of launching aid (excludingaid for Concorde and the -22 engine) and had so far received backonly  6-t million with the hope of a further  22 million to come. Thelatest estimate of total public expenditure on Concorde, the BAC 311,the RB 211-22 and -61 over the four years 1971-72 to 1974-75amounted to nearly  400 million, of which about half would be spenton Concorde. In judging present estimates it should be noted thatthe original estimate of the cost of developing the -22 was  65 million which had now been raised to  138 million.There appeared now to be three courses so far as Rolls-Royce&apos;future was concerned. They could leave the company to go into liquidation which the Government would surely be unwilling to contemplate. They could support the BAC 311 and the -61 engineas well as the -22 as the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was proposing. Or they could limit their assistance to provision withthe City institutions of sufficient finance to complete the -22 engineonly. The Governor of the Bank of England had told him that ifthey supported the BAC 311 and the -61 as well as the -22 engines
the City institutions might find  15- 20 million and, doubtfully, theBank of England might provide another  10 million. So this coursewould involve the Government in expenditure of approximately 40 million on the -22 and at least  150 million on the BAC 311 and-61. (The City institutions would only be prepared to provide 40 million out of the  60 million now required if the Governmentwere prepared to give a commitment that Rolls-Royce would be supported in the big civil aircraft league beyond the BAC 311 andthe -61 engine.) If they decided to provide sufficient support forthe -22 only the City institutions, including the Bank of England,might provide  10 million in all and the Government would have tofind the remaining  50 million perhaps in the form of additionallaunching aid to meet the doubled cost of launching the -61 engine.He invited his colleagues to agree that this last course should beadopted.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that unless the bac 311 and the -61 engine went ahead, neither the United Kingdomairframe industry nor Rolls-Royce would be in a position to take a leading role in a future European aircraft industry. If support forRolls-Royce in the field of big civil engines was limited to the -22and the Olympus, and did not include an engine of the size andtimescale of the -61, it was unlikely that Rolls-Royce would be ablelater in the decade to develop and manufacture the new generation of quiet engines and so to compete in the &quot; big league &quot;. When thisbecame clear, it might in turn throw doubt on the continued viabilityof the firm and even on the strength of our engineering industry as a whole.Moreover, the BAC 311 itself was more promising than manypast projects, and the foreign exchange benefit, both direct and indirect, would prove substantial over the longer term. If we couldnot afford both the Concorde and the BAC 311, it would be preferable to drop the former which was most unlikely to providethe basis for a successful large-scale industry in the long term.On the other hand it was argued that it would be wrong for theGovernment to commit both its own funds and national resourcesover a number of years to a project which even on optimisticassumptions would be unprofitable. Moreover, it was clear that therewould be formidable difficulties in withdrawing from Concorde inMarch 1971. The cost of both Concorde and the BAC 311 projectwould severely limit the Governmenfs room for manoeuvre in other fields, and there were already substantial new claims on public expenditure and resources coming forward such as the Thamestidal barrier and the post-Apollo space programme for which no provision had yet been made in public expenditure programmes to
CM 31 (70)1974-75. The long-term future of the British aircraft industry couldonly be secured by an early merger between the two existing airframefirms, and then their association and that of Rolls-Royce in a european airframe and aero-engine industry. The BAC 311 projectwould delay moves to that end. It would not strengthen the long-term position of Rolls-Royce, whose weaknesses must inevitablybecome public knowledge whatever decision the Government nowtook, while competition between the BAC 311 and the A300B mustdamage the European aircraft industry as a whole. If, however,research and early development of the quiet engine were continued,that together with its military and other civil work would give Rolls-Royce a strong basis for negotiation with European firms; the rb 211-61 would have represented only a small proportion of the firm&apos;s total workload. Withdrawal from the -61 project would relieve the strain on the firm&apos;s technical as well as its managerial andfinancial resources, and funding the -22 would buy time for a fullreview of its future as a whole. The scepticism evident in the Cityabout the long-term viability of Rolls-Royce as a manufacturer oflarge civil engines should be respected, but in view of the largeexisting commitments of City institutions to Rolls-Royce and to theAirholdings/Lockheed TriStar arrangement, they should be pressed to provide a substantial contribution to the completion of the -22.The alternative of allowing Rolls-Royce to go into liquidation wasnot really open, in view of the high cost of the indemnity toLockheeds, the effect on the defence programme, and the risk of a united States takeover.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be preferable to delay a decision until the latest attitude of the French Governmentto Concorde and the likelihood of France and Germany being prepared to offer us a really substantial share in the A300B projecthad been established, and until further consideration had been givento the future structure of the British aircraft and aero-engine industryand its collaboration with European companies. On the other hand it was pointed out that Rolls-Royce would be forced into liquidationif no assurances of support were forthcoming in the next few days,and that the British Aircraft Corporation had stated that they werenot prepared to continue work on the BAC 311 beyond the end ofOctober without a promise of Government financial support. Anyshare that might be offered to Britain at this late stage in the A300Bproject would be too small to be worthwhile, and the prospectivemarket for the A300B-7 with a Rolls-Royce engine would be much too small to provide an adequate basis for launching the -61 engine.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that sufficient support must be provided to enable
Rolls-Royce to complete the -22 engine for Lockheed. On the otherhand they were not agreed on the proposal to support the BAC 311aircraft and the -61 engine. A number of Ministers considered thatthe country could not afford to commit national resources on thescale proposed to a further uneconomic project; nor the public expenditure, unlikely in the end to be less than  200 million,particularly since it looked increasingly unlikely that Concorde wouldbe cancelled in March. Long-term massive commitments of thiskind would remove the room for manoeuvre in public expenditure which was required and for which they had laboured successfullyover the past few months. Others considered that the project offered the best chance of maintaining a strong United Kingdom aircraft industry which would be able to negotiate satisfactory terms in thecreation of a European industry, and that the expenditure was accordingly justified. The Cabinet would wish to resume their consideration of this complex of issues early in the following week.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should, in the courseof his forthcoming discussions with M. Mondon, try to establish asclearly as possible both the French attitude to the Concorde project and the nature of any proposals they and the Germans might have for a British share in the A300B project. In the meantime, however,the Chancellor of the Exchequer should tell the Governor of theBank of England that the Government were prepared to provide further launching aid for the -22 engine on the basis that the Citywould make a substantial contribution to the salvage operations;that no decision had been taken on the BAC 311 and -61 projects, butthe City were expected to contribute both in their own commercial interests and in the national interest. The minimum possibleassurances on the funding of the -22 should be given to enable Rolls-Royce to avoid liquidation before final decisions on the other projects could be reached.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry andthe Minister of Aviation Supply, to make arrangements with the Governor of the Bank of England to provide thenecessary support for completion of the RB 211-22 engineonly, on the lines indicated in the summing up of thediscussion by the Prime Minister.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tobe guided in his further discussions with M.

CM 31 (70)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (70) 88), to which was annexed a draftGreen Paper on Select Committees.The Lord President said that the draft Green Paper had beenprepared in discharge of the undertaking which he had given duringthe Debate on the Address that the Government would continue the comprehensive review of the results of the specialist committeeexperiment which had been instituted by the previous Administration,taking account of the recommendations of the Select Committee on procedure for transforming the Estimates Committee into an expenditure Committee, and would bring proposals before the Housewhen it returned from the summer Recess, so that it should havethe opportunity to express its own views before any new system was introduced. It was necessary in this matter to preserve a nice balance between the power of the Executive and that of Parliament, and toavoid aggrandising Select Committees to the point where they wouldthreaten the authority of proceedings on the Floor of the House.In his judgment, and that of the Ministerial Committee on parliamentary Procedure, the proposals in the Green Paper struckthe right balance and should be generally acceptable to the House.They envisaged retention of the Select Committees on Science and technology, on Race Relations and Immigration and on scottish affairs, and the transforming of the Estimates Committee into an expenditure Committee able to consider the projections of public expenditure, though on a smaller scale than had been proposed bythe Select Committee on Procedure. The main problem outstandingwas how best to arrange for completion of the inquiries on which theSelect Committees considering the Education Departments and theMinistry of Overseas Development had been engaged at the time ofthe Dissolution. Given the political pressures, he could see no alternative to setting up a Select Committee simply to complete the inquiry into overseas aid. But he now proposed, after consultationwith the Secretary of State for Education and Science, to take adifferent line in respect of the unfinished inquiry into teacher training and to say that the evidence taken by the Select Committee wouldbe made available to the Committee of Inquiry which theGovernment had announced their intention of setting up; accordingly the Select Committee would not be reappointed. He sought theauthority of the Cabinet to publish the draft Green Paper, modified in this respect, during the present week; its publication would, he hoped, do something to counter accusations that the Government
aimed to strengthen the power of the Executive at the expense ofParliament.The Cabinet Approved the draft Green Paper annexed to CP (70) 88,subject to the modification mentioned by the lord president.Fuel policy the EnergyScenePreviousReference :CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 7CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (CP (70) 80) on fuel policy and prospects.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that britain was moving from a fuel economy based on two fuels to one basedon four. Successive Governments had paid particular attentionto energy because of its basic importance to the community andthe national economy. But they had sought to moderate the pace of change that would have occurred as a result of competitive forcesalone, in order to manage the run-down of the coal industry and toencourage the use of the new indigenous fuels, natural gas and nuclear power, rather than imported oil. The fuel policy measurescurrently in force included the duty on heavy oil, a virtual ban on coal imports, and control over the fuelling of new power stations and over the conversion of existing coal-fired stations to other fuels.Under the Coal Industry Act, 1967, which expired in March 1971,there were also powers, which were no longer in use, to subsidisethe use of extra coal by the gas and electricity industries. He wouldbe reviewing a number of aspects of energy policy; and it would be his aim to limit Government intervention in the supply and use of energy to the few broad measures needed to insure against fuelscarcity and to promote a satisfactory relationship between prices and costs. The present level of support for coal should be reduced;but, because of the short-term difficulties in equating supply withdemand and major uncertainties in the future outlook we needed tomove gradually, keeping watch on the balance between supply and demand and taking account of the possible impact on the coalindustry and miners&apos; morale. He did not propose renewing theexisting powers under the Coal Industry Act to subsidise extra coaluse by the gas and electricity industries and to subsidise the national coal Board (NCB) for deferring colliery closures; but he proposedto say publicly, as a reassurance to the miners, that the Governmentwould consider sympathetically the reintroduction of measures of thiskind if, contrary to present expectations, a real need for them should arise. He also proposed gradually to reduce the electricity industry&apos;s
CM 31 (70)dependence on coal by allowing the conversion of coal-fired power stations to oil or gas where appropriate, and to examine the scope for gradual easement of the ban on coal imports, particularly ofcoking coals and other special types such as solid smokeless fuelswhich were at present scarce. Few imports, however, were likelyto be available in the near future. Continued power to help themen most severely affected by the continuing contraction of the coalindustry was essential to his general strategy; and the forthcomingCoal Bill should therefore extend until March 1974 the Governmenfspowers to pay special compensation to redundant miners and tocontribute (on a reducing scale) to NCB social costs. He would be putting detailed proposals to the Ministerial Committee on economic policy. He invited his colleagues to endorse his general approach to developing a more competitive framework for energy; to take note that he would be reviewing the present strategy for nuclear powerand other possible action to improve our ability to cope with a suddensurplus or scarcity of fuel; and to agree his proposals for graduallyreducing the support for coal demand and for the forthcoming CoalBill.The Home Secretary, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet endorsed the approach in CP (70) 80 and agreed that, in theforthcoming Coal Bill, provision should be made to pay specialcompensation to redundant miners for a further period and to makea reducing contribution to NCB social costs until March 1974. Theynoted the further studies which the Secretary for Trade and industry had in hand on nuclear strategy and measures of insurance againstthe risk of coal surplus or scarcity. Because of their wider economicand public expenditure implications, the Chancellor of the exchequer should be kept in touch with these studies and with the further development of energy policy generally. The detailed content of theCoal Bill should be settled by the Ministerial Committee on economic policy; and the Bill should be made ready for presentation toParliament as soon as possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Home Secretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved the proposals in CP (70) 80.Cabinet Office,20 October, 1970.
