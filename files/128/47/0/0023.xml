Situation inthe middle east(previous reference:CM (70) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1)121568a secret*1. The Prime Minister, reviewing development since the cabinet&apos;s last meeting, said that, in view of the initial refusal bythe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to acceptBritish medical assistance and relief, we had decided to act independently. An initial consignment of 2\ tons of medical supplieshad been flown into Amman; and others had followed. The ICRCwere now adopting a more co-operative attitude, and had agreedto the despatch of a British field hospital and surgical unit.Meanwhile, food was running short; and the ICRC were attempting to arrange supplies. Some foodstuffs were already being lifted inby air; but the scale of the problem was such that supplies wouldhave to be organised on an international basis and brought in byship to Aqaba.Of the 38 hostages retained by the Fedayeen after the liberation of the British, German and Swiss nationals, 32 had been released and had now left Jordan. The six still remaining were reported tohave been handed over by the Fedayeen to the custody of the Embassyof the United Arab Republic (UAR) in Amman. The circumstances in which the Fedayeen had freed these individuals were not clear.But their deliverance might be due, at least in part, to the fact that early on 22 September, the day fixed for the holding in Cairo ofa Summit Conference of Arab Governments, he had sent a personal and private message to President Nasser of the UAR, suggesting that both the United Kingdom and the UAR should seek to makea fresh start as regards relations between them and urging him forthis purpose to take advantage of the Summit Conference to ensurethe transfer of the hostages to a place of safety as a preliminary to negotiations for their exchange against the seven prisoners in european hands. This message had been acknowledged by PresidentNasser; but no substantive reply had been received until27 September. On that day, however, 32 of the remaining hostageshad been released, reportedly through the good offices of the UARGovernment; and HM Ambassador in Cairo had been told by the uar authorities at the same time that President Nasser was nowin a position to arrange an exchange of the remaining hostages ifwe and the German and Swiss Governments were prepared to return the Fedayeen prisoners whom we held. The UAR government wished for confirmation that our offer still stood; and, afterconsultation with the German and Swiss Governments, we had informed them that this was so. The matter had subsequently beenconsidered at a meeting of Ministers directly concerned on the afternoon of 27 September.  It had been concluded that President
Nasser&apos;s intervention placed us, together with the German and SwissGovernments, under a clear moral obligation to carry out the termsof the bargain. Moreover, HM Representatives in the Middle Easthad drawn urgent attention to the dangerous and far-reachingconsequences for British interests in the area if Leila Khalid werenot released as soon as the hostages reached safety. It was there for every desirable to remove her from this country as quickly as possible,particularly in view of the risk that, if her departure were delayedmuch longer, the Government of Israel might seek her extraditionor an attempt might be made to apply for a writ of habeas corpuson her behalf.It was to be hoped that the German and Swiss Governments,despite the difference between their practical circumstances and ours,would take the same view as ourselves of the moral obligationinvolved. But, even if they did not, we ourselves should returnLeila Khalid as soon as confirmation had been received that theremaining six hostages had reached a place of safety outside jordan and had been positively identified. The United States Governmenthad been informed of this decision but had not so far commented on it. The German and Swiss Governments had been consulted andhad also been informed that we would be prepared to transport theirprisoners on the RAF aircraft on which we should be returningLeila Khalid, provided that they supplied the guards to accompanythem. Initially, they had been disposed to accept our views: butsubsequently they had shown some hesitation, doubtless because they wished to ascertain the attitude of the United States Government.Moreover, the constitutional position of the Swiss Government was complicated by the fact that their prisoners were in the custody of thecantonal government of Zurich, which would have to agree to their release. The Federal German Cabinet were now considering thematter: and we could only await the final decisions of both governments, together with confirmation from the Government ofthe UAR that they were in fact prepared to accept an arrangement on the lines which we proposed. Meanwhile, the Government of israel had not so far been informed of our intentions.In discussion the Cabinet endorsed the action taken by themeeting of Ministers on the previous day. We had a clear obligationto President Nasser to carry out our part of the bargain. While itwould be desirable to carry the German and Swiss governments with us if we could, we should not be deterred from actingindependently either by failure to secure their concurrence or by any objections which might be raised by the Governments of the UnitedStates and Israel.The President of the Board of Trade said that in the course ofa search of passengers boarding a British Overseas Airways
SECRET*2. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet to which was attached a situation report by Treasury officials on public expenditure (CP (70) 58).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet had agreed that a saving of  1,000 million should be made in public expenditure in 1974-75 in addition to any net saving in that yearresulting from the abolition of investment grants. With this savingpublic expenditure would still be expanding at 3 per cent per annum and they would be several hundred million pounds short of the savings required by 1972-73 in order to carry out their electionpledges to reduce taxation. Success in their present objective might still leave them in due course with the difficult political decision whether to provide for reductions in personal taxation by increases in indirect taxation. Moreover, if all the proposals now before themfor additional expenditure were implemented the net reduction in public expenditure would be no more than a wholly inadequate 100- 150 million in 1971-72 and  250- 300 million in 1974-75.The scope for a reduction in taxation in any year did not depend upon the size of the Budget surplus forecast for that year. TheBudget surplus (or deficit) in any year was determined by the degreeof restraint judged necessary in order to contain total demand inrelation to total national output. An increase in savings reduced thedemand on national resources and thus increased the scope for reducing taxation. He was considering whether effective newincentives could be devised to encourage a higher level of personalsaving but experience suggested that the main determinants of savingwere confidence in the future value of the pound and in the futurestrength of the economy as a whole.In discussion it was suggested that it was unlikely that theGovernment would in practice be able to achieve their objective of reducing public expenditure by  1,000 million a year by 1974-75and it would therefore be prudent now to examine alternativestrategies in case of failure.   On the other hand there was wideCorporation aircraft in New York early that day two passengers hadbeen found in possession of revolvers and hand grenades. Theaircraft had been delayed but had now landed safely in this country.The two passengers had held United States passports; but they had so far refused to make a statement.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and thePresident of the Board of Trade.
agreement that the Governmenfs objective must be achieved and thatthe present difficulties were in part a consequence of someDepartments accepting too readily that it was necessary to continueactivities and expenditure which had been started by the previous administration.The Cabinet then considered the items listed under Sections Aand B of the report attached to CP (70) 58. They first consideredmemoranda by the Minister of Technology (CP (70) 52) and theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP (70) 62) about proposed reductions in public expenditure by the Ministry of Technology. They also had before them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP (70) 53)on Accounting Conventions.Ministry of The Minister of Technology said he had agreed to reduceTechnology expenditure under his Departments votes by  100 million and thenet requirement of public funds for his Departments nationalised industries by  50 million in 1974-75. The required reduction inVote expenditure would mean cutting down the present level to a half over four years; inevitably the major part of the savings must come from the larger projects of assistance, for the aircraft industry,through the Industrial Re-organisation Corporation (1958-59) and theUnited Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (sea). A carefulassessment would be needed to determine the precise activities to bereduced, and special arrangements would be needed to deal with the potential staff redundancies, particularly in the sea. It was accordingly necessary for the present to limit consideration to thegeneral areas within which the cuts should be sought. For aircraft projects, he had tentatively postulated a saving of  20- 25 million:but it was impossible for him to give the assurance sought by theChancellor in CP (70) 62 that this saving could be made regardless ofwhat might be decided on Concorde or on support for the BAC-311.The Chancellor had also argued that is was unreal to take credit for a saving of  40 million on the 1958-59, since nothing had been includedin the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESO figures.However, this sum would have been expended in 1974-75 under thearrangements envisaged by the previous Administration. Hisproposalto save  15 million on sea expenditure on the nuclearprogramme would require consultation with the electricity supply industry and plant manufacturers to establish the proportions inwhich each could reasonably be expected to bear additional expenditure: it must be recognised that these additional costs would ultimately have to be borne by the consumer of electricitythrough higher charges. On other assistance to industry, includingtechnological support and industrial research, he would be aiming to save  15- 20 million; he had assumed, however, that expenditure under the Local Employment Acts would need to continue at leastat the planned level, but if there were to be any increase on grounds
of regional policy that would need to be financed from the savingsexpected from abolishing investment grants, and not from further reductions in his Departments other Vote expenditure. A further 5 million could be saved on his Vote by relieving him of theresponsibility for financing that part of his Departments industrial and aero-space research which was done on behalf of otherDepartments. This was, in his view, of lower priority than muchof the research carried out for industry. Finally, his estimate for1974-75 included  10 million for other industrial and aircraft projects which were bound to come forward within four years but could not yet be identified: to delete this, as the Chancellor had suggested, would in his view be unrealistic.In respect of nationalised industry investment, he proposed toreduce the net call on public funds by  50 million in 1974-75,principally by means of seeking alternative sources of finance,whereas the Chancellor wished the total demand on resources to bereduced by  50 million through cuts in the investment programmesthemselves. He agreed that it was incumbent upon the Governmentto see that the industries&apos; investment was realistically based andto keep them under some pressure. But it would be shortsightedto reduce their investment in a way which risked leaving these basic industries short of capacity at a time when we were seeking economic expansion which would increase the demands made on them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the target saving of 1,000 million on projected public expenditure in 1974-75, on whichthe Cabinet had agreed in July, already allowed for a  40 millionsaving on funds for 1958-59. There was no provision for such expenditure in 1974-75 at present: this so-called saving would thuscontribute nothing to their target. Of the remaining  60 millionsaving from the Ministry of Technology&apos;s Vote expenditure, the  20- 25 million offered in respect of aircraft projects was uncertain,and  5 million was to be found by transferring researchexpenditure to the Votes of other Departments; and the Ministersought an extra  10 million in respect of unidentified industrial and aircraft projects which, if they justified it, should properly be leftto complete in due course for a share in the contingency reserve.In sum, therefore, the Ministers proposals would provide firm savings of only  25 million on Vote expenditure. He also proposed to save 50 million on funds needed for nationalised industry investmentprimarily by finding alternative sources of financing it, rather than from real reductions in programmes or the disposal of some existingassets to the private sector. To reduce the pressure of demand and provide scope for tax reductions a saving was needed and not merelya change in the method of raising the finance required. But in fact the Minister now put total investment requirements for his
nationalised industries some  70 million higher than at the start of the Public Expenditure Review, in addition to the further  25million for loans to British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the Radio-Chemical Centre Limited, now transferred to a nationalised industry from Vote expenditure. Thus, on the Ministers figures, even after a  50 million saving had been made, nationalised industryrequirements would be  45 million higher than had been allowed for.Part of this increase would be for an acceleration of investment byBritish Steel Corporation: the case for this had yet to be examined and meanwhile no allowance should be made for it. In his view,it would be wrong to exempt the investment programmes of nationalised industries from the cut in public expenditure and weshould seek a substantial real reduction in the programmes of theorder of  50 million in 1974-75. On Vote expenditure, if hiscolleagues accepted that the Minister should take credit for the  40million which would not be spent in 1974-75 on 1958-59, it would bethe more necessary to have firm proposals for a genuine furthersaving of  60 million in that year.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that it should bepossible to reduce expenditure by the Ministry of Technology by1974-75 by more than  60 million a year (in addition to the decision not to provide additional funds for the 1958-59. It was the government&apos;s policy that industry should as far as possible meet its own needswithout financial assistance from the Government; this should bemade possible by cutting taxation which, in turn, was only possible if public expenditure was reduced. On the other hand it was argued that a substantial part of the Ministry&apos;s expenditure was committed to selective assistance to the development areas under the local employment acts; continuation of this was an important part of theGovernments regional policy with its swing away from unselectiveassistance through investment grants and the regional employment premium. The Cabinet would shortly need to reach decisions on certain aircraft projects; if these were to be continued, so must muchof the expenditure on civil aircraft work at the Royal aircraft establishment and in the Ministry of Technology itself. As for research generally, it was agreed that the research being undertaken with Government funds required review as a whole. While someresearch was valuable, and indeed cost saving, some did not seemto be justified, whoever undertook it; more might be of some value,but not of such high priority as to justify Government assistance.In any event, research of direct interest to industry should beundertaken mainly if not wholly by industry. The Governmentshould support only research of direct departmental interest and fundamental research. On the other hand it was argued that it wouldbe wrong to reduce sharply the Governments contribution to applied research while allowing expenditure by the research councils to go
121568on increasing. It was, however, noted that future expenditure on the research councils would be included in the review of government research and development activities which the Lord Privy Seal hadbeen invited to undertake. It would be appropriate in that reviewto consider a further reduction in the budgets beyond that which hadalready been agreed. On specific items of expenditure on researchit was agreed that the possibility of disbanding the Torry ResearchStation should be investigated. It was, however, argued that theWater Pollution Laboratory performed an essential function; it wouldnot be possible to cover the cost of its essential work within theprovision for environmental services in view of the  10 million cutwhich had already been agreed in this expenditure. The transfer ofresponsibility for the Laboratory from the Ministry of Technologywould not, therefore, produce any real savings.In further discussion it was argued that there should be substantial scope for real reductions in the investment programmes of the Ministry of Technology nationalised industries. Both the gasand electricity industries had planned their investment with the need to provide a margin of capacity much more prominently in mindthan the need to limit their demand for capital and to use it effectively.The British Steel Corporation (BSC) should both speed up the closure of old works and arrange to dispose of assets which were not essentialto the main business, including some steel making activities. Onthe other hand it was argued that the costs of the BSC were at presentinflated by the delayed delivery of new plant which had required itto retain obsolescent works in use. Its cost reduction programme as well as the need for increased capacity would call for increasedinvestment. As for the nationalised industries generally, it wouldbe more appropriate to reduce the burden on the Exchequer by raisingfunds for investment on the market than to reduce actual investment in basic industries essential to the faster growth of the economy.However, it was pointed out that unless the Government guaranteedthe borrowing of the nationalised industries, it would be more expensive for them to raise funds from the private sector than fromthe National Loans Fund. A reduction in the central Governmenfsborrowing requirement which was not accompanied by a reduction in real demand on resources and in the overall public sector borrowing requirement made no contribution to the scope for reducingtaxation.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The nationalised industries as a whole had substantialland holdings which in many cases were derelict or under-used.The possibility of undertaking a special review of public sector landholdings with the help of the team of businessmen was underdiscussion with the Departments concerned.
(/;) The opportunities which would arise in the near future for reviewing the top management of the major nationalised industries should be used to ensure that they gave priority to industrial and commercial efficiency.(c) The changes in the investment grant system which theCabinet would be considering later in the week might enable a furthernet saving to be made on assistance to industry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the fact that additional funds would not berequired for the 1958-59 in 1974-75 might be taken into account. TheMinister of Technology should, however, find at least a further 60 million reduction in the vote expenditure of his Department by1974-75. Many of the projects in hand or coming forward forconsideration, such as the BAC-311 and RB-211, might be desirable.But we could not afford everything that was desirable and, in general,it was right to expect industry to stand on its own feet. There wasa very real need to reduce Government expenditure on research bothby cutting out projects, including those which were desirable but not essential, and by requiring industry to finance much more of theapplied research from which it benefited. The Lord Privy Seal inthe review of expenditure on research and development which hewas undertaking should consider the possibility of a further reductionin the research councils&apos; budgets. It was, however, important toensure that suitable arrangements were made for those maderedundant as a result of reductions in expenditure. As for the nationalised industries, the Cabinet felt that their investment programmes had been allowed to get out of control. Officials shouldbe invited to report urgently on how the investment programmes ofthe Ministry of Technology nationalised industries might be reducedby  50 million in 1974-75. Any proposals for additions to theseinvestment programmes, such as the  70 million to which the Ministerof Technology had referred, would have to be considered on their merits at the appropriate time. No allowance should be made forthem now.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed that the current estimates for vote expenditure ofthe Ministry of Technology for 1974-75 should be reducedby  60 million after account had been taken of the factthat additional funds would not be required for the 1958-59.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Technology, to arrange for officials tomake recommendations, for consideration by the Cabineton 13 October, for a reduction of  50 million in 1974-75
in the investment programmes of the nationalised industries for which the Ministry of Technology was responsible.(4) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State forScotland, to give further consideration to the disbandment of the Torry Research Station.The Cabinet (5) Endorsed the proposal for reductions amounting to  2 million in 1971-72 and  5 million in 1974-75 in the expenditureof the Research Councils.(6) Agreed that consideration should be given to further cutsin the Research Councils&apos; budgets in the course of the review of the Government research and developmentactivities which the Lord Privy Seal had been invited toundertake.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications (CP (70) 49).The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that thepresent target rate of return on net assets of the telecommunicationsbusiness of the Post Office was 10 per cent. He proposed that itshould be increased to between 11 and 12 per cent from mid-1972.The practical consequences would be an increase in the price of telephone services of about 10 per cent in mid-1972 instead of oneof 5 per cent in March 1973. The Post Office would by this meansbe able to finance more of their investment programme from revenue and as a consequence of higher prices there might also be a marginalreduction in the investment programme itself. The Post Office&apos;sborrowings from the National Loan Fund would be reduced byabout  70 million a year. He would not authorise the resultant price increases without prior consultation with his colleagues. He also proposed to ask the British Broadcasting Corporation and theIndependent Television Authority to make savings of  1-7 million and  0 - 9 million respectively in their capital expenditure programmesover the period 1972-73 to 1974-75. But a part of these savings would probably be offset by the provision of about  2 million for theestablishment of a supervisory authority for commercial radio andthe need to reduce the present levies payable by the independent television companies. He was considering the future of the Giro,the National Data Processing Service and Cable and Wireless Limited,and would be making recommendations in due course.In discussion it was argued that it was inconsistent with government policy to increase the target rate of return on the Post
Office&apos;s assets and at the same time to authorise price increases sothat the higher return could be achieved without any additionaleffort. The Post Office should be informed that the target rate of return on assets was being raised as proposed by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications and that the Post Office must aim to produce a higher return without raising prices.The Cabinet (7) Approved CP (70) 49 on the understanding that the PostOffice would be given no undertaking that they would beauthorised to increase prices in order to meet the highertarget rate of return on net assets employed intelecommunications.(8) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications to circulate his proposals on the future of the Giro, theNational Data Processing Service and Cable and WirelessLimited to the Economic Policy Committee.The Cabinet (9) Approved all the reductions proposed in Sections A and b of the report attached to CP (70) 58 subject to the decisionsrecorded in (2), (3) and (7) above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28 September, 1970.
