The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Minister of Technology (CP (70) 77) and a note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (CP (70) 74) covering a report by officials on airbuses and the RB 211-61 engine. They also had before! thema memorandum by the Prime Minister (CP (70) 91), setting out certainconsiderations affecting the aircraft projects before the Cabinet,together with a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP (70) 92),covering a report by the Minister of Aviation Supply on thediscussions with French, German and Dutch Ministers about theA300B European Airbus project.The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinefs previous discussion the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and theMinister of Aviation Supply had met representatives of the French,German and Dutch Governments, who had put forward proposalsfor the re-entry of the United Kingdom into the consortium buildingthe A300B European Airbus. Discussions with the three governments were to be resumed on the following day. There had also been further discussions with the Governor of the Bank ofEngland, in the course of which it had emerged that the City werenot at present prepared to contribute to the  60 million necessaryto complete the RB 211-22 engine unless the Government were committed to providing assistance for further aero-engine projects.In considering these complex issues the Cabinet should have in mind that the total net cost of undertaking the BAC 311 project and continuing with the Concorde, from which it seemed likely to bevery difficult to withdraw, would amount to over  100 million ayear for the next three years. The total future commitment to these projects would be of the order of  400 million. Past experience of cost escalation varied; but it would be unrealistic to expect thepresent estimates not to be exceeded. The cost of the projectscould not be contained within the reduced totals for expenditure ontechnology and industry shown in the White Paper &quot; New policies for Public Spending&quot; (Cmnd. 4515) which was being published that day. The BAC 311-61 would therefore have to compete with other claims on the unallocated contingency reserve. These, however,already exceeded the sum allotted for 1971-72 and came close tothose for the later years. The immediate importance of the BAC 311and the RB 211-61 projects for the future of the British aircraft corporation (BAC) and Rolls-Royce should not be exaggerated; evenby 1974 they would form only a small part of the rapidly increasingworkload of the two firms.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thenew element in the situation was the proposal by the three european governments that we should rejoin the A300B project. The terms offered, however, were unattractive. The capital cost would belower than that of the BAC 311; but the net return might be worse.The critical problem was the sales prospect for the A300B as a whole and for the Rolls-engined version in particular. The otherGovernments had originally proposed that airlines should be whollyfree to choose the engine which they preferred; but they hadeventually agreed to consider a formula under which the participating governments would use their influence to ensure that their nationalairlines reflected in their purchasing policies the importance ofmaintaining a European aero-engine, as well as a European airframe,industry. If they agreed to adopt such a formula, they might perhaps be relied upon to ensure that it was carried out, provided that therewas no delay in the development and production of the -61 engine.If, however, as seemed only too likely, there was some delay, theprospects for a Rolls-engined version were poor even on the basisof such an assurance. In the light of the most probable terms ofany final offer on the A300B, therefore, the BAC 311 was still themost promising project. It did, however, involve very substantialpublic expenditure. If this was unacceptable, to re-enter the A300Bconsortium would be preferable to deciding against participation in either airbus project, since it would at least provide the UnitedKingdom industry with a better basis for participation in a unitedEuropean industry, in which its long-term future lay.In discussion it was suggested that successive Governments had supported uneconomic aircraft projects as the only way ofmaintaining an advanced aircraft industry. But this policy had not succeeded in making the industry enterprising and efficient; and on balance it had probably had an adverse effect on the economy. Solong as this policy was maintained the industry would not seek toreadjust itself to the necessity of operating in future on a Europeanbasis; nor would managements give their full attention to thepossibility of finding profitable projects. While the -22 engineshould be supported unless or until it became clear that Lockheedswere unable to fulfil the contract for the TriStar aircraft in which itwas to be incorporated, we could not afford the BAC 311 projecteven if we ignored the risk of cost escalation, particularly since itgave no assurance for the long-term future of the industry andmight both delay and make more difficult its Europeanisation.Moreover, it was not clear why an industry, which would not inany event rely on this project to any significant extent for some years,could not be satisfactorily reshaped on the basis of its other work,including major military projects, while still retaining the capacity to re-enter the market for large civil aircraft as part of a
reconstructed European industry. Similarly, the A300B, while lessopen to objection on the grounds of delaying the reshaping of theindustry, would continue the tradition of support for uneconomicprojects which we could not afford. For these reasons the right course was to refrain from becoming involved in either project.On the other hand there would be no major market in the next decade for civil aircraft other than the Concorde, the Longhaulaircraft and the trijets which the American firms now dominated -apart from the use of the -22 engine in the Lockheed TriStar andthe airbuses. If we neither built the BAC 311 nor participated inthe A300B, the opportunities to compete over the next few years would have been lost. Even the A300B might not enable us tomaintain the design capacity to undertake a subsequent major civilproject or to contribute to a future European grouping. Moreover,there could be no certainty that the resources which would be released if the projects were not undertaken would be re-employedin ways which earned so much foreign exchange.In discussion of the A300B project there was general agreement that the proposal as submitted by the European Governments was unacceptable. It seemed unlikely that the airlines would voluntarilybuy a Rolls-engined version, especially since neither we nor theother Governments had power to commit our airlines to so doing.At best we might hope for some clearer commitment to try to persuade them to do so; but it was arguable whether there was any real prospect of a market adequate to justify launching the -61engine. If 250 A300Bs were sold, 100 with Rolls engines, the net loss would be of the order of  65 million. While sales should be larger if there were no competing BAC 311 and the Governmenfscontribution might be of the order of only  85 million as against 144 million for the BAC 311, the project would almost certainly beeven more unprofitable. It would, however, provide a basis for themore rapid development of a united European industry.In further discussion the following points were made :(a) While Rolls-Royce were not yet insolvent, they were thought to be on the verge of placing orders for which they could not expect to be able to pay without further assistance. In order to avoidliquidation they needed to have sufficient assurance of support toenable them to continue trading and to be able to make a public statement on the following Thursday to make this clear. It would be wrong, however, for the Government to commit themselves to finding all the  60 million required; the City should be expected tomake a reasonable contribution in order to protect their existinginvestment in the firm. In any event, any further government assistance should be specifically in the form of launching aid for the-22 engine; there must be no question of the Governmenfs accepting
wider liabilities in respect of Rolls-Royce. It was also clear thatthe top management required drastic reconstruction. This, however,should be regarded as initially a matter for the City interests, whoseproposal that Lord Cole should become Chairman was generally welcomed. The most important appointment, however, would bethat of a new chief executive.(b) BAC had not completed the arrangements for raising 12 million towards the development cost of the BAC 311. In thecircumstances, and since they knew that a decision was imminent,it seemed unlikely that they would in fact terminate the project atthe end of the month unless they received some assurance of furthersupport. On the other hand, since they had committed themselvesto doing so and had so informed the staff, it might be difficult forthem to continue if the decision was delayed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet were inclined to the view that it would be wrong tosupport the BAC 311 or, probably, the A300B, they could not takea decision until after the resumed discussion on the following day with the French, German and Dutch Governments. At this meetingthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister of aviation Supply should try to establish whether the terms offeredcould be substantially improved by obtaining reasonably firmassurances as to sales of the Rolls-engined version or as to theprovision of substantial funds towards the development of the -61engine. The result of these discussions should be reported to theCabinet on 29 October; and in the meantime nothing should be said which might be regarded as an implied commitment to re-enter the project. He would arrange for preliminary consideration to begiven, before the Cabinefs discussion was resumed, to the steps whichmight be necessary to ensure the reorientation of the industry if theCabinet decided to support neither the BAC 311 nor the A300B.As for Rolls-Royce, the Minister of Aviation Supply should arrange,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry and the Attorney-General, for a formula to be drawn up which gave Rolls-Royce sufficient assurance to enable them to continue trading and to make it clear that theywere not acting improperly in doing so. The Government shouldnot, however, be committed to finding the whole of the  60 millionrequired to complete the -22 engine, and it should be made clear thatthe City were expected to contribute. Moreover, the additional funds should be provided specifically as the continuation of launchingaid for the -22 engine and not in a form which could carry anyimplied commitment in respect of Rolls-Royce&apos;s liabilities. TheChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister of aviation Supply, should inform the Governor of the Bank of

The Secretary of State for Employment said that Sir JackScamp, who had been appointed by the local authority employersand the trade unions to preside over an independent inquiry intothe pay dispute, was now expected to call for a general resumptionof work by the local authority manual workers.The Secretary of State for Wales said that it had been reportedto him that morning that it might not be possible for volunteers tocontinue operating the Penarth Road sewage pumping station inCardiff after 10 p.m. that evening and that the Cardiff City council might therefore be asking for the help of Servicemen.England that the Government looked primarily to the City to ensurethe reconstruction of the Rolls-Royce management, on the basis that the Government themselves would concur in the proposal that lord Cole might become the Chairman.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry andthe Minister of Aviation Supply (i) to be guided in their handling of the further discussions on the A300B proposal by the PrimeMinisters summing up of the discussion;(ii) to report the outcome of these further discussions tothe Cabinet on 29 October.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation Supply, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry and the Attorney-General,to arrange for a formula which might be used byRolls-Royce on 29 October to be drawn up on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up ofthe discussion.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Aviation Supply, to inform theGovernor of the Bank of England that the Governmentlooked primarily to the City to ensure the reconstruction of the Rolls-Royce management, on the basis that theGovernment themselves concurred in the proposal that lord Cole might become Chairman of the firm.
