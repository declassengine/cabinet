OverseaAffairsKidnappingof UnitedKingdomTradeCommissionerat Montreal(previous reference:CM (70) 28thConclusions,Minute 1)Indo-ChinaCM 30 (70)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that discussions had now begun between the lawyer representing theQuebec Government, Mr. Robert Demers, and the legalrepresentative of the Front de Liberation Quebecois (FLQ),Mr. Robert Lemieux. It was difficult to see what would be achieved by these exchanges, since the FLQ were refusing to discuss mattersof substance relating to the exchange of the United Kingdom trade commissioner in Montreal, Mr. Cross, and the Quebec Minister ofLabour, Mr. Laporte, against the so-called &quot; political prisoners &quot;.Meanwhile, the recent statement by the Prime Minister of Ontarioopposing any concession to the kidnappers had had an unfortunate effect, in that it had injected a political element into the discussion and had sharpened the traditional antagonism between English-speaking and French-speaking Canada. The outlook was thus notpromising; and Mrs. Cross, to whom he had sent a personal messagethat, day, appeared to feel that our efforts to free her husband hadbeen less effective than they might have been had not the high commission in Ottawa been in the charge of a Charge d&apos;Affairespending the arrival of a new High Commissioner. He had therefore been considering whether to expedite the latter&apos;s departure forOttawa. Hitherto, we had taken the attitude that the negotiationswith the FLQ were a matter for the Canadian Government; and wehad been careful not to involve ourselves in them or to suggest thatwe were seeking to bring pressure to bear on Canada. There wasa risk that to send the new High Commissioner out early might create an impression of this kind; but he intended to consult the CanadianHigh Commissioner in London about the likely reaction in Canada.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the north vietnamese delegation at the Paris discussions had now rejected thepeace plan put forward by President Nixon of the United States.He had recently discussed the situation in Indo-China with theLaotian Prime Minister, Prince Souvanna Phouma, who had suggested that Britain and the Soviet Union, as Co-Chairmen ofthe Geneva Conference, should act as observers at the forthcoming discussions between his Government and the Communist-led PathetLao. He had replied that he would be ready to comply with this request if the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, whom hewould be seeing shortly, also agreed. Prince Souvanna Phouma had gone on to say that he did not believe that the North Vietnamesewould be capable of taking over the whole of Cambodia during the approaching rainy season. In Cambodia, as in Laos, their position had been considerably weakened, a major factor being the interruption of their supply routes by sea. On balance, the outlook for the United States in Indo-China seemed to have slightly improved.121711a 2
Middle East(previous reference:CM (70) 27thConclusions,Minute 1)Visit to theSoviet Unionby theFrenchPresidentBermuda(previous reference:CM (70) 28thConclusions,Minute 1)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the decisionto adopt Anwar Sadat as the official candidate for the presidency of the United Arab Republic appeared to be the result of a compromise. It was unlikely that his tenure would be a long one.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the main point of interest which had emerged from the discussions which theFrench President, M. Pompidou, had recently had with the SovietGovernment in Moscow, was the agreement between the French and soviet Governments to hold six-monthly consultations on foreignaffairs, possibly at Foreign Minister level. During the visitM. Pompidou had not committed himself to the project for a european Security Conference, although he had indicated that hewould not be opposed to such a conference provided that it was fully prepared in advance.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the recent disturbances in Bermuda had probably been instigated by the BlackPower movement. Reports in the Press and elsewhere that theyhad been connected with Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs supposedintentions in regard to arms supplies to South Africa were unfounded.The disturbances did, however, raise the question whether the projected visit by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales toBermuda should now take place. The Governor^ view was thatthe visit could proceed. But a senior Special Branch officer, who hadbeen in Bermuda in connection with security arrangements for the visit, would be returning to this country within the next 24 hours;and a decision should be deferred until his advice was available.If the visit were to be cancelled, this might well have a salutary effect in Bermuda itself.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.IndustrialAffairsLocalAuthorityManualWorkers&apos; PayDispute(previous reference:CM (70) 29thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that, in the discussions to be held on 16 October with the tradeunions, the employers appeared to have no intention of makingsignificant concessions to meet the local authority manual workers&apos;pay claims; and the trade unions were unlikely to settle for the relatively minor improvements now to be offered to them formally.The Home Secretary said that on the previous day the ministerial committee on Emergencies had reviewed the effects of the strike and the immediate outlook. There was still no instance in whicha critical threat to public health or safety had actually developed.
In discussion it was suggested that, even though public healthwas not yet at risk, the Government now needed to intervene more directly in the dispute in order both to demonstrate that essential services from which the local authority employees had withdrawntheir labour must be maintained and to enlist the support of publicopinion against trade union militancy in prosecuting unreasonablewage claims. In the light of the prospect of continuing industrial unrest a union victory in the current strike could result in veryserious damage to the economy and the erosion of the Governmenfsauthority. Public opinion had not yet been brought to appreciateeither the full extent of these risks or the true facts about the wageclaim which was currently at issue; and there were indications thatthe general public were increasingly puzzled by the Governmenfsfailure to introduce Servicemen or to appeal for volunteers. Forthese reasons the Government should seek to present their case moreforcefully: and further consideration should be given to intensifyingthe financial disincentives to strike action which were currently beingconsidered. On the other hand income tax refunds were not a significant factor in the calculations of those contemplating a strike,since social security benefits were available as an alternative; andthese in turn affected only a very small proportion of strikers. the modern worker tended to have significant resources of his own; andhe also enjoyed considerable opportunities for replacing any short-term reduction in income by casual employment. Moreover, publicopinion was divided on the issues involved; and there was a gooddeal of sympathy with the plight of the lower-paid members of thecommunity. In these circumstances any action which smacked of strike-breaking should be avoided; and direct government intervention should be a last resort not only in order to avoidprovocation but also because, even if the most careful plans weremade in advance, the Government could probably not succeed inreplacing the services of strikers on any considerable scale.Nevertheless, further thought should be given to the Governmenfspreparations for dealing with a series of major strikes, including astrike in the National Health Service, where public opinion mightbe acutely disturbed since human life might be at risk; and thesepreparations should have regard to, among other things, Section 5of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875.The Prime Minister, summing up. the discussion, said that itwas clear that public opinion had not yet been mobilised in supportof the Governmenfs policy of resisting a settlement with the localauthority manual workers on the basis of their pay claim. the ministerial Committee on Emergencies should therefore reassess asa matter of urgency the opportunities for an early Government
initiative to maintain or restore essential public services disruptedby the local authority manual workers&apos; strike. He would give furtherconsideration to the most appropriate means of reviewing all aspectsof the strategy which the Government should adopt in dealing withmajor instances of industrial unrest likely to occur in the foreseeable future.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to make a fresh assessment of the scope for Government intervention in the localauthority manual workers&apos; strike, on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.PublicExpenditureGeneral(previous reference:CM (70) 29thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (70) 84) covering a draft White Paper onPriorities in Public Spending and a note by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP (70) 86) summarising the reductions and increases in public expenditure agreed by the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft white paper was essentially factual; it would be published after his statement on 27 October in which he would set the figures in the context of the Governmenfs policies. The change in the system of investment incentives complicated the presentation of the overalleffect of the cuts. It was more realistic to regard these as reducingthe rate of growth of public expenditure from 3-6 per cent a yearto 2-7 per cent than to emphasise the sharp drop to 1-8 per centif investment grants were included. The change of system did,however, make a real reduction in the demand on public funds. Hewas reconsidering the presentation of this point. The tables includedin the draft White Paper made it clear that the reductions had notfallen mainly on the social services. In addition, however, allreferences to increases in charges for the social services were accompanied by a statement about remissions or other arrangements to mitigate their effects.In discussion the following points were made :(a) The Government must expect some criticism from those interested in defence matters of the reduction of  130 million in1974-75 below the previous levels of the long-term defence costingsin view of pledges which had been given in Opposition aboutstrengthening various sectors of our defences.  The Defence White
Paper, which the Cabinet would be considering early the following week, would make it clear that the Government were neverthelessmaking major improvements in our defences; as it would bepublished on the day following the public expenditure White paper and this would be known to the Press in advance, substantial adversecomment on the basis of the latter alone was unlikely.(b) Parliament had been informed in July that the Governmentwould continue to publish a full annual public expenditure white paper on the lines of Cmnd. 4234, and it was now proposed to publish this early in the new year.(c) While inclusion of the details of the arrangements to mitigate the effect of the increases in social services charges was helpful, too much of the present text was in consequence devoted to the social services. Consideration should be given to condensation of the sections on social services.(d) The charge for issuing new passports could be increased tobring in an extra  6 million a year.(e) It might be preferable to include a reference in the white paper to the postponement of the proposals for a new Design Councilrather than to announce it separately.(/) The Minister of Technology intended to make a statement toParliament about the abolition of the Industrial reorganisation corporation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the lines of the proposed White Paper, subject tothe points made in discussion. Suggestions for amendments shouldbe sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at latest in the course ofthe following day.The Cabinet-CD Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer(i) to arrange for the draft White Paper to be amended in the light of the discussion and of considerationof any additional amendments suggested; and to circulate copies of the revise to the Cabinet fortheir information;(ii) to consider, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,whether it would be appropriate to include in theWhite Paper a saving of  6 million a year from increased charges for passports.
secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Minister of Housing and Local Government (CP (70) 69)about the rate support grant.In discussion it was suggested that the proposed squeeze on localauthority current expenditure through the rate support grant mightadversely affect the local health and welfare services and the ability of the local authorities to employ all the available teachers or tosupport some regional symphony orchestras which were facingincreasing difficulties. On the other hand it was pointed out thatthe proposed reduction was very small. It would impose some financial discipline on local authorities. Only by reverting to thesystem of specific grants could the Government control where theauthorities made the necessary economies, but there was generalagreement that this would be a retrograde step.In further discussion it was suggested that, while it would be right to make Increase Orders now covering price increases in1969-70 and 1970-71, local authorities should now be warned notto assume that such Orders would automatically be made in futureif they gave way to unreasonable wage demands. On the otherhand it was pointed out that the level of about half of the wagesand salaries paid by local authorities were effectively under controlof the Government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals in CP (70) 69. The Minister of housing and Local Government should, however, warn the localauthorities not to assume that Increase Orders would necessarily bemade in future to cover costs due to extravagant wage settlements.The Paymaster-General could, if he wished, raise with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment, the possibility that some central financial supportmight be made available to regional symphony orchestras on thebasis of matching grants from the local authorities.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the proposals in paragraph 21 of CP (70) 69.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to warn the local authorities that Increase Orders would notnecessarily be made in future to cover higher costsresulting from unduly generous wage settlements.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment and Productivity (CP (70) 83) about the futureof the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity saidthat the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC) had been
considering the policies and institutions required in the whole areaof competition policy and incomes policy. He would be submittinga report to the Cabinet shortly about competition policy and thefuture of the Monopolies Commission. It was however urgent to announce as soon as possible after Parliament reassembled the government&apos;s decision about the future of the NBPI and the newinstitutions that were needed in the field of incomes. It was proposedthat the NBPI should be abolished and its functions of examiningprices and individual pay settlements, whether in the public or private sector, abandoned. However there were certain groups in the public sector which lacked pay negotiating machinery. Accordingly, itwas proposed to establish three new pay review bodies one forcertain top salary groups in the public service (including the boards of nationalised industries, the judiciary, senior civil servants and senior officers of the Armed Forces), a second for members of the armed Forces not covered by the top salaries body, and a third for doctors and dentists. The Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment had been asked, subject to the Cabinefs endorsement of these proposals, to discuss with the local authorities the possibilityof the top salaries review body covering the pay of chief executivesof major local authorities. The review bodies should have a commonsecretariat and a degree of common membership. The secretariatshould be provided by an &quot; Office of Manpower Economics &quot; whichwould be available to conduct research into general problems suchas productivity and wage drift and to service ad hoc inquiries intopay questions in the public and private sectors. Its work programme would be subject to Ministerial approval, but outside bodies couldfor a fee commission general research work by the Office. All theseproposals had been generally approved by the EPC. Attached tohis memorandum was a draft of the statement he had it in mind tomake about the proposals when Parliament reassembled.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would not be possible to find Parliamentary time for theintroduction of the legislation to abolish the NBPI until perhaps nextMay or June. The NBPI would continue formally in existence until this legislation was approved. In the circumstances it was agreedthat the NBPI should continue its investigation of the food distribution industry, on the understanding that the Board&apos;s report would contain no recommendations.(b) The doctors and dentists had been assured that therecommendations of their new pay review body would be acceptedby the Government unless there were clear and compelling reasonsfor not doing so. Similar assurances must be given about the government&apos;s treatment of advice from the two other proposed
review bodies. But it must be made equally clear that theGovernment reserved the right not to accept the review bodies&apos;recommendations if there were compelling reasons for rejecting ormodifying them. An assurance could be given that the review bodies&apos;recommendations would not be referred for consideration by anyother outside body.(c) Further consideration should be given to the proposal todiscuss with local authorities the possibility of the top salaries review body being concerned with the pay of local authorities&apos; chiefexecutives. Their salaries had fallen behind those of senior civilservants and the inclusion of both sets of salaries in the purview of the top salaries review body could have inflationary effects,particularly bearing in mind the implications of increases in the salaries of top local government officers for those of theirsubordinates, who would continue to have separate pay negotiating machinery.(d) It was important that the top salaries review body should report every two years on the groups for which it was responsible.Longer intervals between reviews were liable to involve undesirablylarge adjustments to the salaries of those concerned. The review body should carry out its first review in 1971. These points mightbe included in the statement to be made about the review bodies&apos;establishment or could alternatively be explained in answer to enquiries.(e) The representatives of the groups concerned should beinformed in confidence before the proposed top salaries review bodywas announced.(/) It would be desirable to secure a change in the present arrangements whereby increases in the salaries of the higher judiciaryhad to be approved by an affirmative resolution of Parliament.(g) Whether the top salaries review body should be asked toadvise on the pay of Ministers and Members of Parliament orwhether any other arrangement should be made to secure independentadvice on this issue should be left for consideration when it wasnecessary to decide how to proceed on these salaries. For the timebeing nothing should be said about a system for reviewing thesesalaries.(h) Further consideration should be given to the draft statementattached to CP (70) 83. It would be desirable to avoid the implicationin paragraphs 2 and 3 of the present draft that the proposed newOffice was in effect a substitute for, and development of, the NBPI.The present draft of these paragraphs should be amended too toavoid unnecessary provocation to the doctors and dentists. The draft statement at present implied wrongly that the Office would be
AircraftIndustryAirbusesand theRB211Engine(previous reference:CM (70) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)secret .* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Technology (CP (70) 77) and a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP (70) 74) covering a report by officials on airbuses andthe RB211 engine.The Prime Minister said that the situation which now faced theCabinet was a complex one which they had largely inherited fromthe previous Administration. In considering the various optionsbefore them it was necessary to bear in mind that very large demands on national resources and public expenditure were involved. They* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.available to carry out studies and to service enquiries only in thepublic sector. The final sentence of paragraph 5 was an unnecessaryelaboration at this stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, subjectto the points which had been made, the Cabinet generally approved the proposals in CP (70) 83. However further consideration shouldbe given to the treatment of chief executives of major localauthorities and also to the draft statement attached to thememorandum and to the title of the proposed new Office. TheCabinet should have the opportunity to consider a revised draft ofthe proposed statement. The Cabinet would consider in due course the appropriate arrangements for reviewing the salaries of ministers and Members of Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Subject to 3 (i) and (ii) and the points made in discussion,approved the proposals in CP (70) 83.(3) Invited the  Secretary  of State for  Employment  and productivity-(i) To consider with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand the Lord Privy Seal the procedure for dealingwith the salaries of chief executives of major localauthorities.(ii) To revise the draft statement attached to CP (70) 83in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for social services and the Lord Privy Seal, and to circulate the revised version for consideration by theCabinet.
would need to take hard-headed and, if necessary, hard decisions.The Minister of Technology would outline the financial difficultiesnow facing Rolls-Royce which added a further serious complicationand which must be treated in the strictest confidence.The Minister of Technology said that Rolls-Royce had informed him in mid-August that they were in serious financial difficulties.The situation had since been fully examined, and it was clear thatthe company were facing very large losses on the contract with the lockheed Corporation for the RB 211-22 engine for the Tri-starairbus; the development costs of this engine had doubled to 140 million. To complete the contract Rolls-Royce would need 60 million, mostly in the course of the next year, in addition to the funds now available to them, but including  10 million which theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) had virtually committedfor this purpose. The firm already owed  70 million to its bankers.This situation would be revealed to the full Board of Rolls-Royceon 20 October and they would be then advised that, if the necessaryfinance were not available within at most 48 hours, the company should go into liquidation. Apart from the losses for shareholdersand creditors, liquidation would cause serious damage to our own defence production and have world-wide repercussions on theaircraft and defence industries; the full implications of these couldnot immediately be assessed. The Governor of the Bank of england had taken soundings in the City to see how far the institutionsalready financially involved in Rolls-Royce would be prepared toassist in a salvage operation to enable the firm to complete the rb 211-22 contract, and so avoid large claims by Lockheed forindemnity under their contract and the immediate collapse of rolls-Royce. These soundings were being undertaken on the basis that there was no Government commitment to further Rolls-Roycecivil engine projects beyond the RB 211-22 engine. It was, however,clear that even if finance to enable that to be completed wereavailable the future of Rolls-Royce, at least on its present scale, was by no means assured. The latest information was that the Citymight be prepared to put up  40 million if the Government would find a further  20 million (including the  10 million from the 1958-59),but only if the City institutions were able to look forward to theservice of their additional capital investment. The capital could not,however, be serviced unless the company could maintain a profitablebusiness of its present size and scope. This in turn would depend upon Government support for further projects beyond the RB 211-22engine. A City contribution to the immediate rescue of the companyappeared therefore to depend on some degree of commitment bythe Government to the company&apos;s future which in turn would involvea further commitment of Government funds, possibly on a large
scale. One complicating factor was that there was some doubt whether the Lockheed Corporation would be in a position tocomplete the Tri-star. They were also in financial difficulties andit would not be clear for some time yet whether funds would beavailable to enable their civil and military work to continue. If theTri-star project fell through, Rolls-Royce would discontinue workon the RB 211-22 engine, for which further funds would not thenbe required, and would have a claim under the contract for an indemnity from Lockheeds. In the meantime, however, the cabinet would have to decide whether to provide the funds immediatelynecessary to prevent Rolls-Royce going into liquidation. Any suchcontribution should, in any event, be conditional on a majorreconstruction of the management and a full review of the firm&apos;activities. But the decision on funds for the RB 211-22 should itself be taken in the light of the view the Cabinet took of the issues raised in the report by officials: the future of the aircraft aero-engineindustry as a whole, our policy on co-operation with the Europeanindustries, and whether Government aid should be provided for the bac 311 and RB 211-61. Decisions were urgently required not onlyin respect of Rolls-Royce but also because the British aircraft corporation had stated that they would not continue work on the bac 311 beyond the end of October without promise ofGovernment support.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was a danger that, in taking part in a salvageoperation for Rolls-Royce, the Government might acquireresponsibility for its liabilities. If assistance were provided it shouldbe given in a form which avoided this, and no pressure should beput on the City to provide more funds than they were prepared, intheir own commercial judgment, to put up to protect their existinginvestments.(b) The Government should not, in order to obtain support fromthe City, guarantee a future for Rolls-Royce in the &quot; big league &quot;of civil aero-engine manufacturers. The cost of any such assurance could be very high. Even if the Concorde continued, its Olympusengine would not provide a basis for the firm&apos;s continuation in thatleague. The cost of the assurance would, therefore, certainly involveassistance for the BAC-311 aircraft and the RB 211-61 engineamounting to well over  150 million. Rolls-Royce might well havea future under new management in the military and small civil aero-engine market, but it would not then be in a position to service its existing capital and the additional funds now required.(c) The liquidation of Rolls-Royce could have seriousimplications for the defence programme and for the policy of
co-operation with European countries in collaborative projects, the precise effects on which might be considered further. Moreover, aliquidator would be in no position to prevent, for example, a UnitedStates takeover of Rolls-Royce.(d) The future of Rolls-Royce lay in a combined Europeanaero-engine industry. It would, however, be difficult to arrange a merger unless the firm was maintained meanwhile on a viable basis.(e) There were considerable attractions to the idea ofco-operating with the European aircraft industries in the A300Bproject, but this would not help Rolls-Royce and the majority ofMinisters felt that the project itself was unsatisfactory.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to continue their discussion before his departureat the beginning of the following week for the United States. Inthe meantime the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of technology should try to establish more precisely with the governor of the Bank of England the terms on which the City institutionswould be prepared to provide support for Rolls-Royce. The ministers concerned might also give further consideration urgently to thepossible implications for our defence programme and for thecollaborative military aircraft projects, of the liquidation of Rolls-Royce. The strictest confidence must be maintained.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Technology, to clarify the terms uponwhich private financial assistance would be forthcomingfor Rolls-Royce.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Minister of Technology, to give furtherconsideration to the implications of the liquidation of rolls-Royce for the defence programme, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing-up ofthe discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15 October, 1970.
