CM 34 (70)confidential parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs Parliament the following week.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would i wish to congratulate the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the skill with whichhe had presented the Governments measures on public expenditure and taxation.Machinery ofGovernmentCentral policy review StaffPreviousReference:CM (70) 29thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL2. The Prime Minister said that he proposed to announce,in a written reply to a Parliamentary Question that afternoon, thathe had appointed Lord Rothschild as head of the new central policy review staff referred to in the White Paper on The Reorganisation of central Government (Cmnd. 4506).OverseaAffairsVisit ofthe SovietMinister ofForeignAffairsSECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePrime Minister and he himself had had useful discussions with theSoviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, during the latterV recent visit to London. On Berlin Mr. Gromyko had shown some interestin easing the restrictions on access from the West; but it was clearthat the Soviet Government would expect any concessions in thisrespect to be matched by reductions in the scale of the activities,especially in the political sphere, undertaken by the Federal republic of Germany in West Berlin. Apart from this there had been fewsigns of flexibility in the Soviet position. It had not proved possibleto make any mention of Berlin in the communique issued at the endof the discussions, since Mr. Gromyko would not accept any wordingimplying the continuance of four-Power responsibility for the cityas a whole. It was clear, therefore, that it remained the long-termaim of the Soviet Government to make the position of West Berlinstill more anomalous and to weaken still further the position of theWestern Powers in the city.As regards the possibility of a European Security ConferenceMr. Gromyko had expressed the hope that we would give favourable consideration to the proposal, which, as he had pointed out, hadbeen put forward originally by the previous British Administration,for a standing body to deal with questions of this nature. The SovietGovernment perhaps hoped to include some of the non-aligned
countries of Europe in the membership of such an organisation andso to secure additional support for their policies. We should therefore need to proceed with caution. On the Middle EastMr. Gromyko had proposed that the Foreign Ministers of theUnited Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and france should now fix a date for the resumption of the mission of theUnited Nations Secretary-General&apos;s Special Representative,Dr. Jarring. This suggestion might well derive from the fact thatthe Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic (UAR), Mr. Riad,had indicated to Mr. Gromyko that the UAR would not agree to a renewal of the cease-fire in the Suez Canal zone for more than afurther two months. On the other hand the United States Secretaryof State, Mr. Rogers, had told us that the Government of Israelwere likely to persist in their refusal to renew contacts withdraw. Jarring unless at least some of the missiles which the UAR haddeployed in the Suez Canal Zone subsequently to the cease-fire were removed a condition which the UAR were unlikely to accept. Theforthcoming visit of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mrs. Meir, toLondon might present us with a further opportunity to try to persuade the Government of Israel of the desirability of taking advantage of the present period of relative calm to relaunchDr. Jarring&apos;s mission. But the prospects of breaking the deadlockwere not good.Visit toLondon ofthe Presidentof GabonThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit to London of the President of Gabon, Mr. Bongo, had gone well.It had been Mr. Bongo&apos;s first visit to a foreign capital as President ofhis country; and he had been gratified by our offer to supply Gabonwith a modest quantity of motor vehicles, which would testify tothe success of his mission.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.SECRETEuropeaaEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (70) 28thConclusions,Minute 14. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the ministerial meeting which he had attended at Luxembourg on27 October with the Members of the European economic community (e.c.) had been a useful one at which modest progress had been made. At the meeting we had managed satisfactorily to resolve problems about the effects of the common agricultural policyof the e.c. on the market in the enlarged Community for pigmeatand eggs; on supplies of liquid milk; and on future arrangementsfor the annual review of the prospects of the agricultural industry.We had also reached agreement in principle that the dependent
CONFIDENTIALIndustrialAffairsLocalAuthorityManualWorkers&apos;Pay DisputePreviousReference:CM (70) 33rdConclusions,Minute 25. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that the council&apos;s of two London boroughs, Tower Hamlets and Southwark,had yielded to the trade unions&apos; demand for a 55s. a week pay increase for local authority manual workers. The Greater london council intended to issue a public statement calling in question thevalue of the rate equalisation arrangements in London if the boroughs which benefited from them made excessive pay awardswhile those which paid for them resisted pay concessions.territories of the United Kingdom with the exception of HongKong could become associated with the enlarged Community: theposition of Hong Kong would be considered further. Finally wehad informed the Six that acceptance of the eec&apos;s commoncommercial policy (at present very rudimentary) would not present difficulties for the United Kingdom. We had at an earlier stageput in factual papers setting out the background to the major problems which confronted us imports of sugar from developing commonwealth countries and of dairy produce from New Zealand;and the size of our contribution to the Community budget and wehad also made proposals for the length of transitional periods were quired to adapt to the common agricultural policy and to makethe necessary changes in tariffs. Thus the fact-finding stage of thenegotiations could be said to have ended. We had been asked bythe Six at the Luxembourg meeting to table our proposals beforethe end of the year for resolving all the major problems and also to engage by then in the financial discussions for which they hadearlier asked. The next step would be to table United Kingdomproposals to deal with imports of sugar and of New Zealand dairyproduce. We should start by asking the Six for arrangements whichwould enable New Zealand to continue to export to us their presentquantities of dairy products at present prices and he would beinforming Mr. Marshall, the Deputy Prime Minister of NewZealand, to this effect when he saw him on the following day. Itwas, of course, most improbable that the Community would concedean arrangement as advantageous as this to New Zealand. We shouldtable proposals on similar lines to meet the interests of the sugarexporting countries in the developing Commonwealth: such proposals would avoid the need at this stage at least for consultations with the Commonwealth interests concerned.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would no doubt besatisfied with the progress which had been made, and would wishto consider at a fairly early date the general situation and outlook for the negotiations as a whole.
The Secretary of State for Wales said that Cardiff City council had made a public appeal for volunteers to help to avoid the risk ofsewage flooding and had received a sufficient response to man thePenarth Road pumping station for some days, probably until at least3 November. The CounciTs request for Servicemen had therefore not had to be met.The Secretary of State for Employment said that Sir Jack Scamphad called for a return to work while his Committee of Inquiry intothe dispute was sitting. The unions had replied that they would not extend their strike action while the Committee was at work but would not call it off. The Committee&apos;s report was expected on or 4 November. There was a risk that it might follow the leadgiven by the final offer by the National Coal Board (NCB) to thecoalminers and add 10s. a week to the employers&apos; pay offer.The Lord President of the Council said that, as requested by cabinet on 26 October, he had circulated to Ministers in correspondence a note about the true earnings of local authority manual workers. But he had only obtained this material with some difficulty; and the inability of the employers&apos; association to provideit immediately suggested that they had not been well enoughprepared in this respect to present their own case either in negotiationor in public discussion of the subject.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Employment, theSecretary of State for the Environment and the Secretaryof State for Wales.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, as agreed by the Cabinet and in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment, he had authorised the Chairman of the NCB, Lord Robens, to offer theNational Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on 27 October a further10s. a week pay increase in mid-1971, to be made conditional upona rise in productivity. On the afternoon of that day Lord Robenshad reported to him the NUM&apos;s rejection of this offer and ofarbitration and had strongly urged that the 10s. a week should be offered unconditionally and with effect from 1 November, arguing that this would achieve a settlement and would avert widespreadunofficial strikes which would cause damage to the coal industry ona scale which the NCB had not previously envisaged. Lord Robenshad said that, unless he was instructed to withhold this further offer(in which event he would have to report this to the NUM), he wouldmake it on his own responsibility.Coalminers&apos;PayPreviousReference:CM (70) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2
He had sought to dissuade Lord Robens from making the offer and had pointed out that the Government might well disown it.Lord Robens had nevertheless decided to make the offer on his own responsibility; and the NUM executive had subsequently agreed by a small margin to commend it to their members, for approval in a further ballot. The improved offer amounted to a 12 per centpay increase, offset only by a postponement for a matter of monthsof a further increase due to some miners under a restructuring of payin 1971.Together with the other Ministers principally concerned he had considered how the Government would best react to thisunauthorised offer and, in particular, what attitude they should adopt in the debate that afternoon in the House of Commons onthe coal industry. They had concluded that, the damage havingbeen done, an explicit disavowal of the pay offer would merely draw attention to the Governmenfs lack of power to prevent the NCBfrom making it. It might also be thought to imply that Lord Robensshould be replaced as Chairman of the NCB, whereas theGovernment should clearly retain their freedom of action in thisrespect. It might therefore be best, for the purposes of theParliamentary debate, to make it clear that the Government thought the NCB&apos;s previous pay offer fully adequate, if not generous (giventhe coal industry&apos;s recent productivity record), and to say that, tothe extent that higher wage costs were not offset by improvedproductivity, coal prices would have to rise, with a further contractionin the market for coal and in mining employment as a consequence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentwould certainly need to comment on the NCB&apos;s final pay offer tothe NUM, and in terms at least as critical as those suggested by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry. The NCB&apos;s disregard of the Governmenfs wishes, after both Parties had fully agreed fromthe outset on the tactics to be followed and at a time when thesituation had developed exactly as originally envisaged, would makeit difficult to establish an agreed plan of campaign, with Governmentbacking, for other nationalised industry pay negotiations. Moreover,it was important to bring it home to the industry and to the public that wage increases which could not be absorbed by higher efficiencymust be reflected in higher prices. A proposal to increase the priceof general purpose coal was currently before Ministers; and it wouldbe salutary if the increase were announced in the debate that afternoon and were related to the need to cover the wage increase inquestion. The Industrial Coal Consumers&apos; Council had already been consulted about the proposed price increase; and if it were effective from mid-November, it would provide sufficient revenue to cover the cost of the improved pay offer.  If the price increase were not
approved at once, but left until after the result of the NUM&apos;s furtherballot on the pay offer were known, it might not suffice to avoid therisk that the NCB might exceed their statutory limit on deficits atthe end of the financial year.In discussion it was agreed that, rather than explicitly disownthe NCB&apos;s offer of a further 10s. a week, the Government should emphasise the relationship between higher wages and higher prices by announcing the proposed price increase at once. Although the pay offer had not yet been accepted by the miners, its rejection wouldbe likely to impose still higher costs on the NCB through the concession of an even higher pay award or the costs of a strike. in approving a price increase to take account of the present offer, theGovernment would not therefore be anticipating costs beyond those to which the NCB were already committed. The proposed 16 percent price increase would apply country-wide to general purposecoals for industry and electricity generation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that inthe House of Commons that afternoon the Secretary of State for trade and Industry should refer to the NCB&apos;s provisional agreementwith the NUM on a pay increase and say that the government thought the previous pay offer fully adequate, if not generous. Heshould also announce that a 16 per cent increase in the price ofgeneral purpose coals would be brought into force from an earlydate; and he should make it clear that this illustrated that higherwage costs which were not matched by productivity necessarilyimplied higher prices. Now that the Government had dealt withthe question of reducing public expenditure, Ministers would need to devote special attention to the means of curbing inflation, sincecontinuing wage increases at the current rate could quickly nullifythe good effects of their public expenditure decisions.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (i) To be guided by the Prime Ministers summing upin speaking that day in the House of commons debate on the coal industry.(ii) To arrange to give effect at the earliest possible date to a 16 per cent increase in the price of general purpose coal.
TankerCollisionPreviousReference:CM (70) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3CM (34) 70CONFIDENTIAL6. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that oil from the Pacific Glory tanker stranded off the Isle of Wight wasthat day being discharged into another tanker with the objective ofrefloating the ship. This was a particularly risky operation; butonce it had been successfully carried out there should be no furtherdanger of large-scale pollution.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.AircraftIndustryAirbuses andthe RB211EnginePreviousReference:CM (70) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1SECRET*7. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda by the Prime Minister (CP (70) 91) and the Minister of Technology(CP (70) 77) and of Notes by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP (70) 74and 92) covering a report by officials on airbuses and the RB 211-61engine; and of a Note by the Minister of Aviation Supply on discussions with French, German and Dutch Ministers about theA300B European airbus project.The Prime Minister said that, together with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, he had met representatives of the banks and insurance companies who were creditors and shareholders of rolls-Royce Ltd. The Company had been advised that it couldpostpone making an interim statement so long as there was areasonable prospect of its discussions with the Government coming to fruition. No statement would therefore be issued after the Boardmeeting that morning; and further time was available in which toconsider the firm&apos;s financial position. The loss on the developmentof the -22 engine was expected on present estimates to be  61 million.The Company also expected to incur losses of  45 million on theproduction of the -22 engines up to the first 500 sold. On salesabove 500, there should be some profit; and the firm expected tosell 800 engines to Lockheed. They were writing off reserves tocover the  45 million of production losses and in cash termsexpected to cover them out of profits on other business (includingprofits on the -22 engines after the first 500). But they needed aninjection of  60 million cash in order to be able to complete the -22contract. The Government were now being asked to provide theadditional  61 million of launching aid, together with any furtherfunds needed to complete development if the cost were exceeded;
but they were offered little prospect of recovery. The City&apos;representatives had indicated that, unless the Government provided this  61 million, the banks would probably refuse to advance anymore finance, including the undrawn  18 million of the  70 million which they had agreed to make available. This was a new situation,which it would be necessary to discuss further with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry andthe Minister of Aviation Supply before firm proposals were put tothe Cabinet.The Minister of Aviation Supply said that, after lengthydiscussions on the previous day with French, German and DutchMinisters, he was no more optimistic than before about thecommercial prospects for the A300B European airbus and, inparticular, for any version fitted with Rolls-Royce RB 211-61 engines.The European Ministers had suggested possible total sales of either400, of which 196 might be equipped with Rolls engines, or 700, ofwhich 280 would be Rolls-engined. These estimates, however, werehighly optimistic. The higher figures assumed substantial penetration of the American market and a competitive advantage over anyAmerican airbus which seemed most unlikely to be achieved.Moreover, all the national airlines except BEA and most of theother European airlines were already committed either to the A300Bwith General Electric (GE) engines or to the DC 10 aircraft withthe same GE engine or to both. The realistic sales prospects,therefore, did not provide an adequate base for launching the -61engine. There had, however, been one hopeful development in thediscussion. The European Ministers had proposed that the participating Governments should recognise that the maintenance ofan effective European aero-engine industry was as important as themaintenance of the European airframe industry and that they should therefore undertake, by means of a procedure to be settled jointly,a study of the terms of co-operation between European engineindustries on the basis of the closest possible links between the firms and the countries concerned in Western Europe. This suggestedthat the way might be open for the reorganisation of the aero-engineand, subsequently, the airframe industry on a European basis, whichthe Cabinet had recognised should be our long-term objective.While the French Minister appeared to regard our re-entry into theA300B consortium as a prerequisite of any such development, itwas possible that cancellation of the BAC 311 alone would providea basis at least for co-operation with the German industry. He had agreed to meet the other Ministers on 3 November in Amsterdamin order to tell them the results of the Cabinet&apos;s consideration oftheir proposals. In his view the BAC 311-61 remained a sounderproposition than the proposal for the A300B with the -61 engine.If the former were rejected, however, he would wish to consider the
CM (34) 70possible advantages of British participation in the airframe of theA300B with a GE engine, which might also provide a little extrawork for Rolls-Royce, at a cost of the order of  40 million or more(together with whatever liability might be involved in productionguarantees), on the assumption that BEA would order the A300B.Alternatively, we could rest on the present position of hawker siddeley&apos;s participation in the A300B with no Government financial contribution; and we could combine this course either with a BEAorder for the A300B or with a BEA purchase of the LockheedTriStar with -22 engines. Moreover, GE had just indicated that, ifthe Government were prepared to support the development of the bac 311 with GE engines, they would be prepared to arrange forRolls-Royce to undertake up to half the manufacturing work.While this proposal was not at first sight very attractive, it should perhaps be examined further before a final decision was reached.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) While the proposal for a GE-engined BAC 311 might providea considerable volume of work for Rolls-Royce, any advantagesimplicit either in this proposal or in the proposal for british participation in an A300B programme without the -61 engine wouldbe offset not only by the loss of work on -22 engines for the LockheedTriStar aircraft which BEA might otherwise buy but also by the direct cost to the Government of funding the airframe coupled withloss of the possibility of recovering any of the -22 launching aid.(b) There would for some time remain a risk that Lockheedwould be unable to complete the TriStar. Their early failure mightsave further expenditure on the -22 engine and enable Rolls-Royceto claim compensation. On the other hand a BEA order for theTriStar might be a critical factor in the success of the aircraft andmight enable at least some return to be earned on our investment inthe -22 engine.(c) The prospect of a major reorganisation of the aero-engineindustry on a European basis was attractive. It would, however, be some considerable time before any positive result could be expected.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould give further consideration to the best means of taking advantage of this new opportunity to reorganise the industry on a european basis. In the meantime he would arrange to discussRolls-Royce&apos;s financial problems further with the ministers primarily concerned before the Cabinet resumed their discussion.The Minister of Aviation Supply, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,should arrange for further consideration to be given to the alternative courses of action excluding the development of the -61 engine towhich he had referred in his opening statement, together with the
new proposal for a BAC 311 with GE engines. This, however,would necessarily take a little time; and he should therefore seek the agreement of the French, German and Dutch Ministers to the postponement for a few days of the meeting proposed for November.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation Supply (i) To seek to defer the further meeting with French,German and Dutch Ministers proposed for November.(ii) To arrange, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for trade and Industry, for further consideration tobe given to alternative proposals on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing upof the discussion.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion in the following week.CONFIDENTIALFuture ofthe national board totPrices andIncomesPreviousReference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute 58. The Cabinet considered a memorandum CP (70) 97 by theSecretary of State for Employment, to which was attached the revised draft of a statement announcing the winding-up of theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).The Secretary of State for Employment said that he had revisedthe draft statement to meet the points made when the Cabinet had considered his earlier draft. He now proposed to make thestatement on the following Monday. He also suggested, after consulting those of his colleagues who were directly concerned, thatthere should be announcements on the same day of the proposed new pay scales for the judiciary, on which the Cabinet had agreed on 21 July (CM (70) 7th Conclusions, Minute 5), and for senior officers of the Armed Forces, on which the NBPI had now made recommendations which the Ministers concerned had accepted.Although the absolute size of the increases for judges and senior officers would be liable to attract critical comment in relation to the government&apos;s declared policy of seeking to moderate wage settlements generally, it was doubtful whether there would be any advantage in postponing these announcements.
MousingFinancePreviousReference:CM (70) 29thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP (70) 95) on the reform of housing finance.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that theproposals in his memorandum, which had been approved by theHome Affairs Committee, followed the lines indicated in his earlier memorandum CP (70) 64. Fair rents would become the basis of allunfurnished tenancies in both public and private sectors. In orderto make the change effective the legislation would need to providefor a statutory rate of progression from present rents to fair rentsin the public sector; the choice seemed to lie between annualThe Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet were content with the terms of the revised statement on thefuture of the National Board for Prices and Incomes, subject to thelast paragraphs being amended to read &quot; A statement on the government&apos;s proposals for strengthening and developing the workof the Monopolies Commission will be made at an early date &quot;. But,in view of the forthcoming economic Debate, of the expectation thatthe Committee of Inquiry under Sir Jack Scamp into the localauthority manual workers&apos; pay dispute would report in the following week and of the fact that a mineworkers&apos; ballot on the national coal Board&apos;s latest pay offer was pending, the announcement of higher pay for the judiciary and senior officers of the Armed forces should be delayed, preferably until after the mineworkers&apos; ballot anddesirably until nearer the Christmas Parliamentary Recess. If,following Monday&apos;s statement on the future of the NBPI, there weresupplementary questions about the Governmenfs intentions on thefuture pay reviews by the proposed new bodies, on the implementation of their recommendations or on the pay of ministers and Members of Parliament, the Secretary of State for employment should deal with them in accordance with the Cabinefs discussion at their meeting on 15 October (as recorded in sub-paragraphs (b), (d)and (g) of CM (70) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5).The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved, subject to the amendment of paragraph 4 asindicated by the Prime Minister, the statement annexed to CP (70) 97.
increases averaging 15s. a week (with a maximum of  1 a week) and increases averaging 10s. a week (with a maximum of 15s.). TheHome Affairs Committee had decided that an average increase of15s. was to be preferred, because this would shorten the transitional period. This, however, would contrast very unfavourably with themaximum of 7s. 6d. laid down by the previous Administration andwas a point to which the Cabinet would wish to pay particular attention, taking account of the implications for wage inflation andfor public expenditure. So large an increase would absorb a large part of any likely increase in household incomes and might wellimperil the success of the measures recently approved by the Cabinet.A comprehensive rebate scheme, applying to both public and private tenancies, would protect tenants of limited means; it wouldbe administered by local authorities with financial assistance fromthe Exchequer. Exchequer subsidies would be progressively reducedas rents rose, although subsidies would continue to be paid to localauthorities with rapidly rising costs and deficits in their housingaccounts and to assist slum clearance. He invited the Cabinet to approve the proposals as a basis for consultation with the localauthority associations, subject to further consultation on outstanding points, and to endorse the view of the Home Affairs Committee thata White Paper was not desirable. He also sought approval to themaking of an early statement in the House of Commons on the linesof the draft attached to his memorandum.In discussion it was the general view that it would be a mistake to seek to increase council house rents by more than 10s. a week on average, even though there were good arguments on both housing andpolitical grounds for preferring 15s a week. Rents were an important element in the cost of living; but their significance in wage bargainingwas even greater than their importance warranted because of theiremotive power. The Governmenfs strategy had been carefullydesigned to protect the poorest sections of the community. But itwas already being pointed out that their measures would bear hardlyon families with incomes of, say,  25 or  30 a week, because theycould expect little or no help from rebate and similar schemes and yet paid too little income tax to derive much benefit from theforthcoming reductions in direct taxation. To extend the protectionOf rent rebates to this group would, considerations of cost apart,have a damaging disincentive effect.There might be advantage, if it were practicable, in deferringa decision on the rent progression and opening negotiations with thelocal authorities on the basis of the general principle, citing alternativerates of increase in rents by way of illustration. But the localauthorities would be largely concerned with the impact on their ownfinances; and the rate of rent increases was critical in this context,
CM (34) 70because it determined the rate at which subsidies would be withdrawn.It was agreed that the same rent progression should apply inScotland as in England and Wales, although a different basis was proposed for council house rents, for the reasons given in paragraph of CP (70) 95. The revaluation due shortly was likely to increasethe rates of council houses in Scotland by something like 7s. a week;and this furnished an additional reason for restricting the average annual increase to 10s. a week.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the draft statement annexed to CP (70) 95. It was agreed that, if the average annual increase was to be restricted to 10s. a week, there would be advantage in making this clear in the statement in order to prevent damagingspeculation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that ingeneral the Cabinet approved the proposals in CP (70) 95, subjectto consultation, on outstanding points with the Ministers concerned.But they considered that the average annual rent increase should be10s. a week, with a maximum of 15s. a week in the case of anydwelling. The draft statement should be modified to make clear the rate of progression proposed. He would discuss with the lord president of the Council and the Secretaries of State for the environment and for Scotland whether the position in scotland should be the subject of a separate statement by the Secretary ofState for Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that average annual rent increases in the public sector should be limited to 10s. a week, with a maximum of 15s. a week for any one dwelling.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved the proposals in cp (70) 95.(3) Approved the draft statement annexed to CP (70) 95, subjectto the insertion of a reference to the rate of rent increasesagreed under Conclusion (1) and to any drafting amendments.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, whether aseparate statement should be made in respect of Scotland.
