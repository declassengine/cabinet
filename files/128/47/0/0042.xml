OverseaAffairsPakistanPreviousReference:CM (70) 41stConclusions,Minute 7SECRET1. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theMinister for Overseas Development, on returning from his visit to pakistan, had reported that the relief operations by British forces had been very efficiently conducted and had reflected great credit on all concerned. There appeared to be little risk of widespreadstarvation or major water shortage and no danger of epidemics;and our relief units were therefore concentrating on building updepots for supplies which would be handed over to the Pakistaniauthorities when they withdrew. Initially, the Government of pakistan had incurred considerable criticism, both in Pakistan itself and more widely, for their alleged passivity in the face of theemergency. But they had had to deal with a very difficult problem in an area where communications, which were at the best of timesinadequate, had been largely destroyed in the disaster; and they now seemed to be establishing control of the situation. Extremistelements, however, were seeking to take advantage of the impendingelections in Pakistan to exploit our efforts by mounting a campaign against the presence in Pakistan of &quot; armed foreign troops in theguise of relief&quot;. President Yahya Khan had maintained acommendably robust attitude in the face of these accusations. Butit would be unfortunate if the presence of our forces were to become an issue in the elections; and it might therefore be advisable for thetroops to be withdrawn by 12 December, although they might beable to remain for a further week if this seemed necessary.The Prime Minister said that it would be regrettable if we werecharged with leaving before the work of relief had been completed.It might be possible for elements of the Royal Navy to continueoperations without incurring criticism of the kind which had been mentioned. Subject to these considerations it would probably be right to withdraw our forces. But the President should be consulted before a decision was taken; and any arrangements for withdrawalshould be concerted with the Government of Pakistan.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements  by the  ForeignCommonwealth Secretary and the Prime Minister.andSECRETTheSimonstownAgreementand Arms forSooth AfricaPreviousReference:CM (70) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1*2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (CP (70) 113) making proposals onthe terms and timing of the Governmenfs announcement of their intentions in the matter of the supply of arms to South Africa.128813-4
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in formulating these proposals he had taken account of the results ofthe lengthy discussions which the Prime Minister and he himself had had with leaders of other Commonwealth countries on the government&apos;s intention to resume limited arms sales to South Africa.If we were to adhere to the policy which had been worked out in the context of the Simonstown Agreement and in conformity with itsspirit, the formula proposed in paragraph 5 of CP (70) 113 offered the best prospect of achieving our aims of retaining the Simonstownfacilities, securing the acquiescence of as many commonwealth countries as possible in our policy and minimising the risk of a major threat to the cohesion of the Commonwealth. The essentialelements in this formula were: the restriction of supplies to spares,to Wasp helicopters for the frigates supplied under the simonstown agreement and to other equipment and arms necessary to maintainSouth African maritime defences at their present level of efficiency;an undertaking by the South African Government not to use thesearms for purposes other than the defence of the sea routes; and an offer by ourselves to study, in conjunction with other commonwealth countries, the question of the security of the Indian Oceanarea as a whole in order to ascertain whether a broader basis forits defence could be devised. As regards the timing of any announcement of our decision the considerations set out in CP (70)113 suggested that the balance of advantage inclined in favour of deferring any disclosure of our intentions until the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers at Singapore. Therewere now, however, additional arguments for postponement untilthen. It seemed probable that the report by the United Nationsinvestigating team would confirm Portuguese complicity in the recentseaborne operations against Guinea; and the possibility that SouthAfrica might also be implicated could not be excluded. It would be wiser to allow the United Nations the opportunity to complete their examination of this episode before publicly stating our position about the supply of arms to South Africa; and this consideration was reinforced by the fact that the General Assembly would haveadjourned by the time of the Singapore Meeting, while the composition of the Security Council should by then have changed to our advantage.In discussion it was recognised that, however an announcement was timed, a policy decision on the lines envisaged in CP (70) 113would entail significant risks. Apart from the danger that some members of the Commonwealth might withdraw from membership,others might seek to run down their sterling balances or adopt anunco-operative attitude in the renegotiation of the undertakings on sterling holdings which had been given under the Basle agreement and would shortly have to be renewed. Moreover, although themajority of the Governmenfs supporters would probably endorse
-4b* 2the proposed decision, others, particularly among the youngermembers of the Conservative Party, would regret it. Finally, eventhough an announcement would be so timed as to minimise theprospect of hostile demonstrations directed against United Kingdomresidents in Africa and HM Representatives there would have takenall possible precautions in advance, there would undoubtedly be some risk to British communities overseas. These factors, however,must be weighed against the political arguments in favour ofadhering to the Governmenfs declared policy and the strategic importance of retaining South African facilities and the co-operationof South African forces in the defence of the Indian Ocean. on balance these considerations were decisive.On timing there was general agreement that it would be preferable to defer any announcement until after the start of the singapore Meeting, during which our position would be made clear to other Commonwealth Heads of Government on the lines ofparagraph 5 of CP (70) 113. The formal public statement of the government&apos;s decision should be reserved until it could be madein Parliament after the Meeting had ended. But it would be difficultto avoid premature disclosures of our intentions from the SingaporeMeeting; and it would be preferable, therefore, that discussion ofthe subject at Singapore should so far as possible take place towardsthe end of the proceedings.In further discussion the following additional points were made:(a) It was unlikely that the South African Government would feel able to maintain the Simonstown Agreement unless we wereprepared to announce our willingness to sell, in addition to sparesand Wasp helicopters, the naval equipment defined in paragraph 5 (c)of CP (70) 113. If we did so, however, there was a good chance that they would subscribe to an undertaking about the use of thesearms which most reasonable people would regard as satisfactory,although, since their African neighbours had already rejected their offer of non-aggression pacts, they might be reluctant to give a specific undertaking not to use the arms supplied by us foraggression against neighbouring States.(b) The broadening of the defence issue to cover the wholeIndian Ocean area rather than merely the Cape route, combined with the offer to confer with other Commonwealth countries at ministerial level, should help to convince informed opinion that ourfears for the safety of the area were genuine.(c) Even with the maximum of goodwill other countries couldnot provide in less than 5-10 years forces and facilities which would
be an adequate substitute for those at present made available bySouth Africa. We could not, therefore, accept the proposal, whichwould almost certainly be made to us at the Singapore Meeting,that we should defer a decision on the supply of arms to SouthAfrica until after the proposed discussions on the security of theIndian Ocean area had been completed. Moreover, the cost ofproviding alternative facilities would be high.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the recommendation in CP (70) 113 that weshould act in accordance with the spirit of our obligations under the simonstown Agreement. As regards timing they agreed that no announcement should be made in advance of the Singapore Meetingor at the Meeting itself. During the course of the proceedings at singapore, however, he would seek so to arrange the discussion that commonwealth leaders would be left in no doubt that the UnitedKingdom Governmenfs position was as indicated in paragraph 5 of cp (70) 113. Although we should try to avoid any public announcement of our intentions at Singapore, some of the discussions were bound to be heated; and the inevitable disclosures would leadto speculation and comment by the Press in this country and elsewhere. It was to be hoped, nevertheless, that it would be possibleto resist demands for a Parliamentary debate before the SingaporeMeeting had ended and it was possible to report its outcome toParliament. But, if such a debate proved unavoidable, he mighthimself fly home, if necessary, in order to take part in it. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should now discuss in confidence with the South African Government the terms on whichthey would be prepared to give an undertaking about their use ofany fresh arms supplies, on the lines of paragraph 5 of CP (70) 113.Meanwhile in the interests of securing the least unfavourableoutcome of the Singapore Meeting, it was essential to avoid anydisclosure of the views expressed, and the conclusions reached, inthe present discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toascertain the terms in which the South african government would be willing to give a publicundertaking not to use arms supplies for purposes otherthan maritime defence.
CM 42 (7(AircraftIndustryAirbusesand theRB211EnginePreviousReference:CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 6128813-4SECRET*3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Aviation Supply (CP (70) 112) about airbuses and the RB211engine.The Prime Minister said that, since the last discussion in cabinet of the various proposed airbus projects, the French, Germanand Dutch Governments had been asked to give us further indications of the extent to which they were able and willing to influence their national and independent airlines to purchase A300B 7 aircraft withRolls-Royce engines, and the total number of such aircraft which their airlines were likely to purchase. They had also been askedto provide their detailed analysis of the total sales expected for theA300B with and without Rolls-Royce engines; and they had been invited to indicate whether they were willing to share the costs andrisks of launching the RB 211-61 engine and, if so, on what basis.The answer was almost wholly negative and gave us no assurance that the European national airlines would buy the A300B 7 withRolls-Royce engines or that other Governments would contribute to the engine launching costs. On the other hand it had emergedthat the other European Governments were now seriouslyconsidering the need for the establishment of a joint Europeanaero-engine firm and for further integration among the airframemanufacturers. This seemed likely to be true irrespective of our decision on the A300B. The other airbus project now before theCabinet was the BAC 311. This would require large-scaleGovernment expenditure, which would make it impossible to achieve the savings which it had been agreed should be achieved in the field of technology in the course of the recent public expenditure review.The BAC 311 would, moreover, be in competition with the A300Bwith the disadvantages which that involved. The alternative was toprovide Government support for neither of the airbus projects. Inthat case British European Airways (BEA) were likely to buy the lockheed TriStar. This would not be particularly advantageous ordisadvantageous in our political relations with other european governments; but it would increase sales of the RB 211-22 engineand hence the return on the Governmenfs investment in it. the detailed arguments for and against the various courses were set outin CP (70) 112.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The BAC 311 was clearly the most desirable project fromthe point of view of the British aircraft industry. Its rejection might lead to the loss of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), Weybridge,b* 2
design team and might damage the prospects of ancillary industries.There was considerable doubt, however, about the capacity of rolls-Royce to develop the RB 211-61 engine satisfactorily at thesame time as its other important engine projects. To go forward with the BAC 311 with American engines would damage the reputation of Rolls-Royce; it would be bitterly opposed by theFrench, German and Dutch authorities; and it would remove allpressure from BAC to consider their future in realistic terms and ina European context. Moreover, we could not afford the BAC 311 aswell as the other growing demands on public expenditure. It was unlikely that the City would be prepared to provide any funds for development of the -61 engine; and the Government would therefore have to provide a minimum of  144 million for the project, a figure which was subject to further escalation. Rolls-Royce would havebeen offered a total of  159 million in public funds in relation to thisseries of engines alone within three years. The costs would exceed the provision for unallocated aircraft projects in the public expenditure forecast and would not allow the savings to be achievedto which the Government were committed in the White Paper on new Policies for Public Spending (Cmnd. 4515). We could not afford both Concorde and the BAC 311. The decision on the lattercould not be delayed. Moreover, in view of the success so far ofthe tests and of progress on the design of the new nozzle it seemed unlikely that it would be possible to withdraw from the concorde project even in March. While the French would agree to the ending of the project if the airlines refused to buy it, that might not become clear until considerably later.(b) In view of the latest discouraging reply from the three governments, the A300B project was not worth pursuing. It wouldnot provide a satisfactory basis for launching the RB 211-61 engineeven if the Government were prepared to fund the latter. joining the consortium to build American-engined A300Bs would gain us acomparatively small amount of work beyond that already allocated to Hawker Siddeleys; indeed, our total share of the project wouldbe less than our share of the Lockheed TriStar. The Governmentwould almost certainly lose at least  30 million. It would be difficultto represent a refusal to join the consortium as an anti-Europeanaction if we did not support the BAC 311 either; the A300B was a european airframe with an American engine, while the TriStar wasthe reverse.(c) To support neither the BAC 311 nor the A300B was not a negative decision. It would be welcomed by many as a sign ofrealism. And it would clear the way for BEA to buy the TriStarand so enable us to obtain some return on our large investment inthe RB 211-22 engine.
(d) A decision not to contribute to the A300B was unlikely to damage the prospects of reorganisation of the European aero-engineindustry. It might, however, delay moves towards integrationamong the airframe companies; and rejection of both proposals might weaken the position of the British airframe firms in anyeventual merger.(e) A number of the Governments supporters had been strongly in favour of the BAC 311; but it was believed that their enthusiasmhad waned somewhat since the position of Rolls-Royce had become known.(/) Other large items of public expenditure, for instanceinvestment in electricity generation, should be subject to as rigorousscrutiny of the real return on marginal expenditure as was appliedto assistance to the aircraft industry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there would be no advantage in rejoining theA300B consortium. They also agreed that it would be inappropriateto support the BAC 311 project with an American engine. TheCabinet recognised the advantages for our aircraft industry of the project for a BAC 311 aircraft with Rolls-Royce RB 211-61 engines.But there were doubts about the ability of Rolls-Royce to develop the engine; and the general view was that we could not afford this project in addition to our existing commitments in respect of the concorde and other demands for public expenditure. TheGovernment would therefore support neither airbus project. Thisdecision would require careful presentation both here and abroad.A statement should be made in Parliament on the following day; andarrangements should be made to inform the European Governmentsat the same time. The Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should consider, with the Minister of Aviation Supply, how thedecision could best be presented to the French, German and DutchGovernments, bearing in mind the desirability of a forthcomingresponse to the references which had been made in recent exchangesto the need for the development of the closest ties between thecompanies in the European aircraft industry. The Lord president should consider, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, theMinister of Aviation Supply and the Parliamentary Secretary,Treasury, the form of the announcement in Parliament. In themeantime the strictest security should be maintained.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should provide no financial support for either the BAC 311 or the A300B airbusprojects.
(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for trade and Industry, the Minister of Aviation Supply andthe Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, to give furtherconsideration to the presentation of the decision and toarrange for it to be announced in Parliament on  December.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the Minister of Aviation Supply, toarrange for suitable presentation of the decision to theFrench, German and Dutch Governments on 2 December.SECRETPublicSectorRemunerationPreviousReferences:CM (70) 10thConclusions,Minute 4, and cm (70) 39thConclusions,Minute 3*4. The Cabinet discussed certain aspects of public sectorremuneration.The Prime Minister said that in July the Cabinet had decidedto give effect on 1 January, 1971, to the third stage of the salaryincrease for the Higher Civil Service which had been recommendedby the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher CivilService and to increase from the same date the salaries of the higher judiciary and the chairmen of the Boards of nationalised industries.They had also decided to refer to the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) the salaries of senior officers of the Armed Forces;and the Board had reported in October, recommending increases which were also envisaged as operative from 1 January, 1971. Thedecisions about the Higher Civil Service and the chairmen of nationalised industry Boards had been announced. The increases for the judges had not so far been made known publicly; but theLord Chancellor had been authorised to arrange for the judges to beinformed confidentially. The NBPI report on the pay of senior officers of the Armed Forces had not yet been published; but itwould be unreasonable to withhold it any longer from the officersaffected.All these increases were very large in both absolute andpercentage terms; and he had therefore discussed with the ministers directly concerned the probable result if those affecting the judges and senior officers of the Armed Forces were announced while thecurrent negotiations on the pay claims in the electricity, gas and water industries were at a critical stage. The impact on the capacityof the employers to contain the level of wage increases and on themaintenance of public confidence in the Governmenfs determination
to combat inflation could not be other than adverse. Nevertheless,there was a clear link between the increases for the judges and senior officers of the Services on the one hand and the increases for theHigher Civil Service and the chairmen of nationalised industryBoards on the other hand. It might be held to be indefensible to discriminate against the judges and the senior officers; but it wouldbe no less unpalatable to defer increases already announced for theHigher Civil Service and the chairmen of the nationalised industryBoards.In these circumstances three courses of action appeared to beopen to the Government. First, they could proceed with the increases as planned and table the necessary Order in Council inrespect of the judges on 3 December. Second, they could defer the implementation of the judges&apos; increases until Parliament reassembledafter the Christmas Recess (on the hypothesis that an Order made during January could be retrospective to the beginning of the month),accepting the risk that the inflationary pressure might be no less serious by then. Third, they could approach the problem on thebasis of a broader arrangement, whereby the Cabinet might thinkit right that Ministers should temporarily forgo a proportion oftheir Ministerial salary and the groups who were to receive increases on 1 January, 1971, might wish to follow this example by forgoingthe increases for say six months in the national interest. the implications of these various courses required further consideration;in particular, if the third course were to be adopted, time would be needed to make the necessary approaches to those concerned. Onthe other hand a decision to adopt the first course would have to betaken by Thursday, 3 December, since that was the latest date bywhich the Order in Council in respect of the judges could be laidif an Affirmative Resolution were to be secured in the House ofLords in time to make the Order effective on 1 January, 1971. TheCabinet should therefore resume consideration of the matter on the morning of that day.11The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.(2) Agreed   to   resume   consideration   of   public   sectorremuneration on Thursday, 3 December.
