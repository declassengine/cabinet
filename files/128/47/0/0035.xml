IndustrialAffairsLocalAuthorityManualWorkers&apos;DisputePreviousReference:CM (70) 34thConclusions,Minute 5GeneralCONFIDENTIAL1. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that thereport of the Committee of Inquiry under Sir Jack Scamp into thelocal authority manual workers&apos; dispute was expected on thefollowing day; and a meeting of the National Joint Council of theemployers and the unions had been arranged for 5 November. Ifthere were then no settlement, the Greater London Council (GLC)would be obliged to take certain action to remove accumulatedsewage sludge; and such action might have the effect of extending the strike. In that event the GLC might seek the assistance of servicemen at the weekend. Anxiety had been expressed in recentPress reports about the fire risk on 5 November, when the piles ofrubbish in city streets might be ignited by fireworks. The LondonFire Brigade, however, did not expect to face an unmanageablesituation, provided that the public exercised reasonable responsibility on Guy Fawkes Day.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had discussed the fire risk at their meeting on theprevious day; and he had since been in touch with fire authorities to remind them of the need to make adequate preparations to counter the risk of fires on 5 November. The primary responsibility for ensuring that those responsible for accumulations of rubbish tooksteps to safeguard them from the risk of catching fire and for issuingany necessary appeals for public co-operation lay with the localauthorities. It would in any case be impracticable for the ArmedServices, with the limited resources which they had available, toremove all accumulations of rubbish. Some local authorities might wish to consider using contractors to reduce refuse dumps whichwere particularly vulnerable; but in doing so they might riskprompting a forceful reaction by the strikers and an extension ofindustrial action. While the Government should remain willing toconsider the provision of Servicemen where a local authorityrequested their help, it would be wrong to seek to force troops on anunwilling authority.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment would be exposed to public criticism if it were notevident that they had done all in their power to reduce the risk offires on 5 November. The Ministerial Committee on Emergenciesshould accordingly re-examine urgently the extent of these risks andthe further steps, if any, which might be taken to reduce them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial committee on Economic Policy had given preliminary consideration
to the best means of dealing with a series of forthcoming pay negotiations between which there had traditionally been links those for local authority manual workers, for ancillary workers of theNational Health Service (NHS) and for employees in the water, gasand electricity industries. A decision on the pay of NHS ancillary workers could not sensibly be reached until the recommendations ofthe Scamp Committee into the pay dispute of the local authority manual workers were known. The Electricity Council had beenintending to make an offer on the following Monday in reply to theclaim of the electricity supply workers for a substantial pay increase;but the Committee had asked that they should be dissuaded from doing so until Ministers had been able to give further considerationto the possibility of adopting a new approach to pay settlementsgenerally, in an effort to reduce their level. The Secretary of Statefor Employment would be preparing a memorandum about certain suggestions which had emerged in the Committee&apos;s discussion for anew Government initiative designed to ensure that pay settlementsshould in future cover a period of more than merely 12 months or should be related to a specified number of years with additional payments under an agreed formula to compensate for any rise in thecost of living during that period. Such an approach might havebetter prospects of carrying public support and avoiding damagingstrikes than a simple insistence on reducing the percentage rate of immediate increases in sectors where many of the workers were generally thought to be among the lower paid. A nation-wide strikeamong electricity supply workers would have even more immediate and serious effects on industrial production and on the national economy than a national strike among coalminers; and much of thework done by NHS ancillary staffs was critical to the continuedfunctioning of the hospital services. The Government would be liable to be severely criticised if, by refusing to match the localauthorities&apos; settlement (should that be achieved by a comparatively small addition to the present offer), they provoked industrial actionin the hospital service and human life was endangered as a result.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, said it was a matter of growing concern that, in seeking to withstandirresponsible industrial pressure, the Government should apparentlyhave no alternative but to expose the economy to the risk of serious damage to essential services. The strategy for dealing with threats of this kind and for countering wage inflation required furtherconsideration. There was in particular a need for urgent measuresto increase the financial disincentive to strike action; and the social services Committee should give first priority to their examination ofa combination of measures to reduce the &quot; disregard &quot; of a strikers
CM 35 (70)personal resources in assessing his entitlement to supplementary benefit, to require the repayment of benefits paid during and afterstrikes and to defer income tax refunds becoming due to strikersuntil the strike was over.The Cabinet  I took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIALNationalisedIndustriesGas andElectricityPricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 10thConclusions,Minute 72. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC) had agreed,subject to endorsement by the Cabinet, that he should authorise the gas and Electricity Boards, without commitment on the part ofGovernment, to put proposals to their Consumer Councils for tariffincreases to come into effect early in the following year. Theaverage rise in electricity tariffs would be 13 per cent and in gastariffs 6 - 3 per cent; but increases would vary from area to area andwould in general be higher for domestic users, who, in some cases,would face increases of up to 25 per cent. Both increases were urgently necessary to enable the industries to meet their financial obligations. If the total additional revenue required, amounting tosome  230 million in a full year, was not raised from consumers, an equivalent sum would have to be found by the Exchequer in termsof additional borrowing by the Boards. The gas industry&apos;s proposalscontain a modest allowance of 3 per cent per annum for future costinflation. Those of the electricity industry allowed, in addition, for a10 per cent wage increase this year and next. But in that case itwas not proposed to present them to the Consumer Council until thecurrent year&apos;s wage negotiations had taken place; and he intendedto disallow the element of anticipation for the following year&apos;s wage increase. Domestic tariff increases in these industries were relativelyinfrequent, the last being almost three years ago. When theConsumer Councils had reported on the proposals, he would bebringing them before EPC again for further consideration, togetherwith a fuller assessment of the scope for future cost savings by theindustries. The Committee would meanwhile consider possible means of enabling Ministers henceforward to maintain a closersurveillance of the efficiency of the industries and of their financialmanagement.
In discussion concern was expressed about the size of theproposed price increases, particularly in domestic tariffs, whichwould bear hard on old age pensioners and poorer households. Thiswas a matter to which the Consumer Councils could be expected todraw attention; and the Government would be pressed to defer the increases unless simultaneous action could be taken to mitigate anyhardship among those who would be liable to be most affected duringthe winter. The Supplementary Benefits Commission had already made proposals to the Secretary of State for Social Services toimprove the allowances available to old people in order to help themto meet heating costs; but administrative considerations would almost certainly make it impracticable to act on these suggestionsbefore the winter.In further discussion it was urged that, whenever an announce-ment of higher gas and electricity tariffs was made, it should be accompanied by statements of the Governmenfs plans in relation to industrial competition and the future financing and control of the nationalised industries. Proposals on both these issues of policy would be brought before Ministers for consideration shortly.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that actionto refer the proposals by the gas and electricity industries for highertariffs to their Consumer Councils should be deferred pending an urgent examination of the practicability of introducing concurrentlyimproved benefits which would mitigate the effects of these proposals on pensioners and poorer households. The Home Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for further considera-tion to be given by the Ministerial Committees concerned to theproposals for price increases in the light of the examination of theprospects of mitigating their effects; and the necessary recommenda-tions should be submitted to the Cabinet as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for further consideration to begiven by the Ministerial Committees concerned to the issues raised in their discussion, on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister with a view to an early report to theCabinet.
Oversea AffairsSale of mining plant to SouthWest AfricaSECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theExport Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) wished to make available a credit of  2-42 million to cover the export of a slagfuming plant by Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox to a mining company in South West Africa. The provision of Governmental financialassistance to trade with South West Africa would be contrary to aResolution passed by the United Nations Security Council in July1970 on which the United Kingdom and France had abstained. Ifwe allowed the credit to be made available, therefore, we should be liable to encounter criticism both in the United Nations and at home.To refuse to allow the ECGD to exercise their normal commercial judgment, however, would probably entail both the loss of the order and a deterioration in our relations with the South African Govern-ment, who would be likely to regard our action as the first step towards the economic confrontation which we had hitherto sought toavoid. The Security Council Resolution was not mandatory; andit would be fully consistent with the attitude which we had adoptedin United Nations discussions and elsewhere to allow the credit to bemade available.In discussion it was pointed out that we had never accepted that,for trading purposes, South West Africa should be treated anydifferently from South Africa. Moreover, the previous Administra-tion had sanctioned a very large contract for the purchase ofuranium ore from South West Africa. There was some indication that the South African Government had been exerting pressure onthe mining firm concerned (which was partly United States owned)to seek the credit; and the motivation for the request might therefore be political as well as economic. There was generalagreement, however, that there were no grounds for dealing withthe matter on other than the normal commercial basis.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no objection should be raised to the proposedgrant of an export credit to cover the sale of miningplant to South West Africa.Middle east previous reference:CM (70) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that his recentspeech at Harrogate, in which he had referred to the need for Israeliwithdrawal from territories occupied in 1967, had been made in the context of a threatened Afro-Asian initiative in the United nations general Assembly to extend the scope of Security council resolution 242 of November 1967 and had been intended to clarifySECRET128805-1 b* 2
the Governmenfs position in anticipation of any pre-emptive actionwhich we might need to take in the Assembly. In the event, thepredictably adverse Israeli Press reactions had been heightened bymisreporting of his remarks. But the Israeli Foreign Minister,Mr. Eban, was taking a balanced view of the situation; and the speech would probably have cleared the air without any lastingunfortunate consequences.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.CONFIDENTIALRate SupportGrantPreviousReference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute 44. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (70) 94) about the rate support grant.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that, on thebasis of what they considered a reasonable projection of existing policies, the local authority associations had put forward bids for total expenditure in rate support grant terms of  3,662 million in1971-72 and  3,867 million in 1972-73. These bids were not ingeneral excessive. Nevertheless, Departments had agreed that, inthe context of the need to restrain public expenditure, it would bedefensible to require a reduction of  38 million in 1971-72 and 54 million in 1972-73. In public expenditure terms Departments&apos;proposals would produce expenditure of  2,932 million in 1971-72and  3,070 million in 1972-73. These figures were respectively 24 million and  28 million below the existing public expenditureestimates, on the basis of which the Cabinet had decided (CM (70)24th Conclusions, Minute 2) that a general unattributed reduction should be applied to local authority expenditure in Great britain in order to try to produce a saving of  20 million in 1971-72 and 25- 30 million by 1974-75. To seek a general reduction of thelatter magnitude in addition to Departments&apos; proposed reductions would be liable to provoke justifiable resentment by the localauthorities. He recommended, therefore, that the Cabinet shouldrevise their decision and should seek, instead, to apply a general reduction on local authority expenditure of only  10 million in1971-72 and  15 million in 1972-73. Together with Departments&apos;proposed reductions and the effects of the Cabinefs other public expenditure decisions, including the increased charges for school meals and for further education, this more modest degree of general reduction would produce total savings of  34 million in 1971-72 and
 43 million in 1972-73. This would still be more than the largergeneral reduction by itself would have yielded. The resulting totalexpenditure for rate support grant purposes would be  3,596 million for 1971-72 and  3,779 million in 1972-73. But, in order to allow for unexpected factors which might arise during the negotiations, he sought authority to reach a settlement on the basis of an additional sum, not exceeding  10 million, without further reference to theCabinet.In discussion it was argued that the fact that it now seemed possible to reduce local authority expenditure below the levelsenvisaged when the Cabinet had decided on a general reduction of 20 million in 1971-72 and  25- 30 million by 1974-75 did not justify revising the latter decision. Advantage should be taken ofthis possible increased saving, which was the result partly ofthe Governmenfs other decisions on public expenditure and partly of the fact that local authority expenditure had fortuitously proved to be lower than had been expected. The proposals of the Secretaryof State for the Environment would imply an increase of 3 per centin 1971-72 and 4-5 per cent in 1972-73 in local authority expenditure in public expenditure terms.On the other hand it was pointed out that the increase in muchlocal authority expenditure resulted from decisions by centralGovernment and from the growth of population. The proposals ofthe Secretary of State for the Environment would still more thanachieve the savings on local authority expenditure implicit in theWhite Paper &quot; New Policies for Public Spending &quot; (Cmnd. 4515).They involved significant reductions in the expenditure proposed bythe local authorities on individual services. To try to achieve still greater savings by insisting on the general reduction originally proposed would involve stricter restrictions on the rate support grant than the previous Administration had sought to impose. Evenon the basis of the proposals of the Secretary of State for the environment, local authorities would have to increase their ratepoundage by, on average, Is. 2d. in 1971-72 and Is. 4d. in 1972-73.In further discussion it was suggested that, to the extent thatthe local authorities granted an unacceptably large pay increase totheir manual workers, they should be made to carry the costwithout help from the Exchequer. Consideration should also begiven to the possibility of preventing authorities who gave way tothe unions&apos; demands in respect of the manual workers from beingassisted in paying the extra wage bill by precepts on other authorities.Pressure should also be put upon local authorities to improve theefficiency of their use of labour.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, in the forthcoming rate support grant negotiations the Governmenfs purpose should be to seek to reach agreement on figures of expenditure on which the rate support grant would be based not exceeding  3,596 million in 1971-72 and 3,779 million in 1972-73. The Secretary of State for the environment should, however, have discretion to exceed these limitsby  10 million if unexpected factors arose in the negotiations, eventhough there was at present no reason to suppose that he would need to make use of this discretion. As soon as the report ofSir Jack Scamp&apos;s inquiry into the dispute over the pay of localauthority manual workers was available, it would be necessary tostate the Governmenfs attitude to the reports recommendations and, if necessary, to make it clear that the local authorities wouldnot receive assistance from the Exchequer towards the extra costof any unduly large pay award. Consideration should also be givento ways of preventing local authorities who had given way to the manual workers&apos; unions&apos; demands from receiving assistance fromother authorities in meeting the cost of their surrender.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, approved the proposals in paragraph 16 of cp (70) 94.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment (i) To be guided by Conclusion 1 in negotiations withthe local authority associations about the rate support grant.(ii) In   consultation   with   the   Chancellor   of   theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Employ-ment and taking account of the Prime Ministefssumming up of their discussion, to consider what attitude the Government should adopt about the implications for the rate support grant of theforthcoming report of Sir Jack Scamp&apos;s inquiry into the dispute on the pay of local authority manual workers.(iii) To consider ways of preventing local authorities whohad conceded the pay claim of their manual workers from receiving assistance from other authorities in meeting the increased costs involved.
CM 35 (70)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal(CP (70) 93) and by the Minister of Aviation Supply (CP (70) 100)about the attitude to be adopted by the United Kingdom delegation at the European Space Conference in Brussels on 4-5 November,1970.The Lord Privy Seal said that the fourth meeting of theEuropean Space Conference (ESC) would be resumed in Brussels onthe following day. A critical point had been reached in our policy towards European collaboration in space, because we would be pressed to join in further studies of the post-Apollo programme ofthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), whichcould eventually lead to participation in the space programme ofthe United States. The question had been discussed by theCommittee on Science and Technology (SCT), which had concluded that there were two options open to us. Option A required us toparticipate in studies of the post-Apollo programme until thebenefits could be assessed; under option B we maintained our existing commitments, while declining to participate further in thepost-Apollo negotiations. There was keen industrial interest in thepost-Apollo programme; and the form of co-operation offered bythe United States was attractive. A mission led by the President ofthe ESC had resulted in the United States authorities moving towards the European point of view; and there was considerableenthusiasm for the proposal among other members of the ESC. Ourearlier withdrawal from the European Launcher development organisation had had an adverse effect on European space collabora-tion; and although option A did not go as far as other countriesdesired we should probably be able to reach agreement with them on that basis. Option B, however, might cause the French towithdraw from the ESC and to seek to put the blame on us. Amajority of SCT had been in favour of option A, but on theunderstanding that we should take part in the full post-apollo programme only if the studies showed that genuine benefits were likely to result.The Minister of Aviation Supply said that he had met thePresident of the ESC in London on 27 October to discuss theforthcoming conference. The President had said that there wouldbe a proposal to set up an interim launcher study fund of $35 million,of which the United Kingdom share would be about  4 million. Itwas impossible to regard this as an attractive proposition, since itwas difficult to foresee any worthwhile outcome. But it wouldprobably be acceptable to the ESC if we offered to contribute 2 million for studies solely related to the post-Apollo programme.EuropeanSpaceConferencePost-apollo programme
In discussion it was argued, on the one hand, that we should adopt option A because we could achieve technological advanceonly through European co-operation and we should fall behindother European countries if we failed to participate. It was notpossible to assess the economic worth of the post-Apollo programmeuntil after the studies had been made; but there were adequate safeguards against our being irretrievably committed if the benefitsproved to be inadequate. If we refused to take part, there was a danger that the French would withdraw from the European SpaceOrganisation. This would mean the end of any effective jointEuropean space programme, including the development of air navigation satellites and telecommunications satellites, in which wehad a particular interest, and we might acquire a reputation for beingunreliable European partners. It was essential that we should lookahead and keep an open mind about projects such as the post-Apollo programme so long as they remained promising.On the other hand, it was pointed out that there appeared tobe no clear arguments on scientific, technological or defence grounds to justify participation in the post-Apollo programme. the dominant question was whether we could afford such projects. Wehad embarked on a programme of financial stringency and couldnot now undertake to participate in a venture which offered onlydoubtful benefits but certainly entailed heavy new expenditurewithout appearing to be pursuing inconsistent aims. Furthermore,we should find it more difficult to extricate ourselves in one or twoyears&apos; time after spending  2 million on studies.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) We could not sustain a contribution to an internationalspace programme without a national programme as itsfoundation; and this would inevitably foster further pressure to build up space research in the universities and elsewhere; with increased expenditure as a consequence.(b) It was clearly understood by the other members of the ESCthat we had agreed to a joint development programmeof applications satellites on the understanding that wewould not contribute to launcher development. Therewas no reason why the applications satellites programme should be jeopardised if we refused to participate in thepost-Apollo programme.(c) The United States had enjoyed substantial returns fromadvanced technological projects which were in thenature of &quot; spin-off&quot; from their defence programme.Our defence effort did not yield the same incidental
AircraftIndustryAirbuses andthe RB 211EnginePreviousReference:CM (70) 34thConclusions,Minute 6benefits; and we had had to buy our way into civildevelopments at a high cost.id) There were many opportunities for investing in newtechnologies; and we should devote our attention tothose where we had some special expertise. In terms of space technology it would be best to concentrate onsatellite development, in which we had considerable experience.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thedecision had to be taken primarily on political grounds. Above all we should avoid ambiguity in our position at the ESC. If were fused to join the project at the start, it could not be said of us thatwe were unreliable European partners; and it seemed unlikely insuch a case that the French Government would deliberately destroy the European Space Organisation. It was possible, however, thatthey and some other countries might elect to go forward with thepost-Apollo programme without us. The Cabinet agreed that inthese circumstances we should adopt option B and should decline to participate in new studies of the post-Apollo programme. TheMinister of Aviation Supply should lead our delegation in Brussels;and he should find an opportunity to indicate that the Governmentwere unable to support a programme in which the costs and benefitswere so ill-defined as those of the post-Apollo programme, ascurrently conceived. He should also make it clear that we were willing to maintain existing commitments, including participation inthe applications and scientific satellites programme.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation Supply, in leading our delegation to the European Space Conference, to be guided by the Prime Ministers summing up.SECRET*6. The Prime Minister said that in the previous week theChancellor of the Exchequer and he had seen the Governor of theBank of England together with representatives of the banking andother City interests concerned with Rolls-Royce&apos;s finances. Theyhad established at that meeting that it was now expected that theoriginal estimate of the cost of developing the RB 211-22 enginewould be exceeded by  61 million (though estimates of this excessapparently varied between  60 million and  73 million depending on
which version of this engine was taken as the base); and that thecompany expected additionally to lose  45 million on the productionof the first 500 -22 engines sold. They had been told that thecompany required a further  60 million in order to be able tocomplete the -22 contract. The bankers to the company consideredthat they were already as fully committed as they were prepared tobe and would not increase the lending facilities which they hadalready made available. The Ministers directly concerned hadthereafter considered the situation. They had concluded that thefirst steps must be the appointment of a new Chairmanof Rolls-Royce, Lord Cole, to carry through a managerial andprobably a financial reconstruction of the company; and theappointment of an independent firm of accountants to carry out an examination of the company&apos;s finances on behalf of the Governmentand advise on the minimal additional sum required for thecompletion of the -22 engine. When these steps had been taken theGovernment could consider proposals by Lord Cole for financialassistance. The Governmenfs position had been explained in these terms to the company and they were now awaiting a reply: theBoard of Directors of Rolls-Royce were meeting that morning. Ifthe Government, in due course, provided 70 per cent of theadditional cost of development of the -22 engine, i.e.  42 million, inthe form of launching aid, this would avoid any risk of involvementby the Government in wider responsibility for the company&apos;s debtsand would still leave the City to find a further  18 million if theindependent firm of accountants confirmed that  60 million was indeed required. He had also considered with the other ministers concerned what action should be taken in response to a suggestion which had been made by our Ambassador in Paris that the FrenchGovernment would be prepared to bring sufficient pressure on AirFrance to persuade them to purchase a developed version of theA300B airbus-the A300B.7 with Rolls-Royce engines. the ambassador had said that the French Government had reason tobelieve that the German Government would also be prepared to bemore helpful to British interests in this matter than they had so farindicated. The Ministers concerned had decided that it would bedesirable for the Minister of Aviation Supply to send a message tohis opposite numbers in the French, German and NetherlandsGovernments making it clear that the British Government would need to take a decision very shortly on the invitation to participate in the development and production of the A300B and in order todo so required definite answers as soon as possible as to whetherthe participating Governments were in a position to influence theirairlines to ensure that they purchased a guaranteed number ofA300B.7s with Rolls-Royce engines; and whether they wereprepared to share the costs and risks of launching the RB 211-61
engine; and if so on what basis. If the Cabinet agreed, a message to this effect would be sent immediately with the aim of arranginga preliminary inter-governmental meeting at official level before theend of the week at which the answers to these questions could be ascertained. JThe Cabinet-CD Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation Supply to send a message on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister to theMinisters concerned in the French, German and netherlands Governments.
