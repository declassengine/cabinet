Rochat, the representative of the international committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the leaders of the ArabFedayeen organisation, the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine (PFLP), at Dawson Field, it appeared that the time limitattached to the PFLP ultimatum would be extended for a further72 hours and would therefore expire at approximately midnight on saturday, 12 September. In addition the Fedayeen leaders had communicated to M. Rochat certain terms, which were stated to beprovisional and subject to ratification by the &quot; PalestinianOrganisation &quot;, whereby all the women, children and sick in all three aircraft at present held at Dawson Field would be released, providedthat the ICRC could deliver in Amman the Fedayeen prisoners heldby the Swiss and Federal German Governments, together with the terrorist, Leila Khalid, whom we had taken into custody and the body of her male accomplice. The remaining passengers of the three aircraft would be released in exchange for Fedayeen prisoners heldin Israel, to be designated in a list which would be provided toM. Rochat by the PFLP later in the day.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theseproposals were being considered at Berne by representatives of theGovernments of the United States, the United Kingdom, the federal republic of Germany and Switzerland, together with a spokesmanof the Government of Israel, who had now agreed to be associatedwith the discussions about the release of the hostages at DawsonField. So far we were maintaining our earlier stipulation that any agreement with the PFLP must embrace all hostages whom they held. But the position was complicated not only by a suggestion putforward by the Swiss Government that we should seek to negotiate an agreement with the PFLP providing for the unconditional releaseof all the women and children but also by the fact that the Israelirepresentative was without instructions, and it was still uncertainhow far the Government of Israel would be willing to be a party toany agreement with the PFLP at all. Meanwhile, the security council of the United Nations were now seized of the problem andhad passed a reasonably satisfactory Resolution condemning theoutrage; and we had taken the additional precaution of tentativelysuggesting to the Secretary-General, U Thant, that, against thepossibility that the ICRC might fail in their efforts to negotiate asettlement, the United Nations might consider stationing observersat Dawson Field as a further deterrent to any attempt by the PFLPto massacre the prisoners. It was perhaps significant that theGovernment of Iraq, whose sympathies had hitherto lain with the
PFLP, had now expressed disapproval in principle of the forcibleseizure of aircraft and had said that they would exert every effortwith the Fedayeen to obtain the release of all the hostages,irrespective of nationality. This suggested an additional means bywhich pressure might be brought to bear on the PFLP, particularly since the guerillas drew much of their financial support from the iraqi Government.In discussion it was suggested that the Government might incursevere criticism and lose a propaganda point to the Fedayeen if theyrefrained from supporting any attempt to secure the release of thewomen and children, whether or not this was conditional on therelease of the Fedayeen prisoners held by the British, German andSwiss Governments. The conditions at Dawson Field were said tobe deteriorating; and on humanitarian grounds we should lose no opportunity to rescue those who were least able to withstand the increasing strain and discomfort. On the other hand, if the Fedayeenwere susceptible to considerations of this kind, there was nothing to prevent them from voluntarily releasing the women and children.Moreover, the ICRC considered that the terms proposed by the fedayeen involved serious discrimination which might compel themto reconsider the possibility of continuing their task as a neutralintermediary; and this attitude might reflect a genuine, and perhapswell-founded, fear on their part that, once the Fedayeen haddisembarrassed themselves of the women and children, they wouldhave less compunction in carrying out their original threat to execute the male passengers unless their demands were satisfied. under such an arrangement we might have to surrender Leila Khalid, whoconstituted the one bargaining asset in our possession, in exchange for the return of only the British women and children held by the fedayeen; and the fate of the British men would then depend entirely on the unpredictable extent to which the Government of Israel mightbe prepared to surrender any of the Fedayeen whom they held. Itmight well prove a serious tactical error to allow the PFLP to createdisunity in this way between the five Governments concerned; and,although our attitude to their proposal must to some extent depend upon the further discussions in Berne, the overriding consideration atthe present stage was the need to maintain a united front against the terrorists&apos; demands.Meanwhile Leila Khalid, who had originally been held in orderto assist the police in their enquiries into the forcible seizure of theEl Al aircraft on 6 September, had now been formally detainedunder the Aliens Order, 1953. As a result, she could remain in the custody of the police for a further five days; but, if she was to be detained thereafter, she would have to be removed, as from Sunday,13 September, to prison. We must bear in mind the possible effectof her lodgment in prison on the course of the negotiations, if theywere still in train at that point.
The Cabinet then considered the situation in Jordan, whichhad deteriorated to a point at which HM Ambassador had advisedall British subjects who could do so to leave by ordinary commercialservices while these were still available. The necessary Serviceaircraft were being stationed in Cyprus and Bahrein and would beavailable both to convey the hostages from Dawson Field, if anagreement with the PFLP was reached, and to assist in the evacuation of British subjects from Jordan. But access to the airport at Ammanappeared to be under the control of the Fedayeen; and, short of a major military operation, it could not be regarded as available foruse by British military aircraft. It would be preferable, therefore,that British subjects should leave Jordan by commercial charterflights arranged under the auspices of the ICRC; and it was hopedthat the Lebanese airline, Middle East Airways, would provideaircraft for this purpose.The Cabinet next reviewed the measures to intensify security in relation to British aircraft and British airports. Although theinformation obtained during the interrogation of Leila Khalidsuggested that the PFLP were particularly hostile to the UnitedKingdom, whom they regarded as the leaders of resistance to their demands, and might well try to take forcible possession of anotherBritish aircraft, it was agreed that, while flights to Beirut shouldcontinue to be suspended, it would be inexpedient to require Britishairlines to withdraw all their services to North Africa and the arab countries of the Middle East, since no other country appeared to becontemplating so drastic a step and the Arab countries concerned might well retaliate by withdrawing the overflying rights which theyat present granted us. On the other hand, British airlines shouldcontinue as at present to re-route through services through non-arab countries to the extent practicable. It was also agreed that it wouldbe impracticable to enforce a complete search of all passengers andluggage on British aircraft, which would be administrativelyimpossible and would entail intolerable delays. It would be preferable to concentrate on introducing security guards on all aircraft of the British Overseas Airways Corporation and all aircraft on the overseas services of British European Airways and BritishUnited Airways, especially those to Arab countries. Such guardsshould be unarmed and preferably in plain clothes. In addition, the airlines should limit their acceptance of passengers to individuals who had booked their flights 72 hours in advance and should refuseto accept last-minute additions to passenger lists. It might benecessary for the stipulation as regards forward booking to be advanced day by day; but it should be retained in force until thepresent emergency had been resolved. In addition, Ministers should
consider their own intentions so far as air travel was concerned;and they should notify the Prime Minister in advance of any journeywhich could not easily be made otherwise than by commercialair flight.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,although it was not possible to reach a final decision about thehostages held at Dawson Field until a further report had beenreceived from the five-Power meeting in Berne, the Cabinet should hold themselves available to resume discussion, if necessary, at very short notice.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the developments in the negotiations for therelease of the hostages held by the Popular Front for the liberation of Palestine at Dawson Field.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe British Airways Corporations to introduce additionalsecurity precautions on their aircraft on the lines whichhad emerged from the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11 September, 1970.
