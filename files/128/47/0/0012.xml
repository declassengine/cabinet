CM 12 (70)confidential the 1.   The Prime Minister said that the prospect in the monthsGovernment anead was a troubled one, especially in the light of the increasingevidence of widespread industrial unrest. In these circumstances it was important that the Government should be seen to adhere tothe objectives of policy which they had proposed in their election manifesto. But it was clear that, if they were to satisfy the public demand for evidence of the change in the management of public affairs which they had undertaken to effect, they might have lesstime than they had originally hoped in which to come to grips withthe main economic issues which confronted them, especially prices and incomes policy and industrial relations. It was particularly important that the Industrial Relations Bill should be introduced at the earliest possible moment after the reassembly of Parliament,since, until the climate of industrial relations could be radicallyaltered, the Government would be perpetually at risk of becomingtrapped in the type of sterile confrontation with organised labour which had frustrated the efforts of their predecessors to deal effectively with industrial problems.In other respects the major projects to which the Cabinet hadinitially set their hands had been carried forward during the holidayperiod particularly the reorganisation of the machinery ofGovernment and the review of public expenditure. But once theseinitial inquiries had been completed it would be necessary to institute a more radical scrutiny of the policies and activities of departments with a view to eliminating or curtailing those which were redundantor could be conducted by other means; and arrangements for thispurpose would shortly be put in hand.It would be important in the months ahead to give more attention to the presentation of the Governmenfs decisions from aspecifically political point of view. This would be particularlyrelevant in relation to the review of public expenditure. ministers should be concerned to discourage any premature speculation aboutthe probable outcome of this review and should be careful to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer before making any public statements on economic policy as a whole.secret oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Herr Brandt, hadRelations1&apos;- signed a treaty with the Soviet Union in Moscow on 12 August.The German- The German Government intended to follow this up by furtherRussian Treaty discussions with the Polish Government and, in due course, with121363A 2
the Administration of the &quot; German Democratic Republic &quot; (GDR).The German policy of seeking a detente with the Soviet Union andthe countries of Eastern Europe had certain advantages for germany&apos;s allies; but it also entailed risks which we must bear wellin mind. The Soviet Government would not have engaged in adialogue with the Federal Republic of Germany or have permittedthe Eastern European Governments to do so unless they, too,expected to derive advantages for themselves. As the Germandialogue with the East gained momentum, an increasing number of states would be tempted to accord a measure of recognition to theGovernment of the GDR; there would be a tendency to regard thestatus of the Western sectors in Berlin as an enclave in East german territory which would appear increasingly anomalous: and the Alliedposition in Berlin might be progressively eroded as a result. HerrBrandt did not share this view; and he had assured us that theFederal Government would not ratify the treaty with the soviet union unless satisfactory arrangements could be made in relationto Berlin. But it remained to be seen whether he would be ableto maintain this position. The Soviet Government were likely tobe slow to make any significant concessions on Berlin, the more so since they probably calculated that time was on their side, thatthere would be an increasing tendency to accept the GDR as a fait accompli and that this would assist them to achieve their basicobjective of perpetuating the division of Germany and Europe. TheFederal Governmenfs Ostpolitik had to some extent loosened the deadlock; but its long-term consequences could not yet be foreseen.From the point of view of Germany&apos;s allies it was perhaps fortunatethat the initiative towards a detente had come from the federal government themselves. Since it was they who had initiated thedialogue with the Soviet Union, they would not be able subsequently to reproach us for any unwelcome consequences in regard to Berlinor Germany as a whole which might result.The Prime Minister said that in a message of 7 August theGerman Chancellor had informed us of his intention to sign theGerman-Soviet Treaty and had proposed a meeting during theautumn of the Heads of States or Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States, France and the Federal Republic ofGermany. In a further message of 14 August, despatched on his return from Moscow, he had reverted to this proposal, adding thatthe meeting could be at Foreign Minister level if this was preferred.We had agreed in principle to this suggestion. Close relationships between Germany and the Soviet Union had seldom been to our advantage in the past; and it was important to ensure and to demonstrate publicly that the Federal Government^ Ostpolitik wasnot weakening Germany&apos;s links with the West or her commitment tothe North Atlantic Alliance.   There was already a tendency in
Middle East(previous reference:CM (70) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)Germany itself to question the necessity of military expenditure onthe present scale in view of the trend towards detente with the soviet union; and it was important, therefore, that a meeting on the lines proposed by Herr Brandt should be arranged if possible.In discussion it was suggested that a general detente with theEast might open up considerable opportunities for trade with eastern europe. The German authorities, for their part, were fully alive to this possibility; and the Federal Government probably hopedthat the economic advantages which would result from a policyof detente would outweigh the criticisms which were being levelledat their Ostpolitik by their internal political opponents. although we ourselves should similarly seek to exploit to the full anyopportunities for increased trade which might present themselves,foreign trade in Eastern Europe was under strict political control;and our commercial prospects would therefore depend largely onthe manner in which the political situation developed. It wasunrealistic to expect that we should be able to achieve a majorexpansion of our exports by normal commercial methods; and discussions would continue to have to be conducted mainly on aGovernment-to-Government basis.The Cabinet-CD Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary and the Prime Minister and ofthe points made in the discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was only with considerable reluctance that the Israeli Government had accepted, during August, the cease-fire proposed by the United StatesGovernment; and the position of the Prime Minister, Mrs. GoldaMeir, had been weakened by the resultant resignation of six Cabinetmembers belonging to the Right-wing Gahal party. There was nodoubt that the United Arab Republic (UAR) had subsequentlyviolated the cease-fire by installing new surface-to-air missile (SAM)sites in the cease-fire zone. The Israeli Government, for their part,had also breached the cease-fire by conducting photographic reconnaissance flights over the cease-fire zone. The Governmentsof the UAR and the Soviet Union must be well aware that theGovernments of the United States and Israel knew that they hadbeen breaching the cease-fire; and, if they were allowed to persistin this course with impunity, a dangerous situation might develop not least in view of the risk that the Soviet Government might be tempted to adopt a similar policy elsewhere, for example in and around Berlin. For the present, the United States Government
appeared to be reluctant to prejudice the chances of mediation bythe United Nations Secretary-General&apos;s special representative,Dr. Jarring, by protesting against the breaches of the cease-fireagreement. But these breaches were now so evident and extensivethat it was for consideration whether they should attract some publiccondemnation and, if so, what form it should take. We ourselvescould hardly do more than continue to emphasise that, if therewere substantial and continuing breaches of the cease-fire, this would destroy the mutual confidence which was the prerequisite of anyfurther progress towards a settlement. But during his forthcoming visit to the United Nations he would seek to ascertain whether theUnited States Government would be prepared to make a moreforthright statement on the subject. Meanwhile, the outlook forDr. Jarring&apos;s mission remained necessarily uncertain; and therespective positions of the Arab Governments and Israel were so farapart that there seemed little hope that Dr. Jarring would be ableto reconcile them. But the four Power meetings between therepresentatives at the United Nations of the United Kingdom, theUnited States, France and the Soviet Union would continue; andwe would be ready to make any contribution we could to the supportof Dr. Jarring&apos;s enterprise.In discussion it was suggested that the United States Governmentseemed inclined to place too much reliance on the good intentions of the President of the United Arab Republic, Colonel Nasser. they appeared to believe that concessions to him at this stage mightimprove the prospects of an eventual settlement, although past experience suggested that he would merely regard them as evidenceof weakness and would use them as a point of departure for furtherdemands and renewed acts of aggression. On the other hand theUnited States were deeply committed to the success of their pea:ceinitiative and were naturally reluctant to prejudice this by bringingundue pressure to bear on Colonel Nasser. So far as the latter&apos;intentions were concerned, he must surely recognise, whatever hiswishes might be, that his forces would be incapable of undertakinglarge-scale offensive action for a long time to come.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in thediscussion.Arms supplies for SouthAfrica(previous reference:CM (70) 8thConclusions,Minute 3)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen little change since the Cabinet had last considered the situation.The opposition of certain other members of the commonwealth to the sale of arms to South Africa by Britain was being led by thePresident of Tanzania, Mr. Nyerere. To him, and to those who supported him, the issue had become an essentially symbolic one,
NorthernIreland(previous reference:CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 4)since they regarded any sale of arms to South Africa as a declarationof support for white supremacy in and of opposition to Africanaspirations. It seemed useless, therefore, to argue that we did not intend to supply equipment which could be used for internalrepression or for aggression against South Africa&apos;s Africanneighbours; or that the quantities involved were in fact likely to be small. Not all African countries, however, took quite such anuncompromising view; Kenya, in particular, had shown someunderstanding of the considerations of defence policy by which wewere influenced. Further discussions with Commonwealth countries were now in progress. They would continue during the autumnmonths, in which it was likely that President Nyerere would visitLondon on his way to the General Assembly of the United Nations.As a result it might be possible to induce at least some of the countries concerned to accept that we must be free to act as we judged bestin a matter where our defence interests were involved and that thiswas not an issue justifying action which might result in the virtualdestruction of the Commonwealth. But the attitude of a numberof countries, including India and Ceylon, was unpredictable; andit was possible that those countries who took a more balanced viewmight be reluctant to resist pressure from the advocates of more extreme courses. Officials would shortly be completing a comprehensive review of the balance of British interests in SouthAfrica on the one hand and in the independent African countries on the other hand; and this review, together with a study of the strategic importance of the Cape route and of the extent to whicharms sales could be represented as an integral element in the effectiveworking of the Simonstown Agreement, would be submitted in thenear future to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee in preparation for further consideration by the Cabinet of the issues involved.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet would wish to resume discussion of this question afterthe studies by officials had been considered by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed to resume their discussion after the studies by officials had been considered by the Defence and overseas policy Committee.The Home Secretary said that the past few weeks had beenrelatively uneventful and the main season for political demonstrationsand processions had come to an end comparatively quietly. There-establishment of police authority in the Bogside area of
Londonderry and the Catholic areas of Belfast had been accomplishedsuccessfully; and a number of the recent searches for arms therehad in fact been carried out by the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC). One problem likely to arise in connection with the police in the near future would be the replacement as Chief Constable ofthe RUC of Sir Arthur Young, who would shortly return to his duties as Commissioner of Police for the City of London; and thiswould raise the question whether he should be relieved by anUlsterman or by another police officer from Great Britain.But, while there had been a modest improvement in the security situation, political developments continued to give cause for anxiety;and the risk of violent action by extreme Nationalists remained.Right-wing elements in the Ulster Unionist Party had succeeded in achieving a significant erosion of support for the Northern IrelandPrime Minister, Major Chichester-Clark; and there were rumoursthat the Ulster Unionist Council would shortly be convened in orderto pass a vote of no confidence in him. In sum, the general outlookseemed a little more promising; but there was no doubt that a largeBritish military presence in Northern Ireland would be required fora considerable time to come.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe need to maintain a substantial security force in Northern ireland was having a serious effect on Army training and in the longer termmight also have adverse repercussions on efficiency and morale. Inpresent circumstances, however, there was no alternative. the difficult summer months had on the whole passed off reasonablycalmly; and the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the HomeSecretary on the skill with which he had handled the situation overa potentially dangerous period.The Cabinet-(4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.SECRETIndustrial 3.   The Secretary of State for Employment and ProductivityAffairs sa^ that s0 far jn igjQ faQ number of strikes and of days&apos; worklost through strikes had been very much greater than in previous years, and there was no prospect of an early improvement. Therealso appeared to be a disquieting trend towards strikes of greaterduration. Militancy was also continuing to be rewarded with,success, as for example in the unofficial strike at the works of Guest,Keen, Nettlefold-Sankey Limited (GKN-Sankey) at Wellington,Shropshire.  The new offer made by the employers in joint talks
121363Bon 2 September would give workers increases at once of from  2to  4 10s. a week, becoming  3 to  7 a week when incentive schemes were introduced; this would represent an average increase in pay of about 25 per cent. The current theme for those seeking pay increases was comparability, which could lead to a rapid spread of substantial pay claims; and since very different pay levels for thesame work in the same industry was indeed inequitable, the claimscould not be dismissed as wholly unreasonable. However, thedisparities in pay in different factories in the same company were oftenin practice accompanied by substantial disparities in productivity and, in any event, the country simply could not afford the increasesinvolved in conceding immediate parity. Against the pressure forexcessive pay increases, it would be necessary for employers,including the Government, to offer strong resistance repeatedly asingle successful test case would not be enough. The next importantpay claim coming to a head in the public sector was, unfortunately,that of the local authority manual workers, where the government did not control the Local Authority Associations and these in turncould not control all their individual members. There was a risk that individual local authorities might break ranks and yield to thetrade unions&apos; excessive demands in the face of selective strike action.At that day&apos;s meeting with the trade unions, the local authorityemployers as a body would not be making any significant advance on their last offer of a 13 per cent increase in pay and the tradeunions would probably not accept this offer; accordingly a breakdown in negotiations must be expected. In order to show thatthe Government still adhered to its declared policy of holding out against unreasonable pay demands, he proposed that, once the talkshad broken down, the Government should make it plain that itsupported the local authority employers&apos; determination not to go beyond the generous terms already offered to their manual workers.For the longer term, he was continuing the preparation of an industrial Relations Bill on lines previously approved by Cabinet.He was also producing the draft of a consultative document for publication at the end of September or early in October and, sincethe draft Bill would necessarily take some time to produce, this document would give evidence of the Governmenfs firm intentionto carry through its previously declared proposals. The Bill wasnot being delayed by the need for formal consultation, but it required a great deal of detailed work and might not be ready for introduction into Parliament until early December. This however should make no difference to the date at which it would come into effect providedthat its second reading in the House of Commons took place beforethe Christmas recess.
LocalAuthorityManualWorkersThe effects of the Industrial Relations Act were likely to be felt only in the medium term. There would be a greater immediateimpact on industrial relations if the Government were to take early action to reduce substantially payments to strikers in the form of income tax repayments and social security benefits. He recommendedan urgent re-examination of this subject.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,although the nature of the industrial action likely to be taken bylocal authority manual workers was not yet known, it was reasonable to assume that, given the trade unions&apos; limited financial resources,strikes would be localised and concentrated on services where thewithdrawal of labour v/ould have the greatest effect. One possibilitywas a disruption of the burial and cremation services, where strongpublic emotion was likely to be roused; this however could beexpected to lose the trade unions public support. Sewage disposalcould also be readily disrupted, in particular where installationsdepended upon continuous pumping. The pollution of rivers andthe flooding of towns with undiluted sewage might be very earlyresults of such strike action. One special problem would be thepossible unreliability of the salaried staff of local authorities, who in previous unofficial strikes had assisted the management but mightnot do so in face of an official strike. Another service at risk wasrefuse disposal, but although there might be inconvenience if theservice were interrupted, it would be some time before a health riskdeveloped. His Department was offering advice to local authoritiesand preparations should be made for the use of Servicemen for workon sewage disposal, as and when that was required. But apart fromthis, very little further contingency planning could be underakenuntil particular strikes were threatened, and this would probably nothappen until after the annual conference of the Trades UnionCongress in the following week.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that the Governmentshould make a public declaration, possibly by way of guidance tothe Press, as soon as it was clear that negotiations had broken down.Such a statement would make it clear that the Government was ready to support the local authorities in standing firm on their presentpay offer and would assist them in maintaining essential services.It would also point out that pay increases for local authority workersnecessarily meant increases in local rates and in taxation. An early statement on these lines would show the Governmenfs determination to maintain the policy which they had announced at the end ofJuly and would serve as a warning to the trade union leaders whenthey were concerting their line on strike action over the localauthority pay claim in the course of the next week. It was also important to reassure the local authorities that the Governmentwould remain opposed to a higher pay settlement even if strikes
led to a serious disruption of local authority services and if therewere an extension of the strike to the hospital service also. Onthe other hand, it was argued that the local authority employers would themselves be presenting their case to the public as soon asnegotiations broke down, including the likely cost to the ratepayers,of which local authorities were fully conscious. An immediateGovernment statement would probably be misrepresented as anattack on the local authority workers, at a time when the GKN-Sankey settlement in the private sector was going through withoutany Government objection. The time for a Government statement would be when specific strike action was threatened. Meanwhile,however, the Government should be prepared to answer enquiriesfrom the Press on their attitude.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that if after a breakdown in negotiations between the localauthority employers and the trade unions there were Press enquiriesabout the Governments attitude, the response should be that theissue was one for the local authorities, who were engaged in the pay negotiations and the Government would certainly not be pressing the local authorities to improve on their existing reasonable offer.The response would also indicate that pay increases would, of course,have to be met by increased rates and taxation, and that if industrial action led to a demand for emergency services, government assistance would be made available to the local authorities. the ministerial Committee on Emergencies should ensure that all necessary preparations were made to provide assistance to localauthorities if industrial action was likely to lead to the disruptionof essential services.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity, in consultation with the Lord President andother Ministers principally concerned, to arrange for theissuing of guidance in response to Press questions, on thelines indicated in the summing up by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department toarrange for the Ministerial Committee on Emergenciesto consider what preparations were required and, as necessary, what assistance should be offered to localauthorities in maintaining essential services during anyindustrial action by their manual workers.In discussion, it was suggested that publication of the proposedconsultative document might not completely reassure the public ofthe Governments firm intention to legislate on industrial relations.
secret.* The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the economicsituation was particularly difficult, since a high level ofunemployment, which might normally be dealt with by measures ofeconomic expansion was being experienced concurrently with the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETTax RefundsandSupplementaryBenefit forStrikersEconomicAffairsAt a meeting with the Prime Minister on 1 September, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) had made it clearthat the TUC would oppose proposals on the lines of those approvedby the Cabinet, but since the cause of a number of major strikeshad been the rejection by trade union members of their leaders&apos;recommendations for a settlement, a number of trade union leadersmight not privately be averse to legislation which would help tomaintain agreed procedures for negotiation.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity to circulate as early as possible his proposalsfor a consultative document and the draft of a Bill on industrial relations.In discussion it was argued that public opinion was cominground to the view that payments from public funds were helping to create and prolong strikes and that this should not continue. Themost effective change would be an alteration in the present Pay as you Earn (PAYE) income tax arrangements so that strikers did not immediately receive tax refunds. There were, however, objectionsto a general change in the PA YE system in this direction and itwould be difficult to make a discriminatory change affecting strikersonly. Reductions in social security benefits, on the other hand,might be less acceptable to the public than changes in the tax system for this purpose because the benefits were intended to maintain thewives and children of strikers.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that action which would produce an early impact on thosecontemplating strike action was urgently needed. The ministers concerned should reconsider the possibility of reducing payments tostrikers from public funds.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department toarrange for the Ministerial Committee on Social services to reconsider at an early date the possibility of reducingpayments to strikers from public funds.
most severe bout of cost inflation since at least 1951. In Juneearnings were running at a level 12 per cent higher than a yearearlier; wage rates in July were running 10 per cent higher; andwage settlements in that month had yielded average increases of14 per cent. While the Trades Union Congress (TUC) claimed thatthe increases in wages stemmed from increases in the cost of living,prices had in fact risen by only 6^ per cent over the past year;and there had therefore been a substantial increase in net disposablereal incomes. Over the same period, however, the economy hadbeen growing only at some 2-3 per cent a year; and no practicableincrease in the rate of growth could, as the TUC had argued, enablewage increases of the current order to be absorbed without seriousinflation. In addition to urging measures to stimulate growth, therepresentatives of the TUC whom he had recently met had expressed concern that the Government were attempting to enforce a harshand discriminatory incomes policy in the public sector. It was important, therefore, to make it clear, as he had done to the TUC,that the Government were equally concerned to avoid inflationarywage increases in both the public and private sectors, although inthe former case they had the responsibility as employers directly or indirectly to act accordingly. The TUC had also been concerned about suggestions in the Press that we were heading for economicdisaster; and he had therefore made it clear to them, as the Secretaryof State for Employment and Productivity had previously done ina public statement, that economic disaster was not in prospect but might become so if the present rate of wage increases and costinflation continued for much longer. Demand was reviving,particularly in terms of personal consumption; retail sales had increased substantially in the second quarter of the year. This risein consumption was expected to continue. Unemployment, however,was high; and although this was partly due to the number of studentsregistering at this time of the year and to the availability of redundancy payments, some increase in the underlying trend hadbeen inevitable in the light of the sluggish growth of the economyover the last year. The Treasury, unlike the National Institute for economic and Social Research, did not expect any substantial furtherrise in unemployment on a seasonally corrected basis. Export orders in the engineering industries in the first half of 1970 were 17 percent higher than a year earlier; but, in view of the distortion of thetrade returns caused by the dock strike, it would not be easy toascertain for some months how the balance of visible trade wasmoving. There had been a  53 million surplus on the balance ofpayments in the second quarter of the year, compared with  150million in the first quarter.  There had been some recent pressure
on sterling; but this was not serious and had not entailed significantlosses to the reserves. For the future the Government must base their economic policy on resistance to excessive wage claims andon reductions in public expenditure which would enable them to fulfil their commitments to reduce direct taxation and eventually to remove the Selective Employment Tax (SET). Savings fromabolition of investment grants would largely have to be channelledback to companies in order to maintain their liquidity. Savingsrequired for tax reductions in the personal sector would, therefore,have to be found elsewhere. Public expenditure now absorbednearly 50-9 per cent of the gross domestic product compared with about 43 per cent in 1963-64.In these circumstances it would be premature to institute any immediate reflationary action. But, if it did prove necessary to doso, it would be possible to reflate at any time by, for example, relaxing the existing hire purchase regulations or using the Regulator to reduceindirect taxation. Any move to reflate the economy in advance ofthe publication of the results of the present public expenditure review,however, could well affect international confidence adversely.Moreover, present indications suggested that there would in any event be a moderate expansion between the present time and themiddle of the following year without the introduction of any special measures; and the use of the Regulator at this juncture to reduceindirect taxation would, of course, limit the scope for the reductions in direct taxation to which the Government were committed.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet would wish to resume their discussion of the economic prospects in the context of the forthcoming review of public expenditure. It would be necessary to consider carefully the totalimpact on individuals and families of the complex of changes proposed. It would also be important to ensure that the government&apos;s priorities were maintained; reductions must be concentrated on expenditure which the Government considered tobe unnecessary or less essential. Further consideration might begiven to the suggestion made in discussion that in future the statistics of our overseas trade and reserve position should be publishedquarterly rather than monthly.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4 September, 1970.
