CM 10 (70)secret the Cabinet 1-   The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, extended awarm welcome to Mr. John Davies, mp, on his appointment as  minister of Technology.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, in thelight of the recent agreement between the Royalist and the republican factions in the Yemen, we had decided to recognise theGovernment of the Yemen Arab Republic.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Sultanof Muscat and Oman had been overthrown in a palace revolution led by his son who had now replaced him. The coup had been effectedwith very little bloodshed, although the former Sultan himself hadbeen slightly wounded and was now recovering in hospital in britain. The new Ruler was likely to adopt more enlightenedpolicies than his father; and the change would be welcomed inMuscat itself and by the other Rulers in the Persian Gulf. It was our intention to give immediate recognition to the new regime.The Cabinet 1.  Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.Southern The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that hisAfrica Parliamentary statement in the previous week, announcing our intention to consider the sale of certain restricted categories of arms to South Africa, had been followed by strong reactions in certain other Commonwealth countries. President Nyerere of Tanzania had announced that, if Britain sold arms to South Africa, his country would leave the Commonwealth: and his lead had been followed byPresidents Kaunda of Zambia and Obote of Uganda. The attitudeof other Commonwealth countries was unpredictable. But thepossibility of similar action by India could not be discounted; andany lead given by India was likely to be followed by Ceylon. Thesituation had not been improved by premature disclosures of personal messages exchanged between the Prime Minister and other commonwealth Heads of State and Prime Ministers and by the intervention of the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau. On thebasis of emotional reactions and incomplete understanding ofour intentions a situation had developed which might seriouslythreaten the stability of the Commonwealth.   He had thereforeOverseaAffairsYemen ArabRepublicMuscat andOman11429
thought it advisable, in the debate in the House of Commons on22 July, to emphasise that we had not yet taken any final decisions and that the process of discussion within the Commonwealth would continue. The situation had been further complicated by the factthat the South African Defence Minister, Mr. Botha, had expressed a desire to modify the Simonstown Agreement with a view tosafeguarding any supplies of British arms to South Africa against possible changes of policy by successive British Governments. Itwas possible that, if the South African Government failed to obtainassurances on this point, they might decide that Britain could not be relied on as a source of arms supplies and might transfer all SouthAfrica&apos;s arms orders to other suppliers, in particular France. Itappeared, however, that the South African Prime Minister,Mr. Vorster, and the Foreign Minister, Dr. Muller, were reluctant atthis stage to adopt this extreme course, to which their Serviceadvisers were also opposed.In these circumstances our first step should perhaps be to obtain further clarification from the South African Government of theirviews on the Simonstown Agreement and the arrangements whichthey envisaged for safeguarding continuity in the supply of arms.Inquiries on this point were already in train: and, in the light of theSouth African reply, we should have to establish whether they stillproposed to order arms from us (and, if so, what types) or whetherthey had decided to rely on other sources of supply. If they stillwished to place orders in the United Kingdom, we should have toconsider how we might meet their wishes and achieve our primary object of safeguarding the Cape sea route without further threateningthe cohesion of the Commonwealth. Much of the trouble had arisen because the African Commonwealth countries had not onlymisinterpreted our intentions but were imperfectly acquainted withthe facts. They seemed, for example, to be unaware of theco-operation in defence matters with South Africa which had existedunder the previous British Administration even after the impositionof the arms embargo. They did not realise the threat to both our interests and their own which were posed by Soviet naval expansion.Nor, probably, did they appreciate the advantages to be derived,from their point of view as well as ours, from a continuance of the simonstown Agreement, which provided inter alia that SouthAfrican naval forces would be placed under British command in theevent of war. An intensive effort was therefore needed to removemisapprehensions about our policies and to inform other Common-wealth countries about the background against which our decisions would have to be taken. For this purpose it might be useful if the presidents of Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda could be invited to visitLondon, possibly on their way to or from the autumn meeting of theUnited Nations General Assembly. It might be possible to find some
earlier occasion for personal discussions of this kind; but there wasa risk that, if the three Presidents came to London before theOrganisation of African Unity (OAU) meeting in August or themeeting of Heads of non-aligned States in Lusaka in September andif we then failed to convince them, the atmosphere at thesesubsequent meetings might be exacerbated. It might be preferable,therefore, to try to avoid being forced into any categorical statementof policy in regard to South Africa until after the commonwealth prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in Singapore in January 1971. If we were able in the interval to secure a greater degree of understanding ofour aims we might be able at the Singapore Meeting to gain ameasure of support from those Commonwealth members who took a less extreme and emotional view.In terms of our policy towards southern Africa as a whole a balance had to be struck between our interests in South Africa onthe one hand and in the Black African countries on the other hand;and we must make an assessment of the relative risks involved inthe various policies open to us. Studies on these lines were being put in hand. In the last resort, however, we must retain our freedom to take our own decisions on defence and foreign policy,even though we must also take account of world opinion. Animportant factor in the situation was Rhodesia. The Governmentwere committed to making a further attempt to establish whether asettlement of the Rhodesian problem was possible; and the leader of the illegal regime, Mr. Ian Smith, had given clear indications thathe was expecting discussions to this end. Any exchanges of this kindmight preferably be put in train before the necessity arose inNovember to renew the provisions of Section 2 of the SouthernRhodesia Act, 1965. In the longer term, however, a major effort of conciliation was required in southern Africa. The prospects of ageneral settlement in this area as a whole would require further detailed study; but one way of promoting it might be by way of aseries of agreements between the European-dominated States andtheir African-ruled neighbours directed to proscribing aggression andsubversive activities. Britain could perhaps hope to play a part in encouraging the development of such a system, with a view tocreating a larger framework in which such issues as arms for SouthAfrica and the Rhodesian problem would fall into better perspectiveand be susceptible of treatment in a less emotional climate than atpresent.In discussion it was suggested that pressure in Parliament forsome further clarification of the Governmenfs intentions about armssales to South Africa was likely to revive during the autumn. The
South African Government, for their part, might press us about theinterpretation of the Simonstown Agreement and about assuranceson continuity of supplies. If they applied for a licence in respect ofthe export of a specific item of equipment, a decision might be forcedon us; and, although there were arguments in favour of deferring afinal decision until after the Singapore Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, this might prove to be impossible. A furtherconsideration against delay was that, if we postponed a decision until after the Singapore Meeting, this might encourage those Common-wealth countries which took an extreme attitude on the SouthAfrican question to use the Conference in order to try to bring pressure to bear on us.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thefirst step was to ascertain the intentions of the South african government as regards safeguards for the continuity of arms supplies and to establish whether they would be likely to abandonBritain as a source of supply and turn to other countries if we were unable to give them the assurances which they required. If thisprove to be the case, a new situation would be created. But, on theassumption that the South African Government still wished to obtainarms from us, we should have, as a next step, to seek to ensure thatthe outcome of the OAU conference and the Lusaka meeting of heads of non-aligned States was as little detrimental as possible toour interests. We should also consider inviting the Presidents ofTanzania, Zambia and Uganda to visit London on their way to theUnited Nations General Assembly.The Cabinet-(2) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign  and Commonwealth  Secretary toproceed accordingly.IndustrialAffairsNationalDocksDispute(previous reference:CM (70) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that a dock delegate conference on 29 July had voted, bya majority, in favour of accepting the recommendations of the Courtof Inquiry into the docks dispute and had called for a resumptionof normal working in the docks on Monday, 3 August. The press had given prominence to the impression created by the leadership of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (TGWU) that theterms of the pay settlement were more generous than the employershad indicated. In fact the real difference between the interpretations
of the two parties was very small. Some dockers, particularly at liverpool, Southampton and London might try to continue the strike on an unofficial basis. But it seemed unlikely that this action bymilitants would win general support; and by early in the following week the ports should be back to normal working. The Governmentwould need to consider the revocation of the Proclamation of a Stateof Emergency; but it would be preferable to defer this step until therehad been a general resumption of work. In the meantime theServicemen who were ready for work in the docks couldprogressively be stood down; and, while no public announcement should be made, the Press could be discreetly informed to this effect.During the negotiations before the strike he had agreed to a request from the TGWU leadership to consider sympathetically an inquiry into the definition of dock work, if such a proposal was madeat some future date. The recommendations made by a Committeeon the subject under Mr. Peter Bristow, which had been appointedby the employer and trade union members of the port transport industry, did not offer a useful basis for action. It might be appropriate, however, to link a further inquiry into this subject withan examination of the future of the dock labour scheme; and bothissues might best be pursued after the completion of the currentphase of negotiations on stage II of the measures of portmodernisation recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into thePort Transport Industry (the Devlin Committee), i.e., in about ayear&apos;s time.The Minister of Transport said that there was a risk thatunofficial strikes might continue in some ports despite the TGWUcall for a return to work. In these ports there were several shipsv/ith cargoes of food awaiting unloading. In these circumstances theGovernment should not yet surrender the special powers required todeal with an emergency. Even without the strike a number of britain&apos;s ports would have been in a difficult financial situation; and measures to deal with this problem should be worked out beforeconsideration was given to a new inquiry on the definition of dockwork.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Guidance should be given to the Press on the correctinterpretation of the pay settlement in the docks with a view tocountering the impression that the strike had been successful andthat it had established a new standard for a general  20 a weekminimum wage.(b) The Proclamation of a State of Emergency should not be revoked until after 3 August; but, if there was a general return to
work, it would be difficult to justify the retention of emergency powers thereafter in order to deal with unofficial action in one ortwo ports. Parliament had been assured that the State of Emergencywould be terminated at the earliest possible date.(c) The supply of urgent requirements of food to the Orkneyshad not yet been arranged; and there was still likely to be some difficulty in making arrangements for this purpose either throughAberdeen or through Leith. It was not certain, however, that supplies of the items in question would be exhausted as quickly ashad earlier been reported. The TGWU leaders had undertaken onthe afternoon of 29 July to use their best endeavours to ensure thaturgently needed deliveries took place; and, if the dockers did not co-operate at once, it would still be possible to have deliveries madeto the Orkneys at short notice by aircraft or naval vessels.The Prime Minister, summing up the discusion, said that theCabinet wished to congratulate the Secretary of State for Employ-ment and Productivity on the successful resolution of the nationaldocks dispute. He should now try to ensure that the Press receiveda correct interpretation of the settlement. Provided that there wasa satisfactory response on Monday to the TGWU&apos;s call for a returnto work in the docks, the Proclamation of a State of Emergencycould be revoked on Tuesday, 4 August. In the meantime theMinistry of Defence could arrange to stand down most of theServicemen at present on call for work in the docks, provided that sufficient numbers remained at the immediate disposal of ministers to allow their introduction to perform essential services in the docksif strike action continued after the weekend. No public statementneed be made about the redisposition of Servicemen. preparations should be made, however, for delivering urgently needed supplies tothe Orkneys after the weekend by the use of aircraft or naval vessels,in case the normal service could not be provided through the ports.There might be advantage in the Governmenfs taking a reasonablyearly initiative to arrange an inquiry into the definition of dock workand the future ofthe dock labour scheme; and this possibility shouldbe further considered.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity, in consultation with the Lord President ofthe Council, to arrange for the Press to receive guidance on the correct interpretation of the settlement reached inthe national docks dispute.
11429B(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Employment and Productivity, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Statefor Defence, to establish the requirements of the Orkneysfor urgently needed food supplies which could not be delivered by the normal services and to arrange, ifnecessary, for them to be transported by aircraft or naval vessels on or after 3 August.(4) Invited the Minister of State for Defence to arrange for thereturn of Servicemen to their normal assignments on thebasis indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.(5) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Employment and Productivity andthe Minister of Transport, to consider on 4 Augustwhether the Proclamation of a State of emergency should be revoked; and to arrange for the Prime Ministerto be informed of their conclusion.(6) Invited the Minister of Transport to prepare an earlyassessment of the financial position of the port authorities; and the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity to arrange, on its completion, toconsider, in consultation with the Minister of Transport,whether the Government should initiate an inquiry intothe definition of dock work and the future of the dock labour scheme.London The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity saidAirport jkaj- a qouti 0f inquiry, which had recently presented a report on the pay of firemen at London Airport, was due to present on 7 Augusta further report on the dispute over the granting of contracts toGeneral Aviation Services Limited to carry out certain work atLondon Airport. This, like the report on firemen&apos;s pay, would verylargely reject the arguments of the trade unions; and this secondrejection of their claims might lead to some disruption of operations at London Airport in the near future.The Cabinet-(7) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity on the possibility ofindustrial action at London Airport.
PublicServicePay(previous reference:CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet had invited him,in consultation with the other Ministers most closely concerned, toconsider the most appropriate timing of the publication of the TenthReport of the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of theHigher Civil Service, together with the Governmenfs decision onthe issues involved and on the pay of Board members of nationalised industries. He had prepared a draft of an announcement whichmight be released on the following day; but it would be acceptablefor it to be deferred until the following week if necessary. the government&apos;s decision on the related question of the pay of thehigher judiciary should not, however, be announced until thenecessary Order was laid before Parliament in due course.The Minister of State for Defence said the Cabinet had askedfor further consideration to be given to the possibility of referringthe pay of senior officers of the Armed Forces to the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI). It was now envisaged that the nbpi should be asked to make an early report on this matter under their standing reference; and this decision also might be included inthe proposed announcement.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that it had beensuggested at a separate meeting of Ministers that the Governmenfsconclusions about doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay, on which he had hadconsultations with the Chairman and Secretary of the British medical association, might be announced at the same time. This announce-ment, too, could be deferred, if necessary, until the following week.In discussion it was the general view that the announcementsinvolved should be made during the second half of the following week. It was suggested, however, that successive statements of the government&apos;s decisions might attract less public attention and carryless risk of provoking repercussions on other pay demands than onecomprehensive announcement. It should in any case be made clearthat the awards in question represented the final stages of the implementation of pay proposals which had been at issue duringthe tenure of office of the previous Administration. In theannouncement relating to the Higher Civil Service and nationalised industry Board members it might be preferable to avoid specifyingthe present and new salary levels in detail.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the Governmenfs decisions on the pay of theHigher Civil Service and of nationalised industry Board members,the decision to invite the NBPI to make a further report on the pay of senior officers in the Armed Forces and the further award todoctors and dentists should be announced during the latter part of
IndustrialRelationsLegislation(previous reference:CM (70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Employment and Productivity (CP (70) 30) presentingproposals for reforming the legal framework which regulatedindustrial relations.The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity saidthat the Government were committed to introducing legislation onthe subject in the present session of Parliament. The Bill would need to have its Second Reading before Christmas. In order toprepare for the necessary prior consultation with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) inSeptember and for the work to be done by the Parliamentarydraftsman it was necessary to decide forthwith on the BilPs main principles and its major and most controversial provisions. when in Opposition the Conservative Party had published in &quot; Fair Dealat Work &quot; detailed proposals for action. It would be necessary tomodify, and to supplement, these proposals in certain respects; butfor the most part the new legislation would incorporate them in full.A new Industrial Court should be set up to administer theproposed statute, with the existing Industrial Tribunals as a lower level in order to deal with cases arising out of industrial action in the11429b 2the following week. The Lord President, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Social Services, the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity and the Lord Privy Seal, should give further consideration to the timing and terms of these announce-ments having regard to the points made in discussion and shouldalso consider whether it would be preferable for the decisions to be announced simultaneously or in succession. Meanwhile, the lord privy Seal might inform the General Secretary of the Staff Side ofthe National Whitley Council, in confidence, that a decision on the pay of the Higher Civil Service would be announced in the courseof the following week.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Social Services, the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity and the Lord Privy Seal,to consider further the timing and terms of the necessarypublic announcement in the light of the points made in discussion.
circumstances of a trade dispute. The relationship between the new machinery and the existing Courts, together with other points of legalprocedure, would require further consideration in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor. In principle, however, any collective agreement should be presumed in future to be enforceable in theCourts unless both parties to it agreed otherwise. This was as recommended in &quot; Fair Deal at Work &quot;. The provision would nodoubt be strongly opposed by the trade unions; and, initially at least,few such agreements would be made. But the consequences in the longer term should be beneficial. With the same end in view andfor the purposes of more immediate action, it was proposed to implement a proposal based on a recommendation in the report bythe Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers, 1965-68(the Donovan Commission); and the Bill would therefore provide that, on application by the Secretary of State or by one of the negotiating parties, a procedural agreement could, if the Commissionon Industrial Relations (CIR) found it suitable for the purpose (withany necessary modifications), be made legally enforceable by theIndustrial Court. If so, the parties would be able to take proceedings in the Court for any breach of the agreement. In addition, theSecretary of State would have reserve powers to require employers to register collective agreements with his Department.The Bill would also provide that registered trade unions should,in general, have immunity from ordinary civil action in the courts and immunity in the Industrial Court for acts committed in furthering a trade dispute, including sympathetic strikes and strikesabout job demarcation and job assignment. The reasons for maintaining legal protection in relation to sympathetic strikes, whileremoving it in relation to secondary boycotts, were that the formermight often constitute a reasonable form of action by a trade union;that it would be difficult to define the particular types of sympatheticstrike to which protection should not be given; and that employersneeded to enjoy comparable protection in relation to thecorresponding action of sympathetic lock-outs to which theysometimes had to resort. The effect of these proposals would be thatthe trade unions would be liable to appear in ordinary civil orcriminal courts only on account of torts not committed in the context of a trade dispute or prosecutions for illegal picketing but that they and other persons seeking to call an unlawful strike would be subjectto restraint by the Industrial Court, which might include the award of damages or an injunction, the latter involving the possible sanction of imprisonment for non-compliance. Unlawful industrial action would be as defined in the sub-paragraphs to paragraph 20(b) of cp (70) 30. The Bill would provide for the right of individuals,separately or collectively, to withdraw their labour, subject only to
the existing risk of discipline by the employer or action for breach of contract. In order to emphasise that the proposed legal frameworkwould be confined to the civil, rather than to the criminal, spherethe Government should consider abolishing the existing criminal sanctions against strikers embodied in the Conspiracy and Protectionof Property Act, 1875, as amended in the Electricity Supply Act,1919. The protection from legal action provided in the TradesDisputes Act, 1965, for an individual threatening to induce a breach of contract of employment should be withdrawn; but it would bemade clear that the protection to be provided in the Bill for lawfulindustrial action would include threats to call a strike as well as theactual calling of a strike. The recommendation in &quot; Fair Deal atWork &quot; about trade union recognition would need to be extendedto cover the more complex problems of a situation in which therewas also an inter-union dispute. This was an important change,which went to the root of the problem of fragmented bargaining in industry. The Bill would provide that disputes about trade unionrecognition and bargaining structure could be referred by theSecretary of State, or by one of the parties, to the CIR for a recommendation on which trade union or unions should havenegotiating rights. A trade union could thereafter have the CIRrecommendations made binding by the Industrial Court, which,would make a decision on the issue on the basis of the majority vote in a ballot of the employees in question. If the employersubsequently refused to negotiate in good faith, the trade union would have the power unilaterally to ask for binding arbitration ona claim. On the other hand a trade union attempting to undermineestablished negotiating arrangements could be restrained by an injunction from the Industrial Court or could be sued for damagesby the employer. In disputes which might endanger the national interest the Secretary of State would be given power under the Bill,without necessarily having in advance a report on the subject froma Board of Inquiry, to apply to the Industrial Court for an injunction,valid for up to 60 days, against the individuals calling a strike Orlock-out. It was not proposed to maintain the recommendation in&quot; Fair Deal at Work &quot; that such disputes should be referred for compulsory arbitration; and the omission of the requirement for aBoard of Inquiry before the application by the Secretary of State tothe Industrial Court reflected the need to avoid delay and thepossibility, which was always open to the Secretary of State, to havea Court of Inquiry at any time. Non-compliance with an injunctioncould lead in the last resort to imprisonment for refusal to pay a fine; but the sanctions would be directed not against the strikersthemselves but only against those calling a strike.  As an addition
to the recommendations in &quot; Fair Deal at Work &quot; the Bill would givethe Secretary of State a general power, not limited to nationalemergencies but subject to authorisation by the Industrial Court, to demand a ballot before any major strike, if the views of the tradeunion members involved appeared not to have been adequatelycanvassed.The Bill would provide for a new Registrar with whom tradeunions would be required to register in order to qualify forlegal immunity. The Registrar would ensure that the rules of thetrade unions satisfied certain standards, including provision for anindependent hearing of complaints from individual members.Unfair dismissals, which would need to be defined with care, could,after attempts at conciliation, be the subject of an appeal to an industrial tribunal, which could recommend reinstatement or imposean award of compensation. Long service employees would benefit from a statutory requirement for a longer period of notice of termination than was at present provided under the Contracts ofEmployment Act, 1963; and the written statement required under that Act on the terms and conditions of employment should also setout an employee&apos;s basic rights and obligations, with particularemphasis on grievance procedure. The Bill should establish the rightto belong to an independent trade union; and any refusal orobstruction of this right by an employer would constitute grounds forproceedings before an industrial tribunal. The right not to belong to a trade union would be established by making the &quot; pre-entryclosed shop&quot; generally unlawful and by providing safeguards for individuals in a &quot; union shop&quot; agreement. The Bill would establish the CIR on a statutory basis and would re-name the existingIndustrial Court, whose functions differed from those of theproposed new Industrial Court. It would provide powers for theGovernment to establish codes of practice on the standards ofprocedure and behaviour required from management, employees andtrade unions and, as necessary, on other subjects, which might includethe disclosure to the trade unions of information needed for industrialbargaining. The Bill would require companies to discloseto employees the same amount of information which they were required to give to shareholders. Finally, it would amend the wages councils Act, in order to encourage the development of voluntarycollective bargaining.Since the intention of the Bill was to regulate industrial relationsit should not deal with arrangements for the levy on trade union members of contributions to political Parties. This might disappointsome of the Governmenfs supporters in Parliament; but it wouldanticipate the hostility of the Labour Opposition on a question not directly germane to the Bill&apos;s purpose. The provision for registering
the rules of trade unions and the activities of the Registrar as a formof Ombudsman, together with the safeguards which would berequired for individuals in &quot; union shops&quot;, would represent a contribution to the protection of individual trade unionists; and thiswould be seen to be an advance in the same direction as an intensification of direct control over the political levy. In spite ofthis one omission, the Bill would be a major political issue, whichwould provoke strong controversy and vigorous debate in the Houseof Commons. Once they had embarked upon it the Governmentwould have to carry it through to full enactment, whatever thepolitical battle or the industrial action which might ensue, in theconfidence that, when it reached the Statute Book, it would promotean improvement in industrial relations and would offer betterprospects for industrial peace. In discussion there was generalagreement that, in view of the importance of speeding the reform ofindustrial relations, the Bill should have its Second Reading before christmas. In order that the Governmenfs proposals should be presented to public opinion as a whole, it would be advisable to publish a consultative document before beginning detailedconsultations with the CBI and the TUGIn further discussion, the following main points were made:(a) The proposals on the enforceability of procedural agreementsmight deter unions from entering into such agreements; and theremust in any event be some risk of a union&apos;s ignoring an agreement which had been made binding against its will.(b) The proposed repeal of criminal sanctions under the Acts of1875 and 1919 would require further consideration in consultationwith the Law Officers.(c) The question of the extent to which the Bill should bind theCrown must be examined further in consultation with the lord privy Seal.(d) The omission of any provision dealing with political leviesmight be unwelcome to some of the Governmenfs supporters. Butit could be defended on the ground that the subject wasinappropriate to a Bill designed to give priority to the reform of industrial relations.(e) It might be unwise to insist that companies should berequired to provide their employees with the same information asthey gave their shareholders. On the other hand such information was readily obtainable by any member of the public; and firms mightprefer to be themselves the source of information provided to their employees.   The proposal that, those negotiating on behalf of
employees should have adequate information for bargainingpurposes was of greater importance; but this was better dealt within a code of practice than in the Bill.(/) The provision granting immunity to registered trade unions in relation to sympathetic strikes but not to secondary boycott action would need to be carefully drafted. A similar attempt in earlierlegislation had given rise to great difficulty and had not been successful.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that reform of industrial relations on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity in CP (70) 30 was of the first importance and that the necessary bill would need to be available for a Second Reading before Christmas.Its preparation and management in Parliament would require an intensive and determined effort; and the Secretary of State should therefore be authorised to embark forthwith on the preparation of drafting instructions and of a consultative document. the consultative document should be brought before the Cabinet earlyin September. The Ministerial Committee on Industrial relations should give further consideration to any questions arising from the cabinet&apos;s discussion or from later consultations which required a modification of the proposals as they now stood.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary  of  State for Employment  and productivity:(i) to prepare instructions for the drafting of an industrial Relations Bill, in consultation as necessary with other Ministers, on the lines indicated in their discussion;(ii) to circulate for the Cabinefs approval, as early aspossible in September, the draft of a consultative document which would be given generalpublication.PublicServiceand ArmedForcesSECRET6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (70) 28) on public service and armed forces&apos; pensions.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government were committed by their Manifesto at the General Election to reduce from 60 to 55the minimum age at which public service pensions increases became
11429cpayable; to bring the pensions of those who retired before 1956 upto the same level as if they had retired then, with appropriateincreases since; and to protect the purchasing power of pensions forthe future by biennial reviews. Further study, however, had shownthat, because a succession of Pensions (Increase) Acts hadconcentrated on helping those who had been retired longest, theadoption of 1956 as the base year would perpetuate a series ofanomalies. It was therefore proposed, instead, that the oldestpensions should be brought up to 1946 levels and that all pensionsfrom that date onwards should have their original purchasing powerrestored as at 1 April, 1969. This change would add substantially to the cost of the proposal; and means of reducing it had therefore been examined. The rapid rise in the cost of living made it essentialto introduce a Pension (Increase) Bill early in the New Year toupdate pensions to 1 April, 1971; but it was proposed that the increases should only be payable from 1 September, 1971. It wasalso proposed to defer for the time being the promised reduction inthe minimum age to 55, while taking powers to introduce the change from a date to be determined and making clear that this would bedone within the lifetime of the present Parliament. The Governmentwould be criticised on both points. But they had a reasonable case;and the cost would be reduced by some  35 million in the first year.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposals,although expensive, represented the least which the Governmentcould do to redeem their Election pledge. Deferring the reductionin the minimum age to 55 was politically unattractive and mightimpede to some extent the reorganisation of the Diplomatic Service.But the sum of  6- 8 million a year which it would save was significant; and the Government would at least make it clear thatthey intended to effect the change during the present Parliament.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved CP (70) 28. The Lord Privy Seal should consider,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Social Services andthe other Ministers concerned, when it would be appropriate to announce the substance of the proposals.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP (70) 28.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider, in consultation withthe Lord President, the Secretary of State for social services and the other Ministers concerned, when a public statement of the Governmenfs intentions would best bemade.
NationalisedIndustriesPricesElectricityand steel prices(previous reference:CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential . The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of technology (CP (70) 29) and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP (70) 31) about the consequential effects of higher coal prices onthe charges for electricity and steel.The Minister of Technology said that some four-fifths of any increase in the price of coking, industrial and electricity coals would fall on the Electricity Boards and the British Steel Corporation(BSC), who must be allowed to pass the increases on unless adversepublicity was to be invited merely for the sake of a transfer ofburdens within the public sector. The Electricity Council had nowproposed that from 1 October electricity prices should be increasedby about 0-15d. per unit (7 per cent) on all sales except those to large consumers whose tariffs were linked to coal prices. In theabsence of such an increase the tariff would become increasinglydistorted at the expense of the industrial consumer. This proposal would recover the cost of a 12^- per cent coal price increase, togetherwith the unrecovered costs of the last two such increases. It would yield  20 million in 1970-71 and over  50 million in a full year. Theelectricity industry, which had not raised prices generally since september 1967 had done much to absorb cost increases; and the realisation of further possible cost savings would take time.Meanwhile, a shortfall of some  80 million against the industry&apos;financial objective (with revenues barely covering interest charges)might be expected in the current year, assuming a coal price increaseof 12Jr per cent, but making no allowance for a possible pay settlement in the autumn. Only  20 million would be offset if theproposed increase in the electricity tariff was approved. Theproposed increase could be presented as deriving from the coal price increase; and it should avoid the need for any further nation-widetariff change until 1971-72. As regards steel the BSC, which had suffered losses of  42 million in its first two financial years, was nowexpecting a profit of no more than  35 million in the current yearand would still be unable, therefore, to pay a dividend on its 700 million of public dividend capital, despite the present world demand for steel. As a result the Corporation were now consideringproposals for raising British steel prices closer to those in Europe, in place of their previous intention to make limited price increasescovering only the cost of the projected higher price of coking coal.Although there was room for improvement in the performance ofthe BSC and the electricity industry, and studies to this end hadalready been put in hand, price increases were unavoidable at this juncture in order to avoid damage to the industries&apos; financial prospects. It was therefore proposed that the Electricity Council andthe BSC should be allowed to put their proposals to their respective
Consumer Councils, on the basis that the Governmenfs position was reserved pending further consideration in the light of the council&apos;s&apos; report.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that electricity prices in Scotland were already being raised. Higher coal prices would therefore necessitate a further increase and could either generatedemands to accelerate the conversion of Scottish power stations tooil firing, which would be damaging to the Scottish coal industry,or alternatively lead to pressure for the price of electricity coal inScotland to be lowered, whether by removal of the regionaldifferential or by a direct subsidy.In discussion it was argued that reference of the projectedelectricity and steel price increases to Consumer Councils before theCoal Consumers Council had reported might suggest that theGovernment had already accepted the proposed coal price increase.On the other hand it was important that associated price increases for electricity and steel should take effect as quickly as possible after a decision to raise coal prices; and this required the industries&apos;proposals to be referred to the Consumer Councils now. Insanctioning this step, however, the Government should ensure thatthey were not committed to accept the proposals, and should seek to arrange with the industries and the Councils that the proposals were not disclosed prematurely before the Councils had consideredthem, in order to avoid a damaging succession of prematuredisclosures such as had attended the recent discussion of increases inpostal charges. The Minister of Technology should discuss with the bsc whether acceptance of their latest proposal would enable themto avoid applying for a further price increase for at least another12 months.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the proposed price increases for electricity andsteel might be put to the Consumer Councils concerned. But itshould be made clear that the Government were not committed tothese increases or to the increases in coal prices on which they werecontingent. The points raised by the Secretary of State for scotland in paragraphs 4 and 5 of CP (70) 31 should be discussed with theMinister of Technology and should be taken into account in thegeneral review of the Governmenfs fuel policy which the Ministeralready had in hand.
The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up  of their discussion and invited the  Minister of technology and the Secretary of State for Scotland to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31 July, 1970.
