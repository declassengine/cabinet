OverseaAffairsKidnapping ofUnited King-dom trade commissioner,MontrealPreviousReference:CM (70) 31stConclusions,Minute 2Middle east previous reference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute 1The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during his visit to New York to attend the 25th Anniversary celebrations ofthe United Nations he had discussions with the Foreign ministers of France, the Soviet Union and the United States, the other three powers concerned in the Four-Power negotiations about theArab-Israel problem. Their discussions had been inconclusive andhad ended with the issue of a communique calling for an earlyreactivation of the mission of the United Nations Secretary-GeneraFsSpecial Representative, Dr. Jarring. It was unlikely, however, that dr. Jarring would be able to resume his activities very soon. Duringthe meeting the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, had urged the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, to put further pressure on the Government of Israel. Mr. Rogers had repliedthat the United States Government considered that they had alreadygone to the limit in this respect. The discussions had thus ended indeadlock. The situation was not improved by the fact that the israeli Prime Minister, Mrs. Golda Meir, in conversation with theUnited States President, Mr. Nixon, and Mr. Rogers had indicated that the Government of Israel would be unwilling to begin discussions with Dr. Jarring until the United Arab Republic (UAR) had removed from the cease-fire zone along the Suez Canal at least some of themissiles which had been deployed there in contravention of thecease-fire agreements. The Government of the UAR, however,appeared to be increasing the deployment of missiles. The position was therefore not encouraging. Mr. Gromyko had indicated,however, that the Soviet Union might in certain circumstances beprepared to guarantee the security of Israel; and some progressmight be possible on these lines if the Soviet Government could be induced to modify their insistence on the complete withdrawal ofIsraeli forces from all territories occupied since 5 June, 1967, andto recognise the necessity of minor rectifications designed to giveSECRET1. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theCanadian Government had been conducting a wide-ranging securityoperation against the Front de Liberation Quebecois (FLQ),involving the detention and questioning of some 400 people. Butthere was no further news of the United Kingdom trade commissioner in Montreal, Mr. Cross; and the fact that there hadbeen no message from him for five days was not encouraging. TheCanadian Government had expressed their appreciation of the restraint which we had shown and had indicated that they would welcome any suggestions for further action that we might wish tomake. For the present, however, we had no proposals to putforward. During his visit to New York, he had telephonedMrs. Cross, who was enduring her ordeal with courage and dignity.
Arms supplies to SouthAfrica;discussions with AfricanCommonwealthLeadersPreviousReference:CM (70) 12thConclusions,Minute 2Israel defensible frontiers. He would be pursuing this question withMr. Gromyko, who would be arriving in London for discussions that day.Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly debate onthe Middle East would shortly be beginning and was expected to last about a fortnight. It was likely that in the course of the debate the Afro-Asian countries might table amendments calling for thetotal withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories.If so, we might be placed in a difficult position and should have totake our stand on the terms of the General Assembly&apos;s resolution no. 242 of 22 November, 1967.The Cabinet-CD Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during the visit which the Prime Minister and he himself had just paid to new York they had been able to meet almost all the AfricanCommonwealth leaders with whom discussion had not previously been held, with the exception of the Nigerian Foreign Minister,Mr. Arikpo, who would, however, shortly be visiting London. Ingeneral the African leaders had shown little appreciation of the realities of the situation as regards Soviet penetration of the indian ocean. They did not accept that, e.g., the Soviet intervention in czechoslovakia in 1968 offered any analogy; and they appearedgenuinely to believe that the gradual extension of Soviet naval power in the Indian Ocean area did not present them with any threat whichthey could not keep under control. They appeared to be obsessedwith the issue of racialism in South Africa to an extent whichblinded them to the Communist threat and made rational discussionvirtually impossible. While they were prepared to admit that the simonstown Agreement should not be abrogated, they did not accept that it imposed on us any obligation to supply arms to South africa and they had argued that we should not do so. They had pointedout that South Africa could in any case obtain arms from other sources, e.g. France; and they had argued that South Africa neededBritish support too much to denounce the Agreement if we refusedto supply arms. A disquieting feature of the discussions was theextent to which the African leaders especially the President ofTanzania, Mr. Nyerere, and the President of Zambia, Mr. Kaunda appeared to have abandoned any idea of co-existence with SouthAfrica. They seemed to consider themselves as being in a state ofvirtual war with South Africa; and they saw no alternative to theuse of such limited force as they could bring to bear, for example,through support for the so-called &quot; freedom fighters &quot;. In thesecircumstances, they had been wholly unresponsive to our suggestions that they should accept the South African offer of a non-aggression pact, even if we were in some way associated with it. In the long
CM 32 (70)term, it might be possible to secure African acquiescence in oursupplying arms to South Africa on the basis that we were providingreplacements for existing equipment; and we might then hope tomove on to a less restrictive policy. But this was likely to be a difficult and protracted matter; and our approach to the whole problem would require to be further discussed by the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that it had been clear in New York thatthe Commonwealth African leaders had been intensively canvassingfor the support of other Commonwealth representatives. The&quot; Francophone&quot; Africans on the other hand, had taken a morerelaxed view of the South African problem and were less obsessedwith the racial issue.In discussion, some concern was expressed that the Governmentof Nigeria, who had hitherto not taken a prominent part incontroversy on the South African issue, now appeared to be becoming more openly opposed to the supply of arms by Britain. This mighthave repercussions on our important economic interests in Nigeria.An opportunity for stating our case would arise during the NigerianForeign Minister^ forthcoming visit to London; and furtherconsideration should also be given to the possibility of a visit toNigeria by a British Minister.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of policy in regard toarms supplies to South Africa at an appropriate time.Visit of the The Prime Minister said that during his visit to New York hefotoe UnitT1 kac* a discussion with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. secretary,Nations *n which useful progress had been made on trade policy generally and, in particular, as regards our common interest in seeking toensure that the United States Government should not, as a resultof legislation now in contemplation (the &quot; Mills Bill&quot;), adopt anunduly restrictive attitude towards textile imports.The Prime Minister said that in discussions with the Irish PrimeMinister, Mr. Lynch, the latter had told him that the acquittal inthe recent arms smuggling case of the defendants who includedone of his own ex-Ministers had put him in a difficult position. he now faced the risk that an attempt might be made in the Dail to challenge his Government, possibly on his proposals for an incomes policy. If the Government were to be defeated, his Administrationmight not survive the ensuing General Election.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister.SECRET128791-2 B*
CONFIDENTIALIndustrialAffairsLocalAuthorityManualWorkers&apos;Pay DisputePreviousReference:CM (70) 31stConclusions,Minute 12. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that on23 October the Government had been advised that there was a healthhazard in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, where large pilesof rubbish contained decaying offal. The local authority had been unable to make arrangements to deal with this situation and had asked for Government assistance. After consultation with the tradeunions concerned at national level had confirmed that their localmembers would not help to remove the rubbish, Servicemen hadbeen deployed during the early hours of 24 October to clear it.There had been no other requests for assistance from localauthorities; and in general sewage systems were being kept working.A continuous check was being maintained on the quality of riverwater; and there was still no serious increase in pollution.Nevertheless, the need for action similar to that which had beentaken at Tower Hamlets could arise at any moment.Meanwhile Sir Jack Scamp had been appointed by the localauthority employers and the trade unions to preside over anindependent inquiry into the pay dispute. Only some 14 localauthorities, nearly all of which were controlled by the Labour Party,had agreed to concede the full amounts claimed by the manual workers&apos; trade unions. Some other authorities had made public statements in support of further negotiations on the claim; but theywere only a small minority of the total number of local authorityemployers.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that a number of judgeshad been approached by the parties to the pay dispute in the search for a chairman of the Committee of Inquiry; but, on being told thatthe Government would not wish to take any action either to assistor to hinder the inquiry, they had very properly rejected the request.Sir Jack Scamp, before accepting the chairmanship, had beeninformed by the Department of Employment that the Governmentcould express no view whether or not he should undertake the taskbut that there might well be a Government statement at some point about the element of national interest in the dispute. It was perhapsfor consideration whether the Government should encourageSir Jack Scamp to call at once for a return to work while the Inquirytook place. On the other hand it was probably preferable that the government&apos;s dissociation from the Committee of Inquiry shouldcontinue, in order that they might remain free to criticise its recommendations if they were unsatisfactory. Sir Jack Scampwould be likely in any event to wish to follow the usual practice of committees of inquiry in calling for a return to work; but he might find difficulty in doing so if it were known that the Government had tried to influence him in this direction.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment should leave it to Sir Jack Scamp to decide whether tocall for a return to work while the Committee of Inquiry took place.But Ministers should take every opportunity of reinforcing in public the view already expressed by the Government that the employers&apos;pay offer was generous and that the actual earnings of local authority manual workers were not in general as low as the references in thePress to their basic pay scales suggested. Although dissociatingthemselves from the Committee of Inquiry, the Government werenot adopting a position of neutrality; and their views on the dangerof inflationary pay awards should be put forward when occasionoffered.The Committee (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Employment and theSecretary of State for the Environment, to circulatefactual information about the pay rates and earnings oflocal authority manual workers, including the pay offerlast made by the local authority employers.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theresult of the ballot by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)on the pay offer by the National Coal Board (NCB) had been a vote of 55 per cent for a strike and 45 per cent against a strike, on a pollof over 90 per cent. The NUM were displeased that an inadequatemajority for an official strike had resulted; and it seemed probablethat after the meeting between the NUM leaders and the NCBChairman which was due to take place on 27 October there wouldbe some unofficial strike action. Its extent could not at present before seen; but it could cause serious damage to the country&apos;s fuel and power supplies in the coming winter. The Government could seek to insist on the NCB&apos;s adhering to the terms of the pay offer onwhich the NUM ballot had been conducted, with a risk of unofficial strikes on a substantial scale. The alternative was arbitration, towhich the NCB had earlier raised no objection. This however,would be likely to result in a more generous pay award. It mightbe possible, however, to avert both these dangers by allowing theNCB to offer the NUM not an immediate increase in pay as suchbut a bonus to be paid in mid-1971 if total output in the first halfof that year equalled or exceeded the corresponding figure for 1970(which had been secured by a larger labour force). This could properly be presented as a genuine productivity agreement, whichwould be conditional upon the efforts of the coalminers. The NCB
Chairman needed a decision on this proposal before he met the num on the following day.In discussion it was suggested that the hypothetical increase infuture productivity was a concession which the Government hadnot been prepared to countenance in the NCB&apos;s final pay offer at atime when there was a threat of a national strike. It should thereforebe discarded once again, since the threat at present was only of unofficial strikes and the concession, if rejected by the miners, wouldmean that arbitration, which was still a possibility, would be basedon a higher initial offer. In any event the terms on which the suggested productivity bonus had been formulated appeared to leavethe miners with an opportunity for disrupting production by strikes in the rest of 1970 and earning a bonus for the effort that would subsequently be required to catch up on lost production. It wouldalso be hard to represent the offer of a bonus as different from anincrease in the basic pay offer. On the other hand the vindicationin the ballot result of the NCB&apos;s judgment so far was perhaps a reason for accepting their proposals for the next stage, especially since the disadvantages of widespread unofficial strike action were clear.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should arrange to discuss further the NCB&apos;s suggestion for offering the NUM aproductivity bonus in mid-1971 for output in the first half of thatyear equalling or exceeding that in the first half of 1970. If thethree Ministers agreed that this proposal should be offered to the num on 27 October in an attempt to secure a negotiated settlement on coalminers&apos; pay, they could authorise the NCB to make the offer on that date.The Cabinet i(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Employment and theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry, to examine further the proposal for a productivity bonus forcoalminers in 1971 and to decide whether it should be offered by the Chairman of the National Coal Board tothe National Union of Mineworkers on 27 October 1970with a view to achieving a negotiated settlement oncoalminers&apos; pay.
CM (32) 70CONFIDENTIALEmergencies 3.   The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, reporting onTanker the incident in which two oil tankers had collided in the EnglishCollision Channel, said that the Pacific Glory was still aground off the Isle of wight. The equipment necessary to deal with the situation hadbeen assembled; but it would not be practicable to pump the cargo of oil into another tanker until the weather improved. The Allegro,with which the Pacific Glory had been in collision, was at Fawley.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that thenecessary precautions had been put in hand to prevent, so far aspossible, pollution of the beaches on the south coast.The Attorney-General said that he had authorised the issue ofwrits against both the Pacific Glory and the Allegro, involving alsothe arrest of the Allegro. He hoped the writs would be served that day.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe incident was likely to be the subject of an early Private notice question in Parliament and that the Minister to whom it was directedshould be in a position to reply to all questions arising from the accident. There would be advantage if all the relevant issues arisingfrom the accident, could be dealt with by the inquiry which wouldin any event be necessary in this country rather than being divided between inquiries in the United Kingdom and in Liberia, underwhose flag the ships had been sailing. It might be necessary to seek to secure the agreement of the Liberian Government that the main(    inquiry should be held in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry, to consider whether an inquiry held in the United Kingdom could deal with allthe relevant issues arising from the accident.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (70) 90) by theChancellor of the Exchequer, to which was attached the revisedtext of a White Paper entitled &quot; New Policies for Public Spending &quot;to be published on the following day.PublicExpenditureGeneralPreviousReference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute 3
FiscalAnnounce-mentsPreviousReferences:CM (70) 25thConclusions,Minute 3,CM (70) 27thConclusions,Minute 3CM (70) 29thConclusions,Minute 3The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the group of ministers under the Prime Ministers chairmanship who had reviewed his proposals in CP (70) 66 in respect of investment incentives had concluded that a scheme on the lines which he had recommended(involving a net saving to the Exchequer of some  100 million a year in 1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75) should be adopted, with the modification that investment grants would continue to be paid inrespect of all contracts made prior to 27 October, 1970, but only inrespect of such contracts. This would enable the Government to fulfil their pre-Election commitments in full. It was also proposedthat the rate of Corporation Tax should be reduced from 45 per cent to 42^ per cent, effective for tax due on 1 January, 1971, in respectof profits earned in 1969-70: this reduction would benefit industryto the extent of  60 million in the current financial year and 90 million in 1971-72. These decisions would be set out in the separate White Paper on Investment Incentives which was to bepublished, concurrently with the White Paper on Public Expenditure,immediately after his oral statement to the House of Commons onthe following day. In addition, he proposed to announce a reductionof 6d. in the standard rate of income tax, effective from 6 April, 1971.The cost of this concession would be  315 million in the first yearand  350 million in the second year. Given the reduction of public expenditure by  330 million in 1971-72, its effect on demand wouldbe broadly neutral. The reductions in Corporation Tax and in personal tax, which would require legislation, would be the firstreductions of their kind for 11 years and they should help to set the economy on a new and more dynamic course.The Cabinet (1) Approved the White Paper.(2) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Cabinet Office,27 October, 1970.
