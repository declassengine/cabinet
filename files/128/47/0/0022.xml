121541SECRET*1. The Prime Minister said that the Syrian forces had nowwithdrawn from northern Jordan but that in Amman the Fedayeenhad rejected a further offer of a cease-fire. The evacuation ofBritish subjects, which was being conducted on a voluntary basis,had so far proceeded satisfactorily. A DC-6 civilian charteredaircraft had arrived safely in Cyprus from Amman on the previous night with 21 British women and children and 9 United Nationswomen and children, of whom one woman and one child were british. A Caravelle aircraft, which was due to land shortly atAmman, could accommodate all the remaining British subjects who could at present be contacted and wished to leave.As regards the hostages, the representative of the international committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), M. Boissier, who had beenin contact with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine(PFLP) in Beirut, had reported that the latter had expressed their willingness, in return for the release of the seven guerilla prisoners in European hands, to release all the hostages whom they still held with the exception of those who had dual United States and Israelinationality. The dual nationals would be moved to a safe place which the PFLP had indicated might be Beirut pending agreement on terms for their release. In discussion of this offer by therepresentatives in Berne of the United Kingdom, the United States,Germany, Switzerland and Israel (the &quot; Berne Group &quot;) the Swissspokesman had argued strongly in favour of accepting the offer.The United States representative, however, had opposed theproposal on the ground that it was contrary to the principle ofnon-discrimination and that the status of M. Boissier&apos;s interlocutorwas uncertain. The United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers,had adopted the same attitude when the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had discussed the matter with him in washington. We had therefore maintained that an attempt shouldbe made at least to test the authenticity of the offer and todetermine its real scope by asking the PFLP to state the number,names and nationalities of the hostages whom they were preparedto release in exchange for the seven prisoners.Meanwhile, the discussions which the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had had at the United Nations had shownthat there was considerable opposition, in particular on the partof the Soviet Union, to either a Four Power statement or a meetingof the Security Council as a means of expressing internationalconcern about the situation in Jordan.
The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that good progress had been made in securing the evacuation of British subjects from Jordan. There were still some 42 individualswhom it had not yet been possible to contact; but the british broadcasting Corporation had been requested to broadcast advice in the hope that it would reach them. If the Caravelle flight was successfully completed, this would dispose of the main problem;and we could then dispense with the contingency plans for anevacuation by land and sea through Aqaba.As regards the hostages, HM Ambassador in Berne had reportedthat, unless all four Governments (other than the Government of israel) represented in the Berne Group agreed to instructM. Boissier to open discussions with the PFLP on the basis of theoffer conveyed to him in Beirut, the Swiss Government were likelyto take unilateral action and would probably be followed by theGerman Government. If so, we would be placed in a difficult position in relation to our European partners on the one hand andthe Governments of the United States and Israel on the other; andthe Cabinet would face a difficult decision in considering the course to be adopted.So far as the provision of relief and medical supplies to Jordanwas concerned the ICRC were still showing little sense of urgency and appeared to attach more importance to preserving a position of strict neutrality than to securing rapid and effective action to relievesuffering and distress. They had indicated to a representative of theMinistry of Defence who had been sent to the ICRC headquartersthat British and United States supplies and personnel would be unwelcome in Jordan. They had also informed him that they were unlikely to request any of the military assistance available in cyprus for several days, if at all; and they had given him tounderstand that any such request would be contingent on therecommendations which they hoped to receive from an ICRCdelegation which had been despatched to Amman and was not expected to report for about a week. An unfavourable impressionhad also been created by the decision of the ICRC representative inAmman to allow some 30 journalists to be evacuated on the previous day in an ICRC aircraft which had conveyed medical supplies toJordan, instead of offering the space available to women andchildren. Hitherto, we had been concerned to avoid any dispute with the ICRC in view of the need to secure their co-operation inconnection with the evacuation of our own nationals. But once thebulk of these had reached safety (as it was hoped that they wouldin the course of that day) we should do our utmost, both throughthe British Red Cross and, if necessary, by direct representations to
121541B*the ICRC itself, to induce the organisation to adopt a moreco-operative attitude and to show a much greater sense of urgencyin conveying medical relief to Jordan.In discussion it was suggested that there might be some substance in the ICRCs allegation that United States and United Kingdomassistance might be unwelcome at any rate to some extremistelements in Jordan. During the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, someArab wounded had refused treatment by British medical personnel.Moreover, we had to accept that the ICRC, in pursuance of their traditional policy of neutrality, were bound to seek to maintaincomplete impartiality between the contending parties in Jordan,even though one of these was the legal Government of the countryand the other was in armed rebellion against it. It was thereforeunlikely that they would modify their position, even if we could arrange for King Hussein to invite us to send in personnel and supplies. To act unilaterally and in disregard of the ICRCsknown attitude would entail considerable risks. If we were tosend in military personnel, their status would be uncertain in theabsence of protection from the ICRC, even if the British red cross agreed, as they were prepared to, that the personnelconcerned should be seconded to them. But if, in the last resort,we had to take unilateral action, some degree of protection mightbe afforded to our personnel if we could obtain from the Fedayeensome form of assurance that their neutral status would be respected.Further delay in bringing relief to Jordan would attract increasingpublic criticism; and we could not indefinitely accept a position inwhich relief operations were in effect being obstructed by thescruples and dilatoriness of the ICRC. In this situation consideration should perhaps be given to placing our supplies at the disposalof some organisation for example the Egyptian Red Crescent which would be acceptable to both contending parties and also tothe ICRC.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the need for relief in Jordan was clearly very urgent. Wewere in a position to make an effective contribution: we shouldbe criticised if we failed to do so: and we could not continue indefinitely to be debarred from action by the difficulties which had arisen with the ICRC. The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs should, through the British Red Cross and whatever other channels were open to us, bring the strongest possible pressure to bear on the ICRC in order to induce them toadopt a more positive and co-operative attitude. At the same timeour Ambassador in Amman should be asked for his urgentcomments, in the light of the report which would by now have been
submitted to him by the senior officer of the Royal Army MedicalCorps who had been visiting Amman, on the suggestions which hadbeen put forward in discussion, and for his recommendations on themanner in which we could most effectively and rapidly contribute to the relief of distress in Jordan.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs to take urgent action accordingly.In further discussion of the problem of the hostages it wassuggested that, while the status of M. Boissier&apos;s interlocutor inBeirut was, as the United States had argued, open to some doubt,it would be prudent to proceed on the assumption that his offer had some substance and that the PFLP would carry out the terms ofany agreement which might be reached with him. The whereaboutsof the hostages were still unknown. But if, as seemed possible,they had been taken to north Jordan, they would be in considerabledanger from any operations which, following the withdrawal ofSyrian forces, the Jordan Army might undertake in order to recovercontrol of that area from the remaining Fedayeen. It was thereforehighly desirable to maintain contact with the PFLP with a viewto securing at least the limited objective of the transfer of thehostages to a place of safety, if possible Beirut. The fact that sevenFedayeen prisoners were still in European hands would constitute a powerful inducement to the Fedayeen to reach agreement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatHM Ambassador in Berne should be instructed to seek the agreementof the Berne Group that M. Boissier should be instructed to try toensure the transfer of the hostages, immediately and withoutprejudice to further negotiations for their exchange to a place of safety. He should also attempt to ascertain the number, names and nationalities of the hostages whose release would, under thePFLP proposals, be secured by the return of the seven prisoners in european hands. The PFLP answer on this latter point would throw some light on their interpretation of the phrase &quot; dualnational&quot; and should therefore indicate whether their proposal was worth pursuing. In his discussions with the PFLP M. Boissiershould bear in mind that the seven Fedayeen prisoners constituted a valuable asset in our hands; and he should not under-estimate theimportance which the Fedayeen attached to their return. So far asthe British position was concerned he could indicate that wemaintained our previous attitude namely that we were prepared to release Leila Khalid as part of a satisfactory settlement.   The
secret. The Prime Minister said that a by-election held inMauritius on 21 September had resulted in the return of a candidateof the Left-wing and extremist Mouvement Militant Mauricien(MMM). The Mauritius Government believed that the MMM might seek to exploit their victory by violent means and that pressure might develop for a general election in which the present government might be overthrown. In either event they feared a breakdown insecurity; and they had requested British military assistance in theform of an infantry company standing by at 15 hours&apos; notice. our high Commissioner had said that he would report this request tothe British Government but had held out no hope that it would bemet. Certain dispositions had already been made in order that action could be taken, if necessary. But there had been no sign of serious trouble; and we should, if possible, seek to avoid becoming involved in the internal affairs of Mauritius.The Defence Secretary said that a cruiser was being held at24 hours steaming distance of Mauritius. The ship in question,however, was en route to join the Beira Patrol; and a decisions would be required by that evening whether she was to continue on her way or to remain available to proceed to Mauritius, if required.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatour High Commissioner should be instructed to report as soon aspossible on the situation in Mauritius. A decision in regard to thefrigate would be taken in the light of his report.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.OverseaAffairsMauritiusposition might have to be considered further in the light of theproceedings of the Berne Group and of PFLP reactions to any instructions which might, as a result of these, be sent to M. Boissier.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(4) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs to take action on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.
Mersey docks and HarbourBoard:FinancialSituationSECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (70) 45) by theMinister of Transport about the financial situation of the MerseyDocks and Harbour Board (MDHB).The Minister of Transport said that the Chairman and Director-General of the MDHB had reported to him at the end of Julythat they were in financial difficulties. He had insisted that theyshould appoint immediately a first-rate firm of accountants; andBinder, Hamlyn and Company had accordingly been appointedearly in August. The latter had informed MDHB on 10 Septemberthat their investigations so far had indicated that the Board wereinsolvent and should therefore neither continue trading nor proceedwith the arrangements for a  1 million bond renewal on27 September. The Economic Policy Committee had considered whether, in these circumstances, a  3 million tranche of a loanunder the Harbours Act due to MDHB from the Government forwork already done on the Seaforth Dock Scheme should be paid.The Law Officers had advised that the Government were under a legal obligation to pay the money; and the payment had accordingly been made. The Government would also shortly be required to advance a further tl\ million under existing loan agreements.Fulfilment of these legal obligations did not involve or implyacceptance of any responsibility by the Government for the Board&apos;present or future financial liabilities. With this total payment of 5^ million from the Government in prospect Binder, Hamlyn had advised that the MDHB were solvent and might reasonably beexpected to remain so until about the end of November and could,therefore, properly continue trading for the time being. Financialassistance might, however, be required before the end ofNovember; and he had informed the MDHB that they could not rely on the Government to provide such assistance. He would be receiving a report from Binder, Hamlyn towards the end of October;and it would then be necessary for the Government to consider what action was required. It was already clear that major changes were required in the present membership of the Board and, in his view, in the antiquated arrangements under which the Board were appointed and operated. The latter change would require legislation probably a Hybrid Bill. More immediately, he had circulated a draft of a Press announcement which the MDHBproposed to issue at 4 p.m. that day; and a draft of a letter which,subject to the comment of his colleagues, he proposed to write tothe MDHB and to publish at the same time as their announcement.In discussion there was general agreement that the Minister ofTransport should, as he had proposed, publicly indicate theGovernment^ position when the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board
released their Press announcement that afternoon. The financial difficulties which now faced MDHB were their responsibility alone;the Government were merely meeting their legal obligations inadvancing money under the existing loan agreements and this impliedno responsibility for providing future financial assistance to theMDHB. Although the Bank of England had warned that thepublication of a letter on the lines proposed by the Minister ofTransport might adversely affect the market in local authority andeven Gilt-edged stocks, there was general agreement that such a risk should be accepted in order to make clear where responsibilityfor the present financial failure lay; that the Government were notprepared to accept a commitment to pay for this failure; and thatthere was a real difference between stock which was guaranteed bythe Government and that which was not. A number of amendments were suggested to the draft letter circulated by the Minister ofTransport, which were intended to emphasise some of these points.Amendments, largely of a drafting nature, were also suggested to paragraph 5 of the draft Press announcement by the MDHB; andthe Minister of Transport said that he would see whether they would prove acceptable to the latter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the sums owing to the MDHB by theGovernment under existing loan agreements must be paid. they further agreed that the Minister of Transport should write to theChairman of the MDHB on the lines which he had proposed andshould publish his letter at the same time as the Press announcement was issued by the MDHB that afternoon. The Minister ofTransport would no doubt take account of the comments on hisdraft which had been made in discussion and had been directed to strengthening the exposition of the Governmenfs position. TheMinister of Transport should also consider with the Solicitor Generaland other Ministers directly concerned the changes includinglegislative ones which would eventually be required in order toensure that the Mersey Docks were in future run more efficiently;and he should make detailed recommendations when Binder,Hamlyn and Company had delivered their report.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24 September, 1970.
