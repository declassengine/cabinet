Acts ofViolenceAgainst CivilAircraftPreviousReference :CM (70) 14thConclusions121401SECRETThe Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the developments in Jordan since their last meeting. For most of the previous day we had been out of contact with M. Rochat, the representative of theInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), who wasnegotiating with the leaders of the Arab Fedayeen organisation, the popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), about therelease of the hostages whom they held. His place appeared to havebeen taken by M. Freymond, the Vice-President of the ICRC. Theposition of the hostages themselves was unclear; and there had beenconflicting messages about the extent to which they were beingmoved from the three aircraft at Dawson Field to Amman. But,despite the great uncertainty and confusion which appeared toprevail in Amman, it seemed clear that, apart from those passengersheld in the Intercontinental Hotel at Amman who had now been released, the rest remained effectively under the control of the PFLPand must still be regarded as hostages.During the afternoon the PFLP had carried out their threat to destroy the aircraft, having previously removed all passengers. Theyhad now communicated through M. Freymond the terms on whichthey were prepared to reach a settlement. These provided that allnon-Israeli and non-American passengers would be releasedunconditionally, apart from six British, six German and six Swisscitizens, who would be detained as hostages until the seven Fedayeenprisoners held by the British, German and Swiss Governments,including Leila Khalid, were delivered in Amman; that Israelicitizens &quot; with military status&quot; would be detained pending an exchange with Fedayeen prisoners held in Israel; and that all UnitedStates passengers would be freed unconditionally, apart from thoseconsidered to be of dual United States/Israeli nationality and having&quot;military status &quot; in Israel, who would be detained on the same basis as the Israeli citizens who had &quot; military status &quot;. In addition,British schoolchildren would be free to leave immediately andunconditionally.But even while this communication was being received her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Amman had reported that a serious situation was developing in the city, where the Fedayeen had apparently formed the impression that we did not intend to releaseLeila Khalid. As a result they had adopted a hostile attitude andwere now threatening the Embassy that if, within the next few hours,we did not undertake that we were prepared to set her free, theconsequences could be violent. Since this situation clearly implied that the hostages were now in imminent danger, Her Majesty&apos;s
Ambassador had advised that we should forthwith issue a public statement designed to correct the PFLPs misunderstanding of our intentions.In these circumstances the group of Ministers mainly concerned had met immediately before the Cabinet assembled and had approved the issue of a public statement, indicating that, in order to avoid anymisapprehension or possible loss of life, the Government wished to let it be known that they were prepared to return Leila Khalid to an arab country as a part of a satisfactory settlement of the problemof the detained passengers and crews of the three aircraft. this statement did no more than make our intentions public in the formin which we had repeatedly tried to convey them to the PFLPthrough the agency of the ICRC. But, in view of the way in whichthe situation was developing, it had been so worded that, while it remained consistent with our earlier stipulation that the settlementmust be non-discriminatory and must satisfy the interests of all five powers concerned, it did not exclude the possibility that, if the israeli Government refused to make any contribution to such asettlement, the three European Powers might have to reach aseparate agreement with the PFLP. We should also make it known that, in the circumstances as they existed at the present moment, the attorney-General did not intend to initiate any legal proceedings against Leila Khalid; and it might subsequently be necessary, inorder to prevent any further misunderstanding, to make it clear thatthis assurance would not be affected when she was transferred frompolice custody to prison, as would become necessary under the aliens (Places of Detention) Order on the evening of the following day if it had not been possible by then to exchange her forthe hostages in Amman.The statement had been issued just before 7 p.m.; and the broadcasting agencies had been requested to ensure that it hadimmediate distribution in both their World and their Arabicservices. At the same time action was being taken very urgently toensure that the other Governments concerned would not regard itas an indication that we were retreating from the unified front which,together with them, we had hitherto presented to the PFLP demands.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that in the circumstances noother course of action had been open to us; and they endorsed theterms of the statement which had been issued. They then turned toconsider the communication from the PFLP which had beenforwarded by M. Freymond. It seemed clear that the offer to release the British schoolchildren forthwith was genuinely unconditional.For the rest, it was possible to regard the three elements inthe communication as inter-related in the sense that no one of them would be implemented unless the others were accepted; and in this
case the offer to release non-Israeli and non-American passengers(apart from the 18 European hostages), together with Americanpassengers other than those of dual United States/Israeli nationality,would not be unconditional in the same sense. The fact that theoriginal offer by the PFLP had provided for the return of theaircraft as well as the passengers and that the aircraft hadnevertheless been subsequently destroyed suggested that we shouldbe on our guard against ambiguity in the present offer. It was equally possible, however, to take the proposal at its face value andto assume that the non-Israeli and non-American passengers (apartfrom the European hostages), together with the American passengersother than those of dual nationality, were genuinely available forunconditional release. On that hypothesis it was essential that they,together with the British schoolchildren, should be removed fromthe power of the Fedayeen as rapidly as possible and that no indication of our attitude to the PFLP terms should be given until they were safe. The ICRC, who had two aircraft in Amman, wereprepared to remove as many of them as possible early on thefollowing day; and arrangements should be made to provide additional civil aircraft, so far as necessary, as a matter of urgency.Service aircraft should be held available in Cyprus to provide fortheir onward conveyance to the United Kingdom.At the same time we must consider our attitude to the communication from the PFLP in the light of the factthat M. Freymond had intimated to our Ambassador in Ammanand the representatives there of the United States, Germany and switzerland, and also to the Fedayeen, that having received this offer,which he regarded as the only possible solution of the problem, and since it was apparently a &quot; diktat&quot; which was not open to negotiation, he considered that the ICRCs mandate in the matter was finished. If so, we appeared to face a choice between twocourses of action. On the one hand, we could indicate to the otherGovernments concerned that we were prepared to continue to seek a non-discriminatory solution embracing all the categories ofhostage but that, in that event, our statement indicating that we wereprepared to return Leila Khalid in the context of such a solutionrepresented the maximum contribution which we could make andthat it would now be for the United States Government to ensurethat the Government of Israel made a corresponding contribution inorder to enable a settlement on a five-Power basis to be achieved.Alternatively, if the Israeli Government were not prepared to make such a contribution, and the United States Government were not willing to press them to do so, we could disengage from the five-Power consortium and, together with the other Governments who
shared our view, seek to conclude a bargain which would safeguard our own nationals. In the last resort we must clearly be preparedto take the latter course, since we could not agree that the fate ofBritish subjects should depend wholly on the decision of the israeli government, however little flexibility they might be disposed todisplay. But, although the United States Government still appearedrelucant to bring pressure to bear on the Government of Israel, the israeli Ambassador in London had indicated that his Governmentcould not remain indifferent to considerations of ordinary humanityif they were confronted with proposals which were tolerable. It wastherefore increasingly urgent to obtain from the PFLP the promisedlist of Fedayeen prisoners in Israeli hands whose return they wouldrequire as the price of releasing individuals with Israeli or dualUnited States/Israel nationality and &quot; military status &quot;. As soon asthat list was available and all the hostages who were to be releasedunconditionally had been safely removed from Jordan, we mustpress the Government of Israel for a clear indication of the extentto which they were prepared to make their contribution to a five-Power settlement; and, in doing so, we should allow them tounderstand that, in default of such a contribution, some of theGovernments concerned might need to reconsider their previousattitude towards a non-discriminatory agreement. We must recognise, however, that if the reaction of the Government of Israel,when they were confronted with the list of the PFLP&apos;s specificdemands, was essentially reasonable, we might thereafter haveto continue to co-operate in the attempt to reach an essentially five-Power agreement, regardless of the consequences.The situation clearly demanded the services of a veryexperienced negotiator; and, although every effort should be madeto persuade M. Freymond to reconsider his decision to withdraw the services of the ICRC in this context, we should invite therepresentatives of the five Powers at Berne to consider, as a matterof great urgency, how he would best be replaced if he refused tocontinue to serve.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the communication from the PFLP should now be remitted to therepresentatives of the five Powers in Berne, who should be requestedto consider it forthwith in the light of the points which had emergedduring the Cabinet&apos;s review of the position. But, in view of the verydelicate political position which had now developed, it was essentialthat the reply to this communication should be referred forconsideration by the Cabinet before it was despatched; and our representative at the Berne discussions should be instructedaccordingly.
The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the issue of a public statement indicating thecircumstances in which the Government were preparedto return Leila Khalid to an Arab country.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of State for Defence, to arrange as amatter of great urgency for the removal from Amman ofall the hostages whom the Popular Front for the liberation of Palestine were prepared to releaseforthwith and unconditionally.(3) Agreed that no reply should be sent to the communication from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestineuntil action under Conclusion 2 above had beencompleted.(4) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toarrange for the communication from the Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine to be remitted immediately to the representatives of the five Powers at Berne for thepreparation of a draft reply, which should be submittedto the Cabinet before despatch, and to ensure that meanwhile the offer contained in that communicationwas neither accepted nor rejected.(5) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to seek to ascertain whether the Government of the UnitedStates were prepared to bring pressure to bear on theGovernment of Israel to make a reasonable contributionto a five-Power settlement and to indicate in the five-Power discussions at Berne that, in default of sucha contribution, some of the Governments concerned might have to consider whether to abandon thenon-discriminatory approach to the problem which theyhad maintained hitherto.(6) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to make every effort to persuade M. Freymond to continue tomake the services of the International Committee of theRed Cross available for the further negotiations with the popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and, if herefused to do so, to ascertain what recommendationabout his successor the five-Power representatives inBerne would wish to make.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13 September, 1970.
