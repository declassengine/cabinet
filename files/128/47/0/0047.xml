SECRETUnited Kingdom l. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of thecontributionto the budget of theEuropeanCommunitiesParliamentaryStatementPreviousReference:CM (70) 45thConclusions,Minute 4Duchy of Lancaster to which was attached the draft of a statement to Parliament on the United Kingdom proposals on Communityfinance and of replies to possible supplementary questions(CP (70) 118).The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, subject tosome drafting amendments which he would himself wish to make,he proposed to make a statement on the lines indicated in the draft attached to CP (70) 118. The draft put the cost of our contributionto the Community budget, under the proposals which he would betabling in Brussels, in the wide bracket of  60- 140 million in 1977.Such a wide range would indicate how speculative were estimatesabout even this element of the balance of payments cost of membership. Moreover, we should be negotiating with the Sixnot only about the size of our gross contribution but also aboutthe level of receipts from the Community budget and it was important for negotiating reasons also that we should put ourpresent estimates in a wide range. As to the economic benefits of membership, he thought it would be reasonable to use as an indication of the dynamic effects the additional growth rate of\ per cent per annum after five years which Mr. Roy Jenkins, thenChancellor of the Exchequer, had used in the debate in the Houseof Commons on 25 February 1970 on the White Paper issued bythe previous Administration (Cmnd. 4289). In answeringsupplementary questions, he would not give any break down ofthe estimated cost of  200- 300 million on account of the otheradverse short-term effects on our trade balance. He would, ofcourse, report to the Cabinet how the negotiations developed on community finance. But they would undoubtedly prove difficult and they had to bear in mind in making statements to parliament the effect on those with whom we were negotiating in the community as well as on public opinion in this country. He hoped it wouldbe possible to make the statement and table our opening bid in brussels on Wednesday 16 December, and that a parliamentary debate on the negotiations as a whole could be arranged before thenext Ministerial meeting in Brussels on 2 February.In discussion, the following main points were made:(a) While it would be very difficult, for the reason given bythe Chancellor of the Duchy, to achieve the right balance betweenundue optimism and undue pessimism about the net economic consequences of membership on the terms we were tabling, thedraft statement attached to CP (70) 118 seemed to give a little too much weight to the need to protect our negotiating position.  For128848
example, paragraphs 5 and 9 of the draft both referred to the probability that our proposals would still result in our makingsubstantial net contributions to the Community budget; thisrepetition might with advantage be avoided. In addition, a reference might be included in paragraph 4 to the effect on ournet contribution, under the proposals we were tabling, of increasedCommunity expenditure on regional development.(b) Economic commentators would undoubtedly publishanalyses of our proposals in which their balance of paymentsimplications would be fully explored and the conclusion might wellbe drawn that the Government expected the eventual balance ofpayments burden to be larger than present official estimatessuggested. The question would almost certainly be asked whether,even if we achieved significantly faster economic growth as a resultof joining the Community, the Government would be able to bringabout the switch of resources needed to meet the balance ofpayments costs. The Chancellor of the Duchy should thereforetry as far as possible to avoid giving precise estimates of thesecosts in his replies to supplementary questions. It should also beborne in mind that the Six would almost certainly continue to claim that we were over-estimating the likely costs of membership and under-estimating the likely benefits.(c) For Parliamentary reasons, it would be preferable if ourdetailed proposals could be presented to the Six on Wednesday16 December, so that the Chancellor of the Duchy could make his proposed statement on the same afternoon. There would inevitably be strong pressure for a Parliamentary debate on our proposals,and the Government should forestall this pressure by making itclear that they would welcome debates in both Houses before thenext Ministerial meeting with the Six on 2 February.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that our detailed proposals on Community financeshould be tabled in Brussels on Wednesday 16 December and thatthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should make his proposed statement in Parliament on the same afternoon. The Chancellorof the Duchy should revise his draft statement in the light of thepoints made in discussion and in consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President. He could make it clear, either in his statement or in response to supplementary questions, that the Governmentwould welcome debates on our negotiations for entry into theEuropean Communities in both Houses of Parliament after the christmas recess and before the next Ministerial meeting with the six on 2 February.
industrial affairs pay ofElectricitySupply ManualWorkersPreviousReference:CM (70) 46thConclusionsSECRET2. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, after theprevious day&apos;s meeting of the trades union side of the National joint industrial Council (NJIC) of the electricity supply industry, theunion representatives, with the agreement of the Electricity Council,had requested him to appoint a court of inquiry on the basis that,provided that its composition and terms of reference were acceptable to them, they would then call on their members to resume normal working. In subsequent discussion with the leaders of the unions,he had emphasised that it was for the Government to decide onthe terms of reference, although he would be prepared to discuss them with the unions. He had also maintained that the terms ofreference should require the court to have regard to the national interest and to take account of the need to curb inflation. Thelatter part of this formula, however, had proved unacceptable tothe unions; and, after consulting those of his colleagues most closely concerned, he had proposed alternative terms of referencewhich would require the court, in inquiring into the causes and circumstances relevant to the dispute and the unions&apos; claim for asubstantial pay increase and improvements in the conditions ofservice of their members, to have regard to the interests of the public and the national economy. The union leaders had agreed to consult the full trade union side of the NJIC on this proposal; but in theearly hours of the morning their leader had reported that he hadbeen unable to persuade them to accept it although they would agree to terms of reference which specified &quot; the public and thenational interest&quot;. He had not felt able to concede the omissionfrom this phrase of the word &quot; economic &quot;; but it had been agreedthat both sides would say that the discussions about the appointment128848b* 2The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up.(2) Agreed that our detailed proposals on Community financeshould be presented to the Six on Wednesday 16December and that the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should make a statement in the House ofCommons on the same day.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to revise the draft statement attached to CP (70) 118 in the lightof the points made in discussion and in consultationwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord President.
of the court of inquiry had been adjourned, rather than broken off,and that they would be resumed later that morning. The differencebetween the two sides, as the leader of the unions&apos; side had publiclyadmitted, was one of principle rather than of mere wording. As he himself had subsequently made clear to the Press, there wasagreement on meeting within the terms of reference therequirements of the employers and the unions but there remained a difference of opinion about the manner in which, in conformitywith the Governmenfs stipulation, the need to have regard to thenational interest should be expressed. On the other hand if the argument about the terms of reference continued for more than another day or so, existing public feeling that the unions were beingunreasonable in maintaining their work-to-rule might give place toa feeling that it was the Government who were being unreasonablein their insistence on the inclusion of the single additional word&quot; economic &quot; in the terms of reference. Failing early agreementwith the unions, it might therefore be right for the Government toproceed forthwith to appoint the court of inquiry with the termsof reference which he proposed, since this would make it difficult for the unions publicly to justify continuing their work-to-rulesimply as an objection to terms of reference which, it would be generally thought, rightly required the inquiry to pay regard tothe national economic interest while meeting the unions&apos; own wishesin all other respects. Although there had been no substantivediscussion with the unions about the membership of the proposedcourt of inquiry, he did not expect this to become an issue. Hehad informed the union representatives that he would be willingto receive any suggestions about the composition of the inquirywhich they or the employers wished to make; but he had remindedthem that under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, both the composition and the terms of reference of a court of inquiry weresolely his responsibility.In discussion it was suggested that although it might earlierhave been possible to argue that the simple expression &quot; thenational interest&quot; embraced the economic interests of the nation,the lengthy argument which had now taken place about theinclusion of the word &quot; economic&quot; made it hardly possible towithdraw this word without implying that &quot; the national interest &quot;could be held to carry some narrower meaning. Nor would it be satisfactory to accept merely &quot; the national interest&quot; in the termsof reference and to try to achieve the Governmenfs purpose bystipulating separately that the Government would expect the courtof inquiry to interpret this phrase as including the national economic interest; once the court of inquiry was established itwas for its members to interpret the terms of reference which theyhad been given.  It might however be possible to state expressly
that the terms of reference should be designed to meet the wishes of the Government as well as those of each of the parties to thedispute and that the reference to the national economic interest was included in order to reflect the specifically Governmentalconcern in the matter without necessarily committing the other parties to endorse that concern.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that public opinion already regarded the unions as havingsuffered a considerable reverse. It might therefore be unwise torefuse to appoint a court of inquiry, even if the unions refused to order a resumption of normal working, since to do so might unitethe moderates with the militants and might also risk making theGovernment themselves appear unreasonable. The Cabinet agreed,however, that for the present it would be right to continue to insist that the terms of reference should require the court to haveregard to &quot; the national economic interest&quot; and to maintainpressure on the unions to accept terms of reference on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment, while orderinga resumption of normal working when the inquiry was appointed.The unions might well come to realise that they would be in a weakpublic position if they refused; and, if they were seen to have accepted the terms of reference only after a struggle, theGovernment would be able more convincingly to countersuggestions that their agreement to appoint a court of inquiry wasitself a retreat.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theelectricity supply now available was currently about 20 per centshort of the potential output of the power stations, although theElectricity Boards were having to shed rather more than 20 percent of the potential load at times of peak demand. The latestassessment by the Electricity Council was that, if the supervisoryengineers continued to give their full co-operation, any further deterioration in the available supply during a continued work-to-rule by the manual workers would be only gradual; and, even ifthe manual workers withdrew their labour completely, it should bepossible, given co-operation by the supervising engineers, tomaintain rather more than 50 per cent of the normal supply. Inthose circumstances, however, it might not in fact be realistic toassume the full co-operation of the supervising engineers; and, ifthey too withdrew their labour, the maximum output which couldbe expected, even if the Boards invoked the help of engineers fromthe industry&apos;s management staff reinforced by volunteers andServicemen, would be only about 20 per cent of the normal supply.If industrial action were than taken by other unions in sympathy with the electricity workers to deny the industry supplies of
materials essential to continued operation, the power stations couldbe brought to a halt within a week, unless other action were taken under Emergency Powers to ensure that essential supplies ofmaterials were maintained.The effect of the Order made under Emergency Powers on 12December, prohibiting the use of electricity for display lightingand advertising from 14 December, would be to save about \ percent of normal consumption. Its primary purpose, however, waspsychological. There were no readily available means of furtherreducing consumption in order to conserve supplies for essentialusers without resorting to the general prohibition of the use ofelectricity in non-essential industry, or for domestic space heating,between specified hours. An Order restricting the use of electricspace heaters would in any event be unenforceable. It would therefore be advisable not to make Orders on these lines until suchaction became essential and to seek to continue to achieve thenecessary load-shedding by restricting supplies area by area in rotation. The pattern of the electricity distribution networks made it impracticable in any case to guarantee uninterrupted supplies tosuch essential users as hospitals without also maintaining the supply to non-essential users in the same neighbourhood. The possibilityof securing a saving of electricity by the restriction of televisionbroadcasts had also been examined; but this, too, would be bestconsidered area by area, in order to avoid the risk that, if commonhours of restricted transmission were adopted throughout thecountry, electrical plant might be damaged by the surge-effects which would develop whenever transmission was abruptly resumedafter a period of interruption. On the other hand the electricity authorities could be invited to try to ensure that the offices of thenational newspapers were not deprived of electricity at editiontimes.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief further discussion, saidthat the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies should consider thefurther Orders which might be made to regulate the use of electricityin industry and in the home in the interests of more essential usersif output should deteriorate to the extent of a loss significantlygreater than the 20-30 per cent presently being experienced.  Evenif the unions ordered a resumption of normal working, it would takea little time before full production was restored; and the order prohibiting the use of electricity for advertisement and displaypurposes would need to be retained in force for the time being.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.
CM 47 (70)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (70) 117) about the report of the public expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) 1970.The Prime Minister said that since the completion of theautumn review of public expenditure and the publication of &quot; new policies for Public Spending &quot; (Cmnd. 4515) the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chief Secretary had, in consultation with the spending Ministers, reached virtually complete agreement on thefull public expenditure forecasts to 1974-75 set out in the PESCMain Report and Appendices; they should be congratulated.Decisions on a few items must await discussion at a later stage notably the school and university building programmes for 1973-74and 1974-75 and the total sum to be made available for localauthority mortgage lending. This agreement was satisfactory. the programmes in the PESC report, however, would give theGovernment little room to manoeuvre. Inroads were already beingmade into the contingency reserves. Expenditure must be further reduced by the strictest economy in existing programmes, and through the current review of Departmental functions. Work wasin hand to enable a full White Paper on Public Expenditure to1974-75 to be published in the week beginning 18 January after consideration by Cabinet (in his absence) in the preceding week;this time-table should be adhered to.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised the need for thecontinued restraint and further reduction. On the programmes inthe PESC report, and taking account of tax changes already announced, the Government would have no more than some  250- 300 million in demand in hand for 1974. He invited the Cabinetto note the pattern of expenditures as costed in the PESC reportfor the period to 1974-75 and to agree that public expenditure asa whole should be kept within the totals for each year of theperiod; to approve the costings of the individual expenditure programmes set out in Table 5 of the report as maxima for thepurposes of management of the programmes; to agree that the search for further savings should be vigorously pursued, including those from the review of functions commissioned by the PrimeMinister; and to agree that a draft White Paper on public expenditure should be prepared on that basis.In discussion the following points were made: -(a) Further consideration would need to be given to the presentation in the White Paper of the figures for overseas aid inPublicExpenditureReport of thePublicExpenditureSurveyCommittee1970PreviousReference:CM (70) 30thConclusions,Minute 3
relation to the 1975 target of 1 per cent of gross national productfor private and public flows together; of the way provision mightbe made for the cost of new civil aircraft and aero-engine projects;and of the impact of the relative price effect on social service programmes.(b) There were likely to be demands for substantial increases in investment in the nationalised industries, particularly in steel and electricity. The Sub-Committee on Nationalised Industry Policyof the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy would be considering the possibility of raising funds from the private sectorbut a change in the method of financing would not reduce thedemand for real resources required to carry out this investment.Some of the investment proposed by these industries would, ifexamined sufficiently rigorously, probably prove to be unnecessaryor more costly than required.(c) Proposals would be made for additional expenditure on the health services if, at a later date, there were more room for manoeuvre.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the points made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in paragraph 10 of his memorandum CP (70) 117, andin particular the need to continue the search for further savings. Adraft White Paper should now be prepared for consideration by theCabinet in the week beginning 11 January. Any detailed points of presentation should be discussed by the Ministers concerned withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chief Secretary, Treasurymight also arrange, in consultation with the Secretary of State for trade and Industry and the other Ministers concerned, for furtherconsideration to be given to the investment programmes of the nationalised industries.The Cabinet -(1) Noted the pattern of expenditure to 1974-75 as costed inthe PESC report.(2) Agreed that public expenditure as a whole should be somanaged as to keep within the annual totals shown inthe PESC report.(3) Approved the costings of the individual expenditureproposals set out in Table 5 of the PESC report asmaxima subject to the outcome of 4 below and to theexistence of certain &quot; unprogrammable &quot; elements.(4) Invited all Ministers to ensure that the search for further savings was vigorously pursued.
The Futureof theMonopoliesCommissionCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Employment (CP (70) 96) and by the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry (CP (70) 114) about the future of the monopolies Commission.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that on thetwo main issues which had remained to be resolved whenCP (70) 96 was circulated to the Cabinet, he was glad to say thaton further reflection he did now agree that the Government needed to retain some powers to investigate mergers under the monopolies and Mergers Act, 1965 provided that they were used very rarelyindeed in cases where the purposes of the proposed merger was quite clearly contrary to the national interest. He was also readyto agree that the Monopolies Commission should be empoweredto propose to him subjects (monopolies and mergers) for formalinquiry. He would, however, continue to authorise all inquiries.The proposals set out in CP (70) 96 amounted to a substantialprogramme for revitalising the Monopolies Commission and for extending the scope of legalisation to achieve a more effectivecompetition policy. But the Government would be unwise to commit themselves now in detail to the terms of new legislation which could not be fitted into the legislative programme for thepresent session. It would, however, be possible to implement muchof the new policy under existing legislation and he invited theCabinet to agree that he should make a statement in the Houseof Commons, on the lines of the draft annexed to CP (70) 114,indicating the Governmenfs intention to introduce legislation indue course and meanwhile to make important changes of practicewithin the scope of the existing legislation.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the general policy indicated in CP (70) 96,(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for adraft White Paper to be prepared for consideration bythe Cabinet in the week beginning 11 January, clearingdetailed points of presentation with the ministers concerned as necessary.(6) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and other ministers concerned, to give further consideration to the investment programmes of the nationalised industries.
with continued investigation of mergers in those rare cases wherethe national interest was significantly involved. The Cabinet wouldhave a further opportunity to review the policy as a whole and thefuture role of the Monopolies Commission before new legislation was approved. Meanwhile they agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry should make a statement to the House ofCommons on the lines of the annex to CP (70) 114 on Thursday,17 December.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tomake a statement on the lines of the annex to cp (70) 114 on Thursday, 17 December.Cabinet Office,14 December, 1970.
