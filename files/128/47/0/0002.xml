TheGovernment(previous reference:CM (70) 1stConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues for theco-operation which he had received from them in completing the new administration. The saving secured by the reduction in the numberof Ministerial posts as compared with the previous Government wasa small but significant indication of the Governments determination to conduct a critical review of public expenditure, a subject on whichhe had already sent a personal message to all Ministers.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:CM (70) 1stConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (70) 1), to which was annexed a draftof The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Lord President said that as on previous occasions when there had been a change of Government, the Speech must inevitably be in the main a general statement of the Governmenfs aims and policies. There had not been time to draw up a legislative programme for the Session by reference to which the Speech couldbe prepared. But it would probably need to commit the Governmentto legislation on industrial relations, immigration, pensions, local radio and abolition of the Land Commission. For the rest various suggestions had already been put forward in favour of specificreferences to other proposed Bills. But, although in one or twoinstances the case for inclusion was strong, it would be premature forthe Government to commit themselves too far until they had beenable to consider the programme as a whole.The Cabinet considered the draft Speechparagraph and agreed a number of amendments,main points were made:paragraph byThe following(a) Consideration should be given, before the next opening speech was prepared, to treating oversea affairs in a way whichwould define the Governmenfs main policies more clearly andsuccinctly.(b) Although the reference in paragraph 8 to the five principlesmight reduce the chances of a settlement of the Rhodesian problem,their omission would be liable to provoke criticism andmisinterpretation.(c) Paragraph 12 should be recast in terms emphasising the government&apos;s support for measures taken by the Government ofNorthern Ireland on their own initiative.11421A 2
(d) Paragraph 15 should be less definite and should refer to changes in the present arrangements for agricultural support ratherthan to a completely new system.(e) In the paragraphs on education and local government reformappropriate reference should be made to the special requirements ofScotland and Wales.(/) The Speech should include an indication of the governments intention to take action on the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions and to improve theorganisation of the Sheriff Courts in Scotland.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the draft Speech annexed to CP (70) 1 wasbroadly acceptable, although there was scope for improving thearrangement and wording of individual paragraphs. The lord president should now reconsider the draft in the light of thediscussion and should circulate a revised version as rapidly aspossible for further consideration by the Cabinet at a meeting on thefollowing Monday. Ministers wishing to. suggest alternative forms of words should arrange to let the Lord President have them by the endof the day.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to circulate a revised draft of the queen&apos;s Speech, taking account of their discussion andof any suggestions submitted to him by individual ministers.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toconsider whether in future Queen&apos;s Speeches theGovernments external policies might be defined more appropriately and concisely.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion on Monday, 29 June.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theUnited States Government would shortly publish a new initiative,which they had already launched privately, to promote a settlementof the dispute between Israel and the Arab States. It envisaged the resumption of the mission of Dr. Jarring, the Special Representativeof the Secretary-General of the United Nations, on the basis of prior commitment by the contending parties to indicate their willingness to carry out Security Council Resolution 242 and to observe a cease-fire from 1 July until at least 1 October.

confidential. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs, to which was attached the draftof a Statement to be made by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster at a meeting in Luxembourg on 30 June to open negotiations for United Kingdom membership of the european communities (CP (70) 2).The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he recognised that the wording of the draft Statement could be improved in certain respects; but he invited his colleagues to approve itstheir decision on the supply of further aircraft to Israel would depend to some extent on the Israeli response. The Israeli PrimeMinister, however, had already reacted strongly against the idea ofa temporary cease-fire: but there had as yet been no definite response from the Arab Governments. It was perhaps significant that theUnited States Government now appeared to be prepared to usesupplies of military aircraft to Israel as a lever to promote political objectives; and, although their proposals were unlikely to be acceptable to either side, their initiative might help to ease thepresent deadlock. But, although they had given us advance noticeof their intentions, they had not discussed them with us; and, since their initiative had been taken outside the framework of the FourPower discussions, the latter might be prejudiced as a result.Mr. Rogers&apos; forthcoming visit to this country might afford anopportunity of making these points to him.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the lightof discussion in Cabinet on 23 June he had been giving furtherconsideration to the main problems of oversea policy on which decisions were likely to be required during the next few months; andhe hoped that it would be possible to bring before Ministers at anearly date his views and suggestions on the situation in the persian gulf and future policy in that area; Rhodesia; and policy in regardto the supply of arms to South Africa.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
6CONFIDENTIALsubstance. He also proposed that the Government should nowindicate their agreement that the opening bilateral session betweenthe European Communities and the United Kingdom should takeplace on 21 July.In discussion it was suggested that, even if full account wastaken of the need to reassure the Six that the Government wouldbe negotiating in earnest, the tone of the draft Statement was perhapstoo elevated and diffuse. Its purpose should be to set out the presentGovernmenfs policy in a more practical and businesslike manner,with less reference to the positions taken up by previousAdministrations. It would also be desirable to add the words &quot; andfisheries &quot; after &quot; agricultural policy &quot; in line 11 of paragraph 9, inorder to anticipate the possibility that the Council of Ministers ofthe European Communities at a meeting on 29 June would make some move towards the development of a common fisheries policywhich, by leading to changes in international fishery limits, couldbe seriously damaging to United Kingdom interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the substance of the draft Statement, subject tothe addition of a reference to fisheries policy as proposed. But theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should consider modifying its general tone onthe lines suggested in discussion. The Cabinet also agreed that thereshould be an opening bilateral session between the United Kingdomand the Six on 21 July, on the basis that its purpose would be confined to setting up official working groups to examine the facts in relation to our problems.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft Statement attached to CP (70) 2, subjectto the points made by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that the opening bilateral session between theUnited Kingdom and the European Communities shouldtake place on 21 July.confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that the situation had not deteriorated since the Cabinet&apos;s last meeting as much as might have appeared. Although the unions were now threatening a strike instead of a go-slow, they had postponedthe date for action by a fortnight. The Government werenevertheless still faced with a difficult situation; and the employersmust be encouraged to stand firm against an increase in the basicIndustrialRelationsThe Docks(previous reference:CM (70) 1stConclusions,Minute 5)
CONFIDENTIAL7Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos;Remuneration(previous reference:CM (70) 1stConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a meeting of theMinisters most closely concerned, which he had convened on theprevious day, had agreed that the Secretary of State for social services should arrange to meet the leaders of the British medical association (BMA) before their conference at the weekend andshould inform them that, if the doctors were persuaded to cease their&quot; industrial action &quot;, the Government would be prepared:(a) To withdraw the present reference of their salaries to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI). TheChairman of the NBPI would be informed, however, thatthe withdrawal of the reference implied no judgment onthe part of the Government about the future role of the nbpi.minimum wage on the scale requested by the unions because of its effect, as he had previously explained, on the future level of earnings.The employers&apos; representatives were prepared, however, to offer anincrease in the guaranteed weekly minimum pay which would nothave the same damaging consequences for earnings as an increase inthe basic minimum wage. The trouble stemmed from the archaicwage structure in the docks, which the employers were nowattempting to modernise in negotiation with the unions on the lines proposed several years previously by the Devlin Committee on theport transport industry. The unions&apos; present claim reflected their concern to secure the most favourable basic minimum wage before any new scheme of payment was introduced.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that plans must be worked out forthwith by the appropriate ministerial committee to deal with the situation as it developed, including thepossibility of a major strike. Meanwhile, the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity should circulate to the Cabinet a brief statement of the underlying causes of the present dispute and of theprogress being made towards removing them.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity to circulate a memorandum on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.
confidential(b) To establish a new independent body to review their futuresalaries, whose advice the Government would not refer to another body and would normally accept. TheSecretary of State should not be too specific, however,about the nature of the new review body; and, eventhough it might be described as independent, we shouldnot commit ourselves in advance of further considerationto any precise definition of the nature and degree of itsassociation with machinery to review salaries in otherparts of the public sector.(c) To open negotiations on the balance of their pay, while making it clear that the Government did not expect to beable to agree to the full 30 per cent increaserecommended in the 12th Report of the Review Body onDoctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration (the KindersleyReport). It had become apparent that there were probably defects in the calculations on which theKindersley Report recommendations were based; but the doctors might be informed that the full recommendedpay increase could not be granted because of thecountry&apos;s economic situation rather than because of theflaws in the calculations.In discussion the importance of co-ordinating the future review of salaries in the public sector was emphasised. If review bodiesremained unco-ordinated, the danger of &quot; leap-frogging&quot; claims would be intensified.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25 June, 1970.
