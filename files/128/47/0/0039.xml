CM 39 (70)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament the following week. It was proposed that the House ofCommons should adjourn for the Christmas Recess not later thanFriday, 18 December, and resume on Tuesday, 12 January. TheHouse of Lords would also resume on that date.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGovernment of Pakistan currently estimated the number of casualties in the recent flood disaster in East Pakistan at 200,000; but the eventual total might prove to be as much as double that figure. Wehad already made a donation of  30,000 to assist in meeting theimmediate needs of the situation. The Chancellor of the exchequer had now agreed that  500,000 should be made available for reliefpurposes and that additional funds should be provided, if necessary.In addition, the Minister for Overseas Development, who was visitingPakistan, would be informing the Pakistan Government of our willingness to provide assistance under the Food and Aid Conventionup to the value of a further  500,000. We were also assisting theGovernment of Pakistan by providing emergency transport for relief supplies. We had already made available a number of assault craftfor this purpose; and HMS Intrepid was on her way to the disasterarea with further assault craft and helicopters. He intended toinform the House of Commons that afternoon of the steps whichwe had taken to alleviate the hardship and distress.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our response to the disaster in Pakistan might lead to&apos; appeals for similar assistance infuture cases. It would therefore be prudent, in any statement whichmight be made in Parliament, to emphasise that the emergency in pakistan was on an unprecedented scale, which called for whollyexceptional measures of relief and assistance.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, inaccordance with the Cabinefs decision on 5 October,HM Ambassador in South Africa had addressed a communication to the representative of the Rhodesian regime in that country on1B*
3 November, in order to ascertain whether there was a basis for discussions aimed at achieving a political settlement. The regime&apos;reply was disappointingly negative. In particular, it suggested thatthe only realistic starting point for any negotiations was one based onacceptance of the fact that Rhodesia was &quot; an independent sovereignrepublic in terms of the Constitution of Rhodesia, 1969 &quot;. Moreover,the general tone of the communication was such as to enable us to interpret it, if we so wished, as virtually putting an end to this attempt to establish contact. Nevertheless, we should not be well advised to adopt this attitude. The apparently uncompromisingterms of the reply no doubt reflected the regime&apos;s desire to establish an initial position of strength; but they probably wished to enterinto discussion with us. The Ministerial Committee on rhodesia would shortly be invited to consider the basis on which we might attempt to carry the matter forward.The Prime Minister said that Parliament had already beeninformed that no public statements would be made about theexchanges with the regime in Rhodesia. The unauthoriseddisclosures which were already appearing in the Press had probablyoriginated in Salisbury: but Ministers should bear in mind thenecessity of observing complete discretion about our contacts withthe regime.The Cabinet-(2) Took  note   of  the  statements   by  the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary and the Prime Minister.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGerman-Polish Treaty had now been initialled. In the event theparties had agreed to accept the Oder-Neisse line as Germany&apos;sde facto eastern frontier. We had welcomed this contribution towards removing a long-standing source of tension.Military coup The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, followingin Syria expulsion by the Syrian Army of the former Prime Minister of Syria, Dr. Nureddin al-Atassi, the army had installed as PrimeMinister a trade unionist, Ahmed al-Khatib. He had no previouspolitical experience; and, although the new regime might be slighty more moderate than its predecessor, the change was unlikely to affect the situation significantly.The Cabinet (3) Took  note   of  the  statements   by  the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.German-PolishTreatyPreviousReference:CM (70) 37thConclusions,Minute 2

The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that hehad held a further meeting with the Chairmen of the Electricity and gas Councils, in order to convey to them the Governmenfsdetermination to arrest the present series of inflationary wage settlements. The Chairman of the Electricity Council had agreedto make a pay offer which would provide for an increase of no morethan 10 per cent overall but would also accommodate reasonablygenerous provision for the lowest paid workers. The joint meeting between the electricity authorities and the trade unions to conduct the negotiations was taking place that day; and the outcome wouldnot be known until later. The Electricity Council had discussed with his Department the basis of the proposals to be put forward at the joint meeting. Since the labour force in the industry wasbeing reduced, the Council would work on the basis not of the total increase in the wage bill but of average earnings, which were atpresent just under  25, a week; and the Chairman intended to propose a revision of the rates for all grades designed to produce a standard increase in earnings of 50s. a week, which in percentage terms would favour the lower paid. The precise effects on the basic wage rates had not yet been fully established; but it was clearthat the offer would raise the basic rate for lower paid workers inthe electricity supply industry above the  16 12s. a week awardedrecently to local authority manual workers.In discussion it was suggested that the CouncLTs offer needed to be expressed in terms of the increase in basic rates rather thanthe increase in earnings; until this was done the proposal was difficult to evaluate or to reconcile with the Cabinefs intentions.Officials of the Department of Trade and Industry and of theDepartment of Employment should keep in close and constanttouch with the development of the CounciFs proposals and the courseof the pay negotiations; and they should ensure that Ministers were fully informed about the final offer, whose public presentation in a form that was fully defensible would be of the greatest importance.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that in negotiations with the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA),the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) had reached agreement upon the formula to be adopted in a pay award for pilots,including those flying the Boeing 747 aircraft. But he had so farwithheld from BOAC the authority to make a specific offer on pilots&apos;pay, as requested by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy(EPC), who had been concerned about the possible impact upon other pay negotiations because any negotiable BOAC offer would128813-1b* 2
Pay ofCraftsmenin government research andDevelopmentEstablishmentshave to embody increases which, in absolute terms, would be verylarge. There was now a serious risk, however, that, by furtherdelaying authority for a specific pay offer, the Government wouldfrustrate a settlement altogether and exacerbate relations betweenthe airline and its pilots still further. He recognised the danger ofdisturbing the current electricity pay negotiations; but he consideredthat on balance he should inform BOAC that they might expect tobe authorised to make a specific pay offer in the near future. if that day&apos;s electricity pay discussions led to a complete rejection bythe unions of the Electricity Council&apos;s offer, and especially if theunions thereafter announced their intention of calling a strike, hewould clearly have no alternative but to tell BOAC that thenegotiations on pilots&apos; pay must be kept in suspense for the timebeing. If, however, a pay settlement in the electricity supply indusrty was achieved or discussions were maintained within the limits of theoffer currently approved, he proposed that BOAC should beauthorised to make a specific pay offer on the basis which EPC had last considered.In discussion, it was pointed out that, in view of the series of pay negotiations which confronted the Government over the weeksahead, an announcement of the proposed BOAC offer, wheneverit was made, would be likely to be embarrassing. It was suggested,however, that a condition of Government agreement at the righttime to the proposed pay offer for pilots should be that the BALPAdemand for a six-month trial period of Boeing 747 operations with three pilots should be rejected or, alternatively, that the increase inpilots&apos; pay should come into effect only when the six months were over and the third pilot had been dispensed with. Airline pilots,like others with higher incomes, would benefit from the Government^reduction of the rate of income tax and must be prepared to take this into account.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy had considered on the previous day the dispute over the allowance to be given to some 7,000 craftsmen inGovernment research and development establishments. The official side had offered increases of  3 a week, amounting to 15 per cent;buf the trade unions were seeking to insist on a  4 a week increase,representing 19 per cent. The 15 per cent increase was in line with,and followed from, the previous Administration^ agreement to ageneral pay increase for the industrial Civil Service, which came intoeffect on 1 July, 1970. But to concede the  4 demanded would beto go further than that increase and would be likely to affect the pay of equivalent grades in the Atomic Energy Authority as well as the pay of the non-industrial staff in the Civil Service who supervised thecraftsmen.   On the other hand to refuse the  4 increase might
Pay ofAncillaryWorkersin theNationalHealthServicePreviousReference:CM (70) 38thConclusions,Minute 1Salariesof theJudiciaryThe Cabinet were informed that the laying of the statutory instruments in respect of the increase in the salaries of the judiciarycould not be delayed beyond 2 December if the new salaries wereto be effective on 1 January 1971. Nevertheless, it was agreed thatin present circumstances the timing of the action to give effect tothese, and related, pay increases required further consideration before a final decision was taken.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry should arrange for an interdepartmental analysis of the pay offer being made to electricity supply manual workers by the Electricity Council, and should consult the Lord President of the Council and other ministers principally concerned about the public presentation of the offer andprovoke industrial action by the craftsmen, which would disruptwork in some civil and military research and development establishments and, in particular, would delay work on testing the concorde airframe, the engines for the Harrier aircraft and theA300B airbus. Nevertheless, EPC had unanimously agreed to standon the  3 offer and to refuse the demand for  4; and they had stressed the importance of not making a later concession underpressure once the Government had decided to stand firm. If therewere a strike, the arrangements for presenting to the public the government&apos;s decision on these negotiations and the merits of thecase would be concerted with the Lord President of the Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he suspected that a firm response by the Government might deter the Trade Union Sidefrom taking industrial action. In the public presentation of the government&apos;s attitude to these negotiations there would beopportunity to demonstrate that they were themselves maintaining the policy which they were encouraging other employers to adoptand to emphasise that the relatively high increase on which theywere taking their stand was itself authorised by the previous government.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he would bearranging to make, with the minimum publicity, the concessionagreed at Cabinet on 17 November on the pay of ancillary workersin National Health Service hospitals. He would consult the lord president of the Council and the Secretary of State for Employmentabout Press statements on the pay offer and the probable settlement.
of the settlement or negotiating deadlock to which it might lead.BOAC should be given no authority for the time being to make a specific pay offer to their pilots; but the Cabinet might wish to reconsider this decision at their next meeting if developments in theelectricity supply pay negotiations made it appropriate. TheCabinet endorsed the conclusion reached by EPC on the pay ofcraftsmen in Government research and development establishments;and the Lord President of the Council should arrange for a suitablepresentation to the public of the Governments policy and the merits of their case, as suggested in discussion. He would arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the timing of the action requiredin connection with the salaries of the judiciary.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theLord President of the Council and the Secretary of Statefor Employment, to arrange for (i) An analysis of the pay offer by the electricity council to electricity supply manual workers.(ii) Its public presentation in the most suitable lightonce the outcome of the pay negotiations was known.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord privy seal, to secure appropriate publicity for the government&apos;s decision on the pay of craftsmen in Government research and development establishments.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the timing of action to giveeffect to the increases in the salaries of the judiciary.CONFIDENTIALGas andElectricityPricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 24. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP (70) 107), the Secretary of Statefor Social Services (CP (70) 108) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP (70) 109) about proposed increases in gas and electricity prices and the possibility of mitigating their effects.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the gas industry had proposed increases in charges of some 6 - 3 per centoverall, but averaging 8-9 per cent for domestic consumers. Thesedid not appear to raise any serious issues. The various electricity boards had not yet formulated detailed proposals. But they were seeking an overall increase of 13 per cent, with average increases of about 20 per cent over the country as a whole for domestic consumers, although varying in different areas between 17 and 23 percent; in some areas particular consumers would face increases ofabout 25 per cent. He had been invited by the Social services committee to consider various alternative possibilities to reduce the overall increase to 10 per cent; to make such a reduction and to revert to the 1967 relationship between charges to domestic andother consumers; or to reduce the measure to 10 per cent overalland, in addition, to limit the maximum increase for domestic consumers to either 10 per cent or 12 per cent. The effects of adopting each of these courses were explained in CP (70) 107. Hewas, however, concerned at the degree of intervention in the Boards&apos;affairs which an instruction to reduce the proposed increases in anyof these ways before submission to the Consultative Councils would entail. The additional revenue sought by the industry was theminimum required to enable the Boards to meet their objectives;and insistence on a major reduction or on an arbitrary shift of the impact from domestic to industrial consumers, coupled with the intervention which he was having to undertake in respect of wage claims, could seriously affect the authority and responsibility of the boards and his relations with them. He therefore proposed thatthe Gas and Electricity Boards should be allowed to submit their proposals to the various Consultative Councils, subject only to the deletion from their calculations of any special allowance for wage increases next year and to some &quot; shading &quot; of the largest percentage increases to domestic consumers. The impact on those least ableto bear the increases might then be to some extent mitigated throughthe supplementary benefit machinery.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that most of the proposalswhich had been investigated at the request of the Social services committee entailed a loss of  40 million a year and some couldcost  70- 80 million a year. Such a reduction in revenue would mean a corresponding increase in the amounts which the industry wouldhave to borrow for their necessary, and overwhelmingly committed,investment. They must either borrow from the National loans fund or from the market. In either event the Government wouldhave to increase taxation or to tighten monetary policyproportionately, unless they were prepared to accept a furtherstimulus to inflation.   Moreover, the maintenance of charges to
domestic consumers at uneconomically low levels would tend to generate an increase in demand at a time when the industry was already pressing for an increase of some  48 million a year in itsinvestment programme to provide a reasonable margin of capacity.The proposals should be allowed to go to the Consultative Councils;and the Governmenfs position should be publicly reserved. TheElectricity Boards should, however, be encouraged to consider&quot; shading &quot; the highest domestic increases in consultation with the consultative Councils. The impact of the proposals on those mostin need might be met by the proposals which the Secretary of Statefor Social Services would be putting forward, coupled with theprovision of a lump sum payment to all current recipients of specialheating additions to supplementary benefits.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he had considered how the effects of the gas and electricity price increasesmight be mitigated for those recipients of supplementary benefitwho were most vulnerable. A general increase in benefit was not justified. Some 5-6 per cent of all claimants, however, receivedspecial heating additions because they were in poor health or occupied bad accommodation. The Supplementary BenefitsCommission had proposed that this scheme should be improved bychanging the basis of calculation, by substituting new rates and by applying these rates by reference to new criteria which would bring in large numbers of additional beneficiaries. The cost of the improvements would be up to  3^ million in a full year. The scheme would, however, take six months to implement; and conversion tothe new rates would only be complete at the end of June 1971. Hehad considered whether a simpler version of the scheme could beintroduced more quickly whether by paying a lump sum to allcurrent recipients of special additions or by paying a lump sum tothose dependent on gas and electricity only or by paying additionalsmall weekly sums to all current recipients of special additions.After full consideration, however, he had concluded that none ofthe devices would be satisfactory. He therefore recommended thatthe scheme proposed by the Supplementary Benefits Commission,which represented a genuine long-term improvement for those whoseneeds for extra heating were greatest, should be adopted.In discussion the following principal points were made:(a) The increase in charges to domestic consumers could bereduced if the Electricity Boards were relieved from having to meetthe past shortfall on their financial objectives. On the other hand,failure to recoup the shortfall would increase the industry&apos;s borrowing requirement and aggravate the existing problems of demand management.
Cabinet Office,19 November, 1970.(b) The increases would be liable, however, to strengthen the pressure for inflationary wage settlements and would be particularlyembarrassing in view of the Governmenfs commitments in respectof nationalised industry prices. i(c) This was a particularly awkward moment at which to correct the past imbalance between charges to industrial and domestic consumers by imposing sharp increases on the latter.(d) It might be appropriate to let the proposals go forward forconsideration by the Consultative Councils while reserving the government&apos;s position. The Government would then obtain the credit for any reductions in the proposals on which they might insistat a later stage. On the other hand the main impact on publicopinion would be that of the largest increase originally proposed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the scheme for increased special heatingallowances proposed by the Supplementary Benefits commission should be implemented as soon as possible. They would, however,need to give further consideration both to the proposals for mitigatingin the course of this winter the effects of the proposed increases in charges for gas and electricity and to the increases themselves.Before they resumed their discussion, however, the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry should provide estimates showing both theeffect on the charges for domestic consumers of electricity, if the overall 13 per cent increase proposed by the industry wereredistributed to retain the 1967 balance between domestic and otherconsumers and the extent to which the charges to domestic consumersmight be reduced if the previous shortfall on the industry&apos;s targets were not to be made up.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry toprovide the additional information referred to by the, Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion on the following day.
