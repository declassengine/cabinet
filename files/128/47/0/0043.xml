ParliamentaryAffairsIndustrialRelations bill previous reference:CM (70) 38thConclusions,Minute 2The restriction on Agreements(Estate Agents)Order 1970CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that the Opposition had intended onWednesday 9 December to table a Motion that the industrial relations Bill should be committed to a Committee of the wholeHouse in the expectation that the Government would feel boundto resist it. There might be substantial advantages, however, inpre-empting the Opposition by offering to debate the Bill on the floor of the House. This course would indicate the importance which the Government attached to it, would enable the government&apos;s arguments in favour of its detailed provisions to bemore effectively presented to the public and would be likely to commend itself to the Governmenfs supporters. These advantagesmust be weighed against the late sittings which would be entailedand the probable need to curtail the Whitsun Recess. Moreover,the time which the Committee Stage would consume on the floor of the House would put the rest of the Legislative programme at risk, and would endanger the Governmenfs ability to proceed witha certain number of Bills, some of which were desirable. on balance, however, he was disposed to recommend that the Billshould be taken on the Floor of the House.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that  the Committee Stage for the industrial relations Bill should be taken on the Floor of the House.(2) Invited the Lord President to announce this decision at theappropriate time.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Motion for an affirmative resolution on the Restriction on Agreements (Estate Agents) Order1970, which was to be taken as last order in the House of Lordsthat evening, was likely to encounter strong opposition. The Ordermight also be opposed in the House of Commons when the Motionwas taken on Monday, 7 December. The Order gave effect to a recommendation of the Monopolies Commission by renderingunlawful agreements between estate agents relating to charges inconnection with the disposal of unfurnished dwellings. the government&apos;s acceptance of this recommendation had been announced in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 16 July; butthe substance of the proposal had not been collectively discussed by Ministers. In the circumstances it was for consideration whetherthe Order should be withdrawn in order to enable it to be furtherstudied and to allow the interests affected to be consulted.
The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that,if Affirmative Resolutions in both Houses were not secured by theend of business on 7 December, the Order would lapse. Furtherconsideration and consultation with the interests affected mightmerely lead to the same outcome; and in the meantime oppositionto the measure would gather strength.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the wiser course was to proceed with the order as it stood.Remuneration of The Lord President said that the House of Commons was dueMembers of     faQ following afternoon to give a Second Reading to a Bill,Tj    yll Q TY1 ATI \introduced by Mr. Douglas Houghton, MP, which provided for theestablishment of a statutory review body to keep under review the emoluments, allowances, expenses and pensions of Members of theHouse of Commons. The review body was to be guided by anumber of principles set out in the Bill. The creation of a statutorybody for this purpose might prove politically embarrassing. Onthe other hand outright opposition to the Bill, which was backed by Mr. Turton, MP and Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd, MP would be liable tocreate the impression that the Government were rejecting a proposal which was inherently reasonable. It might be possible to temporiseby allowing the Bill a Second Reading. The Legislation Committee,however, had agreed on 1 December that it would be preferable thatthe Government spokesman in the debate should undertake torefer the salaries of Members of Parliament to the review body which was to consider top salaries in the public service under thearrangements announced in the House of Commons on 2November by the Secretary of State for Employment. This,together with the other review bodies which were proposed, wouldnot be established until early in the following year; and, even if the review body were to give priority to considering the remuneration of Members of Parliament, it was unlikely that its report would beavailable until the second half of 1971, by which time it was virtually inevitable that some review of Members&apos; remunerationshould be undertaken. As regards the frequency of such reviews,however, it might be preferable that, although the review bodieswould normally reconsider their findings every 2 years,Parliamentary salaries should not be subject to re-examination morethan once in the lifetime of each Parliament or in each period of4 years, whichever was the longer interval. If the Governmentcould give an undertaking of the kind which he had outlined,Mr. Houghton would probably withdraw his Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Lord President should give the proposed
undertaking. There were certain points, however, which wouldrequire consideration in due course. While the review bodies were intended to be independent, it would be necessary to frame theterms of reference on the remuneration of Members of parliament with care. They need not necessarily be identical with the termsof reference in other cases; and the Government should not be committed to giving effect to the review bodies&apos; recommendations.It would therefore be inadvisable for the Government spokesmanto be drawn into detail about the precise nature of the reference in question; and it should suffice to indicate that provision wouldbe made for Members&apos; remuneration to be considered in the context of the new salary review structure announced by theSecretary of State for Employment on 2 November. WhileMinisters&apos; remuneration and the allowances for Peers might beincluded within the reference, it should not be necessary to mentionthem in the undertaking given in the House of Commons.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Lord President to concert with the ministers concerned, in the light of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, the attitude to be adopted by theGovernment spokesman in the debate on Mr. Houghton&apos;bill that afternoon.(5) Invited the Lord President to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the terms of the proposedreview.The Courts Bill The Lord Chancellor said that amendments to the Courts Bill,which would enable solicitors to be appointed to the proposedcircuit bench and would give solicitors a larger right of audiencein the proposed Crown Courts, would probably be the subject of controversy during the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Houseof Lords that afternoon. In his view the Courts Bill was not asuitable vehicle for a change which ought more suitably to derive from a comprehensive review of the structure of the legal profession.He proposed to deal with the amendment on this basis in the hopeof trying to avoid dividing the House. But some of the sponsors ofthe amendment were likely to press their point of view.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that,while it was undesirable in principle to give way to an amendmentfounded upon an imperfect appreciation of the situation, it wasalso undesirable for the Government to press their view in theHouse of Lords if there was a possibility that further reflectionmight cause them to modify their view when the Bill reached theHouse of Commons.  It might therefore be preferable to avoid a
decisive confrontation on the issue during the Committee Stage inthe Upper House.The Cabinet (6) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in speaking during theCommittee Stage of the Courts Bill in the House ofLords, to be guided by the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.industrial affairs pay ofElectricitySupply workers and of manual workers in the gas and WaterSupplyIndustriesPreviousReference:CM (70) 41stConclusions,Minute 3SECRET2. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, as agreed by the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations,the Electricity Council had made a pay offer of an increaseequivalent to 10 per cent on average earnings at a meeting on 2December with the trade unions representing manual workers inthe electricity supply industry. The unions had rejected the offer and would be calling for a work-to-rule and an overtime ban from December. In the parallel negotiations about the pay of manual workers in the gas industry, which were due to be resumed on 7December, the Gas Council would take account of the attitude adopted by the Electricity Council; and he himself, proposed todiscuss the situation with the Chairmen of the two Councilsbeforehand. The employers in the water supply industry hadalready agreed that, in their negotiations on 4 December on the pay of their manual workers, they would seek to avoid embarrassingthe gas and electricity negotiations. Some Press reports of theprevious day&apos;s electricity negotiations had wrongly stated that theElectricity Councils offer amounted to a \2-\2\ per cent increase.This represented the increase in terms of average basic rates; taking account of other consequential increases, however, it was equivalentto 10 per cent on average earnings. He would be inviting theElectricity Council to take steps to correct this potentialmisrepresentation of their offer.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had considered whether there was any need to proclaim a State of Emergency on account of the work-to-rule inthe electricity supply industry, its likely effects on water supplyand sewage systems and the risk of parallel industrial action in the gas and water supply industries. They had concluded that the onlypurpose for which Emergency Powers might immediately be usedwould be to relieve the electricity and other authorities of their statutory supply obligations, and that this did not amount tosufficient justification for proclaiming a State of Emergency. TheCommittee would, however, keep a close watch on the effects ofthe work-to-rule in the electricity industry and would bring forwardrecommendations for taking Emergency Powers if it became
necessary to do so. In practice it would be more convenient in termsof the Parliamentary timetable if a State of Emergency were notdeclared before 10 December, since otherwise it might prove necessary to recall Parliament before 12 January in order toauthorise a renewal of the Emergency Regulations, if at that stagethey were still needed.Police Pay The  Home  Secretary  said   that  the  Ministerial  steering committee on Pay Negotiations had agreed that the police shouldbe offered an immediate general pay increase and, in addition, a review designed to produce further special payments to improve the strength of the police force. The Official Side of the police council, however, had decided not to adopt the course approvedby the Government and had offered an increase of 12 per centwithout any further review. This had been rejected by the staff side of the Police Council. He had subsequently discussed thematter with the members of the Official Side, who had now agreedto make an offer in line with the Governmenfs wishes, comprisingan immediate pay increase of 10 per cent, to be followed by negotiations on further specific increases for particular grades inorder to improve the strength of the police force. An offer on theselines might satisfy the Staff Side, who appeared interested in reaching a settlement.Demonstrations The Home Secretary said that unofficial strikes andon 8 December demonstrations appeared likely to take place on 8 December invarious parts of the country in protest against the industrial relations Bill. They might cause some inconvenience to the public and some loss of production in certain industries and services; butsupport for the protest appeared to be less strong than the organisers had hoped. In London there would be a mass marchof 20,000 or more from Tower Hill to Speakers Corner. the organisers were co-operating with the police as regards the necessary arrangements for the march; but, even though special measures would be taken to increase the number of police available, there might be some difficulty in controlling the crowd.The Cabinet (li)i Took note of the statements on pay negotiations,threatened industrial action and demonstrations planned for 8 December.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of State for Employment, to arrangefor appropriate guidance to the Press on the correctinterpretation of the pay offer made on 2 December tomanual workers in the electricity supply industry.
Public SectorRemunerationPreviousReference:CM (70) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4*(3) The Cabinet resumed their discussion of remuneration inthe public sector.The Prime Minister said that following the meeting of theCabinet on 1 December the Head of the Home Civil Service had discussed in confidence with a small number of permanent secretaries the implications of a waiver for 6 months of the increases in salary due on 1 January, 1971 at the highest levels of the groupsaffected: Permanent Secretaries, officers of equivalent rank in the diplomatic Service, the Higher Judiciary, 5 and 4-star officers ofthe Armed Services and Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of the boards of the major nationalised industries. As long as the highersalaries were authorised to be paid from 1 January, 1971 waiver of payment would not affect pension rights; nor would the amountwaived be subject to income or surtax so long as it was not drawn.It now appeared that the Order in Council to increase the remuneration of the Judiciary need not be made public untilTuesday, 8 December, so long as copies could be posted to membersof the House of Lords Special Orders Committee in time to reachthem that morning. If, therefore, the senior public servantsconcerned were willing to waive payment of the increases for months and the first indications were that there would be ageneral readiness to respond it would be possible to put the increases in the remuneration of the Judiciary into effect on1 January, 1971, to announce salary increases from 1 January, 1971for senior Service officers and simultaneously to make it known thatthose in the highest levels of the groups affected had offered to forgothe increases for a period of 6 months in the national interest.There remained the question whether Ministers should forgo a proportion of their salaries. It appeared that in 1951 the PrimeMinister (Mr. Churchill) had conceded that the waiver of ministerial salaries at that time had not achieved the result which he had hoped.The following were the main points made in discussion (a) It was agreed that to allow full effect to be given at this juncture to the increases on 1 January, 1971 would damageconfidence in the Governmenfs efforts to combat inflation; but thatit would not be equitable to treat the Judiciary and the seniorService officers differently from the Higher Civil Service and the chairmen of the Boards of nationalised industries.(b) It was pointed out that the salaries of Ministers had notbeen increased since 1964, that the present rates fell well short of
those recommended by the Committee on the Remuneration ofMinisters and Members of Parliament in 1964 and that no increase was currently proposed. It was argued that for Ministers to forgo,for a period, a proportion of the present salary would be regarded asan empty gesture savouring of panic and contrivance. It was argued, on the other hand, that some special gesture of leadershipwas required if there was a question of public servants forgoingpart of the remuneration which had been promised them.(c) Although the Higher Judiciary and the permanent secretaries and officers of the Diplomatic Service were likely to respond, the attitude of the Chairmen of the Boards of nationalised industries could not be foreseen, particularly as the increase in their salaries had followed a course different from those of permanent secretaries. The 5- and 4-star officers of the Armed Services were likely to be ready to respond, but, as their salaries were at present one stage behind those of the Higher Civil Service, they might justlyclaim that to waive only a proportion of the increase due on 1January, 1971 would be an equivalent gesture on their part.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view was that, for the reasons stated in discussion, it wouldbe inappropriate for Ministers temporarily to forgo a proportionof their present remuneration. The Cabinet were agreed that to announce that full effect would be given to the increases in the pay of the senior officers and to proceed with Orders giving full effectto the increases for the Judiciary would have an adverse effect on confidence in the Governmenfs determination to combat inflation;but that the Judiciary and the senior officers of the Armed services should be treated no differently from the Higher Civil Service andthe Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of the Boards of nationalised industries. There was general agreement that an offer at the highestlevels in all groups concerned to waive, for a period of 6 months,the increase which would take effect on 1 January would show ahexample of public spirit and would do much to ease the position.He, therefore, proposed to discuss further with the Ministers mainly concerned the implications of such a waiver with a view to makingfinal arrangements.The Cabinet-Took note, with  approval,  of  the Prime  Ministefssumming up of the discussion.
