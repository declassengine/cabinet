CM 41 (70)confidential parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons the following week.CONFIDENTIALCabinetBusinessMeetings ofthe CabinetCentral policy review StaffPreviousReference:CM (70) 34thConclusions,Minute 22. The Prime Minister said that, in view of his forthcomingvisits to North America in mid-December and to Singapore for theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in early January, itmight be necessary to make special arrangements to deal with cabinet business in the weeks ahead. Ministers would be advisedas early as possible of the meetings which would probably berequired; and he would be grateful for their co-operation inconforming to this timetable.The Prime Minister said that Lord Rothschild, who was makinga preliminary review of the field in which the Central Policy review staff (CPRS) was to operate, wished to consult individual Ministers,and subsequently Permanent Secretaries, about the issues which they thought the CPRS might most usefully examine at the outset. Hewas sure that his colleagues would extend their full co-operation toLord Rothschild in his inquiries.CONFIDENTIALIndustrialAffairsPay ofElectricitySupply workers and of manual workers in the gas IndustryPreviousReference:CM (70) 40thConclusions,Minute 23. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, as in thenegotiations on the pay of electricity supply manual workers on19 November, the negotiations on 25 November between the gas council and the trade unions about the pay of gas industry manual workers had been adjourned. They would be resumed on7 December. The unions had been offered the equivalent ofthe increase of 8-8 per cent in earnings already proposed for theelectricity supply trade unions. They had rejected this offer but hadnot so far threatened industrial action. Each of the unions in the separate gas, electricity and water supply pay negotiations appearedto be seeking to defer the critical point in the discussions until afterthe other two industries had reached a settlement. In general,however, the reaction of the unions to the pay offers made for electricity and gas workers was less extreme than might have been expected, although it might well become more intransigent when the critical stage was reached.128813-3b*
Pay of BOACPilotsPreviousReference:CM (70) 40thConclusions,Minute pay ofCraftsmen inGovernmentResearch andDevelopmentEstablishmentsPreviousReference:CM (70) 39thConclusions,Minute 3Gas andElectricityPricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 40thConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet were informed that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies would be considering at an early meeting contingencyplans for dealing with industrial action to which the pay disputes inthe gas and electricity industries might give rise in the near future.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theMinisters primarily concerned had agreed earlier in the week toauthorise the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) to open negotiations about an increase in the pay of pilots on the basispreviously found acceptable by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy. This was subject, however, to certain specificlimitations which the Corporation would have to observe. Theywere expected shortly to give the necessary assurances on this score; ,and confidential negotiations could then begin.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Civil Service trade unions concerned had been informed on 20 November of the Governmenfsrejection of their demand for a  4 a week increase for craftsmen inGovernment research and development establishments. They had referred the question to the individual unions, whose reactions werenot yet known. Some limited and sporadic unofficial industrial action had taken place as a result of the Governmenfs decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements on pay negotiations andthreatened industrial action.(2) Took note that the Ministerial Committee on Emergencieswould be considering at an early meeting contingencyplans for dealing with industrial action to which the paydisputes in the gas and electricity industries might giverise in the near future.4. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that on23 November the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC)had agreed on a revision of the proposals for increases in electricityprices and had asked for a revision, if possible, of the proposed increases in gas prices. These changes would meet the conditions laid down by the Cabinet in their previous discussion of the subject.The Chairmen of the Gas and Electricity Councils were willing toco-operate in making the changes sought by the Government andwere working out arrangements to put them into effect. Theprocedure for consultation with consumers about the new electricitytariff, however, was already so far advanced that it would not bepossible, as EPC had wished, to revise the tariff before submission to the Consultative Council; and it would accordingly be necessaryto devise other arrangements for ensuring public recognition of the government&apos;s action in limiting the increase in charges.
confidential. The Lord Chancellor said that the Second Reading debate on the Bill of Rights introduced by the Earl of Arran was to takeplace in the House of Lords that afternoon. The main provisions ofthe Bill sought to define the human rights and fundamental freedomswhich already existed, to prescribe the rights which no law of theland should be allowed to infringe and to give the parliamentary commissioner a duty to examine every Bill or statutory instrumentin order to ascertain whether any of their provisions wereinconsistent with the purposes or provisions of the Bill. TheLegislation Committee had concluded that the Bill was irremediablydefective; and he could not advise the House to give it a SecondReading. Nevertheless, there was considerable interest in it andsome sympathy for its objects; and it was bound to attract supportunless, in criticising it, he could demonstrate in a constructive waythe determination of the Government to take other measures toprotect the liberties of the subject according to the undertakings given in the Conservative Party&apos;s Manifesto at the General Election.For this purpose he would need to be able to point to definite action by the Government, such as the inquiry into powers of entry on landby public officers which the Home Secretary was promoting. It might also be possible to indicate sympathy with the concept of vesting inthe courts administrative jurisdiction in relation to local government,although this should not extend to central government.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, although the Bill ought not to be allowedto proceed, the Government must be seen to adopt a positive attitudetowards the problems of protecting individual liberty. The questionof vesting administrative jurisdiction in the courts raised important issues, on which no decision could be reached for the purpose of theforthcoming debate. It would be open to the Lord Chancellor,however, to mention a number of other measures which were underconsideration, including action to protect the privacy of computerrecords held by public authorities, to redefine the powers of entryCONFIDENTIAL128813-3 B* 2Libertyof theSubjectBill of rights the Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the Council, to make new arrangementsfor the presentation to the public of the increases in electricity prices.
on land by public officials and, possibly, to institute a procedure fordealing with complaints in the National Health Service. Correspond-ing action in relation to complaints in the field of local governmentwas under discussion with the local authority associations; but theestablishment of an appropriate procedure in this case might haveto await the reorganisation of local government as a whole.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor, in speaking in the debate onthe Second Reading of the Bill of Rights, to be guided bythe Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIALImmigration 6.   The Home Secretary said that work was proceeding on the drafting of an Immigration Bill on the lines set out in theConservative Party&apos;s Election Manifesto. As part of the prepara-tion for the introduction of the Bill he hoped to reach an agreementwith the Governments of Kenya and Uganda whereby, in return foran increase in the rate of admission of East African United Kingdom. passport holders of Asian origin desiring to enter this country, those governments would relax the various forms of pressure which were at present being exerted on these individuals and would readmitthose East African Asians who were returned to Africa afterattempting to enter this country without possessing entry vouchers.At present the annual quota of admissions was 1,500 heads of families. He proposed to increase this to 3,000, while at the sametime reducing the flow of other Commonwealth immigrants fromits present level of about 4,000 by at least 2,000. The bulk of thereduction would be in the categories of unskilled and semi-skilled workers. In parallel, he intended to effect some reduction in the rateof alien immigration.In discussion it was generally agreed that the Home Secretary&apos;proposal, if it resulted in a firm agreement with the Kenyan andUgandan Governments, should help to bring a long-standingproblem under control. There might be some difficulties in effecting the compensating reduction in other forms of commonwealth immigration, which was essential if the change was to be madeacceptable to domestic opinion. But these difficulties should not beinsurmountable. The change would not affect the status orprospects of United Kingdom passport holders of Asian origindomiciled in countries other than Kenya and Uganda.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Home Secretary and the Foreign and
secret oversea 7.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thereAffairs nacj j3een an unsUccessful attempt to invade Guinea by aboutGuinea 350 European mercenaries and 50 Guinean Africans. The invadershad failed in their presumed objective of overthrowing theGovernment of President Sekou Toure; but they had succeeded intheir subsidiary purposes of rescuing prisoners and destroyinginstallations used by the followers of the guerilla leader, AmilcarCabral. There was little doubt of the complicity of the portuguese government, although they would certainly deny this when the incident came to be investigated by the United Nations missionwhich had been despatched to Conakry. So far as was known, none of the Europeans involved in the attempted coup were Britishsubjects. i iVietnam The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theostensible reason given by the United States Administration for the resumption of bombing of North Vietnam had been retaliation foran attack by North Vietnamese forces on unarmed United Statesreconnaissance aircraft. In reality, however, the United Statesaction had been directed to disrupting North Vietnam and Vietcongsupply routes. It was not known how far the renewed bombing hadbeen successful in achieving this objective. The United StatesGovernment were maintaining their policy of Vietnamisation, forwhich they claimed a considerable measure of success: but theyevidently thought it desirable to demonstrate from time to time thatthey also retained their capacity to take offensive action when necessary.The Cabinet (1) Took  note   of   the   statements   by  the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.Commonwealth Secretary should now arrange for negotiations withthe Governments of Kenya and Uganda on the basis proposed. Ifthese negotiations succeeded, the way would be clear for a parliamentary announcement either when the Immigration Bill was introduced or at some other appropriate point.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Home Secretary, inconjunction with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, to proceed accordingly.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theemergency operations by British forces following the cyclone disasterin East Pakistan were making a major contribution to the relief of hardship and distress. Moreover, appeals for private donations inthe United Kingdom had resulted in the collection so far ofthe remarkable total of over  1 million.In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that the scale,speed and effectiveness of British assistance following the disasterdeserved to be more widely known. Appropriate publicity for the effort involved could be valuable in terms not merely of our international relations but also of recruitment to the Forces.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theSecretary of State for Defence to consider how theBritish relief programme for East Pakistan could begiven more effective publicity.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that discussions were currently being held in London with the NewZealand Government on the problems created by our decision toimpose a levy on imports of lamb, for which prices in New zealand had to be fixed in January. The New Zealand authorities attachedconsiderable importance to the introduction of the import levycharge by stages; and we therefore intended to propose that itshould be imposed at the rate of Id. per lb. with effect from 1 April,1971, and that the full rate of 3d. per lb. should not be imposed until12 months after that date.In the course of a brief discussion there was general agreement that this concession should be made in the interest of securing anagreement on imports of New Zealand foodstuffs generally. It was essential, however, that the New Zealand Government should notonly accept the other provisions of the agreement but should alsopublicly commit themselves to doing so.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and of the points made in discussion.
Finances ofthe MerseyDocks andHarbourBoardPreviousPreference:CM (70) 37thConclusions,Minute 6CM 41 (70)SECRET8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (70) ill) about the finances of the mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB).The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinet had last discussed the matter, the Ministers most directly concerned had considered it further. There were a limited number of courses opento the Government. They could do nothing, in which case if theMDHB could not find bridging finance elsewhere, they would haveto declare themselves insolvent, there would be a scramble for the assets and the port might come to a standstill, and it would not bepossible to make the necessary immediate changes in the manage-ment. The Government could arrange to provide the necessary 5- 8 million bridging finance to meet the Board &apos;s immediate cashrequirements, including those for the repayment of bonds on1 January, 1971, while a Bill was passed providing for a financialreconstruction; in this way the Government would be able to insist on a new management being installed immediately on an ad hocbasis and on the long-term reconstitution of the Board.Alternatively, the Cabinet could decide not to provide any bridgingfinance but to apply with the consent of the Board for theappointment of a receiver of rates on behalf of all the securedcreditors, thereby gaining the time in which the capital could bereconstructed and the management reconstituted by legislation in an orderly fashion. It was, of course, still possible that the users might put up the bridging finance but present indications were that theywould not be willing to do so. The majority of the Ministers directly concerned felt that the Government should not provide bridgingfinance but should be ready to apply for the appointment of areceiver as soon as this was appropriate; that they should, however,agree to continue financing the Seaforth Dock project provided thatthe Board agreed to delegate their functions to the proposed newExecutive Committee. The Government should also accept theinclusion of their existing capital loans in the reconstruction of theBoard&apos;s finances and ensure that the pensioners were paid in the interim period if the receiver felt unable to do so. The cabinet should be aware that the Board had argued that their troubles werein part attributable to the action of the previous Government inrejecting or reducing proposed increases in charges, to the advice ofthe Bank of England that they should not make a long-termdebenture issue but issue bonds for periods up to 30 months, andto the threat of nationalisation. These arguments would, however,apply to many organisations; the Government could not acceptliability for the consequences of actions of the previous administration.
In discussion the following points were made (a) While the port users were likely to agree to a levy on portcharges for the coming year which would raise some  2 million, theywere unlikely to agree to put up the remaining bridging finance; itwas, however, possible that they would offer to contribute part ifthe Government would also contribute.(b) To make sure of at least the essential legislation this session, the MDHB proposed to present a Private Bill on Friday,27 November, providing for a two-year moratorium on capitalrepayments and a temporary reduction in interest payments. Theywould at the same time announce that they intended to bring forward a further Bill to write down their fixed interest capital debtby 30 per cent and to create equity share capital to replace the written-down portion as well as providing for the creation of a statutory company. They were also proposing in the short Bill todeal with interim changes in Board membership, providing that allthe appointments should be made by the Secretary of State for the environment. It was argued that this latter provision might bedifficult to defend politically and might confer on the government an excessive responsibility for the Board&apos;s future development. Itmight be better to wait for the main Bill, when more satisfactoryprovision might be made, possibly involving the appointment ofBoard members by the equity holders. On the other hand it was argued that the alternative was to leave the present whollyunsatisfactory system in existence; that by requiring the Board totransfer their functions to the new Executive Committee theGovernment would in any event be taking a considerableresponsibility for the Board&apos;s actions in the interim period; and thatwhile the exercise by the Executive Committee of the Board&apos;s functions for a time was defensible, if the situation were prolongedbeyond a few months it might be open to challenge.(c) To ensure the co-operation of the MDHB in the appoint-ment of the Executive Committee and in the proposed receivershipit might be necessary to make it clear that if, but only if, theyco-operated the Government would continue to finance theconstruction of the Seaforth Dock.(d) The MDHB would make a statement when their Bill wasdeposited making clear their intentions and saying that they were still exploring ways of obtaining sufficient finance to meet theircommitments including the maturing bonds. A Governmentholding statement would be needed but, it was argued, there was no need for it to be made in Parliament as it would convey no decisions,only the Governmenfs acquiescence in the inclusion in the capital reconstruction of their existing capital loan.
CM 41 (70)(e) A receiver might feel able to pay the Board&apos;s pensioners, butif not the Government would have to ensure that they did notsuffer.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should not provide anybridging finance, even if the users were prepared to contribute mostof it. The Secretary of State for the Environment and the Ministerfor Transport Industries should so inform the Board, and it would,oi course, be open to the latter to try to find the necessary fundselsewhere. Preparation should, however, be continued so that an urgent application could be made by the Government to the court for the appointment of a receiver of the rates on behalf of all thesecured creditors as soon as the Board declared themselves insolventor this step became necessary to forestall an application by othercreditors. The Board should be informed that if they co-operated in the appointment of the proposed Executive Committee and (ifthey failed to find other bridging finance) in a receivership, theGovernment would be prepared to continue financing the existingSeaforth Dock project; the Cabinet were not, however, prepared atthis stage to commit themselves to financing any extension to theSeaforth works now in hand. The Secretary of State for the environment and the Minister for Transport Industries should consider further with the Solicitor-General whether it would bepossible to arrange for the Executive Committee to exercise theBoard&apos;s functions until a definitive reconstitution of the Board couldbe provided for in the main Bill. If not, it would be necessary toagree to the proposed provision giving the power of appointments tothe Board to the Secretary of State. Arrangements should be madefor a brief holding statement to be issued by the Government afterthe MDHB had made theirs; it was not necessary for a statement tobe made in Parliament. While the Cabinet agreed that the pensionsmust be paid in one way or another, no Government commitmentshould be made in the statement. The Chief Secretary, Treasury,should ensure that the Governor of the Bank of England was informed of the position in view of its possible implications for thebond market.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed that no bridging finance should be made availableto the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board from government sources.(3) Agreed that the Government should, if necessary, seek theappointment of a receiver of the rates on behalf of all
the secured creditors of the Mersey Docks and HarbourBoard and, if he felt unable to arrange for payment ofpensions, to provide funds for that purpose.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment and theMinister for Transport Industries (i) To inform the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board ofthe position and arrange with them for theappointment of the proposed Executive Committeeand for their co-operation, if necessary, in theappointment of a receiver.(ii) To arrange, in consultation with the Solicitor-General (a) For further consideration to be given urgentlyto the need for the inclusion in the MerseyDocks and Harbour Board&apos;s short privatebill of interim provisions for appointments to the Board.(b) To   make  the  necessary  preparations  for appointment of the receiver.(iii) To arrange, in consultation with the Lord President,for a brief Government statement to be made onthe lines indicated in the summing up of thediscussion.(5) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,  to inform theGovernor of the Bank of England of the position.
