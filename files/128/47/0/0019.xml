Acts ofViolenceAgainst civil aircraft(previous reference :CM (70) 18thConclusions)CM 19 (70)secret. The Prime Minister, reviewing developments since the cabinet&apos;s last meeting, said that HM Ambassador in Washingtonhad been informed that the Cabinet regarded it as increasinglyurgent that the United States Government should extract fromthe Government of Israel an undertaking that they would contribute to the exchange of prisoners which was required to secure therelease (pf the hostages held by the Arab Fedayeen organisation,the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP); and that, indefault of such a contribution, the British, German and SwissGovernments might be unable to maintain solidarity with theGovernments of the United States and Israel in the attempt topromote a non-discriminatory settlement. In reply HM ambassador had warned us of the potentially serious consequences for Anglo-United States relations if we decided to negotiate with the PFLPon a three-Power or country-by-country basis. Later that evening,however, the United States representative at the five-Power Group inBerne had put forward, ad referendum to Governments, a formula fora communication to the PFLP, suggesting that the Berne group should provide the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)with a mandate indicating that the five Governments agreed toconsider the proposal of the PFLP in relation to the exchange ofhostages at such time as the PFLP provided the Group with their total demands, including specific lists of the Fedayeen whom thePFLP wanted. The Ministers directly concerned had considered this formula and had concluded that, although it was less positivethan we would have wished, the considerations adduced by HMAmbassador in Washington suggested that we should accept it,provided that the other Governments concerned, including theGovernment of Israel, endorsed it without delay. The Swiss andGerman Governments had accepted the formula. But the Israelirepresentative had returned a temporising and essentially negativereply, indicating that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mrs. Meir, andForeign Minister, Mr. Eban, were on their way to the United Statesand it was therefore not possible for his Government to reach animmediate decision.Meanwhile, there had been a major change in the situation in that early that morning hostilities had broken out between the JordanianArmy and the Fedayeen. The initiative appeared to have been takenby the latter, who had attempted to sieze the Amman radio station;but, in doing so, they had clearly provided the army with theopportunity for which it had been waiting. There had been heavy fighting in Amman: a curfew had been imposed; and persons movingin the streets were liable to be shot on sight by the army. The army121452A 2
claimed to have wrested control from the Fedayeen in several areas.The Fedayeen had appealed for help to the Governments of Iraq and syria; but those Governments were likely to be deterred fromreinforcing the Fedayeen by the consideration that, if they intervenedon one side, the Government of Israel might well do so on the other.The United States Government had so far taken no action beyonddiscreet measures to alert certain units. Meanwhile, the hostages,whose whereabouts in Amman were still not precisely known, had clearly been put at increased risk by the outbreak of fighting. a message had been broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation,in the terms agreed by the Cabinet at their previous meeting, appealingfor the safety of the hostages and of all foreign nationals. Onereport suggested that the leader of the PFLP, Dr. George Habbash,had declared that the hostages would be killed if the Jordanian Armydid not cease firing on the PFLP. Another report, however, providedgrounds for hoping that the Jordanian Army might now be gainingcontrol of the area in which the hostages were believed to be locatedand might therefore be able to hand the hostages over to us in thecourse of the evening.In view of the uncertainty of the situation and the impossibilityin present circumstances of making direct contact with the PFLP,we had thought it best to concentrate our efforts on obtaining, ifpossible, the agreement of the five-Power Group to the proposedmessage to the PFLP, which should then be conveyed to them bybroadcast or any other means which might be practicable. The draftproposed should be in rather more direct and positive terms thanthe formula put forward by the United States and should, inparticular, make it clear that the five Governments were prepared to open negotiations about the proposal of the PFLP immediately thePFLP provided the Berne Group with their total demands, includingspecific lists of the Fedayeen whom the PFLP wanted; that the fiveGovernments had furnished the ICRC with an urgent mandate onthis basis; and that meanwhile they held the PFLP responsible forthe safety of the hostages in Jordan. It was unlikely, however, thatthe Israeli representative in Berne, as at present instructed, would bein a position to agree to a message on these lines; and in that event it would be necessary to consider whether the message should be senton a four-Power basis or, if the United States Government also were unwilling to agree, on a three-Power basis. In order to avoid anymisunderstanding the King of Jordan should be informed of our intentions.The outbreak of hostilities between the Jordanian Army and the fedayeen clearly entailed the possibility that the PFLP, if their defeatappeared imminent, might try to use the hostages as a bargaining counter with the Jordanian Army and Government.   It would
121452b*therefore be wise to try to persuade the King to warn the Fedayeenthat, if the hostages were surrendered alive, the lives of theirFedayeen guards would also be spared but that no such guaranteecould be given if the hostages suffered harm.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that reports received from Amman since the beginning of the meeting indicated that King Hussein considered that the army would be able by that evening to achieve their objective of clearing the area in which thehostages were thought to be. Meanwhile, the United StatesGovernment remained opposed to any attempt by the countries concerned to negotiate with the PFLP individually; but there now appeared for the first time to be some disposition on their part tobring pressure to bear on the Government of Israel to make a contribution to the proposed exchange of prisoners for hostages.In discussion it was agreed that our own action must still depend,for as long as possible, on the success of the belated attempt by theGovernment of the United States to influence Israeli policy. If theycould persuade the Government of Israel to endorse the revisedformula which we were proposing in Berne, it should be possible tomaintain the united front of the five Powers. But we should inform them forthwith that, in default of an Israeli contribution to thispurpose, we might be compelled to abandon the attempt to achieve a non-discriminatory settlement and might have to try to deal withthe PFLP on a four-Power, or even a three-Power, basis. A three-Power settlement would entail our sacrificing the United Stateshostages; and it would presumably be unwelcome to the United StatesGovernment for that reason. A four-Power settlement, on the otherhand, was unlikely to be acceptable to the PFLP, since it wouldrequire them to surrender the United States hostages without anycompensating recovery of the Fedayeen prisoners held by theGovernment of Israel. In the last resort, therefore, each of theGovernments concerned might have to assert their right to drive thebest bargain they could.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that action should be taken forthwith to give effect to the various conclusions which had emerged from the Cabinefs review of the critical situationwhich was developing. Meanwhile, a public statement should bemade, with the authority of the Cabinet, emphasising that theoutbreak of fighting in Amman had created new dangers for thehostages and that the Government had immediately taken further steps, in consultation with the other Governments concerned, to seek to protect both the lives of the hostages and the safety of the Britishand other international communities in Jordan.
The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Concorde(previous reference :CM (70) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP (70) 40), to which was attached a Memorandum on the concorde aircraft project which had been prepared by an inter-departmental group of officials.The Minister of Technology said that it had not yet proved possible to relate this analysis of the Concorde project to a similar,but more comprehensive, study of the various possible decisions on other aircraft projects, with an analysis of their implications for our international relations, for the future of the British aircraft industryand for public expenditure. These issues would be the subject of afurther memorandum which he hoped to circulate shortly. In themeantime, however, at least an interim decision was urgently needed on the Concorde project. There was a general expectation, by bothdomestic public opinion and the French Government, that we would indicate our attitude shortly in the near future; and progress with thecurrent test programme would make it essential, even before the testshad been completed and evaluated, to take certain decisions on theprogramme. The first tests at twice the speed of sound (Mach 2) hadbeen expected to be completed by 30 June; and the previous government had arranged to review the project with the french authorities at that time they had also considered that the correspondence with the French Government would have enabled us to withdraw from the project at that date, although the FrenchGovernment themselves did not accept this interpretation. It might,in fact, have proved just possible to withdraw at that time. Now thatwe were in the middle of the main test programme, however, and testsat Mach 2 were expected to start within a month, there seemed no alternative but to continue with the project until it could bere-evaluated in the light of the tests, i.e., probably until the end ofMarch 1971. On any likely evaluation it would be clear at that point that, even if all expenditure already committed was written off, future expenditure would on the most favourable assumptionsstill result in substantial losses. Continuation of the project wouldmoreover make it difficult to achieve the reduction in expenditure by the Ministry of Technology on which the Cabinet had decided attheir previous meeting; and it would almost certainly be impossibleto proceed also with the BAC 3-11 project. Nevertheless, it wouldbe wrong to withdraw from Concorde before March 1971. In themeantime we should try to establish with the French Governmentthat there would by then be a major review of the future of the
project, on the basis of which it would be open to us to withdraw. Itmust be recognised, however, that the French authorities had so farshown no signs of wishing themselves to withdraw from the project.As for the period between now and March, expenditure and commitments were already being limited as far as practicable; andfurther reductions in expenditure could not be achieved without anapparent breach of faith.The Solicitor General said that, in legal terms, a decision to cancel at this particular point would probably put us at the greatestdisadvantage. As we had now allowed some 2\ months to elapsesince the June date for a review of the project, the next logicaljuncture of the same kind would occur when the Mach 2 tests hadbeen concluded and evaluated. If a decision were delayed untilMarch, our position then would be, if anything, slightly morefavourable than the position in July, on which the Law Officers had reported in CP (70) 17.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that there was no prospect of the Concorde project itself proving economic, even if all expenditure so far incurred were regarded as written off. The cost of continuing it would be particularly heavy during the next few years,when it was proving extremely difficult to secure the economies in public expenditure which were needed to give the Chancellor of theExchequer room for manoeuvre on taxation. For instance, thepublic expenditure costs of Concorde in 1971-72 would more than offset the expenditure in that year which was still in dispute betweenthe social service Ministers and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.Moreover, while it was conceivable that an all-Concorde fleet mightoperate profitably, the British Overseas Airways Corporation(BOAC) estimated that the inclusion of Concorde in a mixed fleetwith other aircraft which they would have to maintain to serve routesfor which Concorde was unsuitable, would cost them up to 3 million a year for each Concorde purchased. While this estimatemight be excessive, there was no reason to doubt that BOACsprofitability would be reduced; and this loss must be added to the loss on development and production. Moreover, the aircraft presentedsubstantial environmental problems. While it was possible that, onentry into service, it might comply with the existing noise regulationsat Heathrow Airport, the subsonic planes then coming into service would be substantially quieter. Moreover, the lateral noise would be higher than that even of existing planes. The situation in New Yorkwas more complex, since the Airport Authority could be sued forexcessive noise. If the United States Congress authoriseddevelopment of the Boeing Supersonic Transport (SST), the UnitedStates aircraft industry might wish to co-operate in ensuring that such
planes were acceptable at the major airports; but they might still use the noise factor as a pretext for delaying Concorde&apos;s access to new york and so reducing its time lead over the SST. If the latter werenot authorised, it would be even more in the interests of the UnitedStates aircraft firms to co-operate with environmental interests indenying the Concorde access to United States airports. There was,therefore, at least a risk that Concorde could never be used on theprincipal North Atlantic routes for which it had primarily been designed. Deferring a decision until March 1971 would not put us in any better position to withdraw from the project unilaterally;and we would have lost a unique opportunity of demonstrating thatthe new Government would follow sensible economic priorities.Moreover, if Britain withdrew from the project after the proposedreview in March, a further  30 million or so would have been spent.On the other hand it was argued that our unilateral withdrawal from the project would have serious consequences for our relationswith the French Government, who still gave the project high priority,and might be expected to take the matter to the International Court.Moreover, they would not be alone in considering a unilateral decision as evidence of our unreliability as a partner; and this might adversely affect the attitude of other members of the European economic community (e.c.) at a particularly sensitive point in our negotiationsfor accession to the Community. Whatever the precise legal position,cancellation while the main test programme was in progress was likely to be unacceptable to public opinion both in this country andabroad, since it would amount to a breach of faith which would seriously damage our reputation for reliability. Indeed, in the light of past experience of cancelled projects, we might, thereafter, find itdifficult, if not impossible, to secure any future orders for majoraircraft projects. Moreover, it was possible that the reassessment ofthe project in the light both of the forthcoming tests and of thedecision on the SST might show that, even if it were unlikely to proveeconomic, its prospects were less unfavourable than we, as opposedto the French, now thought. It was also possible that BOAC hadexaggerated the cost to them of operating a part-Concorde fleet andthat the growth of total air traffic might enable full use to be madeof the fleet even if all first-class traffic were diverted to the Concorde.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that there was no practical alternative to continuing with the project until March 1971, in order to allow thecurrent programme of tests to be completed and evaluated. TheMinisters primarily concerned, however, should consider urgentlyhow we could best put ourselves into a position by then to withdraw from the project without breach of faith with the FrenchGovernment or adverse effects on our standing with our prospectivepartners in the European Economic Community.   Our purpose
should be to reach agreement with the French authorities that therewould be a fundamental review of the project before the end ofMarch in the light of the results of the test programme and the latestassessment of Concorde&apos;s commercial prospects, including theairline&apos;s prospects of being able to operate it profitably. TheCabinet would also have to consider the balance of advantage interms of either continuing or withdrawing from the project in relationto other aircraft projects. Meanwhile, consideration should be givento the desirability of announcing, in the context of the Governmenfsforthcoming statement on public expenditure, that there would be a fundamental review of the Concorde project in March 1971.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, the President of the Board of Trade, the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Attorney-General (i) to consider urgently what action should now be takenin relation to the French Government in order toestablish our position on the lines indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion;(ii) to prepare the further assessment of the concorde project which would be required in order to enablethe Cabinet to reach a decision before the end ofMarch 1971.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th September, 1970.
