confidential. The Lord President, reviewing the situation resulting fromthe strike action taken by local authority manual workers, saidthat on 2 October the Greater London Council (GLC) had warned theGovernment that troops might be required by the following morning to ensure sewage disposal; and he had accordingly arranged, withthe   subsequent   approval   of   the   Ministerial   Committee   on: SECRET.:  .SECRET/ - The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that his meeting with president Nixon at Chequers on Saturday 3 October had taken placein a very cordial atmosphere. The President clearly wished toestablish a close relationship with the new British Government andhad emphasised that he hoped that each country would be able todiscuss its policies with the other with complete freedom andfrankness. It was in this spirit that he had reviewed United Statesobjectives in different areas of the world and had indicated that theUnited States Government intended to continue to resist the probingof the Sino-Soviet bloc wherever it was necessary to do so, whileadhering to their announced intention to withdraw their land forcesprogressively from Vietnam. It was in the same spirit that he had also counselled us, in dealing with the problem of safeguarding thetrade routes across the Indian Ocean and round the Cape, to consultour own interests and our own security, in the assurance that theUnited States Government would do nothing to embarrass us.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he hadconducted parallel discussions with the United States Secretary ofState, Mr. Rogers, with particular reference to the situation in theMiddle East. They had agreed that the only realistic objective inpresent circumstances was to work for an extension of the cease-fire and to try to ensure the reactivation of Ambassador Jarring&apos;s mission,possibly on the basis of amplified instructions. The need for somefresh initiative to establish peace in the Middle East was clearlyintensified by the death of President Nasser of the United arab republic (UAR), whose funeral he had attended on the previousThursday. During his brief visit to Cairo he had had discussions with the Foreign Minister of the UAR, M. Riad, who had been in amood of great pessimism and had dismissed the suggestion of any kind of co-operation with the Government of Israel as whollyunrealistic. By contrast, King Hussein had been surprisinglyconfident of his ability to re-establish control over Jordan after his recent struggle with the Fedayeen. The situation, therefore, remainedextremely unstable; and we could not afford to relax our efforts topromote a peaceful settlement.
Emergencies, for the provision of troops if they were requiredfor this purpose. Together with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment he had seen the union leaders directly involved, as wellas Mr. Feather, the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress.They had impressed on the union leaders the health hazards whichLondon and some other parts of the country now faced; and theyhad told them that, if insufficient volunteers were forthcoming toman the sewage works, the Government would introduce troops, as necessary, in order to avoid risks to human health and that, in doing so, they would be adopting arrangements similar to those made earlier in the summer by the previous Administration. They had also made it clear to the union leaders that, if the GLC requested troops toman the sewage works, the Lord President or the Home secretary would first ask the union leaders concerned whether they could give an immediate and positive assurance that their members wouldprovide the necessary manpower and that it would only be in theabsence of a reliable assurance of this kind that troops would beemployed. Mr. Feather and the union leaders involved had acceptedthese arrangements for dealing with such an emergency.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that the glc at present had sufficient volunteers to man their sewage works for at least 48 hours and perhaps for a week. But the volunteerswere being subjected to spasmodic harassment by strikers; andsome might accordingly withdraw their services. The GLC had tosteer a difficult course in emphasising the health hazards sufficiently to attract volunteers without causing unnecessary public anxiety.As regards the rest of the country the overflow of crude sewageinto the Avon did not so far involve a serious risk to health: itwas in fact a return to the method of sewage disposal which had beennormal practice in Bristol until quite recently. There were seriousrisks to the environment in some places-for example to fish in theRiver Lea-but none so far to human health.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Emergencies should consider whethertroops should be used to avert damage to the environment, forexample in the River Lea, as well as hazards to human health.The Committee should also consider whether advice should be givento the GLC about their public statements on the situation, which atpresent seemed to alternate between forecasts of impending crisis andreassurances that all was well.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to consider the points madeby the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet.
CM 26 (70)SECRET*3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a note by theChief Secretary, Treasury (CP (70) 68), and of a note by the Secretaryof the Cabinet (CP (70) 58) covering a situation report by Treasuryofficials on public expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that, in accordancewith the decision of the Cabinet (CM (70) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4,Conclusion 3) he and the Chief Secretary had had further discussions with Ministers concerned about the proposals for additional expenditure which had been put forward. They had, in large measure, reached agreement.The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (70) 54, 59 and 70) about expenditureon health, welfare and social security and measures to help the poorerfamilies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion of reductions in expenditure on health and welfare (CM (70) 24th Conclusions, Minute 2, Conclusion 9),the Secretary of State for Social Services had agreed to raise afurther  15 million a year by putting prescription charges on a proportionate basis from the earliest practicable date, subject to theretention of substantial exemptions and a limit on the charge on each prescription. Agreement had also been reached on increases in expenditure on health and welfare in Great Britain totalling  20million in 1971-72 and  30 million a year in the three following years.This would enable a start to be made on desirable improvements in these services pending the review of the finances of theNational Health Service. Agreement had also been reached,following the earlier discussion (CM (70) 24th Conclusions, Minute 2,Conclusion 12), that in connection with the 1971 uprating of social security benefits, which the Cabinet had already agreed should take account of price increases only,  45 million in a full year should bemade available for selected improvements for such groups as the disabled and the chronic sick; in 1973 the provision for selectedhelp to such groups would be found from within a total upratingequivalent to the cost of living plus 60 per cent of the differencebetween that and the increase in real earnings. They had also agreed that  17-5 million in a full year should be made availablefor measures to help the poorer families, including the proposedfamily income supplement (FIS) scheme, concessions to those justabove the limit for exemption from the various charges, and an
increase in the uptake of certain services. The proposal for interimupratings of supplementary benefit in 1972 and 1974 should beconsidered later as claims on the contingency reserve. It had not proved practicable to attack family poverty by uprating family allowances, but it would later be possible to consider claims on the contingency reserve for up to  15 million a year to provide additionalhelp for poor families.In discussion, concern was expressed at the apparent need for two Bills in the same or successive Sessions, first to increaseprescription charges to 4s. Od. and then to put them on to a proportionate basis. Doubt was also expressed as to the possibilityof getting the Bill introducing the FIS scheme through parliament before Christmas. The gap between the date of implementation ofthe charges increases and that of the FIS scheme was disquieting.The latter could not, however, be advanced for administrative reasons,and there would be a substantial loss of revenue if the chargesincreases were delayed until the FIS scheme was introduced.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the agreements referred to in the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the proposals for the family income supplement scheme set out in CP (70) 70.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, inconsultation with the Lord President, to give further thought (i) To the possibility of providing , for both theproposed changes in prescription charges in asingle Bill.(ii) To the timing of the Family Income Supplementitflp   M        Bill. &apos; tf^j   m^iiM :     &apos;(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Social Services, to arrange for the Social services committee to give further consideration to the timing ofthe increases in charges in relation to the introductionof the family income supplement scheme.(4) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned, to give further consideration to the implications for the legislative programme of the public expenditure proposals as a whole.Education The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP (70) 47) by theSecretary of State for Education and Science on school building programmes.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science recalled thatshe had agreed to measures proposed by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, which would reduce educational expenditure by  180million over the four years 1971-72 to 1974-75. In her memorandumshe sought offsetting new commitments in respect of school buildingamounting to  71 million, of which  59 million would be spentduring the period, less whatever sums she could secure from savings in other educational building programmes starting in 1973-74.Having regard to the plans of the previous Administration, herproposals were the minimum consistent with their Election pledges,in particular the explicit pledge to do more for the primary schools.She therefore wished to bring the 1972-73 programme up to the1971-72 level of  147-5 million starts, by diverting capital resources from other educational building programmes to provide for an extra 8 million of primary school starts, and by using part of the savingsit had been agreed to make on educational expenditure generally.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said he had discussed theSecretary of State for Education and Science&apos;s proposals with her on  October. In effect she was proposing an increase of  37 million in public expenditure over the period to 1974-75 and he had offeredan increase of  20 million over this period on the assumption that 5^ million of starts could be found in 1972-73 as in 1971-72 byswitching expenditure from other parts of the school building programme to improvements. However, it now appeared that theSecretary of State for Education and Science was unable to repeat the 5^ million switch in the school building programme for 1972-73which his offer had assumed. His proposals were without prejudice to the programme for 1973-74 and later years, which would have tobe considered nearer the time.In discussion it was argued that, whilst the Governmenfs pledge to improve the primary schools must be honoured, this did notnecessarily require a commitment to the same levels of expenditure as their predecessors. Moreover, the Government would be judgedby physical results rather than by levels of expenditure and it wouldbe worth examining further, in consultation with the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works, whether better value could be obtained for money spent. It was pointed out on the other hand that CP (70) 47was concerned only to equate the proposed provision for the basicschool building programme and for improvements and disregardedexpenditure for raising the school-leaving age; it was important notto reduce the allocations for these purposes if the Governmentsstated intention to do more for the primary schools was to remaincredible.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,should seek to resolve with the Secretary of State for Education and science the remaining differences between the respective proposals;and the Secretary of State for Education and Science should consider further whether the balance she sought for new starts in the primaryschool programme could be found by diverting resources fromother educational building programmes. They should keep theSecretary of State for Scotland in touch with their discussions, inorder that any agreement should make appropriate provision forScotland; and the Home Secretary would be available to assist in seeking a settlement. If, after these further discussions, differencesremained the matter would need to be resolved by the Cabinet at alater meeting.The Cabinet-(5) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Education and Science (i) To have further discussions, with a view to identifyingmore precisely and, if possible, resolving theirremaining differences of view as to the provision to be made for school building programmes.(ii) To report any agreement reached to the cabinet as soon as possible.(hi) If no agreement could be reached, to set out for theCabinet the precise area of disagreement and sumsat issue.Employment The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of services State for Employment and Productivity (CP (70) 57) about theemployment services.The Cabinet (7) Agreed additional expenditure in 1974-75, beyond that provided in the present estimates, of  2 - 25 million toprovide the necessary staff to administer the proposedindustrial relations legislation and  0 - 5 million for training the unemployed.(8) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to have further discussions about the remaining proposals in cp (70) 57.
Assistanceto theHotelIndustryProposed New       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of the design Board of Trade (CP (70) 43) about a proposed new Design Council.CouncilIn discussion there was wide agreement that it would not be appropriate to provide additional financial assistance to launch theproposed new Council at a time of large-scale reductions in other government expenditure. Although the establishment of the council might be sensible, it would be right to examine further whetherindustry, as the prime beneficiary, should bear the additional cost.The Cabinet (9) Did not at present approve the proposed additional expenditure of  0 - 5 million a year proposed in CP (70) 43.(10) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to investigate generally, indue course, the possibility of transferring all or more ofthe costs of the proposed Council and of other existingbodies whose primary purpose was to provide servicesof value to industry and commerce.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade about assistance to the hotel industry (CP (70) 46).The Cabinet-(11) Approved CP (70) 46.(12) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to consider whether some assistance might be provided to hotels in development areas as part of the new measures which were now beingevolved to provide assistance to the development areaswhen investment grants were withdrawn and to arrangefor any such proposals to be considered by the ministerial committee on Regional Policy and the Environment.Overseas Aid The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of overseas development (CP (70) 44) and the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs (CP (70) 42) about the British contributionto overseas aid.The Minister of Overseas Development invited the Cabinet toagree that at the United Nations General Assembly in October thePrime Minister should pledge the Governmenfs best endeavours toreach the overseas aid target of 1 per cent of gross national product(GNP) for the total of official flows, private investment and export credits by 1975. An inter-departmental working party officials shouldbe asked to examine ways of stimulating the flow of private investment from this country to the developing countries.  He was
prepared to accept the Treasury proposals for official flows of aid for 1971-72 and 1972-73. Their proposals for 1973-74 and 1974-75should provisionally stand but should, he suggested, be subject toan assessment in the year 1972-73 of the effectiveness of measuresto stimulate private investment; as a result of that assessment, thefigures for the last two years should if necessary be revised in orderto make likely the attainment of the one per cent target in 1975-76.These proposals would not necessarily involve any increase in public expenditure above the levels already forecast, though the outcomewould depend on whether or not private flows reached a level of just over 0-5 per cent of GNP in the later years.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that there was strong pressure both abroad and at home for a greater commitment to aid for the developing countries. It was, however, suggested that this might be met by the considerable increase in aid which was already provided for in the estimates, amounting on average to some six percent a year in real terms. It was not necessary to make a commitment to reach the target of one per cent of GNP by 1975, and thus animplied commitment to substantial increases in public expenditurein 1975-76 if private flows did not increase as was hoped. A six percent increase in expenditure on overseas aid was in itself excessivewhen compared with the limitations being placed on the growth ofexpenditure on education, health welfare and other social services in this country. Moreover the United Kingdom provided substantial assistance to the developing countries by means of, for example, theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement, which was not at present countedin our total aid but should be.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that he should announce at the General assembly that we would use our best endeavours to reach the one per cent by1975; he would, however, make it clear that a substantial percentageof this was expected to come from private flows and that these in turndepended on the attitude to private investment of receiving countries.A working party of officials should examine ways of stimulatingprivate investment in the developing countries; how it would bepossible to ensure that credit were taken for those forms of assistance which were not at present included; and should consider not only therecommendations made in the Pearson Report but also those on theUnited Nations administration of overseas aid in the precedingJackson Report and those in the Peterson Report on aid by theUnited States. The Cabinet endorsed the Treasury proposals for official flows for the years 1971-72 and 1972-73. They agreed withthe proposal that the position for the following two years should be examined in 1972-73 but were not prepared now to make any commitment to increase aid then.
SECRETRhodesia *4.  The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum the Approach by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (CP (70) 67) dealingand OtheT w^ a Possible approach to the leader of the illegal regime inProblems       Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith.(Previous---Reference: * Previously recorded in a Confidential annex cm (70) 25thConclusions, SECRETMinute 1)The Cabinet-(13) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(14) Authorised public expenditure on overseas aid (net at constant prices) of  206 million in 1971-72,  214 million in 1972-73,  234 million in 1973-74 and  255 million in1974-75.(15) Invited the Minister of Overseas Development, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs and other Ministers concerned, to arrange for officials to examine ways of stimulating private investment in the developing countries and the other points mentioned by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.Arts The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the paymaster general (CP (70) 50) about policy for the Arts.The Paymaster General said that it would take some time to review policy for the Arts as a whole. However, he had found thatthe previous Administration had allowed a serious situation todevelop in respect of the Arts Council. The Council had donemuch good work, but it had taken on commitments withoutcounting the cost for future years. He would insist on stricterplanning and control by the Council in the future. In the meantime,the Arts Council were likely to claim that, without substantial help,they could do nothing to support regional activities. He had now,however, agreed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, that additional expenditure for the Arts in 1971-72 should be limited to  1 million;this would be almost exactly offset by the proposed new charges for entry to museums and galleries.The Cabinet (16) Agreed that public expenditure on the Arts should beincreased by  1 million in 1971-72, which would be largely provided by the charges for entry to museums and galleries on which they had already agreed.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at their meeting on 18 September the Ministerial Committee on Rhodesiahad agreed that, subject to Cabinet approval, the most appropriateway of initiating contact with Mr. Smith would be by means of aletter from himself to Mr. Smith in the terms of the draft at Annex of his memorandum. This letter would be conveyed by HMAmbassador in South Africa to Mr. Smith&apos;s diplomatic representative in that country, Air Vice-Marshal Hawkins. The Government were committed to making a further effort to find a sensible and justsolution of the Rhodesian problem in accordance with the five principles, of which the first, which required unimpeded progress to majority rule, was by far the most important. This principlehad been enshrined in the 1961 Constitution, which had provided fora common electoral roll for Africans and Europeans and was stillregarded by ourselves as the legal Constitution of Rhodesia. Sincethe illegal declaration of independence (idi), the regime hadunilaterally and illegally adopted, first, the 1965 Constitution and,subsequently, the &quot; republican &quot; Constitution of 1969. The latter had abolished the common electoral roll in favour of separate rolls;and it clearly had, as its ultimate aim, not majority rule but theestablishment of parity of representation between Europeans andAfricans. While this might be interpreted as a final rejection of our first principle, it could equally be argued that the discussions withthe regime which had been conducted by the Labour Government onboard HMS Tiger and subsequently in HMS Fearless had been basedon the assumption that the long-term objective was the achievement of majority rule. Moreover, they had come within measurabledistance of success. We could not negotiate with Mr. Smith onany other basis; and, although it was uncertain how he would nowreact to an offer of renewed discussions on these lines, earlierexperience of his negotiating methods suggested that he would notrespond with an unqualified refusal. Since we were in any casecommitted to trying to ascertain whether a basis for discussionexisted, it seemed advisable to confine our approach in the firstinstance to the limited but basic requirement of eventual majority rule. Such an approach might best be made shortly before the debate in Parliament early in November on the extension of Section 2of the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965, in order that reference to itmight be made in the course of the debate, as necessary. If thedecisions already taken by the Cabinet in respect of postal surchargesand Rhodesian divorces could also be made public, either during theforthcoming Conservative Party Conference or subsequently inParliament, this might also have a beneficial effect.In discussion it was pointed out that a settlement on any terms which we could accept would involve a considerable change of attitude on the part of the regime. It seemed unlikely that sucha change would either be made voluntarily or be forced on the regime
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5 October, 1970.by economic pressures. Nevertheless, the balance of advantageappeared to be in favour of the course proposed by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary. The regime might well disclose thesubstance of our approach to their friends and supporters in thiscountry; and these disclosures might be used to the Governmenfsdisadvantage. This consideration should be borne in mind in deciding the timing of our approach.The Cabinet Agreed to the despatch to Mr. Smith, at the appropriate moment before the debate in Parliament on the extensionof Section 2 of the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965, of a letterfrom the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on the lines indicated in Annex A to CP (70) 67.
