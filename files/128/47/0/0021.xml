Situationin theMiddle East(previous reference:CM (70) 20thConclusions)121517a secret*1. The Prime Minister said that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, who was now in New York for themeeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations, had beeninformed of the Cabinefs conclusion on the previous day that weshould seek to promote a discussion in the Security Council of thesituation in Jordan and had expressed his full agreement.Consultation with other delegations in New York, however, had established that there was little inclination to hold an immediatemeeting of the Council. The United States Government were nowrather less opposed to such a meeting; but they considered that afinal decision should be deferred until more was known about theconference of the Arab leaders in Cairo which was due to begin at p.m. that day. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary mightthereafter need to discuss the situation with the United states secretary of State, Mr. Rogers.In Jordan itself it appeared that, although the north-west corner of the country, including Irbid, was controlled by the Syrian forces or the Fedayeen, there was no evidence that they had advanced anyfurther. The Iraqi forces had made no decisive move but seemedto be taking measures to protect their own flanks. Following further pressure from the United Arab Republic King Hussein of Jordanhad called for a cease-fire; but in the present situation the Fedayeenwere unlikely to agree. The King had repeated his earlier assertionthat he would be helped by an Israeli intervention; and we hadtransmitted this to the United States Government, leaving it to themin their discretion to convey it to the Government of Israel. Butthere was no sign of any Israeli action.Meanwhile, M. Boissier, the representative of the InternationalCommitteee of the Red Cross (ICRC), had had further discussions with Fedayeen leaders in Beirut about the hostages. There was some doubt about the precise standing of his contacts and the degree of authority with which they spoke. But M. Boissier had reported that in order to make progress he would need to beempowered to discuss with them the release of some of the Israeli-held Fedayeen. He was returning that night to Berne, where therepresentatives of the five Powers would be meeting to discuss his report.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs reported on the preparations for the evacuation of British subjects from Jordan, which had been considered at an inter-departmentalmeeting, under his chairmanship, on the previous afternoon. Of the
British subjects now remaining in Jordan about 100 wished to be evacuated. Several possibilities were being examined. these included moving the evacuees by road to Aqaba (for which king hussein had undertaken to provide safe conduct and an escort) and thence by sea to Eilat or to some other destination if it provedimpracticable to transfer them directly from Jordan to Israel.Alternatively, they might be moved by air from Amman to Beirutor to Cyprus, possibly by using the return flights of aircraft bringingmedical and relief supplies to Jordan. In addition to british nationals some 120 Press representatives of various nationalities nowwished to leave Amman, together with 20-30 Seychellois, for whom we were responsible. The Government of Jordan had provisionallyagreed to a flight by a commercial DC-6 aircraft from Beirut toAmman on 23 September in order to bring in medical stores and essential spares and supplies for the British Embassy. This aircraft which could take about 100 passengers, could make a largecontribution towards solving the evacuation problem, particularly if more than one flight were authorised. The United states ambassador in Amman had been reported as expressing the wish that United Kingdom and United States nationals should be evacuated in a combined operation. It would be preferable, however,to avoid this, if possible, not only because communication betweenthe two Embassies in Amman was still difficult but also because someof the contingency plans for evacuation which the United StatesGovernment were known to be considering presented disquietingfeatures. One of them, indeed, envisaged landing a substantial force at Amman in order to secure the airport and to protect the evacuation of United States and other nationals. It might also entail the use ofAkrotiri, in the Sovereign Base Area in Cyprus, for refuelling theUnited States military aircraft involved on their return journey.But a military intervention in Jordan of this kind, even if it were only a temporary measure and were confined to ensuring the securityof the evacuation, could very easily be misinterpreted; and, in viewof the serious political risks which it would clearly carry, we should seek to dissuade the United States authorities from giving it anyfurther consideration.In discussion it was suggested that, although the ICRC had now agreed in principle to co-ordinate relief operations in Jordan, their actions so far had shown little sense of urgency. They were insisting on a number of elaborate precautions for example, that all aircraftused for flying relief supplies and personnel into Jordan should bepainted white and should carry no markings other than those of theRed Cross which were likely to result in considerable delay. Theiranxiety demonstrably to preserve their neutral status wasunderstandable; but it should not be carried to a point at which itmight result in further hardship and suffering.
IndustrialAffairsLocalAuthorityManualWorkers(previous reference:CM (70) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that the current pay agreement between local authorities andtheir manual workers was due to expire on 29 September. on September the employers had offered an increase averaging14 per cent, which the unions had rejected. This was already abovethe level which the Government regarded as generally acceptablefor current pay settlements; and Ministers had sought to ensure thatthe local authorities should stand firm against making further concessions. There had been certain indications that the employershad nevertheless allowed the unions to suppose, at an earlier stage,that they might secure such concessions. Although the employers&apos;attitude had since hardened, there remained a risk that some localauthorities would adopt a compromise course and offer individualsettlements. To reduce this risk, the leader of the employers&apos; sidewas now proposing to meet the unions and to offer someredistribution of the proposed increase, which might be more attractive to the unions than the existing offer and would not significantly alter its total cost. The Government could not prevent such direct discussions between the two sides to the dispute. Butboth sides had formally requested his Department to conciliate; and,if he were to agree to these requests and to call both sides to his Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs should arrange for further consideration to be given urgently to thepossibility of using the DC-6 aircraft to assist the evacuation ofBritish subjects, any spare capacity being offered to other Westernnationals. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should beinvited to consider making representations to the United StatesGovernment about the dangers of implementing their contingencyevacuation plan. As regards the apparent delays on the part of theICRC in co-ordinating relief operations in Jordan he was, ifnecessary, prepared to send a personal message to the SwissPresident; but the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs should initially give further consideration to the best meansof pressing the Committee to accelerate their preparations.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs to take action accordingly.
Department for discussions under the Department&apos;s auspices, this might strengthen the employers&apos; resolve to stand firm on theirpresent offer. But it could not be guaranteed that, even if theexchanges took place on this basis, the employers would withholdfurther concessions; and, if they did not, the Government wouldrisk becoming identified with an even more inflationary settlement.For this reason, his colleagues might share his view that it wouldbe a lesser risk to the credibility of the Governmenfs general policies to leave the two sides to negotiate directly so that, if anyfurther concessions were made, the Government could dissociatethemselves from them. A decision to reject the requests for conciliation, however, would represent the first occasion on whicha Government had refused to make the conciliation service available and would run counter to the general aim of restoring the Departmentof Employment and Productivity in the eyes of both sides of industry as an impartial instrument of conciliation. But if, on balance, this were thought to be the right course, it should be possible to justifythe decision to refuse conciliation in the present case on the grounds that the service was not one to be used indiscriminately and that,while there would be many occasions when it could play a helpfulrole, there was little doubt about the facts of the present dispute and little scope for the departments intervention. The employers had made an offer of 14 per cent, which was generous in thecircumstances; and it would not be in the public interest to invitethem to make further concessions which would add to the inflationarypressures from which everyone, and especially the lower paid, would suffer. If the two sides wished assistance in exploring the possibilityof reaching a settlement through a more acceptable distribution ofthe available money, which would not add to the total cost, theDepartment would remain ready to help. ,The Secretary of State for Social Services said that a paralleloffer of 14 per cent had been made to ancillary workers in theNational Health Service, where the Government was the directemployer. If that offer were to be maintained, it was important that ministers should be free to condemn any settlement made by thelocal authorities at a higher figure. He therefore favoured rejecting the request for the Department of Employment and Productivity to conciliate.In discussion it was suggested on the one hand that it remainedimportant to re-establish the principle that conciliation by theDepartment of Employment and Productivity was not used as an instrument to further the Governmenfs economic policies but wasfreely available as an impartial means of helping the two sides to a dispute to reach an acceptable agreement. The Secretary of State&apos;proposal would run counter to this general aim of policy. Moreover,if, in particular circumstances, conciliation was to be extended only
on a conditional basis, it would be assumed, when it was offeredwithout conditions, that in the Governmenfs view there were grounds for expecting the employers to make concessions. Although, in thepast, the unions had tended to regard conciliation as a way ofcarrying their demands further after they had exhausted their own efforts to secure concessions from employers in direct discussion, itshould be possible by careful emphasis to correct the impression that conciliation was simply a means of seeking to solve disputes bycompromises and so to permit the Department to engage inconciliation without accepting a share of responsibility forunreasonable settlements.On the other hand the current levels of wage settlements werehighly inflationary and it was important for the Government toexercise a positive role in reducing them. For the present, therefore,the long-term aim of offering an impartial conciliation service on an unconditional basis must be subordinated to the immediate need to arrest cost-inflation. In deciding the extent to which they were willing to make conciliation services available, the Governmentshould in present circumstances be ready to act consistently with thisoverriding aim of policy. Accordingly it would be right in thepresent case to limit the offer of conciliation to providing such helpas the parties might request in seeking a settlement on the basis ofredistributing, but not increasing, the employers&apos; offer and toindicate that conciliation on the total amount of the offer would inpresent circumstances be inappropriate. It would be inadvisable,however, for the wording of any statement to appear to rule outconciliation on a different basis at some future date in circumstances which could not now be foreseen. It might be helpful if in his statement the Secretary of State could outline positively the scope for the use of the conciliation service and the true purpose of conciliation before referring to the special circumstances which made it necessary to restrict its use in the present instance. Alternatively,the statement could indicate that this was not a case in which theDepartment could act as an impartial conciliator in the light of the government&apos;s opinion, which they had made clear, that theemployers&apos; existing offer was already generous.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Department of Employment and Productivityshould not agree to conciliate in the current dispute between thelocal authorities and their manual workers, save on the basis of helping the parties to reach an acceptable settlement within the costof the employers&apos; existing offer. This decision would need carefulpresentation in the light of future policy for the use of the conciliationservice; and the Secretary of State should consult the Lord President
of the Council and the Minister of Technology about the terms ofhis proposed statement. The apparent readiness of individual localauthorities to reach inflationary settlements made it important totake an early opportunity to impress on them that they must regard themselves as accountable to their ratepayers; and they must bebrought to realise that, if they made irresponsible settlements, theGovernment would not allow them to pass on the excess cost to theExchequer. In the re-examination of rate support grant arrangements the Minister of Housing and Local Government should have in mind the desirability of making arrangements accordingly.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity to revise the form of his proposed statement,in consultation with the Lord President of the Counciland the Minister of Technology in the light of the points made in discussion.(3) Invited the Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, to examine the possibility of revising therate support grant arrangements in order to ensure thatthe Exchequer was not obliged to contribute towards the excess costs of inflationary wage settlements made by individual local authorities.postal charges(previous reference:CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential. The Lord President of the Council said that at a meeting onthe previous day the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy(EPC) had considered a memorandum by the Minister of Posts and telecommunications about the proposals of the Post Office board to increase charges for postal and remittance services in January1971. The proposals had been fully considered by the Post OfficeNational Users&apos; Council, which in turn had commissioned CooperBrothers to investigate the case for them. It was envisaged thatthe Councils report, accepting that the increases were justified butrecommending certain variations, should be published on24 September. The Post Office had been willing to accept the recommended variations in part but had demurred at the Councilssuggestion that the new rates for first and second class inland mailsshould take effect simultaneously with the introduction of decimalcoinage in February 1971, instead of a month earlier in order toavoid a two-stage change in rates. They had also accepted only inpart the Councils recommendation that the first weight step forinland letters should not, as the Post Office proposed, be reduced
1215173from 4 oz. to 2 oz. The EPC had concluded that the Governmenthad no alternative but to accept the need to raise postal charges;but they felt that the Post Office should be required to adopt therecommendations of the Users&apos; Council in full.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that he hadconveyed the conclusion of EPC to the Post Office Board, whoseinitial reaction was to object to the decision that the increased postalrates should be introduced simultaneously with the change to decimal currency. It was unlikely, however, that they would maintain their objection to the point at which he would be obliged to give them a formal direction.In discussion the Cabinet endorsed the recommendation ofEPC, which could be defended, if necessary e.g. by the PrimeMinister in his forthcoming television broadcast by emphasisingthat the Government had subjected the proposed increases to themost thorough examination in accordance with their declared policyand that they were accepting the advice of the Users&apos; Council in itsentirety. There would be no advantage in delaying theannouncement.In further discussion concern was expressed about the prospectof further increases in the charges raised by the Post Office and otherlabour-intensive services of distribution unless productivity could be considerably improved or standards of service could be modified,e.g. by promoting shared deliveries of household goods or by reducingthe frequency of deliveries. In this connection it was relevant that,in announcing the Governmenfs decision on postal charges, theMinister of Posts and Telecommunications would also indicate thathe intended to review the postal service.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said the cabinet agreed that their decision on postal charges should be announced,as proposed, on the following Thursday. In the light of the points raised in discussion, however, the Minister of Posts and telecommunications should give urgent consideration to thedesirability of arranging a thorough inquiry into the future standard and scope of postal services and to its possible terms of reference and membership.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications toconsider in what terms an inquiry into the future of the postal service could best be arranged, as indicated in thePrime Minister^ summing up.
Non-industrial civil ServiceManpowerCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (70) 41) on Non-Industrial Civil Service Manpower.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government had anunequivocal commitment to reduce Civil Service numbers byrationalising and eliminating functions. The review of functions would take time; but meanwhile the public would expect the growth of Departmental staffs to be checked and soon reversed. The resultsof the recent review directed to reducing numbers below the previousGovernmenfs limit of 505,000 at 1 April, 1971, and below the forecast of 521,900 at 1 April, 1972, had been disappointing; the reductions offered amounted to only about 1,400 and 4,900respectively. Savings of the order of  140 million a year would beachieved if total numbers could be reduced to 470,000 by 1 April,1973; and the Government should adopt this as their target. Inmaking progress towards this objective, they should seek to restrictnumbers below 500,000 at 1 April, 1971. This figure was importantpresentationally; and it should be adopted as the upper limit fornon-industrial Civil Service staff in post. By 1 April, 1972, further reductions below this figure would be needed, which would be moredifficult to achieve but would be no less critical to the success of thepolicy.Demographic, social and technological trends, together with government policies in some cases, would tend to increase numbers.Arbitrary reductions were unlikely to yield significant savings; andthe recategorisation of staff, though helpful in presentational terms,would not represent genuine reductions. The curtailment orelimination of redundant functions of Government provided theonly way in which real and lasting reductions in numbers could beachieved.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Arbitrary reductions would reflect unfairly on the CivilService; and the adoption of quantitative targets could be misguidedin the long run, even if it were successful in the short term.Moreover, several commitments in the Governmenfs programme,such as increased selectivity in the social services, would requireadditional staff; certain sectors of the Civil Service were already under-staffed; and many factors outside the Governmenfs control would tend to increase staff numbers. A solution therefore had to besought by reducing functions; and Ministers should reviewDepartmental functions in terms of priority, with the objective ofeliminating the least important. When this review had beencompleted, a further percentage reduction might be applied to theadministrative costs of the remaining functions.
ib) On the other hand, results could not be expected sufficientlyquickly from a functional review of this kind, which would necessarily take time; and there was practical value in using the pressure of specific target reductions to eliminate unnecessary tasks and toreduce administrative expenditure, 80 per cent of which wasaccounted for by direct manpower costs.(c) Hiving-off functions could provide worthwhile savings; but,if the functions were retained in the public sector, staff demandscould in certain cases be increased. In general, therefore, the aimin hiving-off should be to transfer functions to the private sector.(d) Some functions could be eliminated, in whole or in part,only by amending legislation.(e) New management techniques, such as output budgeting,often required increases in staff in the short term, even though theymight yield valuable economics in the longer term. On the otherhand the staff for worthwhile management improvements of thiskind should be found from within the lower priority items in a department^ budget.(/) Savings should result from changes in the machinery ofGovernment and from improvements in the accommodation of someDepartments.(g) An increase of more than 1,000 staff for the Inland Revenue,together with an addition of 6,000 to the strength of Customs and excise, would need careful scrutiny, even if a good case could bemade out.ih) There had already been large reductions in Ministry ofDefence staffs, particularly in the ratio of civilian staff to fightingunits. The scope for further savings was limited by the process of transferring functions from the fighting services to civilians and byrecategorising industrial civil servants as non-industrials.if) The Diplomatic Service was already facing reductions arisingfrom the Duncan Report and would find an arbitrary cut difficultto meet. But it would continue to pursue the possibility of reducingfunctions.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproblem of Civil Service numbers might best be approached byeliminating functions; but it should be possible at the same time to achieve the reductions suggested by the Lord Privy Seal in the medium term. He intended to invite all Ministers to give personalattention to the review of functions in their Departments and to identify those which, however desirable in themselves, could be eliminated with the least damage to the Governmenfs strategy. Inthis way the Government should seek to reduce the number of
non-industrial civil servants below 500,000 by 1 April, 1971, to achieve further reductions of staff in the following year and toreach the target of 470,000 by 1 April, 1973. Apart from savingssecured by a reduction of functions, Departments should also try to reduce the numbers of staff engaged on continuing functions by5 per cent by 1 April, 1972.This might entail a new approach to standards of administrationgenerally and of public accountability in particular; and furtherconsideration might need to be given to the scope for reducing staffsby such steps as eliminating unnecessary briefing of Ministers,reducing the time spent on preparing answers to parliamentary questions, reviewing the standards of provision of government services, reducing the amount of double-checking of the actions of independent agencies (particularly in the local authority field),refusing to accept responsibility for providing information and services which were not clearly the Governmenfs responsibility,introducing charges where possible for services now provided free,e.g. to industry, and examing critically the demands made on thepublic for statistical information.A valuable contribution to staff economy could also be expected from the work of the Management Projects Committee, which,among other things, co-ordinated the work of the team of businessadvisers. Studies were in hand on a variety of management projects,including the improvement of computer utilisation, the disposal ofGovernment-owned land and buildings, and investment by the nationalised industries. All projects of this kind would be discussed with the responsible Ministers at the outset; and they should begiven the fullest co-operation by the Departments concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to keep non-industrial CivilService numbers under continuous review, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up, andto report again to the Cabinet in due course.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd September, 1970.
