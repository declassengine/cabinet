industrial affairs pay ofElectricitySupply ManualWorkersPreviousReference:CM (70) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2SECRET1. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the government-slow by manual workers in the electricity supply industry hadrapidly resulted in a degree of load-shedding, since the total reductionin plant capacity amounted to about 20 per cent and it had become clear that it was not possible for the Electricity Council to exercisediscrimination in favour of essential consumers. Moreover, the manual workers were interpreting the go-slow in a surprisingly strictsense; and since the supervisory staff, who were also in dispute withtheir employers about a pay claim, were now calling for a work-to-rule and a ban on overtime from 14 December, the situation mightwell deteriorate further in the next few days. On the other hand,because the manual workers were still formally at their posts, itwould not be possible to put Servicemen in their place to help toimprove output.The Secretary of State for Employment said that officials of his department had met the trade unions representing the electricity supply manual workers on the previous day. The unions had been mainly concerned to elaborate their case and had not asked for hishelp by way of conciliation or the appointment of a court of inquiry.They had acknowledged the need to bring cost inflation under controlbut had claimed that they were entitled to exceptional treatment sinceothers had received increases of 10 per cent and more without anyconditions about productivity whereas electricity workers haddemonstrably improved productivity in their industry. They had also expressed resentment at any suggestion that they were seeking to hold the community to ransom. There was no arrangement to resume the discussions between the Department and the unions;and, in view of the additional complication of the demonstrationsagainst the Governmenfs Industrial Relations Bill on 7 and 8December, it would be advisable to wait until about 10 Decemberbefore trying to make a reliable assessment of the degree of disruptionwhich was likely to result from the go-slow. But it was arguable that some of the manual workers concerned were exceeding thelimits of a work-to-rule and were acting in breach of their contracts of service by not fulfilling productivity agreements.The Attorney-General said that the Electricity Supply Act, 1919,applied to those working in the electricity supply industry theprovisions which, under Section 4 of the Conspiracy and Protectionof Property Act, 1874, related to workers in the gas and waterindustries. As a result a worker could be prosecuted if he broke hiscontract of service knowing that the effect would be to deprive the
community of electricity. Only one prosecution under these provisions, however, was recorded; and previous experience suggestedthat it was very doubtful whether the necessary evidence on which to base a successful prosecution would be available. It was also possible under civil law for individuals to seek injunctions againstthe electricity authorities on account of their failure to fulfil their statutory obligations to supply; but here, too, the prospects of a successful outcome were far from certain. The same was true of anycivil action brought by an employer in the electricity supply industryagainst workers for breach of contract, since it would be difficult toproduce convincing evidence that there had been a breach of contract of service.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had concluded on the previous day that it would be premature to advise the proclamation of a State of Emergency onthe ground that, although the situation might change rapidly, the formal declaration of an emergency would not yet make any definitecontribution to resolving it. The Committee had invited theMinister for Industry, however, to take the opportunity publicly toexpress the Government^ view on the merits of the pay offer tothe workers, the need for resisting inflationary pay awards, the suspicion that the trade unions were applying more than a work-to-rule and the need for public support of the Electricity Councilsefforts to maintain supplies and to secure economy in usingelectricity. For the rest, contingency plans for the possible useof Servicemen were ready; and the distribution to hospitals ofstandby generators belonging to the Ministry of Defence had alreadybeen arranged.In discussion the importance of ensuring that public opinionremained firm in support of the Government and the electricity council was emphasised. Whatever measures of intervention might subsequently become necessary, the public should be given themaximum of help in adjusting their daily lives to the interruptionsin electricity supply which must be expected to persist for &quot;somedays. Steps should therefore be taken to make available the most up-to-date information of impending interruptions in local supply,together with advice on measures to mitigate the resultantinconvenience and hardship. For this purpose an operations centreshould be set up in the Department of Trade and Industry; andthe assistance of voluntary bodies might be enlisted in order to ease the position of the elderly and disabled.Private Notice had been given of questions that afternoon tothe Secretaries of State for Employment and for Trade and Industry.
It would probably not be possible in reply to give very specificguidance to the public; but the nature of the action which theGovernment were taking should be made clear. Moreover,although the result of arbitration might be an unpalatable settlement,the fact that arrangements for arbitration were available but hadnot been invoked by the unions should be emphasised. It might be preferable to reserve a Ministerial broadcast until the manner in whichthe situation was developing was more clear; but there would be advantage if the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry wereto avail himself of any invitations to discuss the position intelevision programmes that evening. Meanwhile, all possibleeconomy of electricity consumption should be exercised in Crownbuildings; and local authorities should be asked to take similarsteps.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The powers which would be available to the Government ifa State of Emergency were proclaimed would be of little avail saveto relieve the electricity authorities of their statutory duty tomaintain a constant supply of electricity and to enforce legallimitations on the use of electricity. But it might well be preferable, for the latter purpose, to rely on persuasion in the firstinstance. On the other hand the proclamation of a State ofEmergency could have an important psychological impact; and, ifEmergency Powers had to be taken at some stage, it might be wiser to take them at the outset.(b) Although little evidence might be forthcoming to supportprosecutions of individuals for offences against the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act, 1874, the overt actions of some of themilitant leaders on the trade union side might be held to amount toconspiracy.(c) Since prolonged overtime was not a feature of the electricity industry, the employees had little to lose by continuing to work-to-rule and to refuse overtime working. Time was therefore not on the side of the Government; and it might soon be necessary to considerthe establishment of a court of inquiry. It was generally agreed thatno immediate action should be taken to this end but that, if a courtof inquiry were set up, its timing would require careful considerationlest the Government should alienate public sympathy by appearing to intervene too late.(d) The unions had not refused arbitration; they had merelycontrived that the necessary quorum for a decision to go to arbitration should not be found. If they continued to refuse to avail
themselves of the arbitration procedure, it might be suggested to theElectricity Council that they should dismiss employees who were in breach of their contracts of employment. On the other handdismissals in these circumstances were likely to result in a strike;and, since the supervisory engineers were themselves intending towork-to-rule from the beginning of the following week, the situation would be still further aggravated.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the ministerial Committee on Pay Negotiations should consider urgentlythe strategy of future action by the Government in the electricity paydispute, taking account of the courses of action mentioned in discussion. The desirability of taking Emergency Powers would also have to be kept under constant review. The Cabinet agreed thatit would be inappropriate to establish a court of inquiry at once;but it was questionable whether public opinion would support theGovernment for long in merely riding out the dispute without any positive intervention. It would therefore be advantageous toemphasise that, even though an arbitration procedure was readily available, the unions had not availed themselves of it.The Government must be seen to be concerned that the bestinformation and advice should be available to both industrial and domestic consumers of electricity; and immediate steps should betaken to ensure the maximum of economy in the use of electricityon Crown premises and those of local authorities. Any private notice Questions that afternoon should be answered by stating thefacts, emphasising the availability of arbitration, referring to the government&apos;s own measures of economy and indicating the actionwhich the Government were taking to give information and advice to the public. It would be advantageous if the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry accepted invitations to appear on television programmes that evening; and the possibility of a formal Ministerialbroadcast on a subsequent occasion should be borne in mind.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretaries ofState for Employment and for Trade and Industry to be guided by it in replying to any Private Notice questions that afternoon.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry:(a) To arrange, as a matter of urgency, to establish anoperations centre for the purposes of collecting anddisseminating information about the impact of the government-slow in the electricity supply industry.
CONFIDENTIALPublic SectorRemunerationPreviousReference:CM (70) 43rdConclusions,Minute 32. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of remuneration inthe public sector.The Prime Minister said that, following the discussion at cabinet on 3 December, he had considered further with the Ministersmainly concerned the salary increases in the public sector whichwere due to take effect on 1 January, 1971. The Lord Chief Justicehad offered to forgo for six months the increase which would be payable to him if the necessary Order was made; and, in general,the most highly paid members of the groups affected were followingsuit the Higher Judiciary; the Chief of Defence Staff and officersof the rank of Admiral, General and Air Chief Marshal; permanent secretaries in the Home Civil Service and officers of equivalent rankin the Diplomatic Service; and the Chairmen and Deputy chairmen of the Boards of the major nationalised industries. Since the salaries of the senior Service officers had not progressed as far as those ofthe Higher Civil Service towards the figure determined by therecent report of the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI)as appropriate in their case for 1 January, 1971, and the increasesinvolved were therefore larger, waiver by the Service officers of half of their increase should be regarded as an equivalent sacrifice.(b) To take the opportunity of any invitations to appear on television programmes that evening in order toexplain the implications of the wage claim bymanual workers in the electricity industry,including the scope for arbitration; to impress onthe public the need to economise in electricityconsumption at peak times; and to outline the steps which the Government were taking to provideconsumers with information and advice.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment and theLord Privy Seal to make arrangements to ensure themaximum of economy in the use of electricity on Crownpremises and those of local authorities.(4) Took note that the Ministerial Steering Committee on pay negotiations would urgently consider the next stages ofthe strategy for dealing with the dispute in the electricity industry.
The Orders in respect of the Judiciary would now be laid beforeParliament; the NBPI report would be published at the same time;and he proposed simultaneously to announce the voluntaryrenunciation by the various groups of public servants in a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon. In so doing he wouldexpress the Governmenfs appreciation of the sense of public spiritshown by those concerned.
