SubjectSituation in the Middle East
Situation inthe middle east(previous reference:CM (70) 19thConclusions,Minute 1)CM 20 (70)SECRET*The Prime Minister, summarising developments since theCabinet&apos;s last meeting, said that the situation in the Middle East gavecause for increasing anxiety.So far as the hostages were concerned, the representatives inBerne of the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, israel and Switzerland (the &quot; Berne Group &quot;) had reached agreement on19 September on the terms of a joint statement declaring that they held responsible for the safety of the hostages all those in whosehands they might be, calling upon those holding the hostages toprovide information on their whereabouts and well being, requiringthem to bring the hostages to a safe place as a prerequisite for an orderly transfer and stating that the five Governments stood ready toconsider at any time proposals for the release of all the hostages.The text ended by reaffirming the mandate given by the fiveGovernments to the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) for this purpose. This statement, which represented aconsiderable measure of progress in so far as it indicated that theGovernment of Israel were now willing to consider making a contribution towards a solution on a five-Power basis, had beenrepeatedly broadcast to Jordan. But owing to the hostilities betweenthe Fedayeen and the Jordan Army it had been impossible toestablish contact with the Fedayeen leaders in Amman. Meanwhile,although there had been conflicting reports about the hostages, theirwhereabouts remained unknown.The military situation in Jordan was unclear; and reporting byHM Embassy in Amman had been impeded by the fact that their communications equipment had been damaged during the fighting.But, so far as could be ascertained, the position in Amman itself was reasonably secure in the sense that the Jordanian Army appearedto be holding their own, although the Fedayeen still controlled anumber of areas. In the north, however, Syrian forces had nowcrossed the frontier and appeared to have gained control, inconjunction with the Fedayeen, of Irbid, Ramtha and a considerable part of north-western Jordan. The latest reports suggested thatthey were now consolidating their position around Irbid and thatthe Jordanian Army had withdrawn in the face of superior numbers.The situation around Mafraq, where the Fedayeen appeared to bein control and there were also substantial Iraqi forces, was uncertain.It was not known whether the withdrawal of Iraqi troops which hadbeen initiated over the past two days was continuing or had beenhalted.121479a 2
In these circumstances we had been concerned to maintain close contact with the United States Administration; and, on theassumption that the Syrian action had been taken without consultation with the Soviet Union and was contrary to their wishes,the Soviet Ambassador had been asked to convey our anxieties tothe Soviet Government and request them to use their influence tosecure a Syrian withdrawal. The reaction of the Soviet ambassador had been to suggest that the position in Jordan was less grave than our information indicated it to be; and we had thereforere-emphasised the dangers which we believed to be latent in thesituation. The United States Government had made similarrepresentations to the Soviet Ambassador in Washington.Meanwhile, a series of messages had been received from king hussein of Jordan, reflecting the extreme anxiety with which he nowregarded the situation. The clearest of these, whose content, in viewof its extremely sensitive and dangerous implications, should on no account be disclosed, had not only appealed for the moral and diplomatic support of the United Kingdom and the United States,coupled with a threat of international action, but had also asked foran air strike by Israel against the Syrian troops. We had receivedthis last message at a moment when King Hussein&apos;s normal channels of communication with both the United States Embassy in Ammanand the Israeli authorities had evidently been interrupted and he had therefore had no means of keeping in touch with the Governmentsof the United States and Israel except through HM Embassy. Wehad received confirmation that he wished us to convey his appealto the Israeli Government; and we had been faced with a difficult decision whether to do so. After discussion between the ministers most closely concerned, it had been decided to transmit the message to the United States Government only, on the ground that they mightmost appropriately convey it to the Government of Israel not merely because the Israeli Prime Minister, Mrs. Meir, was at that moment at the United Nations in New York but also because the UnitedStates Government, being closest to the Israeli Government, wouldbe best placed to advise them whether to accede to King Hussein&apos;request or not. Shortly thereafter we had been informed that theUnited States Government had already received a similar message from King Hussein, appealing for air strikes and air cover &quot; fromany quarter &quot;, and that the substance of this appeal had been passed to the Israeli representatives in Washington.The King had also appealed, on 19 September, for relief supplies and medical assistance; and, in the light of the reports of heavy casualties in Amman and the increasing disruption of public services in the city, we had immediately announced that we would be readyto contribute to any international relief effort which could bemounted under the auspices of the ICRC.  Medical personnel and
supplies were already being flown to Cyprus, where they would beavailable to proceed to Amman as soon as the ICRC were able toorganise the operation.Meanwhile, the Jordanian representative at the United nations had been instructed to raise the question of Syrian aggression as amatter of urgency in the Security Council. The United StatesGovernment had so far advised against this course, on the groundthat time was needed for the representations which they and we had addressed to the Soviet Government to take effect. Our owndelegation in New York were also doubtful of the effectiveness ofany action in the Security Council, in view of the probable opposition of the Soviet Union and of Syria herself, who was at present amember of the Council. On the other hand, the issues involved were too grave to be decided solely by reference to tacticalconsiderations in the United Nations; and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, who had left for New York on theprevious afternoon, would therefore explore the possibility of promoting a satisfactory resolution in the Security Council, pendingreceipt of the Cabinefs considered judgment on this subject.The Cabinet must now consider whether they were prepared to endorse the action which had so far been put in hand and whether there were any further steps which could be taken. We faced a difficult situation, which might deteriorate still further and wasvery different from the position which had confronted us when wehad last intervened in Jordan in 1958. At that time it had beenpossible to send troops to Jordan before hostilities had begun andso to forestall the outbreak of fighting. Now, however, fighting was already in progress and a large part of the country was under thecontrol of the Fedayeen. Both we and the United States were underpressure from King Hussein to intervene; but we had to ask ourselveswhat the long-term objectives of such an intervention could be andwhether they would be worth the risks entailed. Moreover, althoughour limited resources clearly precluded any unilateral interventionon our part, the United States Government might ask us to intervenejointly with themselves; and we must be ready to decide our attitudeif they asked for our active assistance or for the use by their own forces of British facilities, whether in the United Kingdom or, forexample, in the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus.In discussion it was thought to be unlikely that the security council would be able to take effective action in the face of Syrian,and probably also of Soviet, opposition. Instead of condemningSyria&apos;s action and calling on her to withdraw her forces from Jordan,the Security Council might well adopt a compromise resolution
merely calling for a cease-fire; and this would leave the Syrian forcesin possession of north-west Jordan and the Fedayeen still in aposition to defy the authority of King Hussein. On the other hand the Syrian invasion of Jordan was precisely the type of situation for which the procedures of the Security Council had been devised.They might fail to deal with it; but we should be in a stronger position to face criticism from the uncommitted countries and to take action, if necessary, outside the framework of the United Nationsif the matter had first been referred to the Security Council than ifwe had attempted to dispense with discussion in the Councilcompletely. As regards intervention in Jordan, however, there was general agreement that our limited resources and the damage to our interests in the Arab world which would inevitably result wereconclusive arguments against our intervening on our own and that similar considerations applied to any British intervention inconjunction with the United States. The latter had the capability of unilateral action; and it was arguable that in the eyes of the arab world they were already so deeply committed to the support of Israelthat they had little to lose, in terms of their credit with the ArabGovernments, by active intervention in support of King Hussein.But this was not our position; and since, in relation to our totalresources, we had a larger stake in the Middle East than had theUnited States, we were entitled to argue strongly that the damage which United States intervention might inflict on Western interests as a whole outweighed any advantages to be derived from prolonging,possibly for only a short time, the increasingly precarious regimeof King Hussein. A difficult situation would arise, however, if theUnited States accepted our arguments against British interventionbut asked us for facilities in the United Kingdom or Cyprus insupport of unilateral action of their own. Although we no longerhad any formal obligation to come to the assistance of king hussein, he still commanded considerable sympathy in this country.Moreover, a refusal to afford facilities for the United States in thecircumstances envisaged might seriously damage Anglo-american relations; and the Government would need to weigh this risk very carefully. On the other hand, if we provided facilities for UnitedStates intervention in Jordan, the Arab countries would regard us as having thrown in our lot with the United States and Israel; and weshould forfeit their goodwill no less surely than if we intervenedactively ourselves. Nor could we underrate the risk that the fedayeen might react to any Western intervention by putting to death the hostages whom they still held.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Urgent consideration should be given to the possibility of evacuating British nationals in Jordan, who were thought to numberabout 140 and were believed to have come to no harm so far. Any
operation for this purpose might best be arranged under the auspices of the ICRC.(b) It would be prudent to put in hand a confidentialexamination of the possible effect on our oil supplies if the situation deteriorated sharply.(c) We had no information as yet which would justify our issuinga warning to British airlines to suspend their operations in specificareas of conflict. But we should keep in close touch with the airlinesand ensure that they were informed without delay of anydevelopments which might affect their Middle Eastern routes.id) Although the airline authorities and the pilots were stillopposed to the introduction of armed guards in civil aircraft, therewere some indications that their views were being modified by events. The examination of this subject, and other security precautions for British aircraft and airports, should be accelerated.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that we should concentrate on promoting a discussion in the Security Council, despite the risks and disadvantages involved.In no circumstances could we ourselves intervene in Jordan by military means; and the damaging consequences for Western interestsin the Middle East as a whole which might result from United Statesintervention entitled us to represent forcefully to the United StatesGovernment that they, too, should refrain from intervention of theirown. At the same time it was important, not least in terms of domestic public opinion, that we should not part company with theUnited States on any fundamental issue if we could possibly avoiddoing so; and we should therefore suspend judgment for the timebeing on the attitude which we should adopt if, despite our strong representations to the contrary, the United States government decided to intervene in Jordan and sought our help for this purposeparticularly as regards the provision of support facilities in thiscountry or, e.g. in Cyprus.Meanwhile, prompt action should be taken to pursue the othertopics which had emerged from the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and agreed that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should be invited to be guided accordingly in the discussions in the Security Council ofthe United Nations.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs,   in  consultation  with   the  other   Ministers
concerned, to consider, as a matter of urgency, theevacuation of British nationals in Jordan.(3) Invited the Minister of State, Board of Trade, to arrangefor British airlines to be warned immediatelydevelopments in the Middle East made it desirable thatthey should suspend their services or modify their routes;and, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,to accelerate the study of security precautions for british aircraft and airports.(4) Invited the Minister of Technology to arrange for an examination of the probable impact on our oil supplies ofa further deterioration in the situation in the Middle East.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21 September, 1970.
