CM 37 (70)confidential parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons the following week.SECRETOverseaAffairsRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (70) 26thConclusions,Minute 4CollisionbetweenHMSArk Royaland a SovietDestroyerBerlinGerman-PolishTreaty2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that on10th November the United Nations Security Council had debateda draft resolution on Rhodesia tabled by the Afro-Asian Group.The draft had sought to bind the British Government, in advance ofany discussions which might be held with the Rhodesian regime, notto grant independence to Southern Rhodesia until majority rule hadbeen achieved. This was, of course, unacceptable to us. We had therefore made it clear that, if the draft resolution were tabled in this form in the Security Council, we should have no alternative but toveto it; and in the end we had been forced to do so. The Afro-AsianGroup had subsequently put forward an alternative draft resolution in less objectionable terms; and discussions were now in progressin New York with a view to securing amendments to this text whichwould enable us to support it.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that HMAmbassador in Moscow had been instructed to make an officialprotest to the Soviet Government about the recent incident in whicha Soviet destroyer had collided with HMS Ark Royal during a night-flying exercise in the Mediterranean.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a memberof the Soviet military guard at the Soviet War Memorial in theBritish Sector of Berlin had recently been wounded by a shot firedby a German. The question had arisen whether the offence shouldbe dealt with by the civil courts in West Berlin or by the british military authorities. We were in favour of the latter course, which we thought would also be preferred by the Soviet authorities.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was likely that a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and poland would be signed within the next few days. It appeared thatthe parties had failed to reach agreement on the question whether theOder-Neisse line should be regarded as Germany&apos;s definitive eastern frontier or whether this issue should be left for final settlement in a peace treaty with Germany. The treaty was likely to be non-committal on this point.
Nationalisation The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theandCeylon Zambian Government had recently announced legislation designedto establish their control of additional foreign enterprises in Zambia.The full implication of this legislation had yet to be assessed: but theoutlook for foreign investment in Zambia was not encouraging.Similar legislation was in contemplation in Ceylon, although therewere indications that the Ceylonese Government might be disposed to reconsider their intentions. In both cases, the United kingdom high Commissioners had made appropriate representations with aview to safeguarding British interests and the rights of British firms to compensation.Chinese jhe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, referring to the representation recent declaration by the United States in the United Nations thatat the United JNations tney were willing to accept representation of the Chinese PeoplesRepublic in the United Nations provided that the Taiwan regimeretained their seat, said that this represented a major change in theUnited States attitude which had evidently been under consideration for some time. It remained to be seen, however, whether theChinese People&apos;s Republic would now be prepared to accept entry into the United Nations on a &quot; two China &quot; basis, a solution whichthey had hitherto consistently rejected. If they did, a number ofother problems would arise, including the question which Chineseregime (if either) should occupy the seat on the Security Council atpresent allotted to China.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Prime Minister said that the French Government had beengratified by the high level of British representation at the RequiemMass held in Notre Dame, Paris, on 12 November for the formerPresident of the French Republic, General de Gaulle. This had beenattended by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, himself, andthree former Prime Ministers in the persons of Lord Avon,Mr. Harold Macmillan and Mr. Harold Wilson. There had been little opportunity for political discussion with the large number of heads of State or Government who had attended the ceremony;but a number of them had congratulated the Prime Minister on themanner in which the British Government were dealing with theproblems with which they were confronted. The former french colonial territories in Africa had been very fully represented: butthere were notably few representatives of African commonwealth countries.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.general de Gaulle
secret. The Prime Minister said that, in their discussion of industrialaffairs on 15 October (CM (70) 30th Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet had decided that the Government should work out a strategy for dealing with forthcoming pay negotiations and associatedindustrial unrest. A group of Ministers with central responsibilities,under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary, had made a preliminary examination of the subject and had recommended thata standing Cabinet Committee should be appointed for this purpose.The Committee would include the chairman of both the ministerial committee on Emergencies and the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy. It could thus co-ordinate all aspects of significantpay disputes; and, together with the Minister directly responsible forthe industry engaged in any particular pay negotiations, it wouldbe available to deal with urgent questions arising in the course ofthe negotiations and requiring immediate decision. The necessary arrangements would be made accordingly.It was of great importance that the public should understand the government&apos;s policy on pay and the economic consequences of excessive pay settlements. Ministers should therefore seek to conveyin their public statements that the country was confronted by a problem of wage inflation which had very serious implications; butthat we were not facing an imminent threat of economic disasterthat demanded crisis action by the Government. The ministerial committee on Economic Strategy would shortly be taking stock ofthe economic situation and reviewing the Governmenfs strategy on cost inflation, with particular reference to recent pay settlements andforthcoming negotiations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmenfsannouncements on 27 October about public expenditure and taxationhad been well received internationally and had helped to supportsterling in the markets. But Press reports to the effect that costinflation in Britain was worse than in other countries with similarrates of pay increase had helped to create an impression of impendingcrisis. It could be argued that wage costs per unit of output inBritish industry were not, in fact, unsatisfactory; but the accelerationover the last year or so in the general level of pay increases was a clear indication of increasing cost inflation, which posed a threat tothe country&apos;s future competitiveness in international markets.Indeed, the level of profit being made on exports from Britain was already almost as low as it had been before the devaluation of 1967;and the expectations of success in export markets disclosed in the
Current andProspectivePay Disputes :Coal Miners&apos;PayPreviousReference:CM (70) 36thConclusions,Minute 5ElectricitySupplyWorkers&apos; PayPreviousReference:CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 1latest survey by the Confederation of British Industry were at the lowest level since the surveys began.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theexecutive of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), meetingon the previous day, had reaffirmed their proposal to hold a ballotof mineworkers on acceptance of the pay settlement reached withthe National Coal Board (NCB). The ballot would be held in thefollowing week. In the meantime, however, the current unofficial strikes in the coal mines were causing a substantial loss of production;and it had recently been suggested that imports of foundry coke were immediately required in order to maintain operations by coke ovensat the minimum level necessary to avoid long-term damage. Afterinvestigation, however, he had concluded that supplies would be satisfactory for operations at a minimum level for about the next two weeks. In these circumstances, although no Government actionto. relax the general ban on coal imports should be needed beforethe conclusion of the miners&apos; ballot, he had agreed that theChairman of the NCB should warn the NUM early in the following week that during the unofficial strike the NCB&apos;s open general licence for imports would be used to bring in any essential requirements ofcoal, particularly foundry coke, which were not available in Britain.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that discussions on 19 November between the Electricity Council andthe trade unions on the pay claim for a  5 a week increase for manual workers would lead either to a settlement or to deadlock and a subsequent strike. So far the Electricity Council had not been authorised to make any counter offer to the pay claim; but the council&apos;s Chairman saw little hope of an agreed settlement belowthe range of a 12-15 per cent increase. A pay settlement at the higher level might admittedly confirm the impression that pay increases of15 per cent represented a currently acceptable level of settlement.On the other hand a strike in the electricity supply industry wouldhave very grave effects on the economy.In discussion it was maintained that an increase exceeding12 per cent would have serious implications, both for pay negotiationsgenerally, including those for university and schoolteachers, andfor the development of cost inflation. Despite the damage which astrike could cause, a pay increase above 12 per cent would not betolerable. On the other hand the Government could not expect tomaintain a wholly consistent level of pay increases. Public opinion was unlikely to support complete uniformity of treatment if someof the workers concerned were low paid or public health and safetywere put at risk by strikes.  The Government should accordingly
Social ServicesSupplementaryBenefit for andPAYE Refundsto Strikers     ,previous reference :CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 1CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP (70) 103) about the payment of supplementary benefit and PAYE refunds to strikers.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committees on social Services, Economic Policy and Industrial Relations had considered a number of possible financial deterrents to strikes. TheCommittees&apos; first proposal was that the amount of a strikerspersonal resources which should be disregarded in the calculation of the supplementary benefit payable to his dependants should bereduced from the present level of  4 7s. Od. to  1, with the resultthat strikers would be dealt with in the same way as unemployed persons. The second was that in the first two weeks following theend of a strike supplementary benefit should no longer be availablein the ordinary way to an employee but should be paid only in casesof hardship and should then be recoverable through the employer.This proposal would deprive an employee after a strike of whatamounted to a tax-free gift, when he could obtain a taxable loan from his employer. The Committees proposed that these measuresavoid becoming committed to a policy of resisting every pay award of more than a predetermined figure and should risk a strike only where they could expect to win public support.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that the contingency plans for dealing with the effects of an electricity strikewere being reconsidered in order to ascertain whether electricityoutput during a strike could be improved by greater use of servicemen than had so far been planned. Concern was also expressed about recent increases in violent picketing, of which therehad been Press reports although no formal complaints had been madeto the police. It was suggested that the police should take more active steps to ascertain whether offences were in fact beingcommitted during picketing. The Cabinet were informed that theDepartment of Employment were seeking to establish the facts incertain cases and that the Attorney-General was consulting theDirector of Public Prosecutions. The Government could not give instructions to Chief Constables; but the standing advice on thesubject in the Home Office Consolidated Circular to the Police wasbeing re-examined.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting.
should be the subject of legislation separate from the industrial relations Bill. This separate legislation would also deal with certainancillary matters such as the recommendation of the DonovanCommission on the definition of a striker for the purposes ofunemployment benefit and abatement of supplementary benefit for individuals who lost their jobs as the result of industrial&quot; misconduct &quot;. The Committees had considered whether it wouldbe right, in addition, to defer the payment of PAYE refunds during a strike and to make supplementary benefit paid to strikers&apos;dependants during a strike recoverable afterwards. They had reached the conclusion that it would not be right to withhold from astriker a refund of his own money, although a reform of the PAYEsystem which was under consideration might have this effect in the longer term. As regards the recovery of supplementary benefit paidduring a strike, the Committees had concluded that, since 90 per cent of strikes did not last longer than two weeks and supplementary benefit was not payable at all during the first two weeks, thedamaging effect of this measure on industrial relations, both generally and after particular strikes, would outweigh the small practical effect which it might exert during strikes.In discussion it was pointed out that, even in a strike whichlasted longer than two weeks, only about half the strikers drewsupplementary benefit. On the other hand it was argued that this did not make the effect of recovering supplementary benefitnegligible. Such action, apart from discouraging long strikes, whichwas in itself useful, would have a broader psychological effect; andthe small minority of strikers affected might well influence decisions to strike or to continue a strike. It was argued that, although anunemployed person could not obtain a PAYE refund as quickly as a striker, who was still on his employer^ books, it would be wrong to discriminate against strikers as such when it was a questionof refunding their own money. The deferment of PAYE refundsand the recovery of supplementary benefit paid during a strikewere connected in that, if refunds were deferred, more supplementary benefit would have to be paid out. If this was not recoverable, astriker would ultimately be better off; if it were, more supplementary benefit would be paid out and hence more would have to be recovered. The implementation of the Donovan Commission^recommendation would mitigate the severity of the measures proposed. But it would involve 150 more staff; and it would bedesirable to reconsider it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were disposed to agree that the &quot; disregard&quot; should bereduced and that supplementary benefit should be paid after a strike
CM 37 (70)only in cases of hardship and should be recoverable. They would wish to reconsider the implementation of the Donovan Commission^recommendation. Legislation to create deterrents to strikers shouldnot be delayed. But the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy would be meeting shortly; and it would be desirable to reconsider the arguments, particularly in relation to the proposalsrejected in CP (70) 103, in the light of the Governmenfs general economic strategy.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting.CONFIDENTIALRate SupportGrantPreviousReference:CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 45. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP (70) 104) about the implications forrate support grant of the pay settlements reached by the localauthorities with their manual workers on the basis of the report ofthe inquiry under Sir Jack Scamp (the Scamp Report) which thetwo sides to the dispute had jointly appointed.The Secretary of State for the Environment said the amount of rate support grant payable in a full year on the difference betweenthe cost of the settlement and that of the employers&apos; earlier offer would be about  8 million; its rate poundage equivalent would beroughly l^d.; and the effect of withholding grant on the differencewould be slightly under a Id. rate. He had no power to exclude the extra costs resulting from the settlement on the basis of the ScampReport from the Increase Order for 1970-71; but it would be practicable to exclude them from the figures on which rate support grant for 1971-72 and 1972-73 would be based. On the other handhe thought that he ought not to do so. The local authorities had notbeen told, either at the beginning of the pay negotiations or when theScamp Committee was appointed, that the amount to be recognised for grant would be determined without regard to the outcome. Thedispute had now been settled; and to withhold grant would amountto little more than a demonstration of the Governmenfs displeasureand would, moreover, look foolish if the Government themselvesdecided that they must match the settlement in the pay award forancillary staffs of the National Health Service. Local authoritiesalready faced a rise of up to Is. 6d. in rates next year; and with-holding grant on the excess costs of the settlement would increase this by a further Id. As a punishment this would not be effective,
whereas it would allow local authorities to place much of the blame for the rate increase on the meanness of the Government and thus to evade the responsibility which otherwise rested squarely on them.Moreover, it was important to place the actions of the localauthorities in the pay dispute in perspective. Their negotiations werebegun against the background of a 15 per cent increase awarded tothe Governmenfs own manual workers from 1 July; and othersettlements of even higher amounts (e.g. for agricultural workers andfor some grades in the British Steel Corporation) had been reachedduring the period of the local authorities manual workers strike. Butthe Government had not intervened in the latter dispute. Even so,and despite the severe pressures with which local authorities had beenfaced during the strike, only 30 had made individual settlements. Inthese circumstances to reduce grant by the amount of the excess costs of the settlement finally reached would be badly received throughoutlocal government, whose goodwill and co-operation it was important to maintain for the forthcoming negotiations on changes in housing finance and on local government reform. The negotiations on rate support grant had so far gone well. He had secured savings of 5 million in 1971-72 and  8 million in 1972-73 in addition to those set out in CP (70) 94; and he would not now need to take advantageof the discretion given him by the Cabinet on 3 November to exceedhis negotiating limits by up to  10 million in each year. In the result,he would save  12 million in 1971-72 and  31 million in 1972-73 onthe estimates contained in the Public Expenditure White Paper.Although the local authorities had reacted adversely to the proposedfurther unallocated reduction on expenditure qualifying for rate support grant, which they were asked to meet by increased efficiency,he would secure the reductions proposed in paragraph 10 of cp (70) 94. But an attempt to impose greater unallocated reductions to take account of the pay settlement would inevitably cause publiccomplaint when the rate support grant settlement was announced.In discussion it was suggested that the Government ought tograsp the opportunity offered by the current rate support grant negotiations to ensure that the extra costs of the settlement were fullyborne by local government. Ministers had made clear at the timetheir view that the pay offer made by the local authorities prior to thestrike had been sufficiently generous. The subsequent settlement ata higher figure represented a setback for the Governmenfs policy of reducing wage inflation. Although the Government had, throughoutthe dispute, given their full backing to the local authorities to stand firm against an unwarranted further increase, the latter had appointed the Scamp Inquiry without consulting the Government and had committed themselves in advance to accept its findings. It would accordingly be right to bring home to them their responsibility for
the excess costs by making sure that these were fully borne by therate payers.It was argued on the other hand that, although a refusal to paygrant on the excess might be fully justified, it would cause theGovernment to appear petty and vindictive. To deny a settlement on the normal basis would require an unprecedented use of the rate support grant arrangements; and it was only the accident of timingwhich made this possible. Such action seemed unlikely, therefore,to win the Government political credit or to yield economic advantage. It would not of itself reduce inflation; nor would it deterinflationary pay settlements in other industries. It would allow localauthorities to transfer the blame for rate increases on to the Govern-ment. It would be unlikely to win the support of public opinion,which in general sympathised with the plight of lower-paid workers;and the local authorities could argue that the settlement which theyhad reached did no more than compensate those workers in localgovernment for the fact that their pay had for some years laggedbehind that of workers in other employment.But, although the balance of advantage might incline againstmaking a specific reduction in rate support grant equivalent to the excess costs of the settlement over the local authorities&apos; own pay offer,it would be both logical and defensible that local authorities, like other employers, should be expected to offset rising wage bills by making greater savings in manpower. It would therefore be appropriate to increase, through the unallocated reduction in localauthority expenditure, the pressures upon them to do so.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be no specific reduction in rate support grant to offset the excess cost of the pay settlement over thecost of the local authorities&apos; offer as it stood before the ScampReport. They nevertheless considered that local authorities shouldbe put under additional pressure to absorb these excess costs throughincreased efficiency. The Scamp Report itself had suggested thatscope existed for higher efficiency through increased productivity and in other ways. Instead of the unallocated general reductions of  10 million and  15 million to which the Cabinet had agreed on November, the Secretary of State for the Environment should nowapply reductions of  10 million and  25 million respectively to theamounts on which the rate support grant payments for 1971-72and 1972-73 were based. The manner in which this was to be presented to the local authorities and to the general public would need careful consideration in relation to the Scamp Report and tothe forthcoming negotiations on the pay of ancillary workers in the
National Health Service; and on this aspect of the matter theSecretary of State should consult further with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord President of the Council and the Secretary ofState for Social Services. In addition, he should take appropriatesteps to impress on those concerned the need for the local authoritiesto reform their pay negotiating machinery and procedures and toimprove their efficiency in the use of manpower.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to applyunallocated general reductions in local authority expenditure recognised for payment of rate support grantof  10 million in 1971-72 and  25 million in 1972-73,instead of the corresponding reductions proposed inparagraph 10 of CP (70) 94 and approved at CM (70)35th Conclusions.SECRETFinances ofthe MerseyDocks andHarbourBoardPreviousReference:CM (70) 22ndConclusions,Minute 36. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (70) 105), to which was annexed amemorandum by the Minister for Transport Industries about the finances of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB).The Minister for Transport Industries said that the MDHBhad received the report of their consultants, Binder, Hamlyn, which after taking account of various steps which the Board could take to improve their financial prospects, including an increase of25 per cent in charges, to be followed by a further 20 per cent increase now forecast revenue surpluses rising to  2-6 million a year by 1975 instead of the deficits rising to  6-5 million whichhad been predicted at an earlier stage. But they also foresawcash deficiencies totalling  23 million between now and 1973, ofwhich  6-5 million would have to be found on 1 January, 1971.There was no easy solution to the problem. If the Government tookno action, there was a grave risk that the port of Liverpool wouldclose. This would cause heavy unemployment and widespread and unacceptable economic damage both to the region and to our exporttrade; 20 per cent of our total general cargo exports used the port.On the other hand the proposals by the MDHB and their merchantbankers that the Government should rescue them by providing abridging loan of  20 million or guaranteeing future bond renewalswere no less objectionable.   What was needed was a capital
reconstruction, coupled with a complete reconstitution of the Boardand its management. This could only be achieved by privatelegislation; but, even if it were possible to present a Bill by the normaldeadline of 27 November, it would be a substantial period before it could be passed. It was also highly desirable that the managementshould be strengthened immediately. Their recent decision toincrease their charges indicated that they might be beginning to facetheir responsibilities. But the measures which they had so far takenfell short of what was really needed. The Board&apos;s resignation was noremedy since, under the existing statutory provisions a similar board would be re-elected. The wiser course would be to arrange for theBoard to delegate their functions to an ad hoc committee appointedby the Government. He had managed to secure the services ofsuitable members for such a body, which would be competent to manage the port; and he expected to receive the agreement of theexisting Board, provided that the Government were prepared to make special loans of some  5- 8 million to meet their minimum cashrequirements until the Bill could be passed. It would also benecessary to resume payments of grant and loan on the SeaforthDock, which provided the only possibility of a long-term future forthe port. Both new capital loans and the proposed special loanswould be secured on the assets of the port and would not be involvedin the proposed capital reconstruction. This course would ensurethat a substantial volume of private capital would be retained in theport and that the bond-holders and management would bear a largeshare of the cost of their own incompetence. The only alternative to cover the period before the legislation could be enacted would be toappoint a receiver of the rates. But a statutory trust, unlike a company, could not be wound up; and the appointment of a receiverwould therefore be an unusual procedure, which might well lead toprotracted litigation. In these circumstances the least disadvan-tageous course would be to undertake a capital reconstruction anda reconstitution of the Board, on the lines proposed, by means of aprivate Bill; to provide, in the interim, short-term Exchequer loans to cover the cash requirements of the Board; and to resume paymentof port modernisation grant and loans for the construction of theSeaforth Dock.The Solicitor-General said that the course proposed by theMinister for Transport Industries would not involve the Governmentin any further obligations in respect of the liabilities of the MDHB,since the Board&apos;s critical financial situation would have been made clear at the same time. But there would undoubtedly be political pressure on the Government to provide funds to meet the other
bond maturities. In view of the statutory trust status of the MDHBit was not possible to appoint a normal receiver or to wind theundertaking up. The Government could apply to appoint a receiverof the rates; but, since it was not certain under this procedure thatthe receiver would be appointed in respect of all the secured creditors,some might seek execution or the appointment of their own receiver,while the unsecured creditors might seek separate execution on theBoard&apos;s assets. While the Government might ultimately prevailagainst these contending claims, extensive litigation might be unavoidable; and, if they failed to establish their position in any respect, the situation might disintegrate into a complex scramble forthe assets by the creditors. Moreover, there might be considerabledifficulty in clarifying the position created by the receivership even after the capital reconstruction had been undertaken by privatelegislation.In discussion it was suggested that the provision of exchequer loans to help in meeting the Board&apos;s immediate cash requirements would be liable to be interpreted as yet another case of the government&apos;s salvaging an incompetent management. Followingso rapidly after the special measures which had been taken to assistRolls-Royce this would throw increasing doubt on the credibility of the government&apos;s industrial policies and might well be critically receivedby the Governmenfs supporters. If the enactment of the necessaryBill to provide for the capital reconstruction were delayed and this seemed very probable the sums required might be substantiallylarger than the  5- 8 million now envisaged. Moreover, if theGovernment provided funds which would be used in effect to pay offin full holders of bonds maturing on 1 January, 1971, they wouldcertainly attract very heavy pressure to pay off the others in full; andin that case a drastic capital reconstruction which it was generally agreed was essential might not in fact be attainable. In spite ofthe legal difficulties, therefore, the appointment of a receiver mightrepresent the wiser course. If, however, those difficulties werejudged to be insuperable, it might be better to refrain from anyintervention. The MDHB could increase their revenue by raisingcharges still further; and if, as appeared unlikely, this resulted in areduction in traffic, costs could be drastically reduced. It was primarily the responsibility of the management, the bond-holdersand the port users to put matters right; and, if there were anyinterruption to port services before their combined efforts could make the necessary arrangements, the effect would be no more serious than that of previous prolonged strikes. Moreover, if the Govern-ment once showed themselves prepared to provide financialassistance, there would be no further hope of securing an improvementin the deplorable labour relations in the port, which were certainly
one of the main factors contributing to the critical position in whichthe Board now found themselves.On the other hand there was a serious risk that, if theGovernment refrained from any intervention, the port would be closed and it would not be possible for the private interests toarrange to salvage the essential elements of its operation. the implications for the economy of Merseyside and the North-West andfor our export trade were unacceptable. Moreover, some of thebond-holders might try to put in a receiver of the rates; and, if theydid so in respect only of their own bonds, the Government mightagain be faced with the dilemma of either themselves seeking theappointment of a receiver to protect their interests in respect of their capital loans or providing the minimum cash requirements. It was essential to ensure that the loss would fall mainly on the bond-holders,as would be the case in a company liquidation; and this could beachieved by a Bill to provide for a sufficiently drastic capital reconstruction. The bulk of the private capital would then, in effect,be compulsorily retained in the undertaking in the form of equityon which there was little hope of a return. The effect of theappointment of a receiver of the rates was too uncertain to enable theGovernment to be sure of retaining control of the situation untilthe capital reconstruction and the reconstitution of the Board couldbe implemented.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposal that the Government should make funds available to meetthe MDHB&apos;s immediate requirements and, in particular, to pay offthe 1 January bond maturities in full presented very serious difficulties. He would arrange for the Ministers most concerned togive further consideration urgently to alternative methods of dealingwith the problem and ensuring that the cost of past incompetencefell to the maximum extent on the bond-holders and the Board. TheCabinet would need to resume their consideration of the matter inthe following week.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of thendiscussion by the Prime Minister.
