The Prime Minister said that he had held a meeting ofMinisters primarily concerned to review Government strategy todeal with inflation, with particular reference to recent pay settlementsand forthcoming negotiations. Without departing from the government&apos;s long-term economic strategy and policies, effective action must now be taken promptly to curb wage inflation. Theforthcoming settlements for electricity workers and ancillary workers in the National Health Service (NHS) needed to beconsidered against that general background.The Home Secretary said that the Committee under his chairmanship which had been charged to co-ordinate all aspects ofsignificant pay disputes had considered these two sets of negotiations.In the case of the NHS they had agreed that the Government had little alternative to giving the same award as local authority workers had achieved in the recent pay settlement following the ScampReport. There was a traditional link between the pay of NHSancillaries and local authority workers; both consisted of similarlylow-paid groups; and the Government would not carry publicopinion in a strike, caused by refusal of the same settlement, whichput hospitals out of action. A majority of his Committee took theview that the Government should, however, take a firm stand onthe pay of electricity workers. They recommended, the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry dissenting, that the electricity council should be requested not to make an offer of more than10 per cent overall, though they should have authority to go up to12 per cent &quot; without prejudice &quot; if that would secure a settlementat that figure. But, if negotiations were expected to break downand lead to arbitration or industrial action, they should ensure thatthe break was made on the basis of a 10 per cent, and not a 12 percent, offer. Within their offer the Electricity Council should alsoensure that the lowest-paid workers would receive increases sufficientto bring them at the minimum to the same levels of pay ascorresponding local authority workers had been awarded on thebasis of the Scamp Report. His Committee had recognised the potential damage to the economy from a strike of electricity workersbut had agreed, on balance, that this risk must be faced. They had,however, questioned the advice which they had received that itwould not be practicable to maintain more than 25 per cent of thenormal output of power stations even if a greater number of servicemen were provided than the 6,000 now assumed in the contingency plans.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he had sought independent advice from Sir Ronald Edwards, a former
Chairman of the Electricity Council, on the assertion of the central electricity Generating Board that additional numbers of men wouldnot enable higher electrical output to be maintained. Sir Ronald,while unable to give a considered assessment in the time available,had advised that the Board&apos;s assertion should be regarded as reliable.On the general issue of choosing the electricity industry for a firmstand against an inflationary wage settlement, his concern was thatthe Government should not enter a battle which it would be difficultto win. If only 25 per cent of normal electricity supplies could bemaintained during an official strike, much of industry would bebrought to a standstill and there would be serious inconvenience to,and indeed hardship for, the general public. The Government would come under great pressure to reach a settlement. He would have preferred to fight on different ground where there was a betterprospect of the Governmenfs securing their objectives. If, however,the Cabinet took the view that a firm stand on the pay of electricityworkers would best bring home to public opinion the urgent need to moderate the level of pay settlements, he would not dissent.In discussion there was general acceptance of the proposal to reflect the settlement for local authority manual workers in the revised offer to be made for NHS ancillary workers on 20 November.Electricity workers, on the other hand, were in general better paidthan either of those two groups. Despite the potentially serious consequences of an official strike of electricity workers, a settlement on the basis advised by the Electricity Council, in whose view theunions would not agree to less than a 14 per cent increase overall,would risk establishing 14-15 per cent as a new norm for the future.This would not be tolerable. The proportion of lower-paid workers in the electricity industry was only 10 per cent; and itshould accordingly be possible, within a total offer restricted to anincrease of 10 per cent or a final settlement not exceeding 12 percent, to ensure relatively generous treatment for these workers andso to present a good case to the unions and to public opinion forstanding on such an offer. Moreover, public opinion would not readily accept that a small group of workers should be allowed toblackmail the community at large in order to advance its ownsectional interest. Admittedly, if only 25 per cent of electrical output was likely to be available, an official electricity strike could quicklyparalyse much of industry and impose great hardships on ordinaryusers of electricity. For these reasons it was arguable that theelectricity industry was the worst choice for a stand against aninflationary wage claim. On the other hand, the fact that theGovernment were seen to attach such high importance to arrestingwage inflation that they were prepared to take a resolute stand in face of such potentially serious effects would bring the issue home to public opinion more effectively than a stand in an industry which did not involve such widespread risks.  If the Government were to
succeed, however, it would be important to prepare public opinion in advance in order to engender the will to withstand inconvenience and hardship rather than to allow the community to be held toransom.In further discussion, the following main points were made:(a) It was understood that the electricity industry&apos;s negotiatingagreements provided that either party to a pay dispute could invokearbitration and that the findings would be binding on both parties.Arbitration could have unpredictable results; but it would not be practicable, save as part of a new statutory regulation of incomes,to set guidelines which arbitrators would be bound to follow.Moreover, in the light of the Government^ own plans for reformingthe framework of industrial relations it would be undesirable to seek to disturb the standing arrangements governing arbitration in theelectricity industry, even if these arrangements were not at presentlegally binding on the parties. If, however, the Government hadto reckon with the possibility of a final settlement being reached by arbitration or through the appointment of a Court of Inquiry itwould be the more important to ensure that the offer on which thepreceding negotiations had broken down left some room for a final settlement at 12 per cent or less. The Electricity Council should accordingly not be permitted to go beyond a 10 per cent offer. Inorder to establish the right climate for possible arbitration it mightbe helpful for the Government to give suitable emphasis in the meanwhile to the vital importance in the national interest of reducingwage inflation and the general level of pay settlements.(b) Although the outcome of a dispute which might have tobe settled ultimately by arbitration or by a Court of Inquiry wasinevitably uncertain and the final settlement might be higher thanthe Government would have wished, they must nevertheless take a firm stand now against an excessive increase. The risk of a strikemight not be so great as was feared; especially since there was reason for thinking that the electricity unions might not be preparedto declare an official strike. Nor was it clear that means could notbe found to maintain more than 25 per cent of electricity supplieseven if there were an official strike. Such possibilities as enlistingretired electrical power engineers and drawing upon the resourcesof electrical consultants and of the Armed Forces to a considerably greater extent than so far envisaged should be further examined.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that ancillary workers in the NHS must be offeredterms similar to those accorded to local authority manual workersin the recent settlement. In the forthcoming negotiations on the pay of electricity workers, however, the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry should request the Electricity Council to restrict their offer to an increase not exceeding 10 per cent overall and to accommodate within that figure reasonably generous provision forthe lowest paid workers, whose base rates should at least be brought up to the level awarded to local authority manual workers in therecent settlement. It should be made plain to the Chairman of theCouncil that the Government were resolved to stand on this offerin face of industrial action and that the Council were not authorisedto negotiate a settlement at any higher percentage. If the Chairmandemurred, the Secretary of State should report the position later that day to the Ministerial group under the Chairmanship of theHome Secretary; and it might then be necessary to consider givingthe Council a written instruction. The Cabinet recognised that theunions might respond to such an offer by giving immediate noticeof an official strike. On the other hand they might first seekarbitration under the industry&apos;s procedures or the appointment ofa Court of Inquiry. The Secretary of State for Trade and industry should therefore consider with the Secretary of State for employment which of these alternatives would be preferable and how it mightbe achieved: it was most important to influence the climate ofpublic opinion within which the negotiations and any Inquiry orarbitration would take place and to emphasise the vital need in thenational interest to halt wage inflation and to reduce current levels of pay settlements. The Ministers concerned should give urgent consideration to this aspect and to the general presentation of the government&apos;s case; and the Ministerial Committee on Emergenciesshould review forthwith all aspects of an electricity strike, including,in particular, possible means of maintaining a higher output ofelectricity than was assumed under present contingency planning.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry toinform the Chairman of the Electricity Council of thebasis on which the Government desired the forthcomingpay negotiations with the electricity workers to be conducted.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to re-examine urgently thepresent basis of contingency planning for a possibleelectricity strike.(4) Invited the Lord President of the Council to consider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry and theSecretary of State for Employment, the public presentation of the Governmenfs case.
IndustrialRelationsBillPreviousReference:CM (70) 24thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (CP (70) 106), discussing whether certain provisions in the proposed Industrial Relations Bill should apply tothe Crown.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the consultative document on the Industrial Relations Bill had made it clear that the armed Forces and the police would be excluded from the scope ofthe proposed legislation; but the Government had avoided any otherindication of the extent to which the Bill would bind the Crown.Ministers had agreed, however, that in general there should be as little differentiation as possible in the bill&apos;s application to Crownemployees and to other employees. The Ministerial Committee on industrial Relations had accordingly considered the extent to whichthe Bill should apply to the Crown and had reached agreementexcept on two points, the enforceability of collective agreements andthe disclosure of information by employers. The Bill would provide that all written collective agreements between trade unions and employers (or employers&apos; organisations) would be presumed to beintended by the parties to be legally binding except as expresslyprovided to the contrary; it would also make it possible for any party to a procedure agreement to seek to have it made legally enforceable upon the order of the National Industrial RelationsCourt (NIRC) where this was thought essential to secure and maintain orderly industrial relations. Although it could be argued that the application of these provisions to the Crown would introducean undue degree of formality and rigidity into the Whitley Councilsystem of industrial relations in the Civil Service, that system wasin fact paralleled in large organisations in the private sector and need not change simply because the legal status of agreements mightbe changed. The arguments for Crown exemption from thisprovision of the Bill could be adduced with equal or greater force inthe private sector; and, if they were employed to defend Crownexemption, the Government would risk undermining their wholecase for creating the presumption about the legal enforceability of collective agreements.The Bill would also require employers to disclose information to registered trade unions in negotiations, in accordance with provisions to be laid down in a code of practice, and to discloseinformation to employees of approximately the kind of presentgiven to shareholders. As regards the former requirement therewould be protection in the Bill for certain types of information,which employers generally would not be required to disclose. This
would include information affecting national security. the ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations had agreed that, forthe purpose of avoiding inappropriate disclosures of information to civil Service trade unions, the list of types of information exempted from disclosure should include those whose release would be contrary to the national interest. The Committee had not been ableto agree, however, whether this exemption from disclosure shouldbe established simply by a certificate from a Minister that disclosurewould be against the national interest and that this certificate shouldbe conclusive, or whether, as with the determination of Crownprivilege applying to documents required for Court proceedings, theNIRC should rule upon disclosure or non-disclosure on the basisof representations by a Minister, which could, if appropriate, be heard in private. On balance the latter course was preferable, since in the majority of cases the NIRC would no doubt endorse a minister&apos;s refusal of information and the Government would thenbe fully protected against criticism by the Courfs decision, whereas,if certificates by Ministers were to be final in this respect, theGovernment could be exposed to the embarrassment of havingpublicly to defend their action in every instance. On the requirement for the disclosure of information to individual employees, theSecretary of State would be able by regulation to exempt employersfrom the duty in question. There would be some Governmentactivities for which the normal disclosure arrangements to employeeswould be appropriate; but he proposed to exempt GovernmentDepartments for the most part from the obligation and to makeappropriate regulations in consultation with the Ministers concerned.The Lord Privy Seal said that, despite the force of the arguments for applying to the Crown the Bill&apos;s provisions on the enforceabilityof collective agreements, this would seriously disturb the existinginformal arrangements for staff relations in the Civil Service, whichmeet the special requirements of Government employment. the government&apos;s situation in this respect was different from that ofprivate sector employers. If, however, the Government decided toapply to the Crown the provisions in question, this would significantlylimit their freedom of action in relation to future agreements, sincethe National Staff Side of the Civil Service Whitley Council had saidthat, if the Crown were bound in this respect, they would insist thatthe Government should bind themselves to fulfil agreements with theStaff Side. In that event the Government would not in future beable to impose &quot; pay pauses &quot; or to refuse arbitration as they hadbeen able to on previous occasions when the national interestrequired it. As regards the Bill&apos;s provisions for the disclosure ofinformation it would be preferable to prescribe that certification bya Minister should be conclusive against the release of informationwhere that would be contrary to the national interest.  It was for
CONFIDENTIALImproved 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordDedsSby Privy Seal (cp(7Q) 101) on Improved Expenditure Decisions by government    Government.The Lord Privy Seal said that the present system for controllingpublic expenditure through the Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) was effective in relation to the purposes whichit sought to achieve; but it did not subject existing programmes toregular and systematic analysis, in a way which would enable ministers to relate the objectives of those programmes to the government&apos;s strategy as a whole and to achieve a better balance ofexpenditure within the total. The new system of programme analysis and review (PAR) proposed in paragraphs 4-7 of his memorandum was designed as a complement to PESC to giveMinisters a better framework within which they could exerciseoptions within and between programmes. The Business team, intheir discussions with Ministers and Officials, had found wide support for the objectives of a PAR system such as he was proposing, and he sought the Cabinet&apos;s approval in principle to its introduction.Much detailed work remained to be done by the Business team,the Treasury, the Civil Service Department, the Cabinet Office and departments, to discover how the PAR system could best bethe Government of the day to determine whether official information should be published; and the final decision on disclosure should therefore not lie with the NIRC since, if Ministers rejected NIRCrulings on disclosure, they would then have to defend their actionin Parliament and in doing so make it appear that the Governmentwere breaking their own law.After discussing the issues involved the Cabinet agreed, on balance, that the Crown should be bound by the provisions of theproposed Industrial Relations Bill on the enforceability of collective agreements and the disclosure of information, on the understandingthat, where the release of information to trade unions would be contrary to the national interest, it might be withheld fromdisclosure upon a determination to that effect by the national industrial Relations Court.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to arrangefor the Industrial Relations Bill to provide accordingly.
introduced and operated. This would take many months. Theobject would be to apply it flexibly and selectively, concentrating onkey issues in order to lighten the burden on Departments whileproviding the maximum of assistance to Ministers.In discussion it was suggested that the PAR system would place an appreciable additional burden on Ministers, who would berequired to consider the programme reviews collectively. Significantnumbers of senior officials might also have to be diverted to thework; and, at a time when Departments were under strong pressure to reduce numbers, the burden could become heavy. The collectiveconsideration by Ministers of the programmes of individual ministers might raise questions of Ministerial responsibility; andthere were many important areas of policy which could not be subjected to the quantitative analysis proposed under a PAR system.On the other hand all Departments concerned would be fullyconsulted over the introduction and operation of the new system;and the staffing implications would be closely watched by the CivilService Department. Some extra effort would clearly be required;but it would be kept to manageable proportions by applying thenew system selectively and concentrating particularly on thosepolicy areas where real options existed. Any difficulties foreseenby Departments would be taken fully into account in introducing thesystem progressively.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the aims of a PAR system; but the implications of introducing it, particularly in terms of its demands on manpower, should be worked out in greater detail. As the nextstep, further discussions should take place between the Civil service department, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the Departmentsconcerned; and the Lord Privy Seal should report further to theCabinet when a more detailed scheme had been elaborated.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the Civil service department, in consultation with the Treasury, theCabinet Office and other Departments, to make recommendations on the ways in which a PAR systemmight be introduced and operated; and to report again in due course to the Cabinet.
CM 38 (70)CONFIDENTIALLocation of 4.   The Prime Minister said that, at his invitation, the LordGovernment priVy Seal was proposing a full-scale review of the extent to whichsignificant numbers of civil servants could be dispersed efficiently and economically from the centre of London. A start would bemade with the Social group of Departments (the Department ofEducation and Science, the Department of Health and social security and the Home Office), followed by the Defence Supplygroup (the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation Supply).The review, which would be co-ordinated by a Ministerial committee under the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s chairmanship with appropriatedepartmental representation, should be completed before the endof 1971.Although the efficiency of the Governmenfs operations was themain consideration, regional policy and environmental aspects were also important. The Regional Policy Committee would therefore be directly involved in the selection of areas for dispersed blocks ofwork; and it might wish to consider the regional policy aspects ofany proposals arising out of the review before the matter came backto the Cabinet. The proposals had his full support; and the generalacquiescence of the Staff Side had been secured. He invited theCabinet to endorse them.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ statement.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make an interim report tothe Cabinet on the progress of the review in six months&apos;time.Cabinet Office,11 November, 1970.
