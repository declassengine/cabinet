MinisterialPublicationsMemoirs byformerMinistersCONFIDENTIAL1. The Prime Minister said that Mr. Arthur Lewis, M P, had put down a Parliamentary Question for answer that afternoon asking for information about the Governmenfs policy in relation to thepublication of memoirs by former Ministers and suggesting that suchmemoirs should be prohibited until their authors had been out of office for at least 10 years.He proposed to say, in reply, that there were well-establishedconventions in this field which were designed to maintain the standards of British public life and to protect the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between colleagues who shared a collective responsibility; that the application of these conventionsin any individual case was mainly a matter of good taste and goodjudgment; and that their voluntary acceptance by all concerned was more likely to be effective in preserving them than any arbitraryrule.He trusted that these conventions would be respected by all members of the present Administration.  11The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.CabinetCommitteesCONFIDENTIAL2. The Prime Minister said that, as a result of the recentchanges in the structure and organisation of Departments, he hadreviewed the composition of certain Cabinet Committees. Theirrevised membership would be promulgated forthwith.ParliamentaryAffairsCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament the following week.OverseaAffairsUnited StatesMid-TermElectionsSECRET4.

Middle East The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in thePrevious        previous night&apos;s debate in the United Nations General AssemblyReference:      a large majority had endorsed a Resolution, sponsored by theConclusions11   non&apos;augne(i countries and to a large extent inspired by the united minute 3        Arab Republic, calling inter alia for an early resumption of themission   of   the   United   Nations   Secretary-General&apos;s   special representative, Dr. Jarring, a renewal of the cease-fire and a reviewof the situation by the Security Council in two months&apos; time.Together with a number of other countries we had abstained on this resolution mainly on the grounds that it might detract to someextent from United Nations Resolution No. 242 and cast doubt onits status as the basis for a solution of the Arab-Israel problem.Prime MinisterVisit to London The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in theof the Israeli discussions which the Prime Minister and he himself had had withthe Israeli Prime Minister, Mrs. Meir, on the previous day it had appeared that the Israeli Government were prepared in principle to accept the recommendations of United Nations resolution no. 242, which called for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories subject to agreed adjustments of boundaries. But theterritorial adjustments which the Government of Israel were likelyto demand in the interests of their security were so considerable thatit was very doubtful whether they would be negotiable with theUnited Arab Republic (UAR) and Syria. It therefore remaineduncertain whether the Government of Israel were genuinelyprepared to negotiate a political settlement or whether they would continue, as in the past, to rest on the position of strength which theyhad acquired as a result of the 1967 war. Mrs. Meir had indicated that Israel was not prepared to consider the Soviet proposal for ajoint guarantee by the Soviet Union, the United States, the UnitedKingdom and France of the territories which would be evacuatedby Israel under an eventual peace settlement: and, given past history,the Israeli attitude was perhaps understandable. On the other handSoviet support for the armed forces of the UAR was being maintained and intensified and was now being reinforced by increased assistance to Syria, where the Soviet Government had recently established air bases under their exclusive control. In viewof the growing threat to Israeli security which these developmentsimplied the Government of Israel might yet conclude that in thelong term their best hope lay in an international settlement,internationally guaranteed.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements  by  the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
IndustrialAffairsLocal AuthorityManualWorkers&apos;Pay DisputePreviousReference :CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 1CM 36(70)confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the reportby Sir Jack Scamp&apos;s Committee of Inquiry into the dispute overthe pay of local authority manual workers had been made availableto the two sides to the dispute that morning; they were at present engaged in separate discussions on it and would thereafter meet in the National Joint Council, probably that afternoon. The report would not be released until after the National Joint Council meeting and meanwhile there was no reliable information as to its recommendations.In discussion, it was the general view that any public reactionby the Government to the recommendations should be delayed untilthe outcome of that day&apos;s negotiations in the National Joint council was known; and that it would be better included in a Ministerialspeech over the coming week-end than made earlier or as a formal statement. The primary purpose would be to influence forthcomingpay negotiations for other groups of workers.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had reviewed the risk of fires occurring that evening.A number of local authorities had arranged to reduce theaccumulations of rubbish by using contractors or through theco-operation of their own labour. One, the Hackney borough council, had asked for Government help but it had been established that they had not consulted the trade unions locally or tried to employ contractors before doing so; and in the event they had found it possible to engage contractors, for whom the Home Office had arranged police protection. In general, chief fire officers throughoutthe country expected to be able to deal with fire calls that evening and the Committee had concluded that further publicity mightstimulate fire raising rather than reduce the hazard.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinisters primarily concerned should meet in the course of that evening to consider what, if any, public rejoinder would be desirableby the Government to the recommendations of the ScampCommittee and to any settlement that might be reached later that day in the local authority manual workers&apos; pay dispute.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theMinisters primarily concerned to consider later that day how   the  Government   should  react   to   the128805-5b*
recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry and thepossible settlement of the local authority manual workers&apos;pay dispute.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that unofficial strikes in the coal industry now affected 50,000 miners and werecausing the loss of some 100,000 tons of coal a day. This was notyet a critical rate of loss, but Emergency Regulations were availablein draft should it later become necessary to proclaim a State ofEmergency in order to conserve coal stocks.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.confidential. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said thatarrangements to lighten the tanker Pacific Glory by removing partof its oil cargo into other vessels had been hampered by bad weather.When it was possible to complete this operation, the tanker wouldbe moved and would probably now go to Lyme Bay instead ofSpithead. Suitable precautions had been taken to deal with anyescapes of oil that might occur during her passage.SECRET*7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (70) 99) about value-added tax (VAT), towhich was attached a draft Green Paper.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would recognise theneed to maintain complete security on the issues raised in the chancellors memorandum and in the draft Green Paper which was attached to it. Major economic and political issues were involved;and it would be desirable for the Economic Strategy Committee toconsider them before the Cabinet were asked to take decisions,which clearly could not be taken that day. They would need toconsider whether they accepted the Chancellors proposal tointroduce a VAT; and, if so, whether it would be appropriate to announce such a decision at this time. Finally, they would wishto examine the terms of the proposed Green Paper and, in particular,to consider whether it should announce a Government decision tointroduce VAT or leave the Governmenfs position open.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentwere committed to the abolition of Selective Employment Tax (SET).After much consideration he had concluded that the introduction ofVAT in place of both SET and Purchase Tax was the most satisfactory way of carrying out this commitment. The introductionof VAT would also make it easier to switch more of the total burdenfrom direct to indirect taxation. If the United Kingdom became amember of the European Economic Community (e.c.), they wouldin any event be obliged to introduce a VAT on the lines nowproposed. If his colleagues agreed to the introduction of a VAT, thepublication of a Green Paper on the lines indicated in the annex tohis memorandum would be an essential preliminary. It wouldenable HM Customs and Excise to discuss the many complextechnical problems involved with trade and industry before legislation was drafted. If a firm decision to introduce VAT were notannounced in the Green Paper, the Government would find it muchmore difficult to withstand the opposition to the tax, which would undoubtedly be pressed hard. It was essential to introduce the tax as early as possible in the life of the present Parliament. He was satisfied that the earliest practicable date was the autumn of 1972.In order to achieve this the necessary legislation must be enacted by april 1972 in order that a statutory register of traders might becompleted by the autumn of that year. A computer would have tobe installed before a start was made with the register; and thenormal delivery time for a computer of the type required was about15 months. Thus, a decision was needed in the near future. Hehad considered possible alternative methods of raising the revenuerequired to abolish SET. The late Chancellor of the Exchequer,Mr. Iain Macleod, had given an unequivocal commitment in theHouse of Commons that a Conservative Administration would notintroduce a general pay-roll tax in place of SET. This did notnecessarily preclude an increase in employers&apos; contributions to theNational Insurance Fund; but a reasonable increase would not aloneprovide sufficient revenue for the purpose now required. It was notpossible to extend Purchase Tax to cover services such as restaurantsand hairdressing nor to introduce specific taxes on these and other services. Goods at present untaxed were largely those used by industry and commerce. If Purchase Tax were extended to these,a tax burden would be placed indirectly on exports which could notbe refunded as it could be under the VAT system. A sales taxcollected wholly at the retail stage would involve working with verylarge numbers of retailers; and experience in other countries had shown that a sales tax designed to produce revenue on the scale
required here would be far too readily evaded. VAT at a generalrate of 16 per cent, with a reduced rate of 5 per cent for, e.g. fueleducation), would bring in revenue equivalent to the yield of purchase Tax and SET and thus enable the latter taxes to be abolished. If it were considered desirable to increase theproportion of revenue collected by indirect taxation, the generalrate of VAT could be raised above 16 per cent which was in themiddle of the present range of rates in the Member States of the eec. The effect on the retail price index of a VAT at these rates would be a rise of just under If per cent. The effect on individual commodities, however, would vary considerably. Those goods atpresent subject to the highest rates of purchase tax (55 per cent and 36f per cent) such as furs, jewellery, cars, consumerdurables, etc. would, of course, be reduced in price as a result ofthe change. There would be little effect at present on goods subjectto purchase tax at 22 per cent. Clothing, furniture, householdarticles and other goods at present subject to a purchase tax of13f per cent, together with children&apos;s clothing and other goods nowexempt from Purchase Tax, would be increased in price.Compensation for the increase in the cost of living would need to beprovided for old age pensioners and others in receipt of social security benefits. An uprating of benefits was due to take placein any event in the autumn of 1973; and it would be necessary toconsider whether special assistance should be provided before then.Although the introduction of a VAT would require a net increase(after taking account of manpower savings from the abolition of purchase Tax and SET) of some 5,400 to 5,900 Civil Service staff,savings in staff as large as this could probably be obtained by the mid-1970s by changes in the PA YE income tax system.In discussion it was argued that the only effective alternative toSET was VAT. A retail sales tax, unless it was restricted to an inadequate rate, was so open to evasion that it should not beconsidered as a practical substitute. There was a commitment that SET would not be replaced by another form of employment tax;and, unlike VAT, an employment tax would bear hardly on exports.In any event VAT would have to be adopted ultimately if we entered the e.c.: to introduce other taxation measures now for example an employment tax which were inconsistent with the Governmenfspledges and thereafter to change to VAT when we entered the EECwas a course of action which could not be contemplated. It was desirable that SET should be abolished by the end of 1972; and therewas every advantage, therefore, in the Governmenfs making anearly announcement that they intended to introduce legislationadopting the VAT.   A Green Paper of the kind proposed in
CP (70) 99, however, was not necessarily the best vehicle forexplaining the Governmenfs policy. A Green Paper was normallypublished to stimulate discussion of policy. If, however, a firmdecision on policy were announced, it would be better to publish a document which not only explained the working of VAT, which wasto most people an entirely unfamiliar concept, but forestalled someof the criticisms, for example in relation to the scale of resultingprice increases, which would be made in the absence of authoritativeestimates.It was argued on the other hand that VAT had many importantdisadvantages. It would require a substantial increase in manpower in the public service (as well as in trade and industry) which wouldgive rise to serious criticism as being inconsistent with the government&apos;s objective in reducing the size of the Civil Service.The increases in manpower on account of VAT could not be offset by savings arising from possible changes in the administration ofPAYE for some years. The effect of VAT, unless a complexdifferential system were adopted, would be to increase the price of essential goods and services and to decrease the price of luxuries.It would have a marked effect on the cost of living and would be liable to inflate wage claims still further. An employment taxwhich was proportionate to the payroll would have the oppositetendency. The Governmenfs policies in relation to agriculturalsubsidies, charges for public services and housing subsidies andrents would materially increase the cost of living and alter the incidence of taxation: to embark on VAT so soon after inauguratingthese policies would impose excessive strain. The necessary bill would also be a major element in the 1971-72 legislative programme,which was already in danger of being overloaded. It might,therefore, be preferable, for the purpose of recouping the revenuelost by the abolition of SET, to consider increasing and extendingPurchase Tax or increasing the employers&apos; National insurance contribution or adopting both these courses. They could either beregarded as a substitute for VAT or could be used to supplement aVAT at a lower rate than was contemplated in the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer. In any event, the possibility ofmaintaining existing rates of tax on luxuries should be re-examined.Although a pledge had been given not to replace SET by another formof employment tax, this need not preclude an increase in employers&apos;National Insurance contributions. Moreover, if the information which had become available since these issues had been discussed by the Conservative Party before the General Election suggested thatan employment  tax  or an increase in  employers&apos;  National
Insurance contributions was the right course to adopt in the national interest, whether simply or in combination with other measures, this possibility should be further examined. If the public were informedshortly that VAT was to be introduced in the autumn of 1972, asthe Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed, the expectation wouldbe created that the tax on e.g. cars would be substantially lower ifpurchases were postponed; and this could have the most serious consequences for trade and industry.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that it was clear that further information and study were needed before adecision could be taken whether to adopt VAT. A number ofalternatives to the replacement of SET and Purchase Tax by VATappeared to exist. VAT could be abandoned in favour of anincrease in Purchase Tax or an employment tax (or an increase inemployers&apos; National Insurance contributions) or by these in combination; or VAT at a lower rate than that proposed could be combined with any or all of these measures. More information was needed about the effect of all these possibilities either singlyor in combination and about the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various courses open. Information was alsoneeded on the possibility of combining VAT with a special tax onluxuries; on the cost of providing adequate compensation for theincrease in the cost of living to those in receipt of social security benefits; and on the best means of preventing postponement of purchases in expectation of lower future rates of taxation.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate afurther memorandum providing the additional informationindicated by the Home Secretary in his summing up oftheir discussion.
