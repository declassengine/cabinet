CM 48 (70)SECRET0v,er.sea 1.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therecent disturbances in Poland, following the announcement of aPoland series of major price increases, had been on a considerable scale.The Polish authorities had had to use tanks and tear gas to dealwith the rioters; but, so far as we knew, they had not called onthe Soviet forces for assistance. As a result of the disturbancesthe First Secretary of the Polish Communist Party, Mr. Gomulka,had resigned his post and had been replaced by Mr. Gierek. Thelatter belonged to the more uncompromising and pro-Soviet wingII of the Polish Communist Party; but he had considerable working-class support, particularly among the miners. There had alsobeen a number of changes in the composition of the Politburo, themost important new member being Mr. Moczar, who had areputation for strong Polish nationalist views. It was likely thatthe new leadership would take a more pro-Soviet line and that theSoviet grip on Eastern Europe would in consequence be tightened.The changes in Poland might also strengthen the position of the leadership in the German Democratic Republic and encourage themin intransigence over Berlin. The implications for the federal german Republics Ostpolitik were more difficult to evaluate.German-Polish relations might suffer. On the other hand the SovietGovernment were known to be anxious to secure the ratification of the German-Polish treaty; and the new leaders in Poland were unlikely to oppose Soviet wishes.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statement  by  the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.SECRETVisit of the 2.   The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of his prime Minister tQ Ottawa and Washington, together with the Foreign andto Ottawa and .    , . 0Washington     Commonwealth Secretary, in the previous week.   His discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, had been relaxedand cordial. The Canadian Government had been gratified by thesupport which we had given them in their efforts to secure the releaseof the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner in Montreal, Mr. Cross,and by our refusal to bring any pressure to bear on them to accede to his kidnappers&apos; demands. But, though they were relieved by thesuccessful outcome of this episode, they were clearly disturbed by french Canadian extremist activities and their possible implications for the stability of Canada.SECRET128848-2 b*
In discussion on the forthcoming Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; Conference in Singapore and the problem of arms supplies for South Africa Mr. Trudeau had expressed the view that theCommonwealth association was worth preserving, although not atany price. He had conveyed to us the text of a draft declaration on the ideals and purposes of the Commonwealth, which had beengiven to his personal envoy in the African countries, Mr. Ivan Head,by Presidents Nyerere of Tanzania and Kaunda of Zambia, with therequest that the Canadian Government would transmit it to theBritish Government for consideration. The Prime Minister had undertaken that we would study this declaration sympathetically,provided that it was not an attempt, under the guise of a generaldeclaration of non-racial principles, to limit our freedom of actionon specific issues.As regards Europe, the Canadian Minister of External Affairs,Mr. Mitchell Sharp, had made it clear that the Canadian government accepted our policy of seeking entry into the European economic community, while reserving their freedom of action to take any measures which they regarded as necessary to safeguard their own interests.The subsequent discussions in Washington with the UnitedStates President, Mr. Nixon, and the United States Secretary ofState, Mr. Rogers, had covered a wide field. The President had expressed himself as strongly in favour of European political andeconomic integration and had indicated that the United states administration were prepared to accept the consequences for theirown trading interests which the latter might entail. He had made it clear, however, that some of the economic and agricultural policies of the European Economic Community might confront the UnitedStates with considerable problems; and he had emphasised theimportance for his Government of retaining the political support ofthe farming community in the United States. Nevertheless, he had indicated his support for liberal commercial and agricultural policies;and it seemed likely that legislation now before Congress aimed at restricting textile and other imports to the United States wouldnot be proceeded with.On defence and European security, it had been clear that therewas no question of early and substantial United States forcewithdrawals from Europe. But the President had expressedconsiderable misgivings about the Ostpolitik currently being pursued by the Federal German Chancellor, Herr Brandt. As regardsEast-West relations generally, the popular reports of a deterioration in United States-Soviet relations seemed to be unfounded. On theother hand, the United States Government were evidentlydetermined to watch Soviet actions very closely, to be ready to

But the United States Government were clearlyapprehensive that increased pressure on Israel might prove counter-productive. On Vietnam the President had been determined to pursue the policy of Vietnamisation and progressive withdrawal ofUnited States troops; and he had expressed considerable optimismabout the outcome.In the course of exchanges about the security of the indian ocean and arms sales to South Africa the President had indicated that he was impressed by the thoroughness of British studies of theproblems of the area; and he had made it clear that, if any BlackAfrican Governments were to seek United States assistance in orderto replace the British aid which they might lose if they left theCommonwealth, he would leave them in no doubt that it would be useless for them to turn to the United States in the expectation thatthe latter would take Britain&apos;s place. In discussion on South-east asia he had emphasised the necessity of maintaining a british military presence and had welcomed the defence arrangements whichwe were proposing to establish with the Governments of Australia,New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.In sum, the discussions had been extremely useful, not leastbecause they had showed that we could now discuss problems of mutual concern with the United States Government with completefrankness and should be able to bring our influence to bear while their ideas on policy were still at the formative stage.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Trime Minister.
General The Cabinet were given assessments of current industrial action by firemen and airport workers in furtherance of their pay disputes and were informed of current and prospective pay negotiations inthe Civil Service, the gas industry and the motor industry.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had that morning reviewed thecurrent situation and prospective pay negotiations in the public sector until mid-January; and the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had that afternoon reviewed the contingency plans fordealing with any extension of industrial action in the gas industry.In discussion it was emphasised that the extent to which employers in general succeeded in resisting inflationary wage settlements during the forthcoming round of private sector pay negotiations would be of critical importance for the Governmenfssuccess in reducing the general level of pay settlements. The recentsuccess in resisting industrial action in the electricity industry hadheartened many employers; but in the motor industry, wherebargaining procedures were unco-ordinated between the constituentelements, the employers&apos; resistance seemed likely to be weakenedas a result of the inadequate financial strength of the leading firms and their inability to withstand the costs imposed by strikes. If,however, these firms again made settlements at double or more thelevel of that which it was now hoped to achieve in the electricity industry and elsewhere in the public sector, the success of theGovernment^ policies could be quickly undermined. In thesecircumstances consideration should be given to all possible ways of strengthening the resolve of private employers and bringing theforce of public opinion to bear on them to resist inflationary awards.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thework already in progress to identify ways of strengthening the bargaining power of private sector employers and improvingco-ordination between them in the handling of wage negotiations should be pressed ahead. The Secretary of State for employment would be having further discussions with the Confederation ofBritish Industry and with the leading motor manufacturers; and he might find it helpful to associate the Chancellor of the Exchequerwith these exchanges. Additionally, and in consultation with theLord President of the Council, he should consider how public opinion might be mobilised in support of the Governmenfs own efforts in strengthening the resistance of employers in the private sector toinflationary wage settlements. The Cabinefs discussion of thepossible membership of the court of inquiry into the electricity paydispute suggested that there would be value in drawing up a panel of individuals who might be suitable for such appointments; and

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryShipbuilders    Qf state for Trade and Industry (CP(70)120) about Upper ClydeShipbuilders Limited (UCS).The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that his department had had reason to doubt in the autumn whether UCSwas solvent and in a position to carry on trading; and they had therefore asked the company for an early report on their financialposition. UCS had reported that there would be a deficiency onnet current assets throughout 1971 but that they would be operatingprofitably from next summer and in due course would return tosolvency. The Board of Directors had accordingly considered thatthey were justified in continuing to trade; but they had concluded that they would have difficulty in practice in trading beyond 1971unless there was an adjustment in the status of loans from public funds. This would have to take the form of subordination of these loans to other debts, conversion of part of the loans to an equityholding or writing off. He was bound to say, however, that he considered the forecasts made by UCS were optimistic and thatUCS would not continue to be commercially viable in its present form. He had accordingly considered whether, in the specialcircumstances of the company, he should continue to make available the usual credit guarantees for shipowners ordering ships from UCS.If he did so, the amount of guaranteed loans at risk would rise from about  14 million to about  25 million; and he had been advised that in some cases, if UCS failed to complete ships, the shipowners involved might default on their guaranteed loans andthe Government would then be liable. The Ministerial Committeeon Economic Policy had considered this situation in the previousweek and had agreed that he should inform the Board of UCSthat the Government did not feel able to continue offering creditguarantees in respect of ships ordered from UCS. The Committeehad also agreed that he should therefore try to persuade the UCSmanagement that the company did not have a future and to secure their agreement to an orderly rundown. It was important to avoid a sudden liquidation of the company not only because a largelabour force was involved (8,000 at present excluding Yarrow&apos;s)
in an area of high unemployment but also because Yarrow(Shipbuilders) Limited, which was an important supplier to theRoyal Navy, should, if at all possible, be extracted from the UCSconsortium before the latter faced liquidation. He had accordinglyseen the directors of UCS, who had said that they had thoughtthat they would be able to arrange a scheme under which shipownerswith ships on order from the company would agree to pay a higher price in order to secure completion at what would still be areasonable cost, given the increase in prices over the last year or so, and that such an arrangement could increase the company&apos;scash flow by about  3 million. He had undertaken to consider such a scheme; and he would be meeting the Board again on thefollowing day in order to ascertain whether they had in fact managed to make such an arrangement. If, as he expected, they were unable to produce a satisfactory scheme, he intended to tell themfirmly that they must work out arrangements for an orderlyrundown of the company. If, on the other hand, a scheme toproduce a sum of the order of an additional  3 million did appearfeasible, it would be difficult for the Government to refuse the usualcredit guarantees for the ships ordered from UCS. But even inthe latter circumstances the company should be ready to workout arrangements for some rundown of their labour force, includingthe closure of the Clydebank yard. He asked the Cabinet to agreethat he should have discretion to proceed as he thought best, butbroadly on the lines he had indicated, in the light of his further meeting with the Board of the UCS on the following day.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the gradualrundown and dismemberment of the UCS Group was unavoidableand the Government should no longer be prepared to finance its continuance. The Clydebank yard must close. There was, however,a risk that the Government would appear to be discriminating againstthe Clyde if there were a forced liquidation, particularly at a timewhen credit guarantees would continue to be freely available toother shipbuilding firms and the Government were about toprovide support for Harland and Wolff Limited and, possibly, for short Bros, and Harlands. Moreover, in view of the current high rate of unemployment in Scotland it was particularly important tophase any redundancies. He therefore hoped that it would bepossible to arrange an orderly rundown with the co-operation ofthe UCS Board and, if the additional  3 million were forthcoming,to phase the closure of Clydebank and the dismemberment of theGroup over the next year or so. This would enable the separation of Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Limited from the Group to be completed and would increase the likelihood that the Lower Clyde Group could take over part of the UCS facilities.
CM 48 (70)The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that support for the UCS Group should not becontinued. In the circumstances the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry should explore with the UCS Board on the following day any proposals which they might have for finding additionalcash from the shipowners. If there were a realistic possibility thatthe company could continue without further Government funds and provided that he was satisfied that they would close theClydebank yard and complete the separation of Yarrow(Shipbuilders) Limited as soon as practicable, he might have discretion, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Scotland, to agree, to the extent necessary, to credit guarantee proposals and to the subordinationof the existing loans. If, however, the Board&apos;s proposals providedno realistic basis on which the Group might continue trading, heshould seek to make the best possible arrangements with them forthe orderly rundown and dismemberment of the Group, whileavoiding any liquidation or announcement of immediate closuresuntil after the New Year. Once the position had been established,he should consider urgently, together with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, what should be said to the indian government about the outstanding order with which the overseas development Administration were concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tobe guided, in his further discussions with the Board ofUpper Clyde Shipbuilders Limited, by the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.Non-industrial civil ServiceManpowerPreviousReference:CM (70) 21stConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (70) 119) on Civil Service non-industrial manpower.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet had decided on22 September to aim to reduce the number of non-industrial civilservants below 500,000 by 1 April 1971 and to make further reductions thereafter. Reductions of just over 2,000 had been madein the forecast for staff in post on 1 April 1971 which now stood at 501,830. If Departments avoided further increases and madeadditional small economies, it should be possible to reduce the totalto less than 500,000 by 1 April 1971. He hoped and believed thatthis could be done without arbitrary action; but, if necessary, somedeferment of recruiting might have to be made in order to achieve the objective.
Current estimates indicated that the number of staff in poston 1 April 1972 would be over 515,000. Factors outside theGovernments immediate control, such as the growth of population,would tend to increase staff requirements; some of the policiesintroduced by the Government since they took office in June, such asincreased selectivity in social service benefits, had added at least 1,500to Civil Service manpower requirements in the period; and certainadditions to numbers, such as the transfer of 1,600 staff from localauthorities in the course of establishing the unified Courts Service,were inescapable. Moreover, the staff economies which would ultimately result from reducing and eliminating functions necessarilytook some time to achieve. Even so, a staff total amounting to515,000, although 1,500 less than had been forecast in September,could not be regarded as acceptable.In these circumstances it would, admittedly, be possible to insist that staff numbers should not exceed 500,000 at 1 April 1972 evenif this could be achieved only by arbitrary reductions. But toproceed in this way would be incompatible with the Governmenfsdetermination not to reduce numbers without at the same timecurtailing Departmental functions; and the impact on the Staff side would be unfavourable. It would be preferable to establish 510,000as the upper limit for 1 April 1972 and, without taking any arbitraryaction, to seek during 1971-72 to reduce numbers below this level,towards a figure of 500,000, by progressively eliminating functions.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet generally endorsed the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposals.There could be no question of exceeding the figure of 500,000 non-industrial civil servants in post at 1 April 1971; and arbitrary action would have to be taken at the margin, if necessary, in order to achieve this figure. Ministers should give all possible support to theLord Privy Seal, however, in order to avoid action of this kind.If staff numbers were to be restricted to 510,000 at themaximum at 1 April 1972 and, if possible, to be reduced still further to 500,000 by that date, radical action by way of reducing functions would be necessary. A start had already been made on this problem;and it was important that this impetus should be maintained andthat Ministers should not shrink from contemplating substantial and radical reductions in the functions and operations of their departments. Small increases in staff need not be precluded, solong as they were related to definite requirements of policy and wereoffset by large decreases. Provided that functions were reduced and arbitrary staff cuts were avoided, the efficiency of the CivilService should not be affected. It was important to ensure thatthe arrangements which had been introduced for better management
Cabinet Office,23 December, 1970.of the Civil Service, greater efficiency and mobility of staff, improvedtraining and better promotion prospects should be maintained whilereductions in staff numbers were being made.Presentation of the position in 1971-72 would require carefulconsideration; and the categorisation of industrial and non-industrial civil servants, together with the differentiation between permanent and temporary staffs, should be re-examined in order to eliminate,so far as possible, anomalies which were liable to be misrepresented.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided accordingly inhis consultations with Departmental Ministers and in thepreparation and presentation of staff estimates for1 April 1971 and for 1971-72.6. The Prime Minister, in wishing his colleagues a happyChristmas, thanked them for their loyal support and encouragementduring the new Governmenfs first six months of office.The Home Secretary said that the whole Cabinet, inreciprocating the Prime Minister^ good wishes for Christmas,would wish to thank him for his leadership and example during aperiod in which the Government, though faced with many difficult problems, had begun to convince public opinion that they were capable of facing them with courage and resolution.
