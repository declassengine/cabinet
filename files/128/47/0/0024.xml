SECRET*1. The Prime Minister said that the German and SwissGovernments had now agreed to our proposals for the exchange ofthe six remaining hostages against the seven prisoners in Europeanhands. The Israeli Ambassador had indicated that his Governmentwere unlikely to obstruct the release of Leila Khaled by attempting to secure her extradition to Israel, provided that her release wereto take place as part of an exchange involving the return of all theremaining hostages without discrimination. There were therefore no further obstacles, so far as our relations with other Governrnentswere concerned, to an exchange of Leila Khaled for the hostages.The Minister of State, Home Office, intended to receive arepresentative of the solicitors instructed by Leila Khaled&apos;s parentsin the course of the day. Since the interview was fixed for late inthe afternoon, it was unlikely that the solicitors would be able to institute Habeas Corpus proceedings if such was their intention until at least the following day. Meanwhile, we were ready toremove Leila Khaled from the country as soon as we receivedconfirmation that the six hostages had reached safety.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.The Defence Secretary said that it was now intended to send to Amman by air a field ambulance section with three extraambulances, a field surgical team and the light section of a fieldhospital. These units were already deployed in Cyprus and could being to move to Jordan at any time from the following day.Service personnel for the units would be volunteers, unarmed, andin civilian clothes. So long as the present tension persisted inAmman and Leila Khaled remained in British custody, there might be some risk in sending British Service personnel to Jordan;and it might be preferable not to proceed with the operation untilLeila Khaled&apos;s release had been publicly announced.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, despite the risks involved, HM Ambassador in Amman had argued strongly in favour of the immediate despatch of the medical units, not least because it was important that we should not appear to belagging behind the United States and French Governments, whosemedical units were already operating in Amman on a basis &quot;similarto that which we had in mind. On the other hand, the FrenchGovernment at any rate had no hostages at risk.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.      .,,SECRET121576 a 2
The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should discuss the matter further with the Defence Secretary; and it might also be helpful to ascertain the views of the International Committee of the red cross.  Meanwhile, a decision should be deferred.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Defence Secretary andof the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.PresidentNasserThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that PresidentNasser of the United Arab Republic (UAR) had died suddenly onthe previous day. A decision would have to be taken on BritishGovernment representation at his funeral, which would take placeon 1 October.In discussion it was suggested that in our relations with the uar we should now seek to look to the future rather than to pastdifferences. Moreover, the occasion of the funeral might affordvaluable opportunities for informal contacts with the representativesof other Governments in a neutral and restrained atmosphere,particularly if, as seemed possible, the Soviet Government were represented by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers,Mr. Kosygin. We should also have to take into consideration thelevel at which other Western Powers, for example, the United Statesand France, intended to be represented.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould give further consideration to the British Governmenfsrepresentation at President Nassefs funeral in consultation with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and in the light of the points made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.public expenditure(previous reference:CM (70) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposed reductions in expenditure set out in a situation report by Treasuryofficials which was annexed to a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP (70) 58).
Nationalised The CabinetIndustries(1) Invited the Minister of Transport to give consideration tothe possibility of selling Thos. Cook &amp; Son Ltd. to theprivate sector and to bring his proposals before the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.Industrial The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatReorganisation ^ Cabinet agreed that the Industrial Reorganisation corporation should be wound up; the details would require further consideration,but in the meantime no further commitments should be entered into.They noted that some of the  17 million which they had hoped would thereby be saved in 1971-72 might already have been committed.Officials should examine urgently the extent of such commitments and whether they were irrevocable.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the Industrial Reorganisation corporation should be wound up.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer (i) To arrange for officials to report on the extent of commitments and possible savings in respect ofexpenditure in 1971-72.(ii) To give further consideration to the steps necessaryto wind up the Industrial reorganisation corporation.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the Regional Employment Premium should be abolished in September 1974, and that this decision should be taken into account in considering the impact on regional policy of changes in investment incentives.The Cabinet-(5) Confirmed, subject to Conclusion 3 above, their endorsement of all the reductions proposed in Section B of the reportattached to CP (70) 58.RegionalEmploymentPremiumEducation The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that she had proposed reductions in expenditure on school meals of 24 million in 1971-72 and  40 million in 1974-75. She had established, following the earlier Cabinet discussions (CM (70) 17th
Conclusions, Minute 2, Conclusion 9), that this would not involvecharging more than cost price. She had reached agreement withthe Chief Secretary on the retention of school milk for infants.The Cabinet (6) Approved reductions in expenditure on school meals of 24 million in 1971-72 and  40 million in 1974-75; on school milk of  6 million in 1971-72 and  9 million in1974-75; and on further education of  3 million in1971-72 and  5 million in 1974-75.The Paymaster General said that since the public libraryservice had originated in 1850 the principle of free service had been maintained by successive Administrations and supported from timeto time by investigating committees. The introduction now of a charge would give rise to strong opposition in Parliament and outside and would be the more difficult to defend since it represented a volte face in Conservative policy. The revenue which might be collected would be small and would involve recruitment ofconsiderable additional staff by the public libraries. If theGovernment nevertheless considered that a charge should be imposed, it would be advisable first to make an enquiry into the usewhich was at present made of the libraries by different sections ofthe public; it would be preferable to drop the proposals for a chargealtogether but if a charge on reading must be introduced, theywould be better advised to consider imposing a purchase tax onbooks.The Cabinet-(7) Agreed that public library charges should not be introduced.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that there was agreementwith the Secretary of State for Social Services in the health and welfare bloc except on prescription charges. He had proposedthat charges for prescriptions should be limited to 25 per cent of their cost with exemptions for cases of financial hardship only.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he agreed in principle that prescription charges should be proportionate to costbut this was a major administrative change which would take sometime. For 1971-72 he proposed an increase in the flat rate charge to 4s. Od. with no reduction in the present range of exemptions. by making additional savings, however, on wigs and elastic hosiery, itwas possible to reduce expenditure by a further  1 million a year.While it might be possible in due course to limit exemptions to cases of financial hardship he would not be prepared to withdrawexemptions at this stage from children and the old.
social security:SpecificBenefitsThe Cabinet (8) Agreed the reductions shown, in the report attached to cp (70) 58, for 1971-72 and 1974-75 in expenditure onophthalmic services, dental services and welfare milk.(9) Agreed provisionally that expenditure on prescription charges should be reduced by  15 million in 1971-72 and 17 million in 1974-75: the possibility of making largerreductions in both years would be considered furtherwhen the proposals by the Social Services Secretary for additional expenditure on health and welfare were considered.The Cabinet (10) Approved the proposed reductions in expenditure shownagainst item C4 (i) and (ii) in the report attached to cp (70) 58.social security :UpratingThe Secretary of State for Social Services said that he was prepared to reduce the general uprating of social service benefits in 1971 to a level which would provide only for a cost of livingincrease plus 25 per cent of the difference between that and theincrease in average earnings; for 1973 he proposed cost of livingplus 60 per cent of the increase in earnings. This would save 75 million in 1971-72 and  210 million in 1974-75 over the;previous estimates. This would be less generous than the previous administration. It was, however, defensible as the coverage andthe benefits of occupational pension schemes were increasing.Moreover, some redeployment of the sums available for the upratingswould enable substantial improvements to be made for certainhard-hit groups, notably the disabled, the chronic sick and one-parent families. Anything less generous than he proposed could not be defended.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of their discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the.uprating of social security benefits should, subject to review in the light of the circumstancesat the time, be based in 1971 on the cost of living only and in 1973on the cost of living plus 60 per cent of the difference between that and the increase in earnings. These would not be revealed in.advance, but would be taken into account in the provision for contingencies and the overall totals in the public expenditure white paper. They also agreed that certain additional sums should bemade available for selective assistance to particular- groups for whichupratings on the basis agreed would provide inadequately.   The
provision to be made for this selective assistance should be discussed further between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Social Services. Other measures to help hard-hit groupswould be considered among the proposals for additional expenditure. The Cabinet had taken these decisions on the basis that unemployment and sickness benefit and pensions would receiveequal uprating, but they had noted that that point might require futher consideration, and that the Secretary of State for social services would be bringing forward proposals for changes in thenational insurance system shortly, at which stage it would also bepossible to review the present 20 per cent Exchequer contribution.Departmentof EmploymentandProductivityExport)PromotionArtsThe Cabinet-(11) Agreed that social security benefits should be uprated in1971 and 1973 on the basis indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.(12) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Social Services to give further considerationto the provision to be made for selective increases in benefits and the net reductions to be made in currentestimates of expenditure in 1971-72 and 1974-75 on thelines indicated in the summing up of the discussion.The Cabinet-(13) Approved the proposed reductions in expenditure shownagainst item C5 in the report attached to CP (70) 58.The Cabinet (14) Approved the proposed reduction in expenditure in 1974-75shown against item C6 (iii) in the report attached to cp (70) 58.The Cabinet-(15) Agreed that a charge should be made for admission to public museums and galleries.(16) Invited the Paymaster General, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to prepare the necessary arrangements for the introduction of this charge.Agricultural The Lord President of the Council said that the MinisterialSupport Committee on Agricultural Policy had concluded that, in view ofthe overriding need to make major public expenditure savings assoon as possible and of the Governmenfs firm political commitment to make an early start on changing existing methods of agricultural support, it was desirable to go ahead forthwith with the introduction
British RailCommuterServicesof interim import levy schemes covering cereals, beef, lamb anddairy products other than butter and cheese. Such a move would,however, provoke a hostile reaction from our main overseas suppliersand complex and difficult international negotiations would benecessary before the levy schemes could be implemented.In discussion, it was suggested that, provided the Governmentshowed itself to be determined to go ahead with its announced policy for changing agricultural support methods, it should be possible tobring the necessary international negotiations on the proposedinterim levy schemes to a satisfactory conclusion in time to allowsignificant Exchequer savings to be made in 1971-72. On the otherhand, it had to be borne in mind that both bilateral and multilateraldiscussions would have to take place, and past experience had shownthat such complex negotiations could well take at least a year or18 months to complete. The proposed interim levy schemes werein any case only a first step towards the Governmenfs objective ofrelieving the Exchequer by 1974-1975 of much of the cost ofagricultural support.The Cabinet-(17) Agreed that interim import levy schemes for cereals, beef,lamb and minor milk products should be introduced, as recommended in CP (70) 60.(18) Agreed that a reduction of  150 million in Exchequerexpenditure on agricultural support in 1974-75 shouldbe counted towards the target for public expendituresavings.The Minister of Transport said that the London area commuterservices of British Rail were currently making an annual loss of 15 million. He proposed that British Rail should be required tomake these services self-supporting by 1973. To do so would requiretotal fare increases of 30 per cent in real terms (and 45 per cent in money terms) over the next three years and further substantial increases thereafter to keep pace with increasing costs. increases on this scale would no doubt provoke considerable public opposition,but the only alternative was to continue to subsidise commuters inthe London area out of general taxation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Ministry of Transport and the Treasury were alreadycarrying out a review of British Raifs activities as a whole, whichmight show in due course that savings could be made on other partsof British Raifs operations, and that it was therefore less important
to insist that the London commuter services should be madeself-supporting. It was, however, difficult to justify to the public thetotal withdrawal of services from unviable lines in country areas,when London area commuter services were being so heavily subsided.(b) Increases in London commuter fares on the scale proposed would lead more commuters to attempt to use their cars to andfrom work. Such a switch to road transport would add to problemsof congestion and atmospheric pollution in the London area, andwould thus create additional social and economic costs. It wouldalso be necessary to consider the impact of higher fares on familyincomes.The Cabinet-(19) Agreed in principle that British Rail should be requiredto make its London area commuter services self-supporting by 1973 and that a saving of  15 million could accordingly be counted towards the target of reductions in public expenditure.(20) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to arrangefor the implications of higher fares in the London area tobe examined in the study of effects of public expenditurereductions on family incomes.(21) Invited the Minister of Transport and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to examine, and to report in due course to the Economic Policy Committee, what savings couldbe made on other parts of British RaiFs operations.Local Authority      In discussion of the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal to apply aManpower and SqUeeze through the rate support grant on local authority currentOther General    H      ...        .f .   , */\    *. .      AA...     ,  .Current expenditure, it was noted that this would be additional to theExpenditure    reductions in grant-aided expenditure to be secured by functibnalpolicy changes. There would be a temptation for local authorities tomeet the effects of the squeeze by cutting down their expenditureon school maintenance and equipment and on welfare services forthe old and handicapped, which would run counter to the government&apos;s general strategy, unless their co-operation was sought to avoid this. On the other hand, it was argued that, although localauthority expenditure had already been squeezed by the previous government, there should still be room for further savings in administrative costs, and it was right to subject local authorities to similar financial disciplines to those the Government was itselfimposing on central services.   The required economies amountedto only 0-6 per cent of total local authority expenditure, althoughmuch of this expenditure was mandatory and could not thereforebe reduced.
The Cabinet-(22) Endorsed the proposal at Section Dl of the report attachedto CP (70) 58 that public expenditure savings of 20 million in 1971-72 and  25- 30 million in 1974-75should be secured from local authority current expenditure by a general reduction in the rate support grant.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reached agreement with the Defence Secretary on the future level of defence expenditure. The White Paper on Public Expenditure 1968-69 to1973-74 (Cmnd. 4234) had not presented a true picture of the futurelevel of defence expenditure agreed by the previous Government.The actual level, contained in long-term costings prepared by theMinistry of Defence, was substantially larger. He had now agreed with the Defence Secretary that the following net reductions shouldbe made in defence expenditure after allowing for necessaryincreases, for example, to maintain our position East of Suez below the present long-term costings:  million1971-72   ........&apos;.1    &apos;L       201972-73   .........      ...       231973-74   ......      ... 641974-75   ............      132The Defence Secretary said that he agreed with considerablereluctance to these reductions, which would leave defence expenditure at a level which must involve some risks. his agreement, moreover, depended on certain decisions being taken on defence policy: he would be unwilling, for example, to contemplate any contribution to &quot; burden-sharing &quot; i.e., raising our contributionto total NATO expenditure from his reduced defence budget. TheDefence and Oversea Policy Committee would be meeting shortly to consider the relevant defence policy decisions. He would need to consider the public presentation of this reduction very carefullywith the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He intended to publish a defence White Paper shortly after the public expenditure and otherconnected decisions were announced on 27 October.The Cabinet-(23) Approved the net reductions in defence expenditure agreed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theDefence Secretary on the understanding that they mightbe subject to review in the light of decisions which would shortly be taken on defence policy.
The Cabinet then turned to consideration of the proposed increases in public expenditure which were set out in the report by treasury officials attached to a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(CP (70) 58).Agriculture The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales, the Minister of Agriculture and theMinister of State, Home Office (CP (70) 61), recommending certainimmediate increases in the level of agricultural support.The Minister of Agriculture said that since CP (70) 61 had been circulated, he had had an opportunity to discuss his proposals withthe Chief Secretary, who had accepted that in the light of the recentunprecedented rise in farm costs, and particularly in the prices of imported animal feeding stuffs, it was necessary to make someearly increases in guaranteed prices. But against the background of the public expenditure review, the Chief Secretary had asked that the proposals put forward in CP (70)61 should be modified soas to reduce the cost to the Exchequer. The Minister said that hehad accordingly agreed not to press for the proposed extension ofthe higher fertiliser subsidy and to scale down the proposed increasein the guaranteed prices for wheat and barley from Is. 6d. to Is. Od.a cwt. His modified proposals would add  54 million to farmers&apos;incomes in a full year. Their cost to the Exchequer in 1970-71would be  21 million, but even after allowing for this increase,Exchequer expenditure on agricultural support in the current year was likely to be some  70 million less than had been forecast at thetime of the 1970 Price Review, because unexpectedly high market prices for cereals and meat had greatly reduced the cost of deficiency round. If his colleagues agreed, he proposed to announce the increases in the following week.In discussion it was suggested that the public presentation ofthe increases in guaranteed prices proposed by the Minister ofAgriculture would need careful consideration. There was a risk that the impression might be created that the Government was beingunduly generous to the agricultural industry while at the same timeasking the rest of the community to accept major sacrifices in orderthat public expenditure might be reduced. It would also be necessaryto inform our overseas suppliers of the proposed increases before any public announcement was made.The Cabinet-(24) Agreed that the guaranteed prices of wheat and barleyshould be increased by Is. Od. per cwt.; and that, exceptfor the proposed extension of the higher fertilisersubsidy, the other increases in agricultural supportproposed in CP (70) 61 should be approved.proposed increases in expenditure
IndustrialAffairsIndustrialRelationsLegislation(previous reference :CM (70) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Employment and Productivity (CP (70) 63 and 65) aboutthe draft consultative document on the Governmenfs proposalsfor reforming the legal framework regulating industrial relations.The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity saidthat, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, he proposed to issue the consultative document without delay. His proposals for legislation were on lines agreed earlier by the Cabinet, and the draft had been thoroughly examined and agreed by the Ministerial Committee on industrial Relations, subject to the further consideration of one ortwo points. One was whether the criminal sanctions under the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 should be repealedor amended. Section 4 of the Act made it a criminal offence for agas, electricity or water industry employee wilfully to break hiscontract of service and deprive users of these supplies. It seemedno longer appropriate to single out these employees for such treatment and he proposed that this section should be repealed.Section 5 made it a criminal offence for anyone to break a contract of service or hiring when there was a known risk to human life,or valuable property, and so was more general in its application andmodern in its relevance: this section would be retained. Anotherpoint related to the nature of the proposals to be put forward onthe disclosure of information by employers. The draft consultative document said that employers would be required to disclose to their employees such information about the operations and activities oftheir undertakings as might be specified in regulations; but thatthe proposed Code of Industrial Relations Practice would guideemployers on the disclosure of information to trade union representatives with whom they negotiated. In framing therequirements he would aim to avoid putting employers under legal obligation to disclose more information than would be required ofthem, for instance, under company law.In discussion it was argued that the proposal to repeal the criminal sanctions contained in Section 4 of the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act might weaken the sense of duty felt by(25) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theMinister of Agriculture to consider further the public presentation of this increase in agricultural support.
public utility employees to the public and increase the risk that paydisputes in these industries would lead to strikes. On the other hand it was argued that industrial action in other industries could threatenequal danger to the public and to property, and that the repeal ofSection 4 would emphasise the significance and wider relevance ofSection 5 which would remain.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the consultative document should be issuedwithout delay. The Secretary of State for Employment and productivity should, however, reconsider the references to the intended repeal of Section 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection ofProperty Act 1875 in the light of the concern expressed about theirpossible impact on workers in the three public utilities involved.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity to reconsider references in the draftconsultative document to the Conspiracy and Protectionof Property Act 1875.(2) Subject to 1 approved the draft consultative documentannexed to CP (70) 63.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29 September, 1970.
