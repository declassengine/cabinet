secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at8.15 a.m. on 5 October, three armed men had entered the private house of the United Kingdom Senior Trade Commissioner in montreal, Mr. Cross, and abducted him. They had said that theywere members of the Front de Liberation Quebecois (FLQ), an extreme Left-wing separatist group. Subsequently the FLQ had issued a statement, demanding, as the price of Mr. Cross&apos;s returnthat:(i) 18 FLQ prisoners should be set free and 3 FLQ membersat present remanded on bail should be released;(ii) no police action should be taken in connection with thekidnapping;(iii) a FLQ political manifesto should be published in theprincipal newspapers of Quebec and should also be readout over the radio and television by the political prisoners;(iv) the prisoners, accompanied, if they so wished, by their families, their legal advisers and representatives of thePress should be flown to Cuba or Algeria;(v) certain workers dismissed for &quot; revolutionary activities&quot;should be reinstated;(vi) the name and photograph of an informer who was alleged to have recently betrayed a FLQ cell should be published;(vii) they should be paid 500,000 dollars in gold.The kidnappers had declared that these terms would have to beaccepted within 48 hours of the issue of the statement, i.e., by the afternoon of 7 October; and that, meanwhile, Mr. Cross&apos;s life would depend on the goodwill displayed by the authorities in complying with the FLQ&apos;s demands.Mr. Cross&apos;s present whereabouts were unknown; but he had probably been taken to some hiding place in Montreal. Theexorbitant nature of the demands suggested that the kidnappingmight have been carried out by wholly irresponsible elements, who might not in fact bring themselves to fulfil their threats. On theother hand the FLQ had a reputation for violence; and the possibilitycould not be disregarded that Mr. Cross&apos;s life might be in serious danger. The United Kingdom High Commission in Ottawa and itssubordinate posts were taking special precautions to protect the staff;and HM Representatives in other countries had already been instructed, some time ago, to review their security arrangements inthe light of previous incidents. The Canadian Government had been
Situation inthe middle east(previous reference:CM (70) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)informed that we did not feel that we could press them to accede tothe FLQ&apos;s demands in view of their nature. We considered that theresponsibility for dealing with the affair and securing the return ofMr. Cross rested with the Canadian Government who had accepted this. We should now have to await developments; but when this incident was over, we should have to consider whether we should follow the United States example and announce publicly that in any future cases of this kind we would not be prepared, even in theinterests of saving human life, to bring pressure to bear on otherGovernments to accept unconditionally demands which might bemade on them by kidnappers abducting British officials or private individuals residing in their countries.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet approved the line taken by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary. So far as guidance to the Press and other informationmedia was concerned, we should adhere to the line already taken byofficial spokesmen, i.e., that responsibility for dealing with the affairrested with the Canadian Government, who had accepted this position. In doing so, however, we should be careful to avoid creating any impression that we were treating this incident any lessseriously than the recent seizure of British hostages by the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary might consider whether he should make some reference to the episode in the speech which he would be making at the Conservative Party Conference on 7 October; anduntil he returned from the Conference the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should remain in London in order to keep in close touch with any developments in Canada.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that AnwarSadat had now been nominated as the official candidate for the presidency of the United Arab Republic (UAR). The problem ofthe succession to President Nasser had clearly faced the Soviet union with a dilemma; and it was perhaps significant that the delegationrepresenting the Soviet Government at President Nasser&apos;s funeralhad remained in Cairo for eight days. The Soviet Union now hada very large stake in the UAR, which they must presumably have wished to safeguard by securing the nomination of a Sovietsympathiser to the Presidency. On the other hand they must havefeared the reaction which was likely to ensue if Soviet influencebecame too blatant; and they had probably acquiesced, therefore,in the nomination of a moderate candidate.
IndustrialAffairsLocalAuthorityManualWorkers&apos;Dispute(previous reference:CM (70) 26thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that, in the dispute over the pay of local authority manual workers, the trade unions were clearly anxious to reach a settlement and that a small advance on the terms of the employers&apos; last offer would be sufficient to achieve it. Nevertheless, he would strongly recommend against any encouragement to the local authorities toimprove upon their pay offer, even though, if no such improvementwere made, the strike was likely to continue for some time.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies, meeting on 5 October, had concluded that there wasno reason to change the Governmenfs existing policy of readiness to provide Servicemen if necessary to maintain essential services,where there was a hazard to public health. The procedure whichthe Committee had agreed for dealing with any demand for specialGovernment assistance to maintain an essential service was that thelocal authority in question should first be made to try to carry out its own responsibilities by any means open to it; if it could not doso, the Government would ask the trade unions concerned at national level to restore their local members&apos; co-operation, before authorising the use of Servicemen. The employment of the Armed Forces wouldhave to be a last resort, since it would be liable to provoke a generalwithdrawal of local authority manual labour and Servicemen couldnot be expected to maintain all the services essential to public health in all local authorities.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,although sewage pumping operations were being maintained andflooding was being avoided, the other processes of sewage treatmentcould not all be carried out without the experienced manualworkforce. As a result, crude or partly-treated sewage was beingdischarged into some rivers. He had instructed the river authoritiesto take daily samples of the quality of river water; but so far there appeared to be no threat to the water supply and in most parts ofDuring his visit to Cairo he had been told by the UAR ForeignMinister, Mahmoud Riad, that morale in the Egyptian Army wasvery low and that the increase in Soviet missiles in the Canal zone in violation of the cease-fire agreement had been necessary in orderto avoid a complete collapse.The Cabinet-(2) Took   note   of  the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.
the country there were alternative sources of water which could, ifnecessary, meet the situation resulting from some further pollutionof rivers for a time. There was, however, the possibility that aprivate prosecution might be instituted, for example by an anglingsociety, against a local authority which was allowing sewage to damage the quality of a river, even though there was no danger to public health.In discussion it was argued that there was strong public support for the use of the Armed Forces to maintain essential local authority services, and that, if there was such an intervention in one or two areas, the trade unions would not necessarily react by withdrawingall co-operation everywhere. The Services might not be able to substitute for the strikers in all places; but volunteers would come forward from the public at large in numbers sufficient to meetessential requirements. On the other hand it was argued that, if the armed Forces were used to help avoid &quot;river pollution, there mightnot be enough Servicemen or volunteers with the right skills to dealwith other dangers to public health.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to keep the situation underreview.public expenditure(previous reference:CM (70) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)GeneralEmploymentServicesSECRET*3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of public expenditure and had before them a memorandum on the generalsituation by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP (70) 68); memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on investment incentives(CP (70) 71 and 66); and a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (CP (70) 69) on the rate support grant.The Prime Minister said that the Governmenfs decisions whichwere being taken on public expenditure would be reported toParliament when the latter reassembled after the Recess. Meanwhiletheir decisions must remain confidential and should not, of course,be disclosed at the forthcoming Conservative Party Conference.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ statement.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, reported that he had reached agreement with the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity on additional expenditure of  6 million spread over three years on Government training centres.
EducationInvestmentIncentives(previous reference:CM (70) 25thConclusions,Minute 3)Withdrawal of grants fromthe ShippingIndustryThe Cabinet (2) Agreed that expenditure on Government training centresover the period 1972-73 to 1974-75 should be increasedby a total of  6 million.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, reported that he had reached agreement with the Secretary of State for Education that theprogramme of school starts in England and Wales in 1972-73should be  186 million. This included an additional  19-5 millionnow agreed for improvements. This new addition, together with acorresponding additional  2 million agreed in respect of starts inScotland, would result in additional public expenditure of  28 million in all over the four years 1971-72 to 1974-75. They had further agreed that the school-building programme for 1972-73 was not tobe taken as setting a standard for 1973-74: the size of the improvements starts programme in 1973-74 would have to bedetermined nearer the time in the light of the circumstances prevailing then.The Cabinet (3) Agreed additional expenditure of  28 million on the school-building programme in Great Britain spread over thefour years 1971-72 to 1974-75.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet had invited him to reconsider certain points arising from his original proposals in CP (70) 66. It had been suggested that the transitional period for the withdrawal of investment grants from shipping mightcover three years from the date of announcement rather than two.This would, however, reduce the total savings by  40 million in1973-74 and  20 million in 1974-75. It might not be easy to justifythis in comparison with some of the other savings that had beenmade, for instance on the social services. It would also make it moredifficult to justify a one-year cut-off period for grants to manufacturing industry, which also had contracts for large long-termprojects.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that the shipping industry was in a special position. It had to compete with companies which were not taxed in the countries in which they registered, manyof which were tax havens. Moreover, it was suggested that theindustry had been given specific assurances before the generalelection that ships which were ordered before investment grants were abolished would receive their full entitlement to grant and that orders had been placed and charters accepted on that basis. With a two-year cut-off period the industry would lose some  80 million in
investment incentives GeneralTransitionalArrangementsgrants on ships already ordered, and even with a three-year periodthey would lose some  20 million. It was also possible thatassurances had been given that investment grants would be replaced by investment allowances as the Committee of Inquiry into Shipping(the Rochdale Committee) had recommended. This latter system had worked well previously and would enable the growth of our shipping industry to continue, while to replace investment grants byfree depreciation alone would lead to its decline.On the other hand it was argued that the shipping industry would, under the proposals in CP (70) 66, in any event be doingbetter than manufacturing industry both in respect of the transitional period and of free depreciation generally. These, together with the continuation of the home credit scheme, would meet the commitment in the Manifesto to continue special assistance for shipping. Theshipping industry was enjoying a boom period with high profits, butthe accrued losses of many of the firms were such that they wouldbe unable to take advantage of investment allowances; they alreadycould not take full advantage of free depreciation. On a realisticbasis the cost of investment allowances would be some  10 million in1972-73 and  20 million a year thereafter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that beforethe Cabinet could reach a decision they would need to knowprecisely what assurances, if any, had been given to the shipping industry about transitional arrangements for investment grants and about the system of tax allowances thereafter. The Chancellor of theExchequer should then consider whether his proposals requiredamendment in the light of any assurances which had been given.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to establish, in consultation with the Home Secretary,what assurances, if any, had been given before theelection on the points referred to by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of the discussion;(ii) to bring his proposals, revised if necessary, beforethe Cabinet for further consideration in the week beginning 12 October.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had been suggestedthat the proposed transitional arrangements should be reconsideredwith a view to providing that grants should be withdrawn from thedate of the announcement except where contracts had been enteredinto before that date. This idea had considerable attractions.However, unless the arrangement included a cut-off period of oneyear it could well prove more costly than the year&apos;s warningproposed in CP (70) 66. Moreover, he was now convinced that there
investment incentives RegionalDifferentialwould be very serious difficulties in administering a system of the sort proposed. The savings would be comparatively small. Acertain amount of forestalling which might be undertaken under theproposed system of paying grant on all expenditure incurred duringthe 12-month period of notice, might be prevented; however, after allowing for the tax allowances which would accrue on the investment if it were undertaken later, the additional cost arisingfrom such forestalling would be small. In the circumstances, he recommonded the Cabinet to agree that investment grants would bepaid in respect of expenditure incurred during the 12 monthsfollowing the announcement of the abolition of the system, but noton any expenditure incurred thereafter.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that investment grants should be paid in respect ofqualifying expenditure incurred until one year after theannouncement of the abolition of the grant system.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had been suggestedthat the form of the proposed regional differential should be altered by restricting free depreciation to manufacturing industry instead of extending it also to the service sector and by using the resultantExchequer savings to increase grants and loans under the local employment Acts (LEA) and expenditure on infrastructure in thedevelopment areas. The total cash flow to the development areas would, in either event, remain broadly the same as at present. while this alternative proposal would reduce the drop in the incentive to manufacturing industry to move into the development areas, it would adversely affect the construction industry, and further consideration might have to be given to ways of helping the latter.In discussion doubt was expressed about the proposed retentionof an element of discrimination between the manufacturing and service sectors in the development areas. It was, however, pointedout that service industries would benefit from the elimination of discrimination on a national basis, including in due course theabolition of the Selective Employment Tax. It was in line with thegeneral policy of selectivity to provide additional aid in thedevelopment areas to assist incoming manufacturing industry which made a real contribution to employment. Moreover, the Governmentwere committed to increasing use of the LEAs, to developments intraining and retraining, and to improvement of the infrastructure ofthe development areas all of which could be advanced with the savings made by withholding free depreciation from the servicesector. It was clear that good use could be made of the funds whichwould be made available. It was suggested, however, that it wouldSECRET121614 b
investment incentives Level and useof ProspectiveSavingsbe preferable to pay a percentage grant on the plant and machinerycosts of projects qualifying for LEA building grants, subject to a limit on the cost per job provided, rather than to increase the rateof building grant particularly in view of the proposal to maintainthe 40 per cent rate of initial allowances for new industrial buildings and structures in the development areas.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that free depreciation in the development areas should be limited to manufacturing industry, subject to furtherconsideration of the possibility of extending it to immobile plant ofthe construction industry. The net saving made in this way after allowing for any extension to the construction industry should beused to increase spending on loans and grants under the LEA, on training and retraining, and on infrastructure in the development areas. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment should consider how these funds might best be used.The Cabinet (6) Agreed subject to (7) (i) below, that free depreciation shouldbe extended only to manufacturing industry in thedevelopment areas.(7) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor  of the Exchequer,  to  arrange for the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment (i) to decide whether  free depreciation should  beextended to immobile plant of the construction industry in development areas;(ii) to decide how the net saving achieved could best be deployed on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of the discussion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had undertaken toconsider whether the prospective net savings from the change froma system of investment grants to allowances could with advantage be increased, so providing greater scope for reductions in direct, andparticularly in personal, taxation. But with company liquidity tightand profit levels low, failure to return most of the savings from theabolition of investment grants to the company sector would risk afurther damaging reduction in the rate of industrial investment. his proposals in CP (70) 66 were however fully consistent with the government&apos;s declared belief that adequate profit levels would bethe most effective stimulus to higher investment: they would providetax-related investment incentives, and allow some adjustment in thelevel of corporation tax, at a significantly lower net cost to theExchequer than the present cost of investment grants.   He had
examined the possibility of setting the new rate of depreciationallowances at 55 per cent instead of 60 per cent for the first year, butthis would give little extra saving. To reduce it below 55 per cent would leave industry as a whole worse off than at any time in theprevious 20 years. Even under his proposals the benefit to manufacturing companies would inevitably be less than they had atpresent.In discussion, it was argued on the one hand that the effect of withdrawing investment grants without replacement by tax-relatedallowances which provided broadly the same level of financialincentive to investment would be to raise industry&apos;s net tax burden;however, instead of raising initial allowances, which could be described as tax-free loans of uncertain value and reducingcorporation tax, it would be preferable to provide investmentallowances on the lines made available by the previous conservative administration. Property companies would derive greater benefit from the Chancellors present proposals than capital intensivemanufacturing companies.It was suggested, on the other hand, that if investmentallowances were introduced instead of raising initial allowances,there would be an extra cost to the Exchequer of the order of 100 million a year in development areas alone, which wouldeliminate virtually the whole of the prospective savings in CP (70) 66.Even if initial allowances were reduced there would be some additional cost, and companies which did not qualify for investmentallowances would be worse off. Investment allowances amountedto a subsidy to investment and were open to criticism on other grounds. Moreover, it remained questionable whether heavy public expenditure on investment incentives was an effective means ofsecuring higher levels of profitable investment.In further discussion, there was a wide measure of agreement that reductions in corporation tax were unlikely to encourage aclimate favourable to higher investment as effectively as reductions in personal taxation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet were concerned both with the balance between public expenditure savings in respect of industry on the one hand, and thesocial services on the other, and with the desirability of securinggreater scope for reducing direct, and particularly personal, taxation.There was still room for doubting the cost-effectiveness of investment incentives and the need to return to industry broadly the same sumsas would be saved from abolishing investment grants. It was however the general view that reductions in personal taxation offered the greatest promise of restoring dynamism to the economy.  He
Rate support grant(previous reference:CM (70) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)would arrange for these issues to be further considered by theMinisters most closely concerned during the early part of thefollowing week, before the Cabinet completed their discussions on public expenditure.The Cabinet (8) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said he wouldbe bringing firm proposals for the forthcoming statutory negotiationswith local authorities on the rate support grant before the cabinet at the end of October. Meanwhile he invited his colleagues to note the preliminary estimates of the level of local authority expenditure for the next two years; to agree that the element in the rate support grant in respect of relief on the poundage rate payable by domestic rate payers should be increased from its present level of Is. 8d. (or8-3 p) to 9^p in 1971-72 and lOp in 1972-73; to agree that the grantpercentage should not be increased beyond the nearest quarterpercentage step sufficient to cover these increments in the domesticelement; and to agree that Increase Orders should be made in respectof 1969-70 and 1970-71 on account of the increased levels of prices,costs and remuneration since November 1969.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that,that, although it might be necessary in this instance for the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to make Increase Orders as he proposed, their timing would need to be further discussed in relationto the current dispute over the pay of local authority manual workers.The Cabinet would also wish to consider further whether it was right to maintain arrangements whereby, after settling the rate support grant on the basis of the levels of prices, costs and pay thencurrent, subsequent increases in those levels were accepted insubstantial part by the Exchequer through the making of IncreaseOrders. This arrangement could be criticised as reducing the pressures on local authorities to keep pay and other cost increases to the minimum.The Cabinet (9) Noted   theof   local  authoritypreliminary   estimatesexpenditure for the next two years.(10) Approved recommendations (ii) and (iii) in paragraph 21of CP (70) 69.(11) Agreed to resume their discussion of recommendation (iv)at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7 October, 1970.
