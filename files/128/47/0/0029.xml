IndustrialAffairsLocal AuthorityManualWorkers&apos;Dispute(previous reference:CM (70) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)CM 29 (70)confidential. The Home Secretary said that, together with the Ministerof Housing and Local Government, he had met representatives ofthe local authority employers on the previous day and had given them an assurance that, provided that the local authorities dideverything in their power to mitigate any damage resulting from thestrike of their manual workers in some areas, the Government wouldprotect their ratepayers against the financial consequences of anylitigation brought as a result of the interruption of essential servicescaused by their standing firm in the dispute. If the local authorities,after making every effort, could not maintain services essential to public health, including the water supply, and if the trade unionsrefused to co-operate in this task, the Government were ready toprovide assistance.They had later met representatives of the manual workers&apos; tradeunions and had given them the same information. Both groups hadreceived it equably.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theemployers&apos; representatives had said that they had it in mind to propose an independent inquiry into the long-term pay structure ofthe manual workers and, perhaps, some improvement of their current pay offer. Together with the Home Secretary, he had tried to discourage them on both counts. From Press reports, however, itappeared that they had decided in the event to publish the 14J percent offer, already informally suggested to the trade unions beforethe strike began, and to put this to the unions formally on16 October. It was unfortunate that the support for the manual workers&apos; case in that day&apos;s Daily Mirror, together with a general impression that the resistance of the local authorities was weakening,would probably encourage the unions to reject the new offer.In preparation for a continuation of the strike, he was makingplans for the possible use of Servicemen at a number of places wherethere would be the greatest risk to water supply if sewage effluentwas unsatisfactory. It would be difficult, however, to maintain thestandard of services by using Servicemen at sewage works unlessthe supervisory staff continued to co-operate. The possibility of arranging special training for Servicemen, in order to enable themto carry out a wider range of functions at sewage works, wastherefore being studied. A reassessment of the numbers of men andskills which might be required from the Armed Forces was beingmade; but it was not expected to show the need for greater numbersthan had already been given to the Ministry of Defence.
The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the local authority employers shouldcontinue to be urged to avoid increasing their current pay offer. an appropriate occasion should be taken before 16 October for afurther declaration by a senior Government Minister thatunreasonable pay awards, such as that claimed by the local authority manual workers, could inflict serious damage on the national economy and must be strongly resisted. Officials should carry out a study of all possible means of ensuring that public sector bodies which conceded an unreasonable pay increase should not be able topass on any part of the excess costs to the Exchequer, as localauthorities were in practice now able to do under the rate support grant arrangements.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to arrange for officials to examine possible means of ensuring that public sector bodies themselves bore the excess costs ofany unjustifiable pay increase which they granted; andto make recommendations.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council to consider how a further public declaration could best be arrangedbefore 16 October of the Governmenfs attitude onunreasonable pay claims, such as those of the localauthority manual workers.housing finance(previous reference:CM (70) 25thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government on housing finance (CP (70) 64) andon rent allowances for private tenants (CP (70) 75).The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that some system of financial help for poorer private tenants was an essential part of the strategy which had been outlined in his memorandum cp (70) 64 and was designed to achieve a saving in public expenditure of over  200 million in 1975-76. Unlessfinancial help were given to such tenants, it would be necessary tophase the progression to fair rents over a period of several years;and this would remove most of the incentives which his proposals were meant to offer to landlords to repair and improve older houses and so to conserve the housing stock. His proposals for moving towards a fair rent basis were more far-reaching than any putforward by previous Conservative Governments and were bound to
be unpopular with certain sections of the community. The provisionof help for poorer private tenants, however, would make them moredefensible because they would then be seen to be socially just.Moreover, the Conservative Party were pledged to ensure thattenants, whether of private property or of council houses, receivedfair treatment. The cost of establishing a system of rent rebates for private tenants had already been allowed for in calculating the savings to be expected from his new housing policy; and no further expenditure was therefore involved. Indeed, the figure of 25 million in paragraph 19 of CP (70) 75 assumed a take-up of80 per cent, which was higher than was likely to be realised. Therebate scheme would best be administered by local authorities, whowould apply the same tests as they applied to tenants of their council houses and would meet a significant part of the cost. On this basis the administrative cost of the scheme should not be great.In discussion it was suggested that to introduce rent rebatesfor private tenants would be to introduce a new form of subsidywhich might delay the establishment of a free market in housing.But the general view was that such rebates were an essential element in the new scheme of housing finance and were also not inconsistent with the Governmenfs political principles. Moreover, they wouldmake it possible to move faster on to a basis of fair rents, so helping to preserve older houses as well as preventing hardship. In the conurbations complete decontrol of rents would be out of thequestion for many years to come; but where there was no scarcity of accommodation fair rents should be equivalent to market rents.Moreover, unless help were provided for poorer private tenants, theincrease in rents would bring the Government under heavy pressure to build more council houses to accommodate those who could not afford fair rents. Conversely, the introduction of rebates might make it unnecessary to build as many council houses as had been allowed for in the estimates of future expenditure; and the saving on this account might be even larger than had so far been predicted.In Scotland privately-owned rented houses were few in number and dated mainly from the period 1880 to 1910. It would be difficultto establish a system of fair rents for council houses on so narrowa base; and at present it seemed that the best way of introducing a change of policy in parallel with that proposed for England andWales might be to base rents on true historic costs. But the matter was being further considered by the Departments concerned.Entrusting the administration of the scheme to local authorities had the practical advantage that the arrangements could then be operated through the same machinery as was used for giving rebates
to council tenants; and the experience of Birmingham suggested thaton this basis the additional administrative cost should becomparatively small. Local authorities would have a sufficientfinancial stake in the success of the scheme to ensure responsibleadministration; and there would be safeguards against abuse bytenants living in expensive accommodation.In further discussion the Cabinet considered whether anannouncement of the Governmenfs intentions should be made before the publication of the forthcoming White Paper on public expenditure. This would have the advantage of providing a background to the reduction in expenditure on housing which theWhite Paper would disclose. But legislation would not be practicable before the following Session; and it must be expectedthat in the meantime opposition to the scheme would become increasingly vocal. The balance of advantage therefore required further consideration. But it was clear that it would be unwise tomake any statement before the scheme had been worked out indetail and on a defensible basis; and the Housing Ministers should therefore bring their proposals before the appropriate CabinetCommittee as soon as possible.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in CP (70) 75. Both the timing andthe form of the announcement of the Governmenfs intentions,however, required further consideration; the Government were taking a major initiative and it must be presented accordingly. Astatement of general principles alone would be a mistake; any statement must be comprehensive and the Government must be ina position to deal with any criticisms which might be expressed. TheHousing Ministers should therefore bring their proposals before theHome Affairs Committee as soon as possible.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal in CP (70) 75.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales, to bring detailed proposals before the HomeAffairs Committee as rapidly as possible.PublicExpenditureGeneral(previous reference:CM (70) 27thConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET*3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP (70) 81) covering two tables summarising theresults of the review of public expenditure.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the tables showed the outcome of the public expenditure review in the form in which they!
would be published. The basis from which they started allowed fora number of policy decisions taken by the previous Government andfor the re-costing of existing programmes since the publication of cmnd. 4234. This enabled reductions to be shown in respect of thedecisions not to provide further funds for the 1958-59, not to nationalisethe Ports and to reduce defence expenditure below the long-termcostings. Allowance was also made for certain decisions taken inJuly, for instance on pensions for the very old and widows. In viewof the uncertainties about the precise savings likely to be obtained and the need for consultations with other countries on agriculturallevies and with the local authorities on housing, these twoprogrammes had been grouped in an unallocated block with theexisting contingency reserve. While the total savings for 1971-72was still small, that for 1974-75 was more satisfactory. Overall, theaverage rate of growth of public expenditure would be reduced from about 3 - 7 per cent per annum to 1 - 8 per cent if investment grantswere included in the totals for the period before abolition, and2-7 per cent if they were excluded. The balance of the package asshown in column (c) of table 2 was also satisfactory; but it shouldbe appreciated that the substantial reduction in the level of theupratings of social security benefits in 1971 and 1973 was taken intoaccount in the unallocated reserve and was not shown as a cut in social services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following thediscussion in Cabinet on 6 October, his proposals in respect of investment incentives had been considered by a small group of theMinisters most closely concerned. While certain details remained to be fully worked out, agreement had been reached on a schemewhich would meet the Governmenfs commitments and wouldinvolve a net saving to the Exchequer in 1972-73, 1973-74 and1974-75 of some  100 million a year.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The figure of  360 million savings in 1974-75 in respect of housing, agriculture and adjustments to the contingency reserve,including the reduced level of the 1973 uprating, seemed low.(b) Since cuts had not in fact been made in expenditureon environmental services, it would be helpful if the name of that programme group were changed. On the other hand, it would bedifficult to change the established title of one group alone; and itmight be preferable to make clear in the White Paper the nature ofthe reductions involved.
legislative programme(previous reference:CM (70) 26thConclusions,Minute 3,Conclusion 4)InvestmentProgrammesof the Ministryof TechnologyNationalisedIndustries(previous reference:CM (70) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2,Conclusion 3)(c) The net reductions in 1971-72 amounted to well under 300 million; but they appeared larger because of the substantialadjustment of  73 million. This, however, had been calculated onthe established basis.(d) It would be appropriate to consider at a later stage whethera full public expenditure White Paper in the established form shouldbe published early in the New Year.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to give furtherconsideration to the estimate of an unallocated reductionof expenditure of  360 million in 1974-75, including the savings on housing, agriculture, and the uprating of social security benefits.The Lord President said that he had been giving considerationto the legislative implications of the public expenditure review as awhole. It would not be possible to pass through all their stages byChristmas certain Bills which he had been informed would be needed by then if the full savings estimated for 1971-72 were to be obtained.The Ministers concerned should therefore consider whether thesesavings could still be obtained if the Bills were not passed untilrather later or whether the estimated savings for 1971-72 shouldbe reduced.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statement by the Lord President.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP (70) 73) covering a report by officials on reductions in the investment programmes ofthe nationalised industries for which the Minister of Technology was responsible.The Minister Of Technology said that, following the cabinet discussion on 28 September, he had arranged, together with theChief Secretary, Treasury, for officials to make recommendations fora reduction of  50 million in 1974-75 in the investment programmes of the nationalised industries for which he was responsible.Agreement had been reached on reductions in investment by the gasand electricity industries rising to  50 million in 1974-75. Theseassumed, however, that the winter plant margin of the electricity industry could be reduced to 17 per cent. The implications of this were being considered in fuller detail; and he must reserve the rightto reopen the question, if necessary, at a later date. The agreed
The impact ofthe PublicExpendituremeasures onfamilies andIhe timing of measures to help the poorerfamilies(previous reference:CM (70) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)programmes for the industries make no provision for an increasebeyond  185 million a year in investment by the British steel corporation. He might later need to bring forward proposals forincreased investment in steel plant for consideration by the Cabinetin relation to other claims on the contingency reserve.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Technology.(5) Endorsed the proposals for reductions in investment in the gas and electricity industries set out in CP (70) 73.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP (70) 76), summarising the impact of the public expenditure measures on families, together with a memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP (70) 78) about the timing of measures tohelp the poorer families.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the poorest familieswould remain exempt from the increased social service charges orentitled to have them refunded and would continue to enjoy welfare milk. Many of these families would also be better off when the family Income Supplement (FIS) was introduced in the summer of1971; none of them would be worse off in the interval. Around the 20- 24 a week wage level (according to the size of family) therewas a narrow band of families who, under the existing arrangements,would neither be exempt from the new charges nor pay a large amount of tax and so gain from any tax reductions. To them theadditional cost, which might on average amount to some 12s-13s.a week, might represent a real additional burden; but specificmitigation measures had been directed to this category of families and the raising of the present remission limits would mean that many would on balance be better off than at present. Above this group the increased cost would represent a progressively smallerpercentage of incomes; and those concerned would benefit from anyreductions in direct taxation. The changes in the method ofagricultural support when they came into effect at earliest in theautumn of 1971, might increase the cost of living by about 0-4 percent. By then, however, FIS should be in force; and it was proposed that its scope and scale should be enlarged to counter the impact of the increase in food prices. The increases in costs due tothe change in housing policy would not start until 1972-73; and by then householders should have the benefit of tax reductions and rising real incomes. Moreover, any real hardship should be met bythe proposed rebate scheme. The higher fares for London area rail
commuter services could bear quite heavily on some lower paidtravellers; but there was no fair or practicable way of mitigating the impact on them.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that officials had given further consideration to the timing of the increase in charges in the social services in relation to the introduction of the FIS.Under the existing remission arrangements families at presentexempt from paying charges would be unaffected by the proposed increases (always provided that they took up their existingentitlements); and these exemptions already covered family incomeswell in excess of the maximum admissible for families of comparablesize under the FIS scheme. In the circumstances, he would not wishto propose that the implementation of the charges increases shouldbe delayed until the FIS came into effect in August 1971, especially since a postponement would reduce the savings from the changesby at least  25-6 million. He was, however, proposing a campaign to publicise the extent of the available exemptions and remissions inthe hope of increasing the proportion of those eligible who tookadvantage of them.The Cabinet (6) Took note, with approval, of the statements by the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Secretary of State for social services.(7) Agreed that the increases in charges for social services should not be delayed until the Family income supplement scheme came into effect.Steel Prices(previous reference:CM (70) 10thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (CP (70) 79), to which was annexed a draft statement on steel prices.The Minister of Technology said that the Iron and SteelConsumers Council (ISCC) had reported in mid-September on theproposal of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) to increase steel prices by 5 per cent on average and had recommended thatthe application should be rejected. Since that time, however, theBSCs forecast outturn for the current financial year had deterioratedby a further  22 million. The Ministerial Committee on economic policy (EPC) had agreed in these circumstances that there was no alternative to acceptance of the Corporation^ proposal for a 5 percent increase. He was obliged by Statute to make a statement toParliament of the reasons why he was rejecting the advice of ISCC;
and he therefore proposed to issue forthwith an announcement inthe terms of the draft annexed to CP (70) 79.The further deterioration in the bsc&apos;s finances sincemid-September, coming on top of an  85 million deterioration in theearlier months of this year, provided grounds for serious concern.Some four-fifths of this deterioration could be attributed to the lateintroduction and poor performance of new plant and the consequentneed for the Corporation to continue running old and costlier plant.Responsibility lay mainly with the Corporation, but partly with the plant manufacturers. His statement accepting the need for the price increase, which would still leave domestic steel prices somewhatbelow those of other countries, would therefore make clear the government&apos;s dissatisfaction with the industry&apos;s current financialperformance and their determination to introduce a more rigorousfinancial discipline for the future. In accordance with the decisionsof EPC, officials were now undertaking an urgent examination of thefinancial requirements and conditions to be imposed on theCorporation for the future.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that an immediate 5 per cent increase in steel prices was inescapable. The Minister of Technology should,however, urgently re-examine both the finances and financialmanagement of the BSC and should agree with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the financial requirements and conditions to be imposed on the Corporation in order to enforce a more rigorous discipline forthe future. Since there had already been Press reports to the effectthat the Government were to authorise the proposed price increase,it would be preferable to announce the decision without waiting until the new financial requirements could be specified in thestatement. But the draft annexed to CP (70) 79 should be considerably firmer in tone. In particular, it should emphasise thatthe BSC had applied for the increase in August because of the deterioration in their financial position during the earlier months ofthe year and that the ISCCs subsequent report, recommending the rejection of the application, had been out-dated by the further deterioration in the Corporation^ finances which had occurred sincethe Council had examined the case for the increase. The revisedstatement should leave no doubt that the major responsibility forthe deterioration in the bsc&apos;s finances, which had necessitated theprice increase, rested with the Corporation; and it should also bring out more sharply the Governmenfs determination to impose morerigorous financial disciplines on the BSC for the future.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that steel prices should be increased by an averageof 5 per cent.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theLord President and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to redraft the statement annexed to CP (70) 79 on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider urgently themost effective means of imposing a stricter financialdiscipline on the British Steel Corporation for the future.Machinery ofGovernmentReorganisationof CentralGovernment(previous reference:CM (70) 12thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had authorised the circulation, for their information, of a proof copy ofa White Paper on the Reorganisation of Central Government, whichwould be published on the following day. This White Paper woulddescribe the results of a major review of the functions and organisation of central Government which had been carried out during the last 4 months in order to improve the quality of policyformulation and decision, to match the responsibility ofGovernment Departments to coherent fields of policy and administration and to ensure that the Government machine wouldadapt itself responsively to new policies and programmes as theyemerged.The main features of the reorganisation were as follows:(a) The responsibility for general industrial policy and administration, which was at present divided between the Board ofTrade and the Ministry of Technology, would be unified within anew Department of Trade and Industry, which would absorb thefunctions of both the existing Departments (other than responsibilityfor aero-space research, development and procurement), togetherwith responsibility for monopolies and mergers, which would betransferred to it from the Department of Employment and productivity.(b) The future allocation of the existing responsibility of theMinistry of Technology for aero-space research, development andprocurement could not be decided except in the context of a more comprehensive review and rationalisation of the whole function ofdefence procurement. This review would be put in hand forthwith,on the basis of a timetable designed to enable new arrangements tobe implemented by 1st April. 1972.   In the interim the Aviation
Group of the Ministry of Technology would become a separateMinistry of Aviation Supply, which would assume, for the time beingall the aero-space functions of the Ministry of Technology, bothcivil and military.(c) The implementation of the Governmenfs policies for the physical environment required a new form of organisation at thecentre. The Ministries of Housing and Local Government, of public building and Works and of Transport would be unified in a single department of the Environment under a Secretary of State. the responsibilities of this Department would comprise the planning ofland, the construction industries (including the housing programme),the transport industries, the preservation of amenity and the controlof pollution. The Department would also have the leadingresponsibility for regional policy and for the structure andfunctioning of local government.(d) In order to unify Ministerial responsibility for overseaspolicy overseas aid would become the ultimate responsibility of theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, although the Minister of overseas Development would enjoy, by delegation from theSecretary of State, full charge of his functional wing of the foreign and Commonwealth Office.(e) The integration of the personal social services which wasbeing effected at local authority level, in England and Wales, on1st January, 1971, must be matched by unification of ministerial responsibility at the centre. The child care responsibilities of theHome Secretary in England would therefore be transferred to theSecretary of State for Social Services on that date; and the Secretaryof State for Wales would assume similar responsibilities in the principality. The Home Secretary would, however, retain for bothEngland and Wales his existing responsibilities in relation to the juvenile courts and the problems of juvenile delinquency, since these were integral to his overriding responsibility for protecting the public and ensuring the rights and liberties of the individual.(/) The Government also intended to improve the methods bywhich collective policy decisions were taken. For this purpose asmall central policy review staff would be established in the cabinet office which would assist Ministers collectively to work out the implications of their basic strategy in terms of policies in specificareas, to establish the relative priorities to be given to differentprogrammes and to identify the areas of policy in which new choicescould be exercised. In addition, the Public Expenditure Surveysystem would be reinforced by new arrangements for associatedreviews of Departmental programmes at regular intervals.
(g) The full range of functions and activities at present beingdischarged by Departments was being reviewed, in order that itmight be decided whether they were necessary functions of centralGovernment and whether, if so, they were rightly articulated in the organisational framework of Departments. Every activity ofGovernment should be subjected to the rigorous test of the questions was it relevant, and did it have to be done by central Government.The reorganisation of Departmental responsibilities also provided anopportunity to review the location of Government Departments andthe possibilities of dispersing them from London. arrangements had therefore been made to commission a study to determineprecisely which blocks of work needed to remain in London andwhich might most sensibly be relocated outside.These measures represented a major and significant reorganisa-tion of the whole structure of central Government. If it wasto succeed, it was clear that within the new Departments there mustbe considerable devolution to junior Ministers, who should beentrusted with clearly defined areas of responsibility, which might be envisaged as potential units of separate accountability and should be administered in that spirit. In addition a considerable effort of adjustment would be required while the reorganisation was takingeffect; and it was important that in each of the Departmentsconcerned a senior official should be appointed to supervise the changes in organisation and to ensure that they were to be put intoeffect with the minimum of delay and dislocation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th October, 1970.
