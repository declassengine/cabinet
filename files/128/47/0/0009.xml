CM 9 (70)confidential the Cabinet 1.   The Prime Minister said that recent Press reports suggestedthat there might have been some premature and unauthorised disclosure of certain of the Governmenfs intentions. It was essential for the Government to establish from the outset a high standard of discretion. All Ministers should therefore review theDepartmental circulation of the papers of the Cabinet and its committees with a view to restricting them to those individuals whoneeded to be informed about them; and they should impress upon their staffs, both Ministerial and official, the importance of preserving the confidential character of the Governmenfs deliberations.IndustrialAffairsNationalDocks Dispute(previous reference:CM (70) 8thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that the report of the Court of Inquiry into the docks dispute,which had been published on 27 July, had recommended certainimprovements in the port employers&apos; last pay offer but had rejected the trade unions&apos; demand for an increase in the national time rate which, if granted, would have led to an uncontrollable wage driftwith a large increase in dockers&apos; earnings. The only new element in the pay offer recommended by the Court of Inquiry was anincrease in the overtime rate; and it should be possible to insulatethis from other elements in the general earnings level of dockers.There was now a reasonable prospect that the dockers&apos; pay increase could be maintained at the level of the Court of Inquiry&apos;srecommendations; this would amount to an increase ofapproximately 7 per cent in place of the 4 per cent represented bythe employers&apos; last offer. Even at this higher level, a settlement withthe dockers would represent a real contribution to moderating therate of increase in pay settlements so far in the current year.The port employers had made it clear that they accepted therecommendations of the Court of Inquiry and that, as soon as thestrike was called off, they would make a corresponding pay offer.But they had made it equally clear that they would refuse to makeany further concession. The representatives of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union (TGWU) had agreed to put the findings of the Court of Inquiry and the statement of the port employers toa dock delegate conference on Wednesday, 29 July. There was some reason to think that Mr. Jack Jones, the General Secretary of theTGWU, was anxious to call off the strike and to accept the proposed settlement; and he was to see representatives of the dockers beforethe delegate conference with a view, it was thought, to securingsupport for acceptance of the Court of Inquiry&apos;s recommendations.It was impossible, however, to predict the outcome of the conference.It might accept the recommendations as a basis for negotiation and agree to call off the strike.  If so, it might be expedient to accept11428A 2
this formula on the basis that it would be so interpreted as to confine the subsequent negotiations to the implementation of Stage II of themeasures of port modernisation recommended by the Committee of inquiry into the Port Transport Industry (Devlin Report). On theother hand the official strike might be called off but substantialunofficial action might continue at a number of ports for some time.The Minister of Transport said that some 265 ships were idle inBritish ports, 62 of them carrying food. Only 500 dockers out ofthe normal labour force were working. Substantial supplies of meat and other foodstuffs were in store in the dock areas as well as in ships awaiting unloading; and these were available for delivery tothe markets as soon as the dockers or Servicemen took up the workof unloading. But there had been a disappointing response to theTGWU appeal to dockers to co-operate in dealing with essential supplies of perishable food; and it appeared that the attitude of the dockers had, if anything hardened rather than the reverse.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Despite the agreement of the TGWU leaders to supportaction to maintain supplies to the offshore islands, supplies of sugar,flour and yeast in the Orkneys would be exhausted within a day ortwo; and, if the strike was not called off immediately, special action would be required.(b) If the strike were officially called off but unofficial actionkept some ports closed, it might be difficult to deal with perishablefoodstuffs in those ports or to maintain traffic with offshore islandswhich they served. It would be for consideration whether in thesecircumstances the improvement in supplies which the use of servicemen would ensure would outweigh the hostile reactions whichthe deployment of Service labour might provoke.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thespecial requirement of urgently needed supplies in the Orkneysshould be assessed at once, in order to ascertain whether it mightbe met, if necessary, by the use of aircraft or naval vessels. TheCabinet would have to consider on the following Thursday whether to authorise the use of Servicemen in the docks if the national dockstrike was not called off by the decision of the dock delegate conference on 29 July.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to consider the problems which might arise if unofficial strike action persisted at certain ports after the official national dock strike was called off; and to report on the subject to the Cabinet on30 July.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity to make immediate representations to the
SECRETLegislative 3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord197o3im*&apos;    President of the Council (CP (70) 27) outlining proposals for thelegislative programme for the remainder of the 1970-71 Session.The Lord President said that, with the support of his colleagues on the Ministerial Committee on Future Legislation, he had sought to confine the legislative programme within the limits indicated bythe Parliamentary timetable and the drafting resources likely to beavailable. He had also been concerned to avoid imposing too heavy a load on individual Ministers and their Departments.In discussion it was suggested that, if the programme appearedrather light, full account must be taken of the Industrial relations bill, which would take a good deal of time on the Floor of the House.Moreover, if Second Reading Committee and Private Members&apos; Billswere excluded, the programme provided for more major Bills than had been passed by the previous Administration in their last fullSession. In total, therefore, the proposals should be fully adequate;and the need of the House of Lords for a supply of Bills in theperiod before Christmas should be borne in mind when Bills werebeing introduced.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) It might be better to defer Industrial Training until thefollowing Session, when the Governmenfs review of the industrial training system would be complete. Legislation might be needed in the current Session, however, in the Prices and Incomes Board/Monopolies Commission field.(b) A Bill to increase the allowance of the Lord HighCommissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotlandmight raise the whole question of the Civil List; and, althoughtrade union leadership about the need for deliveries ofurgent supplies of foodstuffs to the Orkneys.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food and the Minister of Transport, to make thenecessary preparations for delivering urgently neededfood supplies to the Orkneys by the use of aircraft or naval vessels, in order that deliveries to the islands mightbe maintained if the dock strike was not cancelled on29 July and the dockers in the individual ports concernedcontinued to withhold co-operation for the purpose.(4) Agreed to resume discussion, on 30 July, of the possibleneed for the use of Servicemen in the docks.
political considerations favoured its early introduction, it would be preferable to defer legislation until the Government had decidedtheir policy on the Civil List. Similar considerations applied inconnection with the salary of the Governor of Northern Ireland.(c) There might be a case for early legislation on CigaretteSmoking to require the display of warnings on packets; similar actionin the United States had produced valuable results.(d) The abolition of State Management in Scotland should wait until the Government were ready to deal with the same issue inEngland, even if in the meantime some capital investment on hotelshad to be restricted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in CP (70) 27, subject to the points made in discussion. In so doing they wished to emphasise theimportance of avoiding ill-considered legislation and, therefore,ensuring that the necessary decisions on policy and the preparationof drafting instructions were pressed ahead as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP (70) 27, subject to the points made in discussion. jAircraftIndustryConcordeSECRET4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of technology (CP (70) 15), the President of the Board of Trade(CP (70) 23), the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General(CP (70) 17) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP (70) 25) aboutthe Concorde aircraft project.The Minister of Technology said that the previous Governmenthad agreed to maintain United Kingdom collaboration in this projectuntil the end of June 1970, and had informed the FrenchGovernment that they regarded their commitments as limited to thatdate. Discussions with the French authorities which had been planned for June had been postponed because of the GeneralElection; but it would be necessary to reinstitute them shortly. the flight trials of the aircraft so far had been successful; and the criticaltrials at twice the speed of sound would take place in the next fewweeks. The evaluation of those trials, however, would not be complete until March 1971; and it would not be possible until then to establish whether there was a case for cancelling the project on technical grounds. The economic prospects for the aircraft werenot very encouraging; but, if 50 aircraft were sold, foreign exchangeearnings might amount to some $1,200 million. This was the lowestestimate of probable sales if the trials were successful; and it waspossible that airlines might be forced by competitive pressure to buya larger number, although they would prefer not to have to dealwith the introduction of supersonic planes in the next few years.
A high load factor might compensate for any slight reduction incarrying capacity; and, while there might be difficulties about using the plane on overland routes, there was a substantial network ofroutes for which it would be suitable. The Concorde represented the largest technical project in Western Europe. Some 20,000employees were involved in this country; and cancellation withoutthe agreement of the French Government would not only seriouslydamage Anglo-French relations but also have serious repercussions on our aero-space industry as a whole and on our national prestige.He therefore invited the Cabinet to agree that the Concorde project should continue until 31 March, 1971, when the position might be reviewed in the light of the flight test results and the reactions of the airlines, and that he should discuss the position with the french minister of Transport on that basis.The Attorney-General said that, if Britain withdrew from the concorde project against the wishes of the French Government andwere taken to the International Court, the Court would on balancebe more likely to find in our favour than against us. If, however,they did find against us, our liability would probably be of the orderof  40- 60 million; but the possibility of an award up to  230 million could not be completely excluded. If the Cabinet were to decide towithdraw from the project, there was no significant legal distinctionbetween taking that decision now and taking it in March 1971.In discussion it was suggested on the one hand that, even if the concorde successfully met its design specifications, there was no prospect of its proving an economic success. If the project continued,some  250- 300 million more would have to be spent between now and 1974-75 than if it were cancelled now. There was little prospectof any return on future development expenditure; and there might even be some loss on production loans. The British overseas airways Corporation would require a subsidy to operate it; andAir France might well take the same view when they had completed their current studies. Moreover, there was considerable doubt whether Concorde would reach its payload/range target even if the engine nozzle were completely redesigned at a cost likely to exceedsubstantially the estimate of  30 million. There was also a realpossibility that the take-off and lateral noise levels would exceed those acceptable at, in particular, Heathrow and Kennedy airports;and this might delay the Concorde&apos;s entry into service until itslarger American rival was almost ready to compete with it. If the project were continued until March 1971, and then had to be cancelled in the light of the results of the trials, an additional 45- 50 million would have been lost. Both this item of additional expenditure and the total cost of the project over the next five years,if it were continued, were very substantial in relation to the economiesbeing sought in the current review of public expenditure.
On the other hand it was argued that cancellation without theagreement of the French Government might seriously damage bothAnglo-French relations in general and the current negotiations forour entry into the European Economic Community (e.c.). It mightbe preferable, therefore, to delay a decision until it became clear whether our French partners also were convinced, in the light of theevaluation of the trial results, that the project should be cancelled.The impact of any unilateral cancellation on Anglo-French relationswould be increased if we simultaneously decided to proceed with the bac-311 project; but it might be at least partially offset if theUnited Kingdom decided to co-operate, instead, in the A-300BEuropean Airbus project.In further discussion the following points were made :(a) The Concorde project employed some 20,000 individuals;but this was a relatively small proportion of the 240,000 labour forcein the aero-space industry as a whole. Moreover, past experiencesuggested that the unemployment which would result fromcancellation might prove to be substantially less than the numberscurrently employed.(b) So much of the development work had already beencompleted that we could expect to derive little further advantage inthe form of technological advances of general application fromcontinuation of the project.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be little prospect that the Concorde would prove to bean economic success. If so, further consideration would have to begiven to the precise point at which it might be desirable to cancel the project. On the one hand the cost of maintaining ourcollaboration even until March 1971 was substantial in relation tothe reductions in public expenditure which the Cabinet would be considering in September. On the other hand there was a risk thatunilateral cancellation at this stage would have adverse repercussions on our relations with France and on the e.c. negotiations. In thecircumstances the Cabinet would need to resume their discussion ofboth the Concorde and the BAC-311 projects at their followingmeeting. Thereafter he would consider further how the matter might best be pursued before the Cabinet reached a final decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume discussion of the Concorde and BAC-311projects at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28 July, 1970.
