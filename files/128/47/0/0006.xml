Arms for south Africa(previous reference:CM (70) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)11425SECRET1. The Prime Minister said that, as a result of developments since the Cabinet had last discussed the question on 16 July, it had seemed advisable to modify the formulation of the draft statement on the export of arms to South Africa which was to be made in theHouse of Commons that day by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that replieswere still outstanding from 14 Commonwealth Governments to the messages on this subject which the Prime Minister had sent them.But the President of Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere, had threatenedthat Tanzania would leave the Commonwealth if the BritishGovernment decided to resume the supply of arms of any kind to south Africa; and there was some danger that other commonwealth governments in East Africa and elsewhere might adopt a similarattitude. A further message had therefore been sent to Mr. Nyerere,as a result of which he appeared to be taking a more moderate view.But in the light of his reaction and of the fact that it had not yetbeen possible to complete the process of obtaining the views of commonwealth Governments, there appeared to be some advantage in refraining from final decisions at this juncture and in modifyingaccordingly the wording of the draft statement which he would be making in the House of Commons that day. A further consideration in favour of this course was that the South African Foreign Minister,Dr. Muller, had now asked for clarification of the existing obligationsimplicit in the various exchanges, correspondence, and undertakingsrelating to Simonstown, and of the spirit in which both parties would approach their responsibilities; and this request would clearlyentail further discussion with the South African Government. Inthe light of these developments a revised draft of his statement hadbeen prepared.The revised draft was then distributed for the Cabinet&apos;consideration.The Attorney-General said that he had examined the government&apos;s legal obligations under the Simonstown Agreement.Although differing interpretations of the text of the Agreement couldbe argued, he inclined to the view that there was at any rate animplied obligation on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to supply arms inaccordance with the purposes of the Agreement. If so, it would follow that over the past few years we had not been meeting theobligations imposed on us by the Agreement.In discussion there was general agreement that the developmentsto which the Prime Minister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had referred were not such as to require the Government
to modify the essential features of the policy which they had consistently advocated or to concede to pressure from otherGovernments on an issue where important British interests were at stake. On the other hand there would be advantage in modifying the statement to indicate their willingness to give furtherconsideration, before final decisions were taken, to the variousrepresentations which they had received, particularly from other commonwealth Governments. A statement on the lines now suggested should suffice to mitigate any initial adverse reactions inthe Commonwealth and to allay the misgivings expressed by theUnited States Government. It might admittedly lead to demands in the House of Commons, which could hardly be resisted, for afurther and definitive statement of policy in Parliament when theGovernment reached the point of decision. The timing of any statement of this kind, however, would need to be considered inrelation both to the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters and to the point at which it might become necessary to approve any specific exports of arms which might be regarded aspermissible a point which might not be reached for some time tocome.In further discussion, several amendments to the draft statement were agreed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should make, in the House of Commons that afternoon, the statement annexed to this record.IndustrialAffairsNationalDocks Dispute(previous reference:CM (70) 5thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.secret. The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committeeon Emergencies would be meeting later that day to consider thesituation. No applications for the use of troops had so far beenreceived from any of the Port Emergency Committees. There was still some prospect that the dockers might be induced to unloadperishable foodstuffs; and it was hoped that it would be possible toavoid the use of troops until all other expedients had been exhausted.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The position in regard to perishable foodstuffs was liable tobecome acute in two or three days&apos; time, when a number of cargoes of bananas would become unfit for consumption unless they wereunloaded. If the dockers were unwilling to deal with these cargoes,
troops would have to be used. But the effect on public opinion andon the unions themselves might be unfortunate if troops were called in not as a last resort but in order to save cargoes of a kind whichcould not be regarded as essential. If, despite these considerations,it was thought necessary to use troops to unload cargoes of thiskind, they should, if possible, be used concurrently on some otheroperation which was more manifestly and demonstrably essential.An opportunity might arise for this purpose if the dockers refusedto maintain essential services to the Scottish Islands, in particularShetland, at an adequate level.(b) On the other hand any apparent reluctance on the part ofthe Government to use the Emergency Powers which they had takenwould be liable to be interpreted by the employers and the unionsas a sign of weakness. Too much weight should not, therefore, beattached to the consideration that the cargoes concerned could notbe described as essential.(c) Moreover, supplies of meat were beginning to fall and prices were rising. The dockers might be prepared to co-operate in bringing supplies forward from cold storage or unloading ships&apos;cargoes: but, if not, troops would have to be used if prices were tobe prevented from rising still further.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was essential that the Government should not give the impression of weakness or hesitancy in dealing with the unions. Too much shouldnot be made of the distinction between perishable and non-perishableand essential and non-essential foodstuffs. The Government were as likely to be criticised for allowing perishable foodstuffs to be wasted as for using their Emergency Powers to prevent them from being lost to consumption. The unions should be faced squarelywith the issue and should, if possible, be induced to give a straightanswer to the question whether they would be prepared to co-operate in unloading perishable cargoes and releasing sufficient meat toenable prices to be maintained at a reasonable level. If they refused, public opinion would draw its own conclusions. the ministerial Committee on Emergencies, in considering the problem at their meeting later that day, should be guided by the points madein the present discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21 July, 1970.
secret annex to Item 1STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS (SIR ALECDOUGLAS-HOME) IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ONMONDAY, 20 JULY, 1970SOUTH AFRICA (ARMS)With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I wish to make a statement.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have an overriding duty to take account of present and future strategic needs of the United Kingdomand, in that context, a particular concern for the free passage ofships in all circumstances on the vital sea routes round South Africa.It was to that end that the Simonstown Agreement was negotiated.It is our intention to give effect to the purposes of that agreement and we believe that, as a consequence, we should be ready toconsider within that context applications for the export to SouthAfrica of certain limited categories of arms, so long as they are for maritime defence directly related to the security of the sea routes.The Government have made abundantly clear their fundamentaldisagreement with the racial policies of the South african government. In no circumstances would there be sales to SouthAfrica of arms for the enforcement of the policy of apartheid orinternal repression.It is on this basis that the Government have naturally been concerned to consult with Commonwealth Governments and todiscuss these matters with them. A number of these governments have not yet replied and a number request further information and discussion. At the same time the South African Government arealso seeking clarification of the interpretation of the simonstown agreement; this will need consideration with the South african government.The Government propose to complete these consultations and discussions before decisions are finally taken.
