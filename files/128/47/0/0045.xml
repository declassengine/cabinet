CM 45 (70)SECRET.Parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs j-[ouse 0f Commons the following week.OverseaAffairsEuropeElections inPakistanSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the series of international meetings which had taken place in recent weeks the Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council, thediscussions between the European Economic Community (e.c.) andthe four candidates for membership, and the exchanges between theFederal German Republic and the three Powers with special responsibilities in Berlin the countries concerned, with few exceptions (notably Canada, Denmark and Norway), had taken theview that any further progress about European security and, inparticular, about a European security conference must depend onthe Soviet attitude towards Berlin. So far the Soviet Governmenthad made no proposals of substance about access to the city; butthere were indications that they might be disposed to reach agreement, if only because they were anxious that the federal german Government should ratify the German-Soviet Treaty andrealised that they were not likely to do so unless there were substantial progress towards a settlement of the Berlin problem.The discussions between the six members of the e.c. and the fourcandidate countries had been cordial and informal; and the Sixhad made no attempt to draw a distinction between their own status and that of the candidates. So far as the North Atlantic council meeting was concerned, the main feature had been the statement bythe United States that, given a similar approach by the other allies,they would maintain and improve their own forces in Europe andwould not reduce them except in the context of reciprocal East-Westaction. This statement, which specifically linked the maintenanceof United States forces in Europe with both the maintenance of anadequate European defence effort and developments in East-west relations, had probably been made on the personal initiative of president Nixon and reflected the outcome of his visit during theautumn to Europe and the Mediterranean.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGeneral Election held in Pakistan on 7 December had resulted in aconsiderable swing to the Left. In East Pakistan the Awami League,led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had won a sweeping victory. in west Pakistan the Pakistan Peoples&apos; Party, led by Mr. Bhutto, had
substantially improved its position. It was not yet certain whetherthe President of Pakistan, Yahya Khan, together with his armysupporters, would accept the outcome of the election or whethermilitary rule would be maintained. But on the former assumptionthere was likely to be a move towards consolidating Pakistanirelations with the Chinese Peoples&apos; Republic. Moreover, Mr. Bhuttowas bitterly anti-Indian; and, if he acceded to power, the dispute between Pakistan and India about Kashmir might well beexacerbated.BruneiThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in recent discussions with representatives of the Sultan of Brunei Heads ofAgreement had been initialled dealing with our future relations withBrunei. The Heads of Agreement followed the lines approved by ministers; and the effect would be to bring our relationship withBrunei more closely into line with our new defence relations withMalaysia.St. Kitts/Nevis/AnguillaThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePremier of the Associated State of St. Kitts / Nevis / Anguilla,Mr. Bradshaw, who was at present in London, had had severaldiscussions with the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Godber, about Anguilla. He had rejected our proposal for an interim period of British administrationof the island, followed by a referendum; and he was evidentlydetermined to regain control of it on terms which would be bothunacceptable to its inhabitants and incompatible with our assurancesto them. Mr. Godber would make a further attempt to induceMr. Bradshaw to accept a solution on the basis which we had proposed. But if, as seemed likely, the discussions ended indeadlock, it was difficult to see any alternative in the short term to thecontinued administration of Anguilla by a British Commissioner,and, in the long term, to its final excision from the Associated State.Kidnappingin MontrealPreviousReference:CM (70) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theUnited Kingdom Trade Commissioner in Montreal, Mr. James Cross,who had been kidnapped by the extremist French-Canadian Frontde Liberation Quebecois, had now returned to London. Theharshness of the treatment to which he had been subjected during his captivity had appeared to be without any rational motivation.But he was in reasonably good health; and both he and his familyhad endured their ordeal with courage and dignity.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements   by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.
industrial affairs pay ofElectricitySupplyManualWorkersPreviousReference:CM (70) 44thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that thework-to-rule and overtime ban by manual workers in the electricity supply industry was due to be reinforced on 14 December by similar action on the part of the supervising engineers, who were in dispute with the employers about a new salary structure. On 9 Decemberhe had met representatives of the Electrical Power EngineersAssociation (EPEA), who had said that, provided that the electricity council would be prepared at their next meeting to quantify the new structure, they would recommend their Executive to withdraw theinstructions for a work-to-rule and overtime ban. The electricity council were considering this proposal.He had also met representatives of the electricity manual workers&apos; trade unions, who had admitted that their reason for rejecting arbitration was their inability to carry the support of thoseof their members who claimed that, by acting responsibly andhelping to achieve a substantial reduction in the industry&apos;s labour force, they had simply lost ground by comparison with the pay increases secured by other workers with no similar claims toimproved productivity.In these circumstances he proposed that he should now take thenecessary preliminary steps towards appointing a court of inquiry.This need not be interpreted as an admission of failure, providedthat it was made clear to the public that the Government were alsopreparing the necessary plans in case an early settlement was notachieved. Moreover, if the engineers abandoned their projectedwork-to-rule, considerable pressure could be put on the manual workers to resume normal working and to accept the outcome of acourt of inquiry. The General Secretary of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) was at that moment meeting the manual workers&apos;unions and was probably urging them to resume normal working.The statement by the Leader of the Opposition that it would be right to expect them to do so if a court of inquiry were appointedmight also suggest that the public assertion by the unions to thecontrary was primarily a negotiating tactic. In preparing for a courtof inquiry, therefore, he would ask the unions for an undertaking to return to normal working; and, if they refused, the public would realise that the unions&apos; attitude was wholly unreasonable. But itwould be unwise to make a return to normal working an absoluteprecondition of the establishment of an inquiry, since continuedrefusal by the unions might leave the Government in an untenableposition.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thesupply of electricity had improved, mainly because some plant hadbeen restored to service; and power cuts should be less severe thanon the previous day. If the supervising engineers maintained normal working, the decline in total electricity output should be relativelygradual. If the engineering staff began working to rule, however,total output would decrease much more rapidly. At the present level of output, the electricity authorities could select localities inwhich current should be either reduced or maintained, as appropriate.At an output level of 50 per cent of normal, cuts had to apply tolarger sectors; while at a 20 per cent level there would have to becentral decisions on cutting off supply from whole towns and largeparts of London. The Electricity Council now considered, however,that they could still maintain some control over distribution even when output was at only 20 per cent of the normal level. This wasthe proportion which they judged could be produced, even if the supervisory engineers withdrew, by Servicemen working under the supervision of staff grades. But they doubted whether it would bepossible to improve it by bringing in further skilled engineers.At the moment the electricity authorities appeared to be dealingwith the situation reasonably well and, in consultation with his department, were giving advance warning of power cuts and more detailed advice to consumers. The Minister for Industry wascurrently discussing with the Council whether the supply of powerto hospitals could be improved.The Home Secretary said that the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland, Major Chichester-Clark, had told him on the previous evening that the Province was faced with a position in which, if theunions&apos; pay claim were not met in full, action would have to be taken under Emergency Powers to prohibit the use of electricity for mostindustrial purposes. He had replied that the latter was the right course; but it would have very serious effects in Northern Irelandand all possible help from Great Britain should be provided.In discussion it was agreed that the alternative courses of actionopen to the Government were continued resistance to the unions&apos;industrial action without any attempt to promote a settlement or theappointment of a court of inquiry. It would be important in eitherevent to emphasise the Governmenfs determined opposition to an excessive pay award; and it might well be necessary to takeEmergency Powers if the engineers began working to rule on14 December or if, despite the appointment of a court of inquiry, the manual workers refused to return to normal working. It was arguedin favour of continued resistance without recourse to a court of,inquiry that opinion among the public and in the Conservative party was strongly in support of the Government and would be equally
strongly opposed to a pay award higher than 10 per cent. Theappointment of a court of inquiry would therefore be seen as a weakening of the Governmenfs firm stand against wage inflation.Even if the normal work force withdrew completely, it should be feasible to maintain a higher level of supply than the electricity council had advised by mobilising volunteers with relevantexperience and skills to operate the power stations with the supportof Servicemen. On the other hand such a course might be damagingand prove to be untenable. The Government had always envisaged that, once electricity supplies were seriously threatened, it would benecessary to appoint a court of inquiry in order to achieve asettlement of the dispute; and it was in order to leave such an inquiry some room for manoeuvre that they had been concerned that the CounciFs final offer should be confined to a 10 per cent increase. In any event it was unrealistic to suppose that a refusal to appoint a court of inquiry could persuade the manual workers tocall off their industrial action and to accept a pay increase no higherthan the amount which they had previously refused. Any attemptto insist on a return to normal working before a court of inquirywas appointed might merely result in a deadlock, which in turn wouldhave to be resolved by abandoning the precondition. In thediscussion with the parties to the dispute about the establishment ofa court of inquiry, however, a reluctance on the part of the unions toabandon the go-slow would be likely to lose them public sympathy.The unions might refuse to commit themselves in advance to acceptthe outcome of such an inquiry; and, since it could not be guaranteedto be acceptable to the Government, the employers also ought notto bind themselves to accept it. The manner of presenting a decisionto appoint a court of inquiry would be important, as would its composition and detailed terms of reference.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Proposals for electricity price increases which allowed fora current pay award of the order of 10 per cent were at present being submitted to the various Consultative Councils. These proposals had been adjusted, as requested by the Cabinet, in order to reducethe maximum increases to domestic consumers. It was forconsideration whether the public should now be made aware thatthese price increases were in prospect in order to counteract theimpression conveyed by the unions that their contribution toproductivity had helped to avoid the need for such increases.(b) The Government should explore all possible means of assisting the Government of Northern Ireland to maintain electricity supplies. But it would be necessary to seek to ensure that assistanceto Northern Ireland, for example by providing Servicemen or special
Ministry of Defence facilities, did not have repercussions which caused a greater loss in electricity output either in Northern Irelandor in the rest of the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed, on balance, that it would now be right to move towards the establishment of a court of inquiry. The unions had made it clear that they would not invoke arbitration within theindustry&apos;s normal procedures; and this refusal should havediminished their prospects of winning the support of public opinion.They also appeared to be unwilling to instruct their members to resume normal working if a court of inquiry were appointed. Onthe other hand the Leader of the Opposition had already endorsed the view that public opinion would expect them to do so; and theGeneral Secretary of the TUC, who was meeting them that morning,was likely to urge them to agree. In these circumstances they wouldrisk discrediting themselves still further if they declined a request from the Government to resume normal working when they were informed of the proposal to appoint a court of inquiry. TheGovernment had undertaken to make a Parliamentary statement onthe dispute that afternoon; and the Opposition had already indicated that, if the Government were unwilling to considerappointing a court of inquiry, they would seek to move the adjournment of the House under Standing Order No. 9. It was understood that the Speaker was likely to accept such a Motion;and in the debate which would follow during the evening theOpposition would press for the immediate appointment of an inquiry. If the TUC had by then obtained the unions&apos; assurance that their members would resume work during an inquiry, theOpposition would no doubt claim credit for this gesture; and itwould then become more difficult for the Government to establish a court of inquiry from a position of strength. It would thereforebe desirable that, before the Secretary of State for Employment made his Parliamentary statement that afternoon, he should have arranged to meet the parties to the dispute again and, if possible, have securedfrom the EPEA their agreement to abandon the proposed work-to-rule by their members from 14 December. The Government wouldthen be in a still stronger position to call on the manual workers&apos;unions to follow this example when a court of inquiry was appointed,although it might be inadvisable to make a return to normal workingan absolute precondition of the establishment of the inquiry. Itwould also be important to seek to ensure that the electricity council did not bind themselves in advance to accept the findings of the inquiry unless the unions were prepared to give a similarundertaking. Before any announcement of the decision to appoint an inquiry was made, however, it would be essential to try to create the right climate of public opinion by demonstrating that the
Government remained resolute both in dealing with the immediateproblems of supply and in preparing to meet the threat of still more severe difficulties if the dispute were prolonged. The Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry, in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council, should ensure immediate further publicity for the steps which had been taken to secure electricity supplies to hospitals and to reduce inessential consumption of electricity; an early announcement should be made that a very senior officer of theDepartment of Trade and Industry had been detached from hisnormal duties in order to devote his whole attention to concerting withthe electricity authorities the necessary arrangements for maintainingelectricity supplies to the fullest possible extent in all eventualities;and steps should also be taken to bring it to public attention at theappropriate moment that the electricity authorities were suspendingemployees who failed to co-operate reasonably in working to theproper rules of the industry. It was also important that the public should be made aware that contingency plans were being made against the possible withdrawal of co-operation by the supervisingengineers and the potential loss of the greater part of the country&apos;selectricity output, whether this resulted from a progressivedeterioration under a continuation of the work-to-rule or from acomplete withdrawal of the normal work force. The Cabinet notedthe electricity industry&apos;s view that, if the normal work force was withdrawn, it would not be practicable to rely on volunteers from outside the industry to operate power stations with the assistance of servicemen. This view, however, was open to question; and theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry should satisfy himself thatthe Central Electricity Generating Board had contingency plans tomake the fullest use of the available skills from all possible sources.Moreover, since it would be the final responsibility of theGovernment, acting under Emergency Powers, to deal with thesituation if it reached a point of national crisis, it was proper that theindustry&apos;s contingency plans should be examined by the ministerial committee on Emergencies, which would need to keep under review the question of advising the proclamation of a State of Emergency.This point might be reached at the beginning of the following weekif the, EPEA refused to abandon the proposed work-to-rule by their members or the manual workers&apos; unions refused to resume normal working when a court of inquiry was established.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of theCouncil and the Secretaries of State for Employment andfor Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.
UnitedKingdomContributionto the budget of theEuropeanCommunitiesPreviousReference:CM (70) 34thConclusions,Minute 44. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP (70) 115) to which was attached a report by officials on negotiating objectives for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution to the Community budget.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at the ministerial Meeting in Brussels on 8 December the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster had said sufficient in general terms about our contribution to Community finance to contain speculation aboutthe causes of delay in putting forward a specific opening bid on thissubject. The Ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe had agreed with the assessment by officials in the report annexed to cp (70) 115 that we could not expect in the end to secure agreement to a lower key contribution than 17 per cent, but the Chancellor ofthe Duchy proposed that our opening bid should be 13 to 15 per cent.The Cabinet should be aware that when this offer was tabled in brussels it would be necessary at the same time to publish it in theUnited Kingdom preferably by a statement in the House ofCommons and the very substantial balance of payments cost involved would immediately become apparent: the economic benefits of membership on the other hand remained impossible toquantify. There were no means of avoiding this difficulty at whatever time we tabled our opening bid and he agreed with theChancellor of the Duchy that it had become virtually impossible to delay tabling our specific proposals on this subject beyond the next meeting of the Deputies in Brussels on 18 December.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he wouldbe reporting to the House of Commons that day on the ministerial meeting with the Six in Brussels on 8 December where significantprogress had been made in the negotiations. We had agreed to a five-year transitional period for industry, agriculture, freeing capital movements and fiscal harmonisation (i.e. adoption of the value-added tax) on certain conditions, notably that the dismantling of industrialtariffs should be accelerated at the beginning of the transitional period and that there should be a full five years for our adaptationto the common agricultural policy with a reasonable degree of flexibility in the manner of adaptation. This offer had come assomething of a surprise to the Six who finally agreed to note it with satisfaction and, after some initial difficulty from the French, to use a five-year transitional period for industry and agriculture as a working hypothesis on which to work out detailed transitional arrangements. He had, of course, made it clear that we should require a longer transitional period for Community finance but had made no specific proposals. The report by officials suggested, andthe Committee on the Approach to Europe had agreed, that the most
favourable terms we could expect to secure on Community financewould require that we should make a &quot; key &quot; contribution of 17 percent at the end of the transitional period: that this key would buildup in equal annual steps over a period of five years; that there wouldbe a further period of three years in which &quot; correctives &quot; would prevent our percentage share from increasing more than marginally;and that there would be a special review provision which we couldinvoke at any time if the burden of our net contributions to thebudget threatened to become intolerable. He was proposing tomake an opening bid on these lines but for a key of 13 to 15 percent instead of 17 per cent. If we eventually secured agreement toa key of 17 per cent our net contribution in, for example, the sixthyear would be about  215 million, assuming that the total community budget had risen by then to about $4,500 million, and the totalbalance of payments cost of membership in that year would be about 460 million. These figures should be compared with theCommission^ proposals to the Six which had become public knowledge and which would involve us in a net contribution to theCommunity budget in the sixth year of about  470 million on thesame assumptions. In considering the balance of payments costsinvolved it was also necessary to take account of possible increases in growth of real resources which would stem from our membership of the Community and how much of this additional growth couldbe diverted to meet the additional balance of payments costs. the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the debate on the previous administration^ White Paper about Britain and the european communities (Cmnd. 4289) in February 1970, had pointed out thatif the United Kingdom growth rate increased as a result of entryby \ per cent a year we should have an extra  1,100 million a year of real income at the end of five years and an extra  2,700 million a year at the end of 10 years from which the balance of paymentscosts could be met. The estimates of the likely cost on current account to our balance of payments were, of course, extremelyspeculative depending both on the total Community budget andthe proportion of that budget that would be spent on agriculture in years when we should be members and able to influence thesematters. The economic advantages to be gained from entry had proved impossible to quantify but even if they were only half asmuch as Mr. Roy Jenkins had suggested in February 1970 theywould still provide sufficient real resources to meet the estimatedcosts which were incidentally substantially less than those suggestedin the previous Administration^ White Paper. Because of theunpredictability of the costs and the benefits it was important tosecure provision for a review of our contributions at any time after our accession.  But in practice whether there was a formal review
clause or not we should no doubt follow Community precedent and demand special reimbursements or, in the last resort, refuse to payif the cost of entry at any time became intolerably large. he accordingly asked his colleagues to agree that we should make our proposals on Community finance known to the Community by18 December before the negotiations were adjourned until January.We had agreed at the Ministerial Meeting on 27 October to table all our main negotiating bids before the end of this year. If we did nottable our bid on Community finance on 18 December it would giverise to adverse comment and speculation as well as slowing down the whole pace of the negotiations which it was desirable to concludeon all matters of substance by next summer. Once we had made our opening bid the Government would be able to emphasise theeconomic benefits of entry which for negotiating reasons it had notbeen possible to stress up till now. The Lord President had indicated that a debate on the negotiations should take place shortly after Parliament resumed after the Christmas Recess and it wouldbe possible then to make a reasoned explanation of the case for entry. If the Cabinet agreed that we should table our opening bidin Brussels by 18 December he hoped it would be possible for himto make a statement to the House rather than to the Press simultaneously.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although it was possible to construct plausible estimates ofthe potential balance of payments costs of our entry into theCommunity, any forecast of the likely magnitude of the dynamicbenefits was bound to be much more speculative. It seemed areasonable judgment, however, that these benefits would be substantial and that our economic growth rate would be significantlyhigher within the Community than if we remained outside. It wasalso probable that the official estimates of the costs had madeinsufficient allowance for the expansion of domestic food production which could be achieved. Even if substantially faster economic growth were achieved, however, the Government would probablystill find it necessary to take severe measures in order to bring aboutthe switch of resources required to meet the balance of paymentscost. Indeed, if the. balance of payments costs built up too rapidly in the early years of our membership, the measures of economicrestraint that would have to be taken might largely offset the stimulus to faster growth created by our entry. The report by officials had not taken into account the effect of freeing capital movements which might increase the total balance of payments costby up to  100 million by the end of the transitional period. On theother hand, if we found that a difficult balance of payments situation was developing as a result of the burden of our net contributions to
the Community budget, it would be open to us at any time to requesta review of the Community&apos;s financial arrangements.(b) Once detailed proposals, such as those recommended by theChancellor of the Duchy, had been presented to the Six, the domesticopponents of our entry into the Community would rapidly be ableto calculate that our net contributions to the Community&apos;s budgetwould probably build up to a substantial level (which they would seek to exaggerate). Moreover, the Government would almost certainly be obliged to disclose our own estimate of the likelybalance of payments implications of our proposals. It would therefore be essential that the Government should be able to presenta convincing case, showing in what way these balance of paymentscosts would be met and why, despite these costs, entry into theCommunity would still be to our economic advantage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasnot necessary for the Cabinet to reach a final decision at this stage onthe question of whether we should be prepared in the last resort toaccept the terms which the official assessment suggested were themost favourable we were likely to obtain from the Six in any settlement of the Community finance issue. A more detailed examination of all the relevant factors would be required before itcould be decided whether the balance of payments burden implied by such terms would or would not be a tolerable one. It was not,however, suggested that the burden would so clearly be intolerablethat no useful purpose would be served by continuing thenegotiations. In these circumstances, the Cabinet agreed that ourdetailed proposals on Community finance should be presented tothe Six by 18 December, since otherwise there would be a serious risk of loss of momentum in the negotiations and there might alsobe damaging speculation that delay had arisen because we doubtedour ability to bear the cost of our entry into the Community. TheCabinet also accepted the Chancellor of the Duchy&apos;s judgment thatin view of the position reached in the negotiations it would be rightto propose that our contributions to the Community budget shouldbuild up by equal steps over a period of five years to a base keylevel of 13 to 15 per cent; that they should be subject to correctivesfor a further three years thereafter; and that there should be asuitable review provision whose terms would enable us to invokeit at any time that we needed to do so. But the Cabinet would wishto be satisfied as to how our proposals would be presented at homebefore they were tabled abroad. The Chancellor of the Duchyshould therefore circulate, for consideration by the Cabinet at thebeginning of the following week, the draft of a statement on our proposals which he would make, either in Parliament or to a Press
conference, on the day on which our proposals were presented tothe Six in Brussels; the draft statement should be accompanied bysuggested replies to the supplementary questions which would nodoubt be asked concerning the implications of our proposals for our balance of payments and our ability to meet the costs of entry.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up.(2) Agreed that our detailed proposals on Community financeshould be presented to the Six by 18 December.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to circulate, for their consideration early in the following week, a draft statement and notes for dealing withsupplementary questions, along the lines indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up.CONFIDENTIALLockheed/Rolls-RoyceTriStarECGDCover forSubordinatedDebt5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry (CP (70) 116), proposing that theExport Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) should guaranteelong-term lending on a subordinated basis in order to promote thesale of Lockheed/Rolls-Royce TriStar aircraft.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that Lockheedhad asked for the assistance of the United Kingdom Government inenabling Rolls-Royce to counter, as regards sales of the RB 211-22engine in TriStar aircraft, the competition of General Electric inrespect of the credit terms for their engines offered in the DC-10aircraft. For sales within the United States General Electric wereprepared to allow their long-term lending to be on a subordinatedbasis. This implied that, in the event of insolvency or default, thesubordinated creditors would stand out of their money until the senior debt holders had been paid in full. While insolvency of a major American airline was unlikely, there was a real possibility offorced mergers which could result in protracted delays in thepayment of subordinated creditors. ECGD had already agreed to guarantee lending for 90 per cent of the value of engines for theTriStar on 10-year terms from delivery on a non-subordinated basis;and 59 aircraft had been sold to American airlines on these terms,including 25 to Eastern Airlines. It now appeared that the latter would not be able to confirm their option for a further 25 TriStarsunless they could raise additional subordinated capital. Lockheed&apos;sown financial situation would not permit them to support such
lending; and they were pressing Rolls-Royce to provide finance forthe engines on terms similar to those of General Electric. ECGDcould not recommend supporting such lending as a &quot; commercial&quot;risk under section 1 of the Export Guarantee Act, 1965. He therefore proposed that they should guarantee it &quot; in the national interest&quot;under section 2 of that Act. It must be recognised that, ifsubordinated lending was supported in this case, it would probablybe necessary to extend it to other TriStar sales to United Statesairlines; and this could result in total demands for about  100 million of subordinated credit (including  26 million for the proposed arrangement with Eastern Airlines). The proposal had beenconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC),who had agreed that ECGD might be authorised to guaranteelending to Eastern Airlines on a subordinated basis, provided thatthey leased aircraft to the maximum possible extent since this wouldgive us specific security of a share in the leased aircraft proportionate to our financing of the engines; that a degree of security should be negotiated which would place United Kingdom lenders at the headof the queue of subordinated creditors and, in any case, no lower than the convertible debenture holders; that not more than half thevalue of the total sales guaranteed by ECGD should be subordinated;that the balance of sales guaranteed would be secured pari passu with non-subordinated creditors; and that rights of recourse would beretained against Rolls-Royce for all claims paid as a result of default,although this might not prove a very effective safeguard in practice.While there was clearly a risk in supporting lending on these terms,ECGD had confirmed, after consulting the Chairman of theirAdvisory Council, that it was not considered to be &quot; undulyhazardous&quot;; and there would therefore be no obligation to reportthe arrangement to Parliament.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was regrettable that the possible need to put substantial additional sums at risk had not been known to the Cabinet whenthey were considering the provision of additional launching aid forthe RB 211-22 engine.(b) Nevertheless, there was now no alternative to agreeing tothe present proposals if the Government were to entertain a realistichope of recovering their  89 million investment in the engine.(c) While there was a risk that the guarantees might be invoked,the loan was likely to be repaid in the long run. The need forengine repairs and replacements would provide pressure on the airlines to ensure payment.
(d) Our negotiators should insist that Eastern Airlines leasedthe planes to the maximum extent possible.(e) The Governor of the Bank of England had indicated thatthe commercial banks might not be prepared to accept the right ofrecourse against Rolls-Royce for all claims paid by ECGD as a resultof default.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were prepared to agree to the proposals in paragraph 10 of cp (70) 116, provided that this decision covered lending to EasternAirlines only and that they were prepared to lease the aircraft tothe maximum possible extent. The rights of recourse to Rolls-Roycewere likely to be of little value; and, if the proposed provision couldnot be secured, the matter need not be referred to the Cabinet again.The Cabinet-Agreed that ECGD might be authorised to guaranteelending to Eastern Airlines on a subordinate basis, subjectto the provisions in paragraph 10 of CP (70) 116.Cabinet Office,10 December, 1970.
