CM 40 (70)confidential parliamentary 1.   The Lord President said that the Opposition had tabled aAffairs Motion for the Parliamentary debate on aviation supply on Monday,23 November, to the effect that the House noted the decision toprovide a further  42 million launching aid to Rolls-Royce for theRB211 engine but regretted the lack of consistency and effectiveaccountability in the Governments industrial policy for the private sector.The choice for the Government lay between tabling an amendment to the Motion or simply voting it down.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable for the Governmentto table an amendment to the effect that the House approved the government&apos;s decision to continue the established policy of providinglaunching aid for individual projects, and in particular for the RB 211engine, and welcomed the measures which private interests had beenable to take to deal with the remaining problems of the company.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to arrange for an amendment to be tabled on the lines indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.confidential. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that intheir negotiations with the unions representing manual workers inthe electricity supply industry on the previous day the electricity council had offered a standard pay increase of 35s. in basic weeklyrates. This was equivalent to an average increase of 9\ per cent inrelation to basic rates, although it would represent 11^ per cent ofthe rate for the lowest grade. In relation to earnings, however, theaverage increase would probably be less than 8 per cent. The unions had rejected the offer but had agreed to resume negotiations on  December. They had indicated, however, that in the absence of an improved offer on that date they would introduce working to rulefrom 7 December. The atmosphere at the negotiations had notbeen wholly unfavourable, and their adjournment postponed the threat of industrial action by a fortnight. On the other hand their next stage would now come into closer parallel with those on the pay of manual workers in the gas and water industries.industrial affairs pay ofElectricitySupplyWorkersPreviousReference:CM (70) 39thConclusions,Minute 3128813-2
Pay ofmanualworkersin the gas industryPay ofBOAC pilotsPreviousReference:CM (70) 39thConclusions,Minute 3The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he intended to meet the Chairman of the Gas Council before25 November, when pay negotiations were due to take place in the gas industry. He would be discussing the Councils proposals withhis colleagues in advance.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, now that an immediate breakdown of pay negotiations in the electricity supply industry had been averted, he sought authority for british overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) to table their proposals fora settlement with the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) inorder that negotiations between the two sides might be resumed.Continued refusal to allow BOAC to put forward specific proposals might entail forfeiting the present opportunity of reaching asettlement of this longstanding dispute; and the Government wouldbe blamed accordingly. The Ministerial Committee on economic policy had examined boac&apos;s proposals and considered them broadly acceptable, subject to firmer assurances about the proposedsix-month trial period of operating Boeing 747 aircraft with threepilots before the complement was finally reduced to two pilots. But,although the proposed pay increases could be regarded asunobjectionable in percentage terms, the Committee had been concerned about the risk of embarrassing repercussions on other pay negotiations if the high salaries involved were to receive publicitywhen the offer was tabled. It would therefore be important that thenegotiations should take place in confidence.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,although the Electricity Council had kept their initial offer below their negotiating limit of 10 per cent, it was unfortunate that press reports that morning had represented the offer of 35s. as constitutingan increase of that order and had thus made it appear that theCouncil had already reached the approved limit. If not corrected,these reports might lead to misapprehension if the Councilsubsequently raised their offer to the authorised limit, since the revised offer might then be presented as exceeding 10 per cent. TheLord President of the Council should therefore take the opportunityto allow it to be known that the CounciPs offer represented rather less than a 10 per cent increase. It would be undesirable, however,to go further and to quote the lower percentage which the 35s. offerrepresented in terms of earnings, since this would risk confusion andmight imperil the Councils chances of success with the unions whennegotiations were resumed.The presentation of the Governmenfs decision to offer ancillary workers in the National Health Service similar terms to thoseachieved by local authority manual workers in the recent pay settlement should rest on the relationship between the pay of these
Gas andElectricityPricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 39thConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda bythe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (CP (70) 107), theSecretary of State for Social Services (CP (70) 108) and the chief secretary, Treasury (CP (70) 109) about proposed increases in gasand electricity prices and the possibility of mitigating their effects.They also had before them a further memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry (CP (70) 110).The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, if theElectricity Boards were to recover the full amount needed to achieve their financial objectives but also to revert to the 1967 structure of tariffs, the increases for large consumers (who had already borneincreases of about 10 per cent through the fuel cost adjustment)would average a further 5 per cent, while those for domestic andother consumers would be some 15 per cent. There would, however,be difficulty in persuading the Boards to accept increases on thispattern, since they were not justified by costs. Alternatively,without a recovery of the past shortfall on the financial objective,the total price increase would be restricted to about  120 million ayear; and this would imply an increase of  40 million a year in theindustry&apos;s borrowing requirement. A third possibility would be to limit the maximum increase to any consumer to 20 per cent. this might involve a loss of revenue of the order of  20 million a year.A limitation to, say, 15 per cent, however, would involve a loss ofrevenue of  40 million a year or, if any flexibility were allowed in thetariff structure, rather more. In these circumstances the right course was to allow the Boards to put their proposals to the ConsultativeCouncils, subject only to some marginal &quot; shading &quot; of the largestincreases. If, however, the Cabinet felt it essential to limit the domestic price increase, this might best be achieved by accepting a128813-2two groups of workers and should not include any reference to the merits of the offer in respect of lower paid workers.The Ministers primarily concerned with pay questions andindustrial unrest should arrange to meet early in the following week in order to consider the forthcoming pay negotiations in the gas industry, together with boac&apos;s proposals for a possible settlement with their pilots.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
small shortfall from the financial objective and inviting the electricity industry to restrict the domestic increase other than the off-peakincrease below 20 per cent. In this case it would have to beaccepted that further increases might be needed in about a year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be possibleto limit the maximum increase in prices to domestic consumers to12 per cent by raising the total increase in charges to industrialconsumers from 10 per cent to 16 or 17 per cent and accepting anincrease in the industry&apos;s borrowing requirements of  20 million ayear. This seemed not unreasonable. If, however, the maximumdomestic increase were to be held down to 10 per cent, the increasein the cost to industry or in the borrowing requirement would be excessive.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that, in the lightof the Cabinefs decision on the previous day that the scheme forincreased special heating allowances proposed by the supplementary benefits Commission (SBC) should be implemented as soon aspossible, he had given further consideration to the possibility ofproviding some form of interim assistance during the forthcomingwinter for those most severely affected. But the provision of anyspecial bonus related to the rise in gas and electricity prices wouldbe a dangerous precedent. Moreover, the recent increase in therates of supplementary benefit still provided a small margin fromwhich the price increases could be met. Under the SBC scheme all those concerned would be receiving the higher allowances by July;and half of them would be drawing the higher rates before the endof March, i.e. before the first of the quarterly bills reflecting highercharges was presented. In some cases the cost of gas and electricitywas included in the rent, which was unlikely to be raised in the first quarter; and where the supply was regulated by meter it would take some time for the meters to be adjusted. Finally, it would remain open to any claimants who were exposed to genuine hardship to seek an immediate adjustment in the rates of their allowance. Inthese circumstances, and particularly if the proposal to limit themaximum increases to domestic consumers were accepted, it wouldbe inappropriate to provide a special bonus in advance of the implementation of the new scheme.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy should give furtherconsideration to the proposals for increases in the price of electricityon the basis that the maximum increase to domestic consumersshould be limited to some 10 or 12 per cent and that an increase of 20 million a year in the industry&apos;s borrowing requirement was acceptable.   Further consideration should also be given to the

The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP (70) 103) on the payment of supplementary benefit, and PAYE refunds to strikers.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the mainargument against recovering supplementary benefit paid during astrike was that it would seriously damage industrial relations byengendering bitterness which would persist after a strike was over.About 50 per cent of strikers&apos; families received supplementary benefit in the relatively small number of strikes which lasted longer than two weeks; and after such a strike the poorest families would therefore carry the burden of a substantial debt, which would be liable to be repayable over many weeks. Moreover, the measuremight cause members of the Supplementary Benefits Commission to resign on the ground that it represented an abuse of the principlesof the scheme. If, however, supplementary benefit paid during astrike were not recoverable, there was no profit in deferring PAYEpresentation of the proposals and, in particular, to the questionwhether it would be more advantageous to allow the proposals togo forward to the Consultative Councils without commitment onthe part of the Government and to insist on their reduction thereafteror to persuade the Boards to submit amended proposals to the council&apos;s while making it clear that the Government had requiredearlier unacceptable proposals to be modified in advance. TheCabinet agreed that in the circumstances described by the Secretaryof State for Social Services it would not be appropriate to provideany specific bonus during the forthcomng winter for recipients ofsupplementary benefits in order to meet additional heating costs.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theproposed increases in charges for electricity to beconsidered further by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy on the basis indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.(3) Agreed, on the basis indicated in the summing up of their discussion, that no special bonus to meet the additional cost of gas and electricity during the forthcoming wintershould be paid to recipients of supplementary benefits.
refunds. To do so would involve increased payments ofsupplementary benefit during a strike; and, since the striker would receive his PAYE refund after a strike, he would ultimately bebetter off.In discussion it was suggested on the one hand that strongmeasures, such as the recovery of supplementary benefit paid during a strike, were now required in order to foster public confidence inthe Governmenfs determination to redress the balance of powerbetween employers and trade unions, even though such measures were bound to provoke the hostility of the unions. The recovery ofsupplementary benefit would compel unions to commit their funds for long strikes to a greater extent than at present. It might havehad a marked effect on the strike of the local authority manual workers; and its deterrent effect might become more important if,as seemed not unlikely, long strikes tended to increase in number.It was maintained on the other hand that, while there was strong support from public opinion for the measures which theCabinet had already endorsed (i.e. reduction of the &quot; disregard &quot; andwithdrawal of supplementary benefit after a strike except in casesof hardship) there was no assurance of similar support for recovery of supplementary benefits paid during a strike; and a proposal ofthis nature might well sour the atmosphere for the discussion of theforthcoming legislation on industrial relations. Nor could theattitude of employers to undertaking recovery be gauged with certainty. Recovery might indeed affect long strikes. But it waspredominantly the short strikes which damaged the economy; andthe measure might cause a change in the pattern of industrial actionin favour of short strikes and working to rule. There would alsobe scope for evasion, for example by a bargain, as part of a wagesettlement, that an employer would pay off the debts due on accountof supplementary benefit.In discussion of PAYE refunds the difficulties of a statutory provision deferring refunds were recognised. But it was questioned whether employers should feel under any obligation to keep their pay offices open during a strike merely for the sake of makingrefunds. Many firms had to keep their pay offices open for other purposes; but employers should not be left under any impression that they were obliged to do so simply in order to make tax refundsand so to put a striker in a privileged position by enabling him toobtain a refund more quickly than an individual who had becomeunemployed through no fault of his own and could not look to hisformer employer for a refund.In further discussion it was suggested that the implications ofsubjecting supplementary benefit, and indeed all short-term benefits,to income tax should be examined.  To levy income tax on such
CONFIDENTIAL9CM 40 (70)income would constitute a deterrent which might be more acceptablethan recovery of supplementary benefit paid during a strike, since it involved no discrimination against strikers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepurpose of all the proposals under consideration was to redress thebalance of power between employers and trade unions. The cabinet agreed that the &quot; disregard&quot; should be reduced and thatsupplementary benefit should not be payable after a strike exceptin cases of hardship, when it should be recoverable. Legislation togive effect to these measures and to the abatement of supplementary benefit in respect of industrial &quot; misconduct &quot; should be prepared asa matter of urgency and introduced as soon as possible. its introduction might increase the hostility of trade union interestsduring the passage of the Industrial Relations Bill, but on balancethis risk must be accepted. The Cabinet agreed for the present notto undertake legislation to defer PAYE refunds or to makesupplementary benefit paid during a strike recoverable; but theseproposals could be further considered later in the light of developments. The possibility of levying income tax on supplementary benefit and other short-term benefits should beurgently examined. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should ensurethat local Inland Revenue offices were not leading employers tobelieve that they were under an obligation to keep their offices openduring a strike merely for the purpose of paying PAYE refunds tostrikers.The Cabinet-CD Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, as a matterof urgency, to arrange to prepare legislation to reducethe &quot; disregard&quot; to  1; to limit the payment ofsupplementary benefit after a strike to cases of hardshipand to make such benefit recoverable; and to abatesupplementary benefit in cases of industrial&quot; misconduct&quot;.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to (a) Examine the implications of levying income tax on supplementary benefit and other short-term benefits; and to report further to the Cabinet.(b) To ensure that local offices of the Inland Revenuewere not leading employers to believe that theywere under an obligation during a strike to keep their offices open simply for the purpose of makingPAYE refunds to strikers.Cabinet Office,20 November, 1970.
