government cm 8 (70)CONFIDENTIALTne 1.   The  Prime  Minister  said  that,  on  the  eve  of  theParliamentary Recess, the Government could look back on a firstmonth in office which had been overcast by the grievous loss of theChancellor of the Exchequer and had included two serious challengesto their authority in the form of Orange Day in Northern Ireland andthe docks strike. As a result, the pressure on Ministers and departments had been exceptionally heavy. Moreover, the currentestimates of the economic prospect were confirming the publicwarnings which the Conservative Party had uttered &apos; during theelection campaign. It was all the more necessary, therefore, that theCabinet should address themselves seriously to the issues of public expenditure which figured on that day&apos;s agenda, and should arrangefor the major issues of policy which were involved to be examinedcarefully and methodically during the weeks ahead.confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thefirst week after the Recess.If there were pressure for Parliament to be recalled when thereport of the Committee of Inquiry into the docks dispute wasreceived, this should be dealt with initially by reference to the factthat, if the dispute continued, it would in any event be necessary for parliament to reassemble in mid-August for the renewal of theEmergency Regulations.The Cabinet considered the situation which had arisen as a resultof advice given by the Clerk of the House of Commons that it wouldnot be permissible for Miss Bernadette Devlin, m p, to take the oathwhile serving a term of imprisonment. This view was open to challenge; but it would be desirable to make it clear that the decision was a matter not for the Government but for Mr. Speaker. if mr. Speaker ruled that he would permit Miss Devlin to take the oath if she appeared before him in person, it would then be for theGovernment of Northern Ireland to decide whether they wereprepared to release her from prison on parole for this purpose; andthey had been so advised. The situation, however, wasunprecedented; and, if Miss Devlin were in fact released in order totake the oath, this would itself be liable to establish a precedentand to create a new category of Parliamentary privilege.   TheParliamentaryAffairs11427
Government should therefore adhere to their earlier view, expressedin a Motion for debate for that evening, that the issues raised bythe case were for the Committee of Privileges to consider.OverseaAffairsArms for south Africa(previous reference:CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 2)South-EastAsiaSECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a draft resolution on the sale of arms to South Africa had been tabledin the Security Council of the United Nations. Preliminaryindications suggested that it would be strongly worded and might even be mandatory in character. Our acting Representative wastrying to prevent a vote; but, if his efforts were unsuccessful, weshould have to decide whether to abstain as the French Governmenthad already indicated that they would do or use our veto. much would depend on the attitude of the other Security Council members,since this would determine both the content of the Resolution andthe prospects for obtaining the requisite number of votes for its adoption. If the Resolution was not mandatory, we might be able to abstain. If, however, it was mandatory, we might have no option but to invoke our veto.In discussion it was urged that we should seek to avoid beingsubsequently accused of failing to carry out a mandatory resolution of the United Nations. The present situation differed from thatof 1963, when the Resolution adopted by the United Nations had clearly had the character of a recommendation, thus allowing us to reserve our position. If there were any doubt whether or not thedraft Resolution was mandatory, the safer course would be to regard it as such and, if necessary, to use the veto. By so acting, we shouldprotect ourselves against the risk of being challenged before theInternational Court of Justice for failing to implement a mandatoryResolution; and we should be in a stronger position in relation to public opinion, since we could justify our action on the grounds thatit was wrong to condemn a policy which was still under consideration and on which final decisions had not yet been taken.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGovernment were committed to maintaining a military presence inSouth-East Asia. At their meeting on the previous day, the defence and Oversea Policy Committee had endorsed his recommendation that the present Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement should, ifpossible, be replaced by a five-Power agreement between ourselves,Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore, which would beof limited duration but would be subject to renewal.   At present
the threat to Malaysia and Singapore was on a small scale, beinglimited to incursions from South Thailand by guerilla forces acting in conjunction with indigenous subversive elements. But this situation might not persist; and it was therefore important to defineour obligations under the proposed agreement with precision inorder to limit our involvement. The Defence Secretary would beleaving on the following day for preliminary discussions with thefour Governments concerned.The Defence Secretary said that in his conversations with thefour Governments the principal points for discussion would be thepolitical commitment to be assumed by Britain and the military contribution which we intended to offer under the proposed new agreement. As regards the former, he would make it clear thatthere was no intention on our part of seeking to play a dominantrole and that we would not assume commitments to Malaysia and singapore more extensive than those which Australia and NewZealand were prepared to accept. As regards force levels, financial considerations and our other commitments, particularly our obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, made it essential that our contribution should be kept to the minimum whichwould suffice to constitute a viable force and to satisfy our partners in the proposed defence agreement of our determination to maintain a military presence in the area. On this basis, he proposed thatour force contribution should consist of one infantry battalion with supporting units; five frigates or similar vessels; and up to fourmaritime reconnaissance aircraft. The cost of deploying this forcein South-East Asia could not yet be accurately estimated; but itmight be of the order of  2-5 million to  3-5 million per annum.This estimate did not take account, however, of the need to providesupporting services and war maintenance reserves, or of the full cost of maintaining the bulk of our forces on an &quot; accompanied &quot;basis (which would be necessary, since the Australian and NewZealand contingents would be &quot; accompanied&quot;). Although hewould probably be pressed to increase our contribution, he would hold out no hope that we might be prepared to improve our offer.In the light of his discussions he would submit comprehensiveproposals to the Cabinet for their approval with the view to theconclusion of an agreement at a five-Power conference early in 1971.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the conclusion of the Defence and overseas policy Committee that the Anglo-Malaysian Defence agreement should be replaced by a five-Power defence agreement on the lines proposed. In his discussions with the other Governments concerned,the Defence Secretary should not commit the Government at thisstage to any precise form or level of British contribution to the
Persian Gulf(previous reference:CM (70) 1stConclusions,Minute 5)defence of the area. A decision on this would have to be deferred until the views of all the other Governments concerned had been ascertained and until the Government had been able to review their defence policy as a whole in the autumn.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the Defence Secretary to be guided, in his forthcoming exchanges with the Governments ofAustralia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore, by thePrime Ministers summing up.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, in the pursuit of our wider objective of encouraging the formation of a viable Union of Arab Emirates (UAE), we were faced with three main problems relations between the UAE and the Shah of Iran;relations between the UAE and King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, withparticular reference to the current dispute between Saudi arabia and Abu Dhabi; and, finally, the problem of allaying mutual distrustbetween the local Rulers themselves and hastening the formation ofan effective association capable of taking the responsibility fordefending itself. He had recently discussed the situation in Brusselswith the Shah of Iran. The Shah had indicated that, now that thequestion of Bahrain had been settled, he would not raise any objection to the formation of a UAE, provided that satisfactory arrangements probably in the form of a token Iranian militarypresence could be made in regard to the islands at the mouth ofthe Gulf claimed by Iran (Tunbs and Abu Musa). The Shah wouldnot object to the Union&apos;s entering into a defence arrangement with britain, if the local Rulers were willing to do so. He would beprepared to accept that its defence forces should be trained andofficered by British officers; he would, indeed, welcome this forthe protection which it would provide against internal insurrectionsin the Gulf States. The Shah would prefer, however, that any suchexpatriate personnel should be engaged and paid by the Union itself.Should an arrangement on these lines not prove to be possible,Britain might retain an indirect presence in the area through theCentral Treaty Organisation, under which joint naval exercises couldbe organised with Iran. Relations between Saudi Arabia and AbuDhabi, however, remained tense; and King Faisal appeared to have little confidence in the good faith of the Ruler, Emir Zaid. In thesecircumstances it was clear that, in the absence of some lead from us,little progress could be expected. It was therefore proposed toappoint Sir William Luce, a former Political Resident in the Gulfand Governor of Aden, to take charge of the co-ordination of generalpolicy in the Gulf area.   In addition to seeking to promote the
EuropeanEconomicCommunity(previous reference:CM (70) 5thConclusions,Minute 5)The Cabinet (4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(5) Invited the Defence Secretary to proceed with the necessary arrangements for the relief and replacement of the battalion stationed in Sharjah.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the initialmeeting on 21 July between the United Kingdom and therepresentatives of the six members of the European economic community (e.c.) had begun with the British delegation stating thequestions which they wished to see covered in negotiation. Theyhad indicated that, subject to the reservations which we had already made known, we were prepared to accept the Common agricultural policy of the e.c.. The delegation had then proposed theestablishment of a number of fact-finding working groups. Therepresentatives of the Six had eventually produced counter-proposalswhich met the substance of our requirements. In general, themeeting had gone well.The Cabinet-(6) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.resolution of disputes and the creation of an effective UAE,Sir William Luce would be responsible for conducting the discussions with our friends and allies in the area to which we were committed in connection with the possible retention of a British military presence in the Gulf. Sir William Luce&apos;s appointment would be announced on 27 July.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatour objective in the Gulf area would be to secure a progressive reduction of our expenditure while encouraging and assisting thelocal Rulers to shoulder their own responsibilities within the framework of an effective federal organisation. Sir William Luce&apos;sremit would be discharged within this context. On present plansthe British battalion stationed at Sharjah was due to be withdrawnin November and to be replaced by a company from Bahrain. TheCabinet agreed that in the circumstances it would be advisable toreplace the battalion at Sharjah, even though this would to someextent conflict with our general objective of reducing expenditure.The relieving battalion would remain in Sharjah for a tour of nine months from November 1970; and this would afford time in which further consideration could be given to the resolution of the problemsof the area.
of theBritish ArmySECRETThe Rundown 4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Defence Secretary(CP (70) 26) covering a draft Parliamentary statement outlining a plan for the remaining stages of the rundown of British Army units which had begun under the previous Administration.The Defence Secretary said that the proposals in his statement were designed to reconcile a conflict between the Army&apos;s need toreduce the number of major units as a result of indifferentrecruitment with the political desirability of meeting some of theobjections to the previous Administration^ rundown scheme, whichthe Conservative Party had criticised when in Opposition. Thepresent and prospective state of Army recruiting made it militarilydesirable to reduce the number of infantry battalions to 46, as provided for in the rundown scheme which the Government hadinherited. Even on this basis there would still be a substantialmanpower shortage in the mid-70s. Two more battalions were dueto disband or to amalgamate with other battalions by the end ofSeptember; and, unless these changes were completed, some units would be left with insufficient numbers to carry out their plannedtasks. This situation, however, had to be considered against thepolitical background, including the reference in the conservative party&apos;s Scottish Election Manifesto to the party&apos;s intention, ifelected, to seek to find a role for the Argyll and SutherlandHighlanders, who were one of the units to be disbanded, and theimpression which had gained ground during the election campaignthat a Conservative Administration would halt the rundown and preserve some of the units selected for disbandment or amalgamation.The arrangements proposed in CP (70) 26 would therefore giveregiments which were about to be disbanded or amalgamated the option of continuing in a very reduced form, with an establishment in the region of 30-50. Such cadre formations could be usefullyemployed on recruiting or training tasks; and they would be thefirst to be considered when improved recruitment made it possibleto increase the number of full battalions in the Army. It was desirable to make a very early statement both in order to allayuncertainty and to enable the posting of men to new units, whichwas currently in progress, to proceed smoothly.In discussion considerable misgivings were expressed about theproposed statement. If Ministers had to reveal that the units beingretained would number no more than 30-50 men, the plan mightwell attract considerable criticism. Moreover, those who had supported the &quot; save the Argylls&quot; campaign were unlikely to besatisfied by such a gesture. Unless the affected units could beretained at something like company or squadron strength, the disadvantages of the scheme might well outweigh the advantages.Doubts were also cast on the merits of the principle on which
regiments had been selected for disbandment, i.e., that the mostjunior regiments should be the first to suffer. It might have beenwiser to relate the plan to the recruiting potentialities of individualregiments.On the other hand, worthwhile military uses could be demonstrated for any cadre formations formed under the scheme;and the prospect of being the first in line for restoration to fullestablishment when the recruiting situation permitted would be a valuable incentive to the acceptance of the scheme. There mightadmittedly be room for argument about the principles on whichthe rundown had been planned. Nevertheless, the Government were faced with a process which was in mid-course; men were beingposted day by day with their families; and it was necessary to decide whether to halt the process or allow it to proceed. A decision tohalt it could only be temporary, since the recruiting prospect madethe plan, or some variant of it, inevitable; and a temporary halt was unlikely to have any effect beyond exacting a heavy price in confusion and loss of morale. A very early statement was therefore very desirable, even if it entailed incurring some odium and disappointingsome of the Governments supporters.In further discussion it was conceded that, in order to overcomesome of the objections which had been expressed, the scheme mightbe amended to provide that in suitable cases the units planned toamalgamate or disband might be retained at up to company strength.It was generally agreed, however, that a variation of the scheme onthese lines needed to be further considered before any public statement could be made.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the difficulties which the Defence Secretary&apos;sproposals, as modified in discussion, were designed to confrontand the urgency, deriving from the stage that had been reached inthe existing rundown plan, of coming to a decision. Further time was needed, however, for consideration of the issues involved; andthe objective should therefore be to issue a statement early in August.The Ministry of Defence should prepare a further paper, to which ministers would give preliminary consideration during the following week with a view to a very early announcement. Meanwhile, it was open to the Defence Secretary to take what steps he thought necessary to minimise posting difficulties; but in doing so he shouldnot prejudice the Governments eventual decision.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Defence Secretary to arrange accordingly.
IndustrialAffairsNationalDocks Dispute(previous reference:CM (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that he would need to make a further Parliamentary statementthai afternoon on the docks dispute, in which it would be difficultto avoid indicating the attitude which the Government would adopt towards the findings of the Court of Inquiry when they became known in the course of the following week. Even if the Courtproposed terms of settlement which might be thought undulyfavourable to the dockworkers, the port employers would have little prospect of securing a return to work on any basis less generous thanthe Court might recommend; and it would therefore be realistic, andmight be helpful, if he could say in the House that afternoon that he hoped that the Courfs recommendations would provide the basis for a settlement and that as soon as they were known he would invitethe parties to the dispute to discuss them with him.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that,while the Cabinet did not dissent in principle from this proposal, itwould be inadvisable for the Government to be too definitelycommitted to endorsing in advance the findings of the Court of inquiry or to commending them to the parties to the dispute asnecessarily the appropriate basis for a settlement.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Employment and Productivity to be guided accordingly.The Home Secretary said that on 21 July he and the Ministerof Transport had sought an assurance from the Transport andGeneral Workers Union (TGWU) about the willingness of dockersto co-operate in unloading perishable cargoes. The TGWU leadershad replied on 22 July, saying that they were prepared to recommendtheir Port Union Organisations to consider favourably approachesby the Port Emergency Committees (PECs) relating to clearlyidentifiable food cargoes of an essential nature which were genuinelyin danger of deterioration. This qualified response was itselfsubject to conditions, namely that the wages, salaries and profitsso earned should be remitted to an agreed charity and that any action by the dockers should be confined to ships at present in port.The letter reaffirmed TGWU approval for dockers&apos; co-operation indealing with such items as emergency medical supplies and food foroffshore islands. It emphasised, however, that co-operation asregards perishable cargoes would be more readily provided if theGovernment exercised their powers to enforce rigid price controls over imported food. The reaction in the Press to the TGWU letter
11427suggested that the general public were not expecting theGovernment to respond by putting Servicemen into the docksimmediately; and at present there appeared to be no specificrequirement for dealing with any really important cargo.The Minister of Transport said that some 220 ships were nowidle in British ports, 47 of them carrying food; and 37 ships wereawaiting entry to ports, 12 of which had food cargoes. Out of a normal work force of about 37,000 at the docks in question only about 500 men were actually working. The conditions attached tothe TGWU letter of 22 July would make the local trade unionorganisations the judges of what cargoes were essential and at riskof deterioration; and this would be unacceptable to the Government.He had asked the PECs to seek local trade union co-operation todeal with all perishable cargoes and to eliminate discrepancies in thetreatment of supplies to and from offshore islands, referring to theTGWU letter in support of both requests. At present there weremarked inconsistencies in the willingness of dockers at individualports to deal with supplies to and from Northern Ireland and theoffshore islands. At Barry, dockers were to consider that daywhether they should unload two cargoes of bananas; and, despite the reference in the TGWU letter, they had made it clear that theywould expect their wages to be paid to them and not contributed to acharity.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, although the pricesof some foods had increased as a result of a marginal reduction inthe quantities available, substantial stocks of the main foodstuffswere available. Meat had come forward both from home producers and from cold stores outside the dock areas. Use of Servicemenin the docks might cause an initial reduction, rather than an increase,in deliveries of meat; and the Government would therefore remain subject to criticism in relation to the higher price of meat over theweek-end, whether or not Servicemen were used at once. Moreover,public opinion was probably not yet prepared for the drastic actionof using Servicemen in the docks. At the present juncture it was more important to seek to convince the TGWU that they shouldretract their unreasonable conditions or to expose their inability to implement satisfactory assurances. They should therefore now beasked for unconditional co-operation in moving food supplies; and ministers should review the situation on Monday in the light of the dockers&apos; response. It was not only the risk of spoiling a cargo whichshould determine the priorities for handling it but the community&apos;sneed for supplies of the products in question. But no real shortageswere expected before the following week; and by Monday theGovernment might hope to know the probable outcome of the
Court of Inquiry. On balance, therefore, it might be wiser not to force the issue to a head before then, especially since there was some reason to suspect that the TGWU leaders and the dockers were notin the mood for long, hard conflict and that they might be readyto settle for a moderate concession.On the other hand it was argued that public opinion wasprincipally concerned about increased food prices and that theGovernment should therefore make it plain that it was the refusal of the dockers to handle food cargoes which was the cause of these increases. This applied particularly to meat, which was clearly anessential import; and the request to the TGWU should specificallyrelate to the need to move meat cargoes, in order to maintainsupplies. Although this might make it necessary to introduce Servicelabour into the docks within the next few days and so sour the atmosphere just before the receipt of the report of the Court of inquiry, this might be preferable to deferring the use of Servicemenin the docks until the following week, when negotiations for asettlement might be at a delicate stage and the demand forGovernment action as regards essential supplies might have becomeirresistible. Moreover, a decision to introduce Servicemen into the docks very shortly after the House of Commons had gone intoRecess would be liable to invite political criticism. The TGWUshould therefore be challenged now to give unqualified assurances about handling specific cargoes or types of cargo.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, on balance, no action should be taken whichwould lead to using Servicemen in the docks before Monday, 27 July.They recognised, however, that, despite the strong arguments against taking action in the coming week which might antagonise the dockers immediately after the Court of Inquiry had reported, theintroduction of Service labour might then prove unavoidable. a reply should be sent that day to the letter of 22 July from the TGWUleaders, making it clear that the Government had a duty to ensurethat food and other essential supplies continued to be available to consumers in adequate quantities. Ministers would consider thedraft of this reply later that day; and they would also need toconsider how best to resolve the problem of disposing of NorthernIreland agricultural produce, on which it was expected that therewould be a request from the province in the course of the day.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to consider later that day-(i) the text of an immediate reply to the letter of22 July from the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union about dockers&apos; co-operation in handling
secret . The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Prime Minister(CP (70) 24) about the economic outlook, by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP (70) 20) about the review of public expenditure and bythe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (CP (70) 22) aboutagricultural policy and proposed changes in support arrangements.The Prime Minister said that in reviewing public expenditurefull account would have to be taken of the economic situation inwhich the Government found themselves, of the economic prospectand of its implications for their policy objectives. The outlook was deteriorating; and there was no present room for manoeuvre. Whileit might prove possible to relieve the economy of some of theburden of short and medium-term debt, our ability to do so while maintaining the confidence of our creditors would in turn depend onthe Governmenfs success in controlling public expenditure andstimulating savings. Pledges to reduce the burden of taxation andto restore the competitive vitality of the British industry could onlybe fulfilled if the rate of inflation was reduced, the rate of personalsavings was increased and a large reduction was secured in the totalof public expenditure on goods and services, not merely in transfer payments. This would require a willingness among spendingMinisters to accept reductions in programmes which from a purelyDepartmental standpoint they would be reluctant to make. Theyshould not, however, look simply for cuts in existing expenditure but for ways in which the reshaping of their policies and expenditure as a whole would contribute to the necessary reduction in totalspending. A major cut in public expenditure was required in orderto provide the room for manoeuvre which the Government at presentlacked and to enable them to adopt the necessary taxation and otherpolicies required for future economic expansion.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had taken as theimmediate target for net savings in expenditure by 1974-75 the figureof  1,700 million, with a start of some hundreds of   million in1971-72.   Some  650- 700 million would be saved by 1974-75PublicExpenditureperishable cargoes, on the lines indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion;(ii) the most appropriate means of dealing with theproblem of Northern Ireland&apos;s agricultural produce, if a request for help was received fromthe Northern Ireland Government.
by abolishing investment grants. The bulk of the saving would,however, have to be returned to industry in one way or another in order to restore company liquidity and to avoid a reductionin investment. While, therefore, this sum might be regardedas available to reduce corporate taxation, it could not be expectedto make any substantial contribution to the reduction of personaltaxation. A further cut of at least  600 million in the programmesinherited from the previous Administration would be needed merely to avoid further increases in taxation. While the remaining 300- 400 million out of the proposed  1,700 million reduction would, if saved in terms of real resources, be available for therelief of taxation, there were other constraints which suggested that even that scope might be reduced. For example, additions to expenditure which had already been agreed by the present orprevious Administration, together with further proposals already in course of development, might increase expenditure by 1974-75 bywell over  100 million a year, without taking into account additional expenditure which might be proposed on primary schools, hospitals,space research or the continued deployment of the armed forcesEast of Suez. In his memorandum he had indicated certain areas where savings might be found within the policies which theGovernment had put forward in their Election Manifesto. Theyinvolved a very large change in the scope and methods of support in the fields of housing, agriculture and industry. But theproposals affecting the social services were comparatively smalland, indeed, would be partly offset by the need for additionalselective assistance. It would be necessary to study the impact ofthe proposals as a whole on individual income groups, particularly those living just above subsistence level. In the long term a majorstudy of methods of financing the social services would be needed.While a change would not release real resources or relieve the pressure on the economy, it would affect the direct burden oftaxation. Further consideration should also be given to theadvantages of selling off some of the capital assets of the nationalised industries which were not directly connected with their main functions; but account would have to be taken of the implications of forfeiting income in cases where these assets weredirectly profitable. Further consideration might be given to largerreductions in expenditure by local authorities; the possible savingsso far identified might reduce their expenditure by some 4 per centin 1974-75. Miany of the proposals would require legislation;and the consequences for the legislative programme would have tobe taken into account. He invited the Cabinet to endorse the broadobjectives for the public expenditure review; to agree that he should seek savings in the directions outlined in his memorandum and that further official examination of the proposals in question should be
urgently pursued with the Treasury; to agree that officials should examine any other areas of expenditure where worthwhile savingsmight be found; and to agree that the results of the review andthe decisions reached should be reported to the Cabinet in mid-September in order that they might be reviewed in time toallow for the publication of a White Paper on public expendituresoon after Parliament reassembled.In discussion some concern was expressed at the limited scope for tax reductions which would be provided even if expenditure was successfully reduced by the amount now envisaged. The Budgetsurplus and the buoyancy of revenue had suggested that larger taxreductions should be possible. Moreover, tax reductions would themselves help to stimulate the economy and so produce faster growth, which would in turn provide scope for further reductions.On the other hand it was pointed out that the public expenditure programmes inherited from the previous Administration would, ifimplemented, have required substantial increases in taxation.Moreover, the scope for reductions depended critically on the degree of pressure on real resources in the economy as a whole and on the relationship between public expenditure, consumption,investment and exports rather than on the size of the Budget surplusor deficit. The pressure of demand was high in many industries;and the rising unemployment figures did not necessarily provide areliable indication of the degree of slack in the economy. This was growing and was currently expected to continue to grow more slowlythan those of our principal competitors. More thought thereforeneeded to be given to long-term economic policy in order to ensurethat the growth of productive potential and its fuller use wasstimulated. This would in time provide more scope for reducingtaxation; but it would be wrong to pre-empt such additional resources before they became available. Nevertheless, even if theGovernment had to accept the present constraints on their freedomof action, they should make sure that the public understood to what extent they had been obliged to cut the programmes which they hadinherited even to enable taxation to be held at existing levels.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It might be possible to realise the value of certain of thecapital assets held directly by the Government as well as by the nationalised industries. Any such proposals, however, would need to be considered in relation to their effect on current expenditure over the years as well as to the immediate benefit from the sale.(b) The nationalised industries would be aware that theGovernment  were undertaking a  complete  review  of  public
expenditure. It would not be appropriate, however, to discusspossible savings with them directly at this stage.(c) Certain of the proposals would have implications for regional development. They might indeed, provide scope for better and more direct ways of stimulating development; but the implications shouldbe fully considered in relation to regional policy as a whole.(d) In the context of agricultural support the Government were committed to replacing the system of deficiency grants by importlevies. The main problems were international and included theeffects on our balance of payments, trade agreements with commonwealth and other countries and the negotiations for entry to the European Economic Community (e.c.). While it might notbe feasible to seek to introduce a comprehensive change in thesystem of support concurrently with the negotiations with the e.c.,negotiations might be started forthwith for the introduction of newminimum import price schemes for beef, cereals and lamb, with theintention of introducing them in the autumn. On the other hand the implications of embarking on an interim scheme in respect ofthese three products needed further consideration. It might,therefore, be appropriate to invite officials to report in Septemberboth on the introduction of a comprehensive levy scheme in, say,1972, when the outcome of the e.c. negotiations should be known,and separately on the scope for interim piecemeal action in respectof particular products.(e) In seeking savings in the fields of research and developmentit would be important to review priorities across the whole field, bothcivil and military. In addition to public expenditure savings therelease of skilled manpower could be of value to industry.(/) The immediate closure of the Open University would notonly imply that money already spent would be abortive but wouldalso entail cancellation charges, of the order of at least  8 million,in respect of the various contracts already made. Moreover,although no undertaking to continue the University had been givenby the present Administration, closure would be liable to be resented.In the circumstances it would be more appropriate to give urgent consideration to the possibility of reducing the immediate intake of students and then to reconsider the role of the University in the longer term with a view to obtaining more substantial reductions in its costs.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the/Cabinet endorsed the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals as regards the broad shape and size of the reductions to be made in public expenditure in the light of the economic situation and prospect.The Chief Secretary should now put detailed proposals to spendingMinisters, in order that these might be discussed by officials and,
subsequently, between the Ministers directly concerned. So far aspossible agreement should be reached in these bilateral discussions;but in any event their outcome should be reported to the Cabinet by mid-September. Arrangements should be made for the Minister ofAgriculture and the Chief Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the President of the Boardof Trade, to give further consideration to both the longer term proposals for the introduction of a comprehensive levy scheme andthe practicability of an interim scheme for selected commodities onthe lines indicated in the discussion. The possibility of reducingthe intake of students to the Open University in the current year should be considered urgently, since a decision on this subject was needed before September. A review of the longer term prospects for substantial savings under this head should be undertaken in timefor consideration in the general review of public expenditure in theautumn. He himself would offer some suggestions about fields inwhich expenditure might be reduced consistently with theGovernments policy objectives; and all Ministers should similarlyreview the expenditure of their Departments, and inform the chief secretary of the areas of possible economy. The inclusion of items in existing programmes was not, in itself, adequate justification for continued expenditure. In all these studies full regard should bepaid to the redeployment of resources to fulfil the government&apos;s policy objectives and to the political and practical problems involvedas well as to the need for immediate cash savings. Even economieson the scale proposed by the Chief Secretary, however, wouldprovide relatively little scope for reductions in taxation; and it was essential that the Governments room for manoeuvre in this respectshould not be prejudiced by proposals for additional expenditure.These should only be put forward where they were genuinelyunavoidable; and, so far as possible, compensating savings going beyond those already under consideration, should be proposed at thesame time. So far as possible all additional bids for expenditure and proposals for compensating savings should be considered in theautumn, together with the proposals for reductions now remitted for examination. In any event, no announcement should be made inthe meantime of any policy changes affecting public expenditureuntil he had been consulted; and Ministers should ensure that fullconfidentiality was maintained in respect of all the matters underconsideration. He would also consider, in consultation with theLord President and the Chief Secretary, how the Government could best make clear the extent to which their scope for effecting taxreductions and for implementing certain other elements of their policies had been limited by the commitments which they hadinherited.
The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Endorsed the broad objectives of the public expenditurereview, including the target of  1,700 million net savings in expenditure by 1974-75, as set out in CP (70) 20.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to discuss proposalsfor reductions in public expenditure with the ministers concerned and to make detailed recommendations to theCabinet by mid-September.(4) Invited all Ministers (i) to review their Departments&apos; expenditure and to notify the Chief Secretary, Treasury, of other fieldsin which reductions in expenditure might besought;(ii) to   ensure   that   no   proposals   for   additional expenditure were submitted except where theywere unavoidable and where every effort had beenmade to find compensating savings;(iii) to be guided in their review of their Departments&apos;expenditure by the summing up by the PrimeMinister of their discussion;(iv) to ensure that no announcements of changes in policyaffecting public expenditure were made without consultation with the Prime Minister and the chief secretary, Treasury.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theMinister of Agriculture and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, in consultation with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the President of the Board ofTrade, to examine the eventual introduction of a comprehensive levy scheme after the outcome of ourEEC negotiations was known, and to examine, and toreport by mid-September on a possible interim schemefor selected commodities on the lines suggested by theMinister of Agriculture.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science, inconsultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury (i) to examine urgently the possibility of reducing thefirst intake to the Open University and to reportthe position to the Cabinet, if possible, in thefollowing week;
CONFIDENTIALBroadcasting 7.   The Cabinet were informed that the Ministers concernedPolicy jia(j agreed that a Parliamentary statement should be made beforethe Recess about the future of the Committee of Inquiry intoBroadcasting under the chairmanship of Lord Annan. The statement would indicate that the Government were not convinced of the valueof launching another major inquiry into broadcasting at the presenttime; that they therefore proposed to release Lord Annan from hiscommitment as Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry intoBroadcasting which had been constituted by the previous government; and that the Minister of Posts and Telecommunicationsproposed to invite the Television Advisory Committee to reportearly in the following year on the main technical issues involved,on the basis that thereafter the Government would consider whether an inquiry into the structure of broadcasting after 1976 was desirable and, if so, what form it should take.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Posts and Telecommunicationsshould make a statement in Parliament that day on thelines indicated in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24 July, 1970.(ii) to consider further the possibility of makingadditional reductions in expenditure on the OpenUniversity and to report the outcome to theCabinet by mid-September.
