CM 5 (70)secret. The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivitysaid that at a docks delegate conference held on the previous daythere had been a narrow majority against empowering the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU)to continue negotiations on the basis of the employers&apos; offer of anincrease to  20 in the minimum earnings guarantee and an additional la week on the &quot;modernisation supplement&quot;. That offer had,in fact, represented no more than a 3-4 per cent average increase inthe pay of dockworkers: had there been further negotiations, theemployers might have improved their offer and it was conceivable that a settlement could have been obtained which would not havebeen inflationary. But the dockworkers&apos; insistence that further negotiations must be conducted on the basis of their demand for anincrease in the national basic rate, combined with their unwillingnessto call off the national dock strike and the employers&apos; refusal tonegotiate on that basis, had resulted in final deadlock. There hadbeen incorrect Press reports that he had promised the TGWU thathe would appoint a Court of Inquiry to examine the definition ofdock work. In fact, all that the TGWU leader had suggested tohim was that he might consider such a proposal at some future date;and he had agreed in principle to do so. Pending consultation withhis colleagues, however, he had so far made no offer of a Court of inquiry to examine the present dispute. But he was convinced thatan Inquiry must be held; and there were strong arguments for settingit up at once, since it offered the only prospect of resolving the presentimpasse in the negotiations. Some of the port employers, including those who were concerned to avoid unwarranted pay concessionsunder the pressure of industrial action, also favoured the government&apos;s taking an early initiative to appoint a Court of Inquiry.He therefore recommended his colleagues to agree that a Court of inquiry should be established forthwith and that a State ofEmergency should be proclaimed as soon as possible.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould be seen to be taking firm and early action and that it would on balance be best to proclaim a State of Emergency and to appoint a Court of Inquiry simultaneously and as rapidly as possible.Although there was some risk that a Court of Inquiry mightrecommend a compromise pay settlement which would beinflationary, there was a greater risk that, in the absence of any action by the Government, the employers would be tempted to makea further, and unduly generous, offer. It was also preferable for theGovernment to take the initiative in appointing a Court of Inquirypromptly rather than in response to pressure at a later stage; and action on these lines would strengthen the Governmenfs public
position even if the unions refused to co-operate. It would be important, however, that the terms of reference for the Inquiry shouldbe carefully drawn and should be restricted to the dispute aboutpay, leaving other issues, such as the definition of dock work, for separate examination later. The selection of a suitable chairmanwas a prerequisite to a sensible Inquiry; and this should be discussed later that morning by the Ministers most closely concerned, with aview to the announcement of the chairmanship being simultaneous,if possible, with the decision to appoint the Court of Inquiry. Itshould be possible for the Court to begin taking evidence early inthe following week and to report within about a fortnight. It was perhaps unlikely that the dockworkers would agree to a generalresumption of work while the Inquiry was in progress; and theGeneral Secretary of the TGWU might well feel unwilling torecommend this, at the risk of courting another rebuff from themembers of the union. But the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity should nevertheless invite him to do so.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had completed preparations for the proclamation ofa State of Emergency. If the Cabinet decided that this action shouldbe taken forthwith, he proposed to make a statement in the Houseof Commons that afternoon. Stocks of most commodities, includingfood, should be adequate for several weeks; and no immediate difficulties were expected as regards supplies of fuel and power. TheMinistry of Defence could provide troops to begin working in the docks within three to five days of their being authorised to consult thePort Authorities and to carry out a reconnaissance of dock areas.In further discussion it was agreed that arrangements should proceed for the proclamation of a State of Emergency that afternoon,followed by the tabling of the necessary Emergency Regulations,although the precise timing of the action involved would depend onthe point at which it was possible for a meeting of the Privy Councilto be arranged in relation to The Queen&apos;s return from Canada that day. Subject, however, to further consultation on this point betweenthe Ministers concerned and the Lord President, statements should thereafter be made in the House of Commons by the Secretary ofState for Employment and Productivity and by the Home Secretary,preferably before the Lord President announced the parliamentary business for the following week. Arrangements might be made forthe Emergency Regulations to be debated in both Houses ofParliament on the following Monday, the sitting of the House ofLords being adjusted accordingly.As soon as the Emergency had been proclaimed and theRegulations had been laid before Parliament the Secretary of Statefor Defence should initiate consultations with the Port Authorities
on the deployment of troops in the docks. Within the period ofthree days which must elapse before troops could begin to move intothe docks, it should become clear whether the dockworkers wereprepared to resume work while the Court of Inquiry was sitting.If they were unwilling to do so, the troops should be moved in,port by port, as dispositions were completed. It was important thatLondon should be among the first group of docks where troops weredeployed; and this should be possible within three days if required.The Regulations allowed for the use of troops for loading as wellas unloading ships; and their employment need not therefore be restricted to unloading perishable and other essential goods.In further discussion it was the general view that there wouldbe little advantage in arranging for an immediate Ministerialbroadcast about the situation. The possibility of such a broadcastwhen the Court of Inquiry had reported should, however, be kept in mind, particularly if it then appeared that the dockers&apos; unions were unwilling to accept its recommendations. The public presentation of the Governmenfs present decisions would be important; and arrangements had already been made for a meetingof the group of Ministers concerned under the chairmanship of theLord President that afternoon.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that The Queen in Council should be advised to proclaim a State of Emergency that afternoon and thatEmergency Regulations should be laid before both houses of Parliament immediately thereafter.(2) Agreed that a Court of Inquiry, with carefully defined termsof reference, should be appointed forthwith, and invited the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivityto inform both parties to the dispute of this decision andto urge the Transport and General Workers Union tocall for an immediate resumption of work in the docks.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity and the Home Secretary to make statements in the House of Commons, and the Lord Privy Seal tomake a statement in the House of Lords, to this effectthat afternoon.(4) Invited the Secretary; of State for Defence to arrangethereafter to consult the Port Authorities about the deployment of troops in the docks and to carry out a reconnaissance of dock areas.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss the selection of a chairman for the Court of Inquiry with the Home
OverseaAffairsVisit of theUnited states secretary ofStateVisit of theMinister ofForeign affairs of the federal republic ofGermanySECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in thecourse of his discussions with the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Rogers, during his recent visit to this country, Mr. Rogers had expressed the view that, provided that the South Vietnam Armycontinued to receive supplies of arms and equipment from the UnitedStates, it was now capable of offering effective resistance to theNorth Vietnamese and Vietcong forces. The United states administration therefore considered that they could continue withthe planned withdrawals of their own troops. While this view might prove to be over-sanguine, it was in line with what the Presidentof the United States, Mr. Nixon, had said privately to us two monthsearlier. On the situation in the Middle East, although Mr. Rogersdid not appear to think that the recent United States initiative initself now stood much chance of success, it had at least made bothsides give serious consideration to the possibilities of a negotiatedpeace. It might also have improved the, chances of discussion ona Four-Power basis and of effective mediation by the United NationsSecretary GeneraFs Special Representative, Dr. Jarring. It was truethat the Soviet Government had been heavily reinforcing the united arab Republic (UAR); and if, as a result, the balance of militaryforces was altered to the disadvantage of Israel, the latter might be tempted to embark on pre-emptive action against the UAR.Moreover, in this situation, it would become more difficult for theUnited States to resist Israeli demands for further supplies of armsor to use such supplies as a means of bringing pressure to bear onIsrael with a view to promoting a settlement. Nevertheless, theUnited States Administration appeared to think that the SovietGovernmenfs professions of interest in a settlement were genuine.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the german foreign Minister, Herr Scheel, would be arriving in London that day for a short visit. There was some danger that the federal government, in their anxiety to reach an accommodation with theSoviet Union and their neighbours in Eastern Europe, might embarkSecretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of Statefor Employment and Productivity and the Lord privy seal.(6) Agreed that facilities should not be sought for an earlyMinisterial broadcast, but invited the Lord President toconsider, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,the arrangements which would be required in order tosecure the most effective public presentation of the government&apos;s decisions.
secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP (70) 12), to which was annexed adraft statement of the Governments policy on the supply of arms to South Africa.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the defence and Oversea Policy Committee had agreed with the proposal inhis memorandum that some arms supplies to South Africa shouldbe permitted but that they should be confined to arms for maritimedefence. The announcement, which the Government had undertaken to make before the Recess, would be liable to give rise to controversyboth at home and abroad; and his memorandum therefore set beforethe Cabinet the arguments for and against the policy proposed. ThePrime Ministers messages to his Commonwealth colleagues and the approaches to other countries outlining the new policy had met witha mixed response. Though the possibility could not be altogetherexcluded, there was at present no indication that any country would go so far as to leave the Commonwealth. Some might boycott theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in Singapore in January1971 in protest; and we could expect to encounter criticism on that occasion. But the French Foreign Minister, with whom he hadon courses which would prejudice Western interests, in particular-the maintenance of the quadripartite status of Berlin. Our anxietieson this score were shared by the United States and french governments; and he therefore proposed to raise the subject ofGermany&apos;s Eastern policy with Herr Scheel during the discussions which he would be having with him.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the atmosphere of the discussions which he had had in Paris with theFrench Foreign Minister, M. Schumann, had been cordial and thatthe French Government were clearly glad to have established contact with the new British Administration. There had been some indications that they were disturbed by the position of preponderancewhich the German Government were acquiring in the european economic Community and that they were now more alive than hitherto to the advantages of British membership of the community as a possible counterweight to German influence.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.
discussed the matter on the previous day, had expressedunderstanding of our attitude. On the other hand, severalGovernments, principally African, had on the previous day drawnthe Security Councifs attention to the failure of some member states to honour the South African arms embargo; and although this actionappeared to be directed against those countries already supplyingarms to South Africa and not against the United Kingdom, it might eventually lead to a Security Council Resolution, which we mighthave to veto.In discussion the Cabinet recognised that there were certain risksin pursuing the policy advocated. There was a possibility of censurein the United Nations, where we could not expect United states support and might again face a situation in which our actions andthose of other European Powers were being judged by differentstandards. Political reprisals by the African commonwealth countries were also possible, e.g. action against British residents orthe expulsion of African Asians who held United Kingdom passports.Action against our economic interests must similarly be envisaged;and both our investment in Africa north of the Zambesi and our trade might be in some jeopardy. Any threat arising out of thewithdrawal of sterling balances could, however, be countered byinvoking the facilities open to us under the Basle Agreements.Against these risks there had to be set the fundamentalinconsistency of adopting a policy which, while relying on the SouthAfrican Government to play a part in the defence of the Cape sea route, denied them the means with which to do so. considerations of British defence interests required the Government to follow theline which the Conservative Party had advocated while in Opposition;and, if the Government were now influenced by pressure from theNew Commonwealth countries on this issue, they could expect to be subjected to further pressure on other issues in future.The following additional points were made in discussion (a) It was unlikely that any friction generated by the new policy would create any opportunities for Soviet or Chinese penetration of africa which would not be exploited in any event. The action ofTanzania in accepting a Chinese naval mission demonstrated that a conciliatory policy on our part was not necessarily an insurance against risks of this kind.(b) The United States Government did not wholly share ourview of the strategic importance of the Cape route. They would not themselves supply arms to South Africa and could not give us any public support if we chose to do so. This divergence in policy,however, could be explained in terms of the internal racial tension in the United States and the relatively small interest of the UnitedStates Government in the trade routes round the Cape.
b(c) A number of back-bench Conservative Members ofParliament, who were inclined to oppose a policy even of limitedarms supply to South Africa, had tabled a Motion in the House ofCommons condemning apartheid and proposing that, if arms were supplied, they should not be such as could be used to enforce thispolicy or could be employed against African countries north of theZambesi.  This Motion might be helpful rather than the reverse.(d) Certain indications that the South African government wished to revise the Simonstown Agreement should not be interpreted as implying that they wished to denounce it. Their aim was more probably to ensure that their right to purchase arms for the purposesof the Agreement would be expressly recognised and to safeguardtheir arms supplies against possible variations in policy. It wouldbe desirable, however, that, before the policy under discussion was announced, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should explain to the South African Ambassador our need for an assurance that south Africa would not seek any fundamental alterations in the simonstown Agreement and for some action or undertaking on SouthAfrica&apos;s part which would make it easier for the Government to demonstrate the correctness of their policy and to allay the fearswhich might be expressed about its implications.(e) The Attorney-General had yet to complete his considerationof the legal obligations implicit in the Simonstown Agreement and subsequent intergovernmental exchanges on the matter of arms supplies. It was by no means certain, for example, that we were free,in the terms of these undertakings, to refuse the supply of anti-submarine helicopters for use with the frigates supplied under the simonstown Agreements.In further discussion, a number of amendments to the draft statement were suggested with a view to improving the presentation of the Governmenfs case and emphasising the restricted nature ofthe action which we now intended to take.As regards the timing of the statement, there was generalagreement that, despite the possibility that an announcement might provoke some demonstration by New Commonwealth representatives at the Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh, the only feasiblearrangement would be for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto make the announcement on Monday, 20 July, leaving time for aGovernment Amendment to be put down to the Opposition Motionwhich it was expected would be debated on 22 July.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should announce the Governmenfs policy, on the broad linesadvocated in CP (70) 12, in the House of Commons on 20 July.
confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the rearrangement of thebusiness to be taken in Parliament in the following week, whichwould be required in the light of their decisions about action inrelation to the dock strike and about the supply of arms to SouthAfrica. As a result the Motions on the Parliamentary ConstituenciesOrders which it had been intended to move on 21 July would now have to be deferred until after the Summer Recess; but it should bemade clear, if necessary, that this did not indicate any weakening of the Governmenfs determination to secure Parliamentsendorsement of these Motions.The Cabinet agreed that the issue raised by a Motion on theOrder Paper in the name of Mr. Arthur Latham, m p, about therights of Members of the House of Commons who had been committed to prison should be referred to the Committee of privileges. The Home Secretary would give further consideration,if necessary, to the facilities which might be accorded toMiss Bernadette Devlin, mp, in order to enable her to continue todischarge her duties to her constituents so far as possible while serving a term of imprisonment.ParliamentaryAffairsThe text of his statement should be revised in the light of thediscussion; and the final version should be circulated to himself andto the other Ministers principally concerned. Preparations for this statement, and for the debate which was likely on 22 July, shouldtake account of the Attorney-General&apos;s considered views on the government&apos;s legal obligations under the Simonstown Agreement.Consideration should also be given to the possibility that the BBCs&quot; Panorama &quot; programme, which would also be dealing with SouthAfrica on 20 July, might afford a suitable opportunity of presenting the Governmenfs case; and the Lord President of the council should discuss arrangements to this end with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary. He would arrange for a ministerial committee to be set up to deal with contentious points arising fromapplications for arms exports licences, including those related to the implementation of the Governmenfs policy towards South Africa.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toarrange for a revised version of the proposed statement to be circulated to the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for Defence, the Minister of Technology, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Attorney-General.
confidential. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the bilateral meeting arranged in Brussels for 21 July between representatives of the United Kingdom and the six member Statesof the European Community (e.c.) would be the first occasion onwhich we might hope to initiate negotiations on our application tojoin the Community. The Ministerial Committee on the approach to Europe (AE) had agreed that the Governments objective at themeeting should be to persuade the Six to set up joint official workinggroups to begin a factual examination of seven of the problems whichwould have to be dealt with during the negotiations. These werethe Community&apos;s budgetary arrangements and the consequences ofthe common agricultural policy for agriculture and food in an enlarged Community; the consequences of the enlargement of the eec in the dairy product sector; the consequences of enlargementin the sugar sector; the common external tariff; the European coal and Steel Community; Euratom; and the preparation of the necessarytranslations of the relevant Treaties and Community Decisions. Theseseven subjects for factual examination by official working groups,which had been agreed by AE, represented a considered selection of domestic and Commonwealth issues. We had learned, however,that the Six might well not agree to proposals for the establishmentof any working groups in July and might seek to postpone a decisionon working arrangements until the next bilateral Ministerial meeting in early October. In the circumstances he hoped that he would begiven discretion, in the light of the attitude adopted by the Six on21 July, to settle for the most satisfactory arrangements possible forthe early progress of the negotiations, on the understanding that hewould enter into no new commitments relating to our negotiating position or objectives. He would almost certainly need, however,to reaffirm that the Government accepted in principle the common agricultural policy of the e.c..The Cabinet agreed that it would be desirable to inform parliament before the Recess that the Government intended tointroduce in the current Session measures of support for the coalindustry designed to ease the industry&apos;s contraction, on the lines ofthe Bill which had been introduced by the previous Government andhad been given an unopposed Second Reading in April. But furtherconsideration might need to be given to the detailed provisions ofthe new Bill before it was introduced; and the Government shouldnot accept at this stage any commitment on this point which might prejudice their forthcoming review of public expenditure as a whole.
The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatat this stage the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would be discussing procedural arrangements with the Six. The Cabinet wouldhave an opportunity to consider the United Kingdom&apos;s mainnegotiating objectives before substantive negotiations began. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should have the discretionfor which he had asked at the meeting with the Six on 21 July.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Decision inGovernmentCONFIDENTIALAnalysis and 6.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP (70) 11) outlining the action which was envisaged togive effect to plans prepared by the Conservative Party in Oppositionfor the improved management of Government business, based on areinforcement of the machinery for reaching decisions on complexissues and on the active participation of businessmen in this process.The Lord Privy Seal said that a team of consultants, led byMr. R. A. Meyjes, was being recruited and would be at the disposalof all Ministers in order to help them to carry out investigations andstudies in a wide variety of areas of Government activity. The workof this team, who would be based in the Civil Service Department,would be directed by a small Committee of Ministers under thechairmanship of the Prime Minister, which would be concerned toreceive and, where appropriate, to initiate proposals for individualproject studies and to supervise their implementation. The firstproject of this kind, which had already been authorised, involved an inquiry, in collaboration with the Public Sector Group of theTreasury, into means of improving the Group&apos;s capability in itsanalysis of public sector expenditure programmes. Several other projects had already been identified, relating to procurement,manpower services, computer services and research and developmentactivities. Specific proposals in each case would be submitted to thePrime Ministers Committee in due course.Further action would be required to complete the centralcapability for decision-making which, it was envisaged, should be developed within the Cabinet Office to meet the needs of the cabinet as a whole. The nature and functions of the machinery requiredfor this purpose were under active consideration; and proposals would be submitted to the Prime Ministers Committee at the latestby 1 October. They would draw upon the experience of the team of businessmen;  and they would  also  take  account of the
interdepartmental staffs which had been created in the Cabinet Officeto provide advice and support to the Committees responsible for developing forward thinking in broad areas of policy.These studies would need the active co-operation of all departments and should be co-ordinated with any similar activities which individual Ministers might wish to promote within their ownDepartments. It would be important, therefore, that ministers should consult the Civil Service Department before recruitingbusinessmen for major management studies or undertaking suchstudies by other means, e.g. by the use of management consultants.Meanwhile, the new proposals would supersede the work of theCommittee under Sir Robert Bellinger which the previous government had established in pursuit of economies in Civil service manpower; and it had fortunately proved possible to bring thisCommittee to an end in an atmosphere of goodwill.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet welcomed the progress made in launching this enterprise,which should prove increasingly valuable as it developed, particularlyin relation to the review of public expenditure. In the meantimeMinisters should encourage their Departments to introduce modernmanagement methods, without necessarily waiting for a lead fromthe centre. They should consult the Lord Privy Seal, however, about any proposals which would involve the use of businessmen withinDepartments, although other forms of contact, for instance throughadvisory bodies, should be maintained normally. It would be helpful if arrangements could be made for the leader of the business teamto meet both the Minister of Technology and the President of theBoard of Trade in the near future.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of CP (70) 11 and of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.16 July, 1970.
