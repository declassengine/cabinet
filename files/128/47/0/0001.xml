CM 1 (70)secret. The Prime Minister extended a welcome to his colleagues in the new Cabinet; and the Home Secretary, on behalf of theCabinet, tendered their warm congratulations to the Prime minister on leading them to victory in the recent General Election.The Prime Minister said that he intended, with the co-operationof his colleagues, that the Government should be seen to adopt fromthe outset a new style of administration and a fresh approach to theconduct of public business. They should seek to establish a practiceof deliberate and considered working, avoiding precipitate reactions to events and hasty or premature declarations of policy. ministers should not allow it to be assumed that they were necessarilyinheriting personal commitments entered into by their predecessors;and they should be equally careful to avoid incurring commitments of their own without adequate forethought. There should be a cleanbreak, a fresh start and a new method of administration.Meetings of the Cabinet would normally be held on Thursdays,with additional meetings on Tuesdays, if necessary. But the Cabinetagenda should be reserved, so far as possible, for basic questionsof substantive policy and political strategy; and the more detailed consideration of specific issues should be delegated to the appropriateCabinet Committees, which would be established as rapidly aspossible.A memorandum on &quot; Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot;would shortly be circulated with his personal authority. He askedall Ministers to study it carefully and to ensure that they and theirjunior Ministers were guided by it at all times. He commended totheir particular attention the section dealing with the need to make such dispositions as regards their private interests as would be consistent with the accepted conventions of Ministerial propriety.He asked them also to pay full regard to the section dealing with security. The new Administration were committed to a policy of open and candid government; and it was important that they shouldbe seen to put this concept into effect. At the same time, ministers should be careful not to permit it to become the excuse for anyinvasion of their own confidential discussions or any speculationabout the manner in which the Government conducted their affairs.The unity of a Government depended very largely on the relationship of trust and mutual confidence between colleagues; and ministers should be concerned at all times to maintain the standard of discretion which this relationship required.He had made it clear to each member of the Administration, onoffering him appointment, that it might prove desirable in due course to make certain changes in the machinery of government. But these11420
would require further consideration; and the necessary time mustbe allowed for this. The Governmenfs information services,however, would be in the general charge of the Lord President, whowould be responsible for reviewing the existing arrangements andfor ensuring the maintenance of adequate co-ordination, while leaving with Departmental Ministers the main responsibility fortheir own public and Parliamentary statements. The new PressOfficer at No. 10, whose appointment would be announced that day,would assist the Lord President in this task.Further guidance would be issued as soon as possible on theprocedure to be followed as regards the appointment of advisoryCommissions, public Boards, etc. Meanwhile, it would be helpful if Ministers would inform him of any urgent action which had to betaken in this respect and would refrain from committing themselvesto specific appointments without his prior approval.secret parliament 2.  The Cabinet were informed that it was intended to adhere to the date of 2 July for the opening of the first Session of the new parliament, with the intention that it should extend to July 1971,or into the autumn of that year, if necessary. A draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament would be circulated that evening for consideration by the Cabinet on the following Thursday.In the period before Parliament rose for the Summer Recess,probably on 24 July, it was hoped to give effect to the Governmenfsdeclared policy on the introduction of pensions for the over-80&apos;sand on the redistribution of Parliamentary seats. The major bills in the Governmenfs programme could not be ready until theautumn; but every effort should be made to ensure that as manyof them as possible could be introduced immediately after the recess, with a view to receiving their Second Readings before christmas.Negotiationswith theEuropeanCommunitiesSECRET3. The Prime Minister said that it had seemed advisable tothe Foreign Secretary and himself that the Government should accept the invitation from the President of the Council of ministers of the European Communities to be represented at a formalceremony on 30 June to mark the opening of negotiations betweenthe Communities and the United Kingdom and the other Statesapplying for membership. The Cabinet would be invited toconsider, at their meeting on Thursday, 25 June, the text of the
NorthernIrelandMilitaryReinforcementSECRET4. The Prime Minister said that a meeting of the ministers directly concerned had been held on the previous day to consider anumber of problems arising in connection with the situation inNorthern Ireland.Shortly before the General Election the General OfficerCommanding, Northern Ireland (GOC(NI)), with the support ofthe Government of Northern Ireland, had asked for substantialreinforcements to be sent to Ulster during the period of about a fortnight in July in which the traditional marches and otherdemonstrations associated with Orange Day would take place.The GOC(NI), whose recommendations were endorsed by theChiefs of Staff, had asked for five additional battalions to reinforce the existing nine, or, alternatively, for a mixed force of police and troops. The outgoing Administration had been unable to take adecision on this request; but the meeting of Ministers of the new government on the previous day had concluded that, subject to theapproval of the Cabinet, the reinforcements in question should be despatched. They had thought it inadvisable, however, to include a police element at the present juncture, though they had not excluded the possibility of sending police from Great Britain to northern Ireland at a later stage.In discussion, there was general agreement with these proposals.But the maintenance of the garrison of Northern Ireland at itspresent level involved heavy expenditure and imposed a seriousstrain on the army; the reinforcements contemplated could only beprovided at the expense of other commitments; and it was11420statement which would be made on behalf of the Government onthat occasion. A Ministerial meeting between representatives of theUnited Kingdom and of the Member States of the Communitieshad also been provisionally fixed for 21 July, to consider, in theabsence of the other three applicant States, the future conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom. Since this timetable wouldrequire the Government not only to acquire very rapidly a clear understanding of the major problems to be solved in the negotiationsbut also to reach agreement about the basis on which satisfactorysolutions to those problems might be envisaged, the Cabinet wouldalso have to consider on the following Thursday whether it wouldin fact be expedient that we should endorse the provisional proposalfor a meeting on 21 July or whether we should seek to defer theopening of detailed negotiations until the autumn.
correspondingly urgent to seek to devise some new initiative with aview to a political settlement. In addition the security problemmight be eased if some way could be found of ending the traditionaland provocative practice of routing marches and demonstrations byone contending party through the territory of the other; and,although it was unlikely that this could be achieved in time to affectthe Orange Day demonstrations in July, the possibility should befurther explored in relation to the marches planned for August.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the reinforcements requested by theGOC(NI) should be despatched and that they should consist entirely of military units. An announcement of this decision, which shouldmake it clear that the request for reinforcements had been made before the General Election, should be made by the Ministry ofDefence in consultation with the Home Office.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that reinforcements on the scale requested by theGeneral Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, shouldbe despatched to Ulster forthwith.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to make thenecessary arrangements for this purpose and, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, to issue anannouncement of their decision in the terms outlined bythe Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.Development The Home Secretary said that the Government of NorthernPlan Ireland intended formally to announce their Five-year development plan that afternoon. The outgoing Administration had endorsed thePlan, with some modifications, and had accepted the resultantcharge to the United Kingdom Exchequer of some  75 million over five years. The Ministerial meeting on the previous day had recommended that the new Cabinet should adhere to this decision.If an announcement to this effect could be combined with theannouncement about the reinforcement of our garrison in Ulster,it might help to mitigate any hostile reaction in Northern ireland to the presence of additional British troops in the Province.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to endorse the Government of Northern Ireland&apos;sFive-year Development Plan.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for a public announcement to this effect.Future Policy The Prime Minister said that a fresh political approach to theproblem of Northern Ireland was urgently needed. Under theprevious Administration consultation between Northern Ireland and
secret. The Prime Minister invited members of the Cabinet toindicate the position in their Departments as they had found it onassuming office.Economic The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the foreseeablePolicy future there appeared to be no&apos;need for any special measures of demand management. The surplus on the balance of payments should be substantial in the current year and should continue, albeiton a reduced scale, in 1971. The outstanding short-term internationaldebts due to be repaid by June 1971 should therefore present noproblem. Thereafter, however, large repayments became due to theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF); and it would be necessary toconsider in due course whether we should ask the IMF for some additional borrowing facility in order that part of this debt repaymentmight, in effect, be deferred. But one of the main economic problems, of course, was presented by the continuing sharp increases in earnings and prices. In particular, requests for substantial price increases in the public sector, including higher postal charges, would shortly be coming forward. His preliminary view was that theGovernment might be well advised to acquiesce in these increases,as resulting from the policies of the previous Administration.  the longer TermIssues ofPolicyUnited Kingdom Ministers had tended to take place preponderantlyin London. This had inevitably suggested to public opinion that northern Ireland Ministers had been summoned to London toreceive the instructions of the United Kingdom Government; andtheir authority and prestige, which it was essential to reinforce, hadbeen correspondingly reduced. With this consideration in mind, andalso because it was essential that the Home Secretary shouldfamiliarise himself with the local situation, it was desirable thatthe Home Secretary should pay an early visit to Ulster; andarrangements for this purpose would be put in train. The advent of a new Government in the United Kingdom, whose commitment tothe integrity of Northern Ireland could not be doubted, should calmProtestant apprehensions, contribute to a general reduction of tension and present us with an opportunity of making a fresh start,which we should exploit to the full.In discussion there was general agreement with these views,provided that we also maintained contact with the Government ofthe Irish Republic and sought to give them such private reassuranceabout our intentions as was possible.
incomes policy:The DocksDoctors&apos; and dentists&apos;RemunerationForeign Policycritical issue, however, was public expenditure; and he contemplatedmaking a general statement of intent on this subject in the Houseof Commons shortly before the Summer Recess. To this end hewould need to begin consultations with his colleagues in the very near future.The Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity saidthat the major immediate problem which he faced was the threat of industrial action in the docks, in the form either of a strike or ofa go-slow, starting in the following week. The dispute had arisenfrom a long-standing claim by the unions for an increase in the basic minimum wage, which had last been fixed at just over  11aweek in 1966. The basic minimum wage bore no relation to actualearnings; and, if the union&apos;s demand for an increase to  20 a weekwere met, this would not in itself create any problems for theemployers. But it would also affect bonus rates and would thereforesubstantially increase the current level of earnings. His department and the employers were currently considering whether there were other ways of meeting the union&apos;s demand which would not have such serious repercussions on the level of earnings; but he would encourage the employers to conduct the negotiations as far aspossible on their own responsibility, without leaning too heavily on government assistance and advice. Otherwise, the main wage and salary claims in the next few months were in the public sector,representing attempts to catch up with the gains which had alreadybeen made in the private sector.The Prime Minister said that the British Medical association would be acting unreasonably if, as had been suggested, they decidedat the end of the week to take further harassing action in supportof their salary claims. The Association should therefore be told that the new Administration must be given a reasonable period toconsider the situation; and they should be left in no doubt that theGovernment were not necessarily committed to the policy of theprevious Administration in this matter and would not be influenced by pressure into reaching a hasty decision. The ministers immediately concerned should give further consideration to thequestion, on the basis of a memorandum which the Secretary ofState for Social Services was preparing.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thequestions of foreign policy requiring early consideration included the situation in the Middle East, Rhodesia and the supply of arms to South Africa. In the Middle East differences were developingbetween the Persian Gulf States and the Shah of Iran as regardsoil exploitation under the waters of the Gulf; and this question would need to be kept under review. The possibility that the government might restore the supply of arms to South Africa had already
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23 June, 1970.provoked some speculation in the Press; but he had made it clearthat this question would have to be dealt with through the normaldiplomatic channels.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be helpful if Ministers could let him have, if possible by theend of the week, a brief note, listing the main issues of Departmentalpolicy on which decisions would be required during the next fewmonths and indicating broadly the degree of urgency attaching to each of them.
