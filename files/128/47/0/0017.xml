Acts ofViolenceagainst civil aircraft(previous reference:CM (70) 16thConclusions,Minute 1)CM 17 (70)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, summarisingdevelopments since the Cabinefs last meeting, said that, largelyas a result of the pressure exerted by the five Power group inBerne, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had now agreed to resume an active role as an intermediary in discussions with the Arab Fedayeen organisation, the Popular Front for the liberation of Palestine (PFLP), about the liberation of the hostagesheld by the PFLP in Jordan. M. Jacquinet, who had been in chargeof ICRC activities in Amman since the departure of M. Freymondand M. Rochat, would be seeing the Prime Minister of Jordan andthe Fedayeen that day; and the ICRC representative in Cairo,M. Boisard, a competent official with considerable experience in negotiation for the exchange of prisoners between the United arab republic and Israel, would be reaching Amman on 16 September.The ICRC were thus back in action. This was a step in the right direction, although it was unfortunate that 24 hours would be lost.It was believed that our hostages had now been transferred tosomewhat more comfortable accommodation in a house in Amman.Their position, though still precarious, was at least no worse than ithad been; and they appeared to be in no immediate danger, although they would, of course, be at risk if there were further clashes betweenthe Jordanian regular forces and the Fedayeen. The PFLP now appeared to be insisting on holding the Western, as well as the Israeli,hostages until both the seven Fedayeen prisoners held in europe and the far greater number of prisoners held in Israel had been released. They had so far been reluctant to produce a list of the israeli-held prisoners whose return they wished to secure, on thegrounds that no useful purpose would be served by their doing sountil the Government of Israel had at least declared their willingness to negotiate and that, if they produced a list at the present stage,the Israeli authorities might use it to take vengeance on the individuals whom it named. The statements which had appeared in the Press and elsewhere that the PFLP had &quot; closed the door to allmediation efforts and contacts &quot; had probably to be interpreted inthis sense and did not necessarily imply that all possibilities of further negotiations were now precluded. But any progress wouldhenceforward depend on whether the Government of Israel wouldbe ready to negotiate about the release of prisoners whom they held.In fact, therefore, the PFLP had now adopted the position, whichwe ourselves had so far striven to maintain, that any settlement mustbe essentially non-discriminatory in character; and, as a result, thecourse of events and the prospects of the release of the Westernhostages would now be increasingly determined by the attitude ofthe Government of Israel. Meanwhile, the internal political position121436A 2
in Jordan remained obscure. King Hussein had so far refrained from taking drastic action against the Fedayeen on the ground that he didnot wish to compromise his position as the king of the wholeJordanian nation. But his position had been seriously weakened;and it appeared that he could no longer count on the loyalty ofsome elements of the regular army. It was increasingly uncertain whether he could now take effective action to restore the situationor to establish his authority over the PFLP; and it would be unwise to encourage any move on his part if, as seemed likely, his prospects of success were doubtful.So far as the Berne group was concerned, it had so far beenpossible to maintain a united front in favour of a non-discriminatorysettlement. But pressure was mounting in Germany and Switzerlandfor bilateral settlements with the Fedayeen; and, although commentin this country had so far been commendably restrained, similarpressures might soon become evident here also. We had made everyeffort to bring home to the United States Administration ouranxieties on this score; but, although President Nixon&apos;s public statement that the continued detention of United States citizens was&quot; totally unacceptable &quot; suggested that the United States attitude was hardening, the Administration in Washington still appearedreluctant to bring the necessary pressure to bear on Israel.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe situation remained precarious. Although the lives of the Britishhostages did not appear to be in immediate danger, their safety was at the mercy of a sudden deterioration of the situation in Amman andof developments over which neither we nor any of the other partiesinvolved had any control. On the other hand the appointment ofM. Boisard should make it possible to resume negotiations with the fedayeen, if the latter were still willing to treat. But we must seek to avoid being forced into a position in which the Governmentof Israel refused to contemplate the release of any of the prisonerswhom they held, while the PFLP refused, unless they did so,to release the British hostages. For the present, we should haveto await the outcome of M. Jacquinefs talks with the PrimeMinister of Jordan and the PFLP that day and of any contacts which m. Boisard might be able to establish on his arrival on 16 September.Meanwhile, the risk of further seizures of aircraft persisted. TheUnited States Government and American airlines had taken certainsecurity precautions, such as the introduction of armed &quot; securitymarshals &quot; in civil aircraft, which had been widely publicised. Therewould be public criticism if it were thought that the BritishGovernment, civil aviation authorities and airlines had been anyless active. Progress in this context should therefore be reviewedforthwith; and urgent consideration should be given to action to
public expenditure(previous reference:CM (70) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)GeneralSECRET*2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda on public expenditure by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP (70) 38) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP (70) 39).The Prime Minister said that the previous day&apos;s discussion had emphasised the need to secure a reasonable balance between theproposed reductions in social expenditure and other public expenditure savings, in particular by securing a significant reductionin Government services in support of industry; and the desirabilityof presenting the savings anticipated from the reshaping of thehousing finance system, as flowing from a major change of policyrather than primarily from the Governmenfs wish to cut public expenditure. He had discussed the first point with the Minister of technology, who had agreed that it was necessary to secure by1974-75 a reduction of  50 million in Exchequer financing of nationalised industries&apos; investment, and of  100 million in theMinistry&apos;s other vote expenditure. The Minister of Technologywould accordingly now continue his detailed re-assessment of thevalue of the different items of public expenditure in question, so thatthe necessary reductions in Government-provided services should bebased on a rational examination of priorities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in general it was important to demonstrate that the public expenditure reductions which the Government made were based on their political philosophyand the pledges they had made at the time of the general election and had not been forced on them by any economic crisis. He andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, had discussed with the Minister of housing and Local Government the radical changes in the presenthousing finance arrangements which were under consideration. Theyhad agreed that these changes would need careful presentation butthat the White Paper on public expenditure to be published when parliament reassembled would need to reflect the savings these changes were expected to secure in a way which preserved thepublicise, subject to security considerations, the measures which had so far been taken.The Cabinet (1) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.(2) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
credibility of the total savings set out in the White Paper whilstputting them into the context of the Governments major policies.The Minister of Housing and Local Government accordingly intendedto consider whether, before the public expenditure White Paper was published, he should make a general statement about housing finance,and would be bringing his proposals before the Cabinet shortly.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Defence The Secretary of State for Defence said that the previous government, which had drastically reduced the capacity of the armed Forces during their term of office, had published estimates of public expenditure on defence for 1972-73 to 1974-75 in cmnd. 4234 which, for the three years as a whole, fell some 400 million below what it would actually cost to carry out their defence programme. The present Administration believed thedefence of the realm to be a prime duty of the Government, and the commitments they had undertaken at the time of the general electionwould involve increased costs of some  50 million over the samethree years. To fulfil these policies while containing public expenditure on defence at current levels would therefore mean findingsavings of some  450 million in defence expenditure over the period.Cuts of this order could not be achieved without cutting our frontline defences, though he believed that some economies should bepossible.In discussion it was argued that, while defence was one of the government&apos;s first priorities, it was nevertheless as essential in this sector as in others to secure value for money. Defence expenditureincreased with the increased sophistication of armaments; but similar problems arose in other sectors of public expenditure. It wouldbe desirable to ensure that money was not being spent onunnecessarily sophisticated weapons and to examine whether defence expenditure could be better aligned with the requirements of UnitedKingdom foreign policy. A Government statement on public expenditure which involved heavily reduced expenditure on the social services and increased expenditure on defence would involve veryserious problems of presentation, though these might in some degreebe lessened by bringing out the extent to which the pattern of public expenditure resulting from the cuts involved the redeployment ofexpenditure from defence to other sectors compared with the patternwhich would otherwise have obtained.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that defence expenditure in 1974-75 on the basis of the previousGovernmenfs policies would be  202 million more than in theexisting published estimates.   The Governmenfs election pledges
implied some further expenditure on defence. In order to securethe total public expenditure reductions which the Cabinet had agreed,it was essential to reduce this prospective level of defence expenditure. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Defence should urgently discuss the nature and level ofthe savings which might be achieved and should commission thenecessary investigations by officials.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider withthe Secretary of State for Defence possible reductions in public expenditure on defence on the lines indicated inthe Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.Industry and The Minister of Technology said that be was prepared to agreeTechnology to reductions in his Department^ Vote expenditure (excluding the nationalised industries) amounting to  100 million by 1974-75,though the precise areas in which the savings should be made would need to be determined in the light of his further studies of the majoritems of expenditure. The order of savings proposed would howeverrepresent a very large proportion of his Department^ projectedexpenditure in 1974-75, a substantial part of which was committed to services which it would be impracticable to reduce below aminimum level; and he was concerned that the cuts should be presented in a way which would not damage morale. To that end,redundancy arrangements in the public sector must be improved, inparticular for staffs of the Atomic Energy Authority. He was also prepared to agree to a reduction of  50 million in the demands made on public funds in 1974-75 by the nationalised industries forwhich he was responsible. This would, however, arise in part from proposals for the private financing of their investment which,under existing conventions, would not appear as a reduction in public expenditure. It might therefore be appropriate to review thisparticular convention.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The possibility of making an early announcement that the regional employment premium would be withdrawn or sharplytapered off from 1974 should be considered in relation to the government&apos;s regional policy as a whole.(b) While an inquiry was already under way into the future ofthe Industrial Training Boards as a whole, it might be possible to dispense more quickly with the Agricultural Training Board.(c) Consideration should be given to phasing out theGovernment grant to the British Productivity Council; on the other
hand, this might be difficult before the Committee of Inquiry onSmall Firms had reported.(d) Demand for telecommunications services was at present high, and there were difficulties in obtaining the equipment to meetit. It should be possible to reduce the demand made on theExchequer for investment in this service by some  60 million by raising the test discount rate or target return and increasing charges to the level necessary to achieve it. Increases in these charges were considerably less unpopular than those in postal tariffs; they fellsubstantially on the better-off members of the community. In the longer term the possibility of returning the telecommunicationsservice to the private sector might be considered.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet endorsed the proposal that the Minister of technology should save  100 million a year from his DepartmentsVote expenditure and  50 million on Exchequer expenditure on the nationalised industries for which he was responsible by 1974; itshould be recognised that this would preclude the Government from continuing to provide support for individual private firms whichmight find themselves in difficulty, however strong the pressuresto do so might be; and the Cabinet as a whole would have to supportthe Minister of Technology in explaining that there were no funds available for such purposes. The other ideas mentioned in discussion should be considered; and, in particular, the Minister of agriculture ahould arrange for a proposal for the winding up of the AgriculturalTraining Board to be considered by the Ministers concerned as soonas possible.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that reductions totalling  100 million in 1974-75should be made in Ministry of Technology Voteexpenditure, the precise savings to be settled in the lightof the specific studies which the Minister of Technologyhad put in hand.(4) Agreed that a reduction of  50 million should be made inthe net requirement of public funds for the Ministry of technology nationalised industries in 1974-75.(5) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Technology, to give further considerationto the convention whereby investment expenditure on the nationalised industries which was not financed from public funds was regarded as public expenditure.(6) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange forconsideration to be given to the proposal that theAgricultural Training Board should be wound up.
BThe Secretary of State for Social Services said that he had offered substantial reductions in expenditure in the health and social security field, but he could not finally reach agreement on them until it was clear what offsetting expenditure would also be agreed.On health and welfare services he had agreed to savings amountingto some  60 million in 1971-72, subject to certain exemptions andoffsetting expenditure to protect those in need. These proposals were related to the existing system of financing the Health Service,but he might have more radical proposals to put forward in thefollowing year in the light of studies which were currently being putin hand. Better value for money might also be obtained as a resultof the application of modern operational research techniques tothese services. The health and welfare services did, however, requirevery substantial extra investment, and he would be submitting to theCabinet a proposal for additional expenditure amounting to 200 million a year by 1974-75. For 1971-72 some  35 million would be needed to improve acute medical services, services for the elderly and provide facilities for the mentally handicapped; 10 million towards this might be found by charging for the treatmentof road traffic accident victims, though this was administrativelycomplex. He had agreed to abolish delayed payment of benefit forthe first three waiting days of sickness, though this would be unpopular. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, had asked him to agreethat the uprating of social security benefits in 1971 and 1973 shouldtake account only of increases in the cost of living. He was preparedto agree that the 1971 uprating should be kept somewhere close tothat level, provided that the 1973 uprating could be undertaken on a rather more generous basis; he had put forward certain proposalswhich would have reduced the savings from  490 million a yearproposed by the Chief Secretary to  190 million. He would, however,prefer to use a substantial part of the  300 million which was in dispute, not in a general uprating of benefits, but in givingsubstantially improved assistance to selected categories of those whowere particularly in need, for instance the chronic sick, the disabled,and one-parent households. A small part might also be used toimprove the community services available to pensioners and the disabled. In this way, it would be possible to make a real impact on the conditions of selected groups at a much lower cost than wouldbe involved in attempting to maintain the rate of improvement inthe real standard of general social security benefit which had been set by the previous Government. He was also concerned at the impact of the public expenditure proposals as a whole on familypoverty. He was about to circulate to Social Services Committee a paper outlining a family income supplement scheme for allowances to be paid on an income test to the poorest families with children.
The Cabinet would need to consider the cumulative effect on boththe poorest households and on those just over the tax thresholdof the proposals for increases in charges, withdrawal of certainwelfare facilities, changes in housing finance and rent policies, andthe rise in food prices flowing from the proposed changes in agricultural support. It might be particularly difficult to ensure that adequate offsetting provisions were made for families just above thepoverty level, particularly if it were not possible to increase family allowances at this stage.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that she had been able to offer the Chief Secretary, Treasury, rather largersavings than he had sought on school meals, school milk, further education and library charges. Library charges, however, could be unpopular; it was a new development which might prove damaging to the service, and she would therefore be asking the Cabinet for specific endorsement of the proposal. The proposed increase in thecharge for school meals also involved some difficulties; some localauthorities would be required to charge more than the cost price, theexisting system of charging the same to both infants and olderchildren would continue, and the uptake of school meals might bereduced by up to 40 per cent in the longer term. The proposedsavings should, however, only be seen as part of a generalrearrangement of priorities in which part of the savings would bedirected to tax relief and part to improvement of the primary schools,the Governmenfs main priority in education. She must, therefore,ask to be allowed to make substantial increases in primary school building, and in particular to increase the figure of starts in 1972-73and 1973-74 by a total of  60 million, much of which would havebeen spent before the end of 1974-75; part of the increased primaryschool programme might be financed by a reduction in universitybuilding. Overall, her proposals would result in savings of some 200 million over the remainder of the quinquennium, of whichrather over  50 million might be redirected to primary school building.In discussion there was general endorsement for the broadapproach proposed by the Secretary of State for Social Services tothe uprating of social security benefits and concentration on selectiveassistance for the most hardly pressed groups. Indeed, it was argued,that there was a strong case in principle for relating uprating social security benefits only to the cost of living, particularly with thegrowth of occupational pensions and the need to encourage thosewho could provide for themselves to do so and to concentratebenefits on selected groups. There was, however, considerableconcern about the total effect of the proposals on poorer families,including those whose incomes approached the tax threshold, and
CM 17 (70)about the proposal to require some local authorities to charge morethan the cost of school meals, particularly as it appeared likely thatthis overcharging would be concentrated in the poorer areas of thelarge cities. It was suggested that the possibility of removing thesubsidy on school meals and leaving the local authorities free toprovide them and charge for them as they chose should be considered.The effect on nutrition of the reduction in the uptake of school mealscoupled with the withdrawal of welfare milk and of school milk for older children would not in practice reduce nutrition below thedanger level, but it might well be subject to adverse comment.Similarly, reduction in the average net return to the farmers on milkresulting from the diversion of supplies from the retail to the manufacturing market made it increasingly urgent to take other steps which would raise the return to the farmers.In further discussion it was noted that the reduction in theproposed level of upratings would, however, have certainpresentational difficulties. It had never been the practice to announcefar in advance the scale on which future upratings were expectedto be undertaken, and the provision for this had been made by adjusting the size of the contingency reserve. It was a real saving,and some way should be found of representing it in the total eventhough the practice of not revealing intentions should be maintained.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet should have before them at their nextdiscussion on public expenditure towards the end of September a fullanalysis of the impact on families, particularly those with children,of the proposals as a whole, including proposals for offsetting them.In view of the serious implication of requiring local authorities to charge more than cost price for school meals the possibility ofrequiring the local authority to charge not a flat 2s. 5d. regardless of cost, but the full cost with a maximum of 2s. 5d., should be examined urgently.The Cabinet-(7) Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for social Services and the Secretary of State for education and Science.(8) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Social Services and theother Ministers concerned, to arrange for a report on the implications for family income of the proposals, with recommendations for offsetting provisions, to be circulated to the Cabinet in time for their furtherconsideration of public expenditure in the week beginning28 September.
Rate SupportGrantFurtherProposals for reductions orAdditionalExpenditure(9) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceto give further consideration to the proposed increase inthe charge for school meals on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,following the discussion on the previous day, he had given furtherconsideration to the timetable for consideration of the Rate support grant. It would be possible to submit a paper for consideration on October based on tentative estimates of local authority expenditure.A fuller report could be submitted to Cabinet for final decision on22 October.In discussion, it was argued that the proposal to squeeze theRate Support Grant to obtain a further % per cent reduction in thecurrent expenditure of local authorities, in addition to the specificeconomies in certain services which had already been proposed,would have adverse effects on a number of services to which localauthorities attached less importance than they deserved. Its full implications could, however, be considered further when the paperproposed by the Minister of Housing was before the Cabinet.The Cabinet (10) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to circulate a paper on the forthcoming Rate Support grant negotiations for consideration by the Cabinet early in theweek beginning 5 October.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) Several Ministers had proposed substantial reductions whichwould both be unpopular and have real adverse implications for theservices for which they were responsible . It was important to ensurethat equally rigorous scrutiny was applied to the expenditure of all departments.(b) One possible source for further savings might be the grantsprovided for the maintenance of unremunerative railway services.On the other hand, these were mainly either commuter services in areas where increased congestion on the roads would present serious problems or services in the remoter areas. In any event, it would bedesirable to await the British Railways Board&apos;s corporate plan beforemajor decision on railway policy were taken.(c) It might be possible to make substantial savings by reviewing the Governmenfs property holdings. Plans were in hand for a majormanagement project in this field. The possibility of obtainingeconomies by merging departmental non-industrial staffs in theconstruction field was also under consideration.(d) The Minister of Overseas Development had it in mind tosubmit proposals for increases in overseas aid to the Cabinet for
consideration towards the end of the month. In view of the pressingneed to reduce public expenditure and to limit additional expenditure to the essential minimum, he would reconsider these proposals, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, before submitting them in modified form.(e) A number of the proposals put forward had; been for increases in charges. It might well be that there were other fieldswhere increased charges could reduce the burden on public expenditure. While the Government were anxious to reduce the overall level of inflation, it would nevertheless be right to raise charges to the economic level where this was practicable and could be done without causing undue hardship.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was important that Ministers should ensure that they had consideredfully the scope for reductions in expenditure by their Departments.They should let the Chief Secretary, Treasury, know of any furtherpossibilities which should be considered; he in turn should considerwhether there were any other fields in which it would be appropriate to propose reductions. Any such additional proposals on which itwas not possible to reach agreement between the Treasury and theDepartment, might be considered at the end of September at thesame time as the outstanding points on the existing proposals and onthe claims for additional expenditure, whether requested by individual Ministers or required to offset the overall effects of theproposals on poor families.The Cabinet-(11) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(12) Invited spending Ministers, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, to consider whether further reductions in activities or increases in charges were possible in addition to those which had already beenconsidered.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15 September, 1970.
