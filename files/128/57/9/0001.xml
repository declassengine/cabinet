THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO    37CABINETPUBLICEXPENDITUREprioritiesPreviousReference:CC(75) 25thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cc(75) 39th ConclusionsMonday 4 August 1975 at 10. 00 am the Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(75) 82) covering a memorandum by the Treasury and the central policy Review Staff on public expenditure priorities;  a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Energy (C(75) 83) on economic strategy;a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(75) 87 on public expenditure;  and a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment (C(75) 88) on resource allocation and public expenditure1974-79.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had agreed on 22 Maythats since there was a possibility that the figures in the last public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 5879) for 1978-79 might need to bereduced by some  2, 000 million, the Public Expenditure Survey should proceed in a way which would present the options available to achieve this end, without any prejudice to what might finally be decided.    On14 July they had discussed the Medium-Term Economic Assessmentand the problem of the allocation of resources between the public and private sectors.    No quantified decisions had been reached at that meeting, but subsequently the Cabinet had agreed the statement madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the economic debate on 21 Julywhen he said that &quot;in carrying the reassessment of spendingprogrammes forward beyond 1976-77, there would at best be verylittle room for overall growth beyond the reduced level for that year&quot;.This meant that the Government were now on record that the figures in the January 1975 White Paper would need to be severely cut back.The final stage in the Cabinet&apos;s consideration of public expenditurepriorities would come in the autumn when precise decisions would berequired about the figures.    They did not have to reach final decisions that day, although their discussion would provide them withthe opportunity for moving towards a consensus of view on priorities in expenditure at a time when stringent economies were required.The management of public expenditure had become increasinglysophisticated over the years, and in discussing this subject Ministers
should distinguish between expenditure on goods and services,transfer payments, regional aid and assistance to industry, and theacquisition of assets.    The note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer(C(75) 87) was a helpful description of the main ways in which theclaims of public expenditure and the public sector on the economymight be considered.SIR KENNETH BERRILL said that the memorandum by the treasury and the Central Policy Review Staff (C(75) 82) suggested that the constraints on total public expenditure up to 1978-79 would be verytight and that this made it all the more important to take correctdecisions over priorities.    The present difficulties arose because ofthe very rapid increase of about 20 per cent in cost terms which had occurred in public expenditure between 1972-73 and 1974-75.    Duringthe same period there had been no increase in the Gross domestic product (GDP) (if account was taken of the worsening of the terms oftrade).    Because taxation had not been increased sufficiently to meetthe whole of this rise in expenditure, it had been necessary toincrease the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) to about 10, 000 million, which was about 10 per cent of the GDP.    At a time of relatively low industrial investment and high consumer saving, thiswas manageable; but when the economy began to pick up, the public sector could not borrow the money which would be needed for produc-tive investment, and it would be necessary therefore to reduce thePSBR by, say, a half over three years.    If this were not done, thebalance of payments deficit would worsen and interest rates wouldhave to be raised.    To do it, however, would involve either highertaxation, which would of itself exercise a strong inflationary pressure and have unwelcome political side effects, or a sizablereduction in public expenditure, or some combination of the two.    Ifthe Government were to keep public expenditure at a constant levelover the next two or three years, they had to make a searchingscrutiny of each area of expenditure.    Spending on some items - theservicing of the national debt for example - would have to continue,come what may; but over the remainder of the field there would haveto be overwhelming reasons before any individual spending programmed could be exempted from reduction.    In the past two years the largestincreases in public expenditure had been in transfer payments.Ministers had already agreed to eliminate subsidies to nationalised industry prices and to phase out food subsidies over a period of years.It would now be necessary to review priorities for other transfer payments, and to see how far these could be directed to helping theneediest by being more selective.    Unless reductions could be agreed in social security and related benefits and in housing subsidies, therewould be major pressure on all other items of expenditure.    Areappraisal of expenditure on goods and services should be a majorelement in a review of priorities.    After inflation, the Governmentsmain objectives in the management of the economy over the next twoor three years should be to improve the balance of payments and to
increase productive investment in industry.    Given these objectivesthey would need to pay close attention to public expenditure priorities in every other sphere, including those programmes which were largely in the hands of local authorities.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that as a preliminary to the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of public expenditure he wished to clear upa number of questions which had been raised on previous occasions.First, there were the different ways of looking at public expenditure:a. The public sector&apos;s direct use of resources,,    Adisctinction should be made between i. the direct use of resources by the public sector, ii. the requirements of the&quot;prior claims&quot; (ie the balance of payments and productive investment) and iii. the use of resources to meet the claims of personal consumption.    In the year 1978-79, assuming anannual rate of growth of 3 per cent, additional resources ofabout  1,550 million should be available.    Of this estimatedamount,  500 million would need to go to close the deficit inthe balance of payments,    500 million to productive investment(without which the assumed growth rate would not be achieved),leaving the remaining  550 million for the public sector and increased private consumption.    On present plans public expenditure would increase by if-2 per cent a year on average,allowing an average annual increase of only 1 per cent for private consumption.b. Impact on taxation.    This had to be adjusted to keepthe economy in balance according to the level and distributionof public expenditure that might be agreed.    The main question was: how much of their income were people preparedto allow the Government to spend for them and on them ratherthan deciding for themselves how to spend?       On presentpublic expenditure plans, if indirect taxation were increased in line with inflation, income tax would need to go up to 45p inthe pound.    When graduated national insurance contributions were added, this would mean that the average family would pay5Op in the pound of any additional earnings to the State,    In1955, the two-child family paid 33 per cent marginal tax ratewhen they reached if- of average earnings.    Today they paid35 per cent at half average&quot; earnings.    In 1955, such a familyon average earnings paid 16 per cent in tax.    Today it paid29 per cent.    It was a continuing source of grievance to manyworkpeople, as members of the Cabinet would know from theirown constituencies, that they were subject to such high taxes.
c. Public sector borrowing requirement.    The PSBR wasthe gap between the public sector!s cash outgoings for all purposes and its receipts from taxation and other public sectorrevenues.    At present it was equivalent to about 10 per cent of gross National Product (GNP).    The cost of financing this burden of debt amounted to roughly  2, 000 million annually.    APSBR of this size was acceptable in a recession, but as the economy picked up, there would be a greater demand for investment funds and less private savings, which would reducethe funds available for public sector borrowing.    It would be essential to reduce public sector borrowing to what wouldbe needed for capital formation, and the acquisition of existingassets.d. Manpower.    There was a further aspect of public expenditure which should not be overlooked, and that was theextent to which manpower was being drawn into the public services away from productive employment.    Between 1966and 1973 employment in the public services had increased byabout 700,000.The re had been a growth of about 6 per cent in public expenditure in1973-74, financed by borrowing from the banks with a resultinginflationary increase in the money supply.    In 1974-75 there had been an increase of 8 per cent, financed by borrowing and by increased taxation.    In the current year the Government planned to cut the rateof growth to ijr per cent;  and next year a further reduction was intended.    The Governments aim thereafter would be to containpublic expenditure at the lower level, and the Cabinet had already agreed that it would be necessary to find ways in which public expenditure could be reduced.    They were now for the first timeconsidering the priorities which should be given to different areas ofexpenditure.    There were in particular five areas on which a broadsense of Ministerial views was needed for the completion of the public expenditure Survey.i. size of the contingency reserve.    Last year the cabinet had agreed that there should be a larger contingency reserve.This year the reserve had already been exceeded by some 200 million, and further demands would have to be met inrespect of help to industry, changes in programmes ofexpenditure, and debt charges.    The contingency reservemight well be larger, and more strenuous attempts should bemade to cost those items which were likely to be a charge upon it.
ii. Open-ended commitments.    Attention should be paid to open-ended programmes of expenditure - social security-payments (where the question of changing from the historicbasis would need consideration), housing (where enormousunplanned increases could occur), aid to industry and support for agricultural prices.iii. Payment of benefits.    It would be necessary to decide whether social security benefits should be paid more selectivelyon the basis of need, rather than universally as at present.iv. Economic growth and consumption.    The question here was how far public expenditure should be devoted to theincrease of economic growth (eg through industrialregeneration) and how far to the distribution of the fruits of growth through the social wage.    The National economic development Council had recently agreed that nationalised industry investment should not be used as a demand management tool.    The Economic Policy Committee (EC) had recently been considering the capital expenditure programmes of the industries but had not yet completed their task.    Theindustries had been asked to make cuts of about  125 million in 1976 -77 as part of the cuts announced in April in the budget speech.    EC had approved the commitment of up to 85 per cent of the capital programmes for 1977-78 (70 per cent for BritishRail) and 70 per cent of the programmes for 1978-79 (with no commitment at all on telecommunications).    This left 15 percent and 30 per cent uncommitted, and it would be for theCabinet to decide later in the expenditure review how far, if atall, this margin should be cut.    Aid to private industry wascosting over  L 000 million and raised the question whether some more selective approach was desirable - although neither civilservants nor Ministers were well qualified to make thejudgments greater selectivity would require.    There might bea case for more sectoral aid to industry, as with textiles,A move might be desirable tov/ards the Swedish system ofretraining, which could involve more expenditure on theregeneration of industry at the expense of cuts elsewhere,v. Social expenditure.    The Government lacked a systematic approach to the problems of social expenditure,and on the relative priority of expenditure on cash payments and on social capital.In the past, public expenditure reviews had been based on theassumption that certain areas were sacrosanct.    This year there could be no &quot;sanctuaries&quot; of any description.    If there were to be adraconian programme of cuts, Ministers should also decide the
)   rtpriority areas for expansion when growth became possible.     Thisrequired that ail programmes should be reviewed thoroughly.    Itshould be the aim to reduce the PSBR by half, so that it representedless than 5 per cent of the GDP,In the course of discussion the following points were made in relationto individual areas of expenditure.It was argued that the expenditure on industrial and regional support in the United Kingdom was higher than was customary in otherdeveloped countries, but only because the banking system in the UnitedKingdom was less involved in the financing of industry than was thecase in some other Western European countries particularly Franceand Germany.    There was an argument for trying to organise jointenterprises between the public and private sector.to provide thefinance needed by industry, along the lines which had been tried inFrance and Italy.    Such an approach deserved further study - althoughthe results in other countries had not always been universallyapplauded, being stigmatised as the product of avant garde amateureconomists.    The Government should see what could be done tochannel more money into industrial investment, through the banks and existing institutions - Finance for Industry had already made a step forward to fill the gap in the medium-term borrowing market, andwould be a catalyst for the banking system - and there was a case fortrying to channel private savings, including those of the small saver,into investment also.    Priority should be given to expenditure whichwould help improve industrial productivity, including the provision ofretraining facilities - although it was pointed out that retraining servedno purpose if jobs were not available for the retrained men.    It was argued that the Government must act to maintain key manufacturing capacity through the slump, and not allow it to be lost.    investment in new capacity - by any means whatever - should be a top priority,and if necessary there should be investment controls to ensure thatsuch investment took place.    More generally, it was argued that public expenditure which contributed to industrial growth should have priority over expenditure devoted to the &quot;social wage&quot;.education It was suggested that demographic factors alone would justify cuts in educational expenditure, although it was recognised that theprogramme could not necessarily bear a proportionate cut.    young people who had trained hard as teachers could not simply be told totake other work: it would destroy their morale and the morale of other people working in the education service.    But there was a strong case for reducing the administrative overburden.    Sizable reductions would -juatrial and^ional0;pportSEO;:::;Y
ransportDefenceinvolve difficult decisions on nursery education for example, and itwould be necessary to carry the Party.    It had to be recognised thatthe national birthrate was not the most relevant underlying factor;new schools had to be provided in expanding areas, even if there were no overall growth in the school population.    In particular more money would be needed for the 16-19 age group, which was still expanding.One possible economy would be for the universities to operate for morethan three short terms each year - the degree of use of their capitalfacilities represented a clear       waste of resources and would be quite unacceptable in industry.    It was also argued that, whatever elsewas cut, there should be no change in the pupil/teacher ratio and no reduction in expenditure on the 16-18 age group who leave school andhave no full-time educational contact.It was argued that a distinction should be drawn between expenditure on transport subsidies and expenditure on productive investment.Already the subsidies to buses were being reduced, and this processwould continue;  and it was intended to reduce the subsidy to BritishRail as far as possible.    There was also a strong case for reducing expenditure on the provision ard maintenance of secondary roads,although it was argued that the programme for national roads was nowdown to about the right level and should not be cut further.    there might be a case for seeking economies by integrating the uses ofvarious forms of public transport at present provided separately -postal, school buses, library services.It was argued on the one hand that, if various programmes of socialexpenditure were being cut, it would be politically impossible not tomake some reduction also in defence spending.    Against this, it was strongly argued that if there were any substantial cuts beyond thosemade as a result of the last Defence Review, the standing of theUnited Kingdom abroad would be diminished.    If it were questioned whether such a change mattered, the answer was that it could have adirect effect both upon the level of our exports, and on theGovernments ability to borrow overseas.    Furthermore, the presenttime, when the Government was involved in delicate negotiations onforce reductions in central Europe, was the worst possible moment togive away a major bargaining counter by announcing that significantreductions were to be made in defence spending by the United Kingdom.It was pointed out that in the last White Paper on Public Expenditure(Cmnd 5879) defence was the only programme which showed areduction, all other programmes showing increases of from 29-52 percent.    The United States and our other allies in the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) had been seriously disquieted by theprevious cuts, and further cuts would be liable to alienate them.
ocial Security       It was argued that, although the biggest recent increase in public expenditure had been in transfers, it was not true to say that therehad been a vast bonanza in social security.    Between 1973 and 1974 theincrease in social security expenditure accounted for only one-tenth of the increase in total public expenditure, far more being attributable to subsidies.    Nor could it be said that pensioners were now doingbetter in relation to the rest of the population than ever before.Last year pensions had been about 22 per cent of the averagenational wage, but they had now fallen back to the 1960!s level of18-19 per cent.    Part of the reason for this was that upratings were based on the historic rather than the forecast method, which meant that they took account of past increases in the Retail Prices Index(RPI), so that during a period of rising inflation the pensioners lostout - an arrangement which had been accepted on the understandingthat, when the rate of inflation declined the continued use of the historic method would restore the position.    To switch to the forecast method when the increase in the RPI began to decline wouldbe seen as sharp practice; but it was argued that some compromisearrangement might be possible.    Expenditure on social security wasin any case largely a function of demographic changes and of the stateof the economy - 1 million unemployed meant an inevitable 840 million being paid out in unemployment benefit.    On the otherhand it was argued that while there might be a case for giving priority to cash benefits, there was no reason to regard capital expenditureoa social services as being in a special category.    Moreover therewas much to be said for a much greater degree of selectivity in providing cash benefits.lousing There was a wide measure of support for the view that theprovision of more houses must continue to have a very high priority.A distinction needed to be drawn between housing investment and housing subsidies;  there was a strong case for cutting the latter, eventhough any immediate move in this direction had had to be postponedin order to give priority to the counter-inflation policy.    Both public and private house building made a demand on resources; and bothled to a burden on the Exchequer, either by way of housing subsidiesor by way of tax relief on mortgage payments.    The last, although not technically public expenditure, was an area in which someeasement to the public sector borrowing requirement might beachieved by reducing the tax relief subsidy to the private housepurchaser.    There was increasing evidence of a desire amongstall sections of the community for home ownership as opposed torenting.    The whole strategy of council house building needed re-examination.    One way of increasing housing investment might beby promoting joint savings schemes, to allow potential council-housetenants to buy their own house.
Health It was maintained that here too, physical investment for the social services, in such capital assets as hospitals, was of lower prioritythan cash benefits;  but it was pointed out that hospital spending hadbeen cut by ZO per cent already, and that any further cuts wouldmean a complete moratorium on all further new hospital building.The policy of replacing smaller hospitals by large, district general hospitals was questioned, both or. the ground that the essentialhuman touch might be lost and because the cost per bed might be high, given that the large hospitals were often equipped to a standardnot needed for many of the patients.Nationalised To the extent that investment by the nationalised industries was aIndustry necessary part of the provision of essential industrial capacity itInvestment should have a high priority.    It was, however, wrong to treat allnationalised industry investment as a homogeneous bloc.    some parts of it - the proposals for a massive increase in expenditure ontelecommunications and the facilities for fast inter-city trains -were of a more questionable character, and should be scrutinisedrigorously in the present exercise.    They could not be grouped along with, investment in steel-making capacity for example.Overseas Aid It was accepted that it would not be possible, during the period underreview, to achieve the Manifesto target of 0. 7 per cent of the GNPfor financial aid to developing countries: the present figure was0. 38 per cent.    But as a minimum the figure should continue to move towards 0. 7 per cent and not fall back.    On grounds of self-interestalone,      it would be bad for the United Kingdom economy if therewere a general falling off in the provision of aid funds throughoutthe world.Inner City It was argued that high priority should be given to the problems of problems inner city areas.    These were complex matters, affecting housing,schools, hospitals and roads among others: there was a case for setting up a team to consider the whole question.    The community services programme was also relevant here: rtica problems andinner city problems were not coterminous, but they did overlap,particularly in some English conurbations.    There might be an argument for more Government corporate management.
1.3CaI There was broad agreement that spending by local government,Ittthority presented an acute problem needing urgent action.    At thespenditure meeting of the new Consultative Council the previous week, thelocal authority representatives had agreed to a standstill in thegrowth of their spending for the next financial year:  this was of itself a considerable achievement, and to go further would requirethe introduction of new forms of control.    It was pointed out thatcentral Government expenditure had risen, in percentage terms,more than local authority expenditure;  and that there were in anycase great differences between different local authorities.    TheRate Support Grant system was a blunt instrument, and theGovernment needed a means of achieving some finer tuning.    Therewas some evidence of extravagance and waste at local level.    Thedifficulty was that any more effective way of controlling localgovernment expenditure would require statutory powers, and thisraised major questions about the relationship between central andlocal government.In further discussion it was argued that the problem, of unemployment was central to the whole question of public expenditure.    It wassuggested that even the most cautious estimates of the likely changesin unemployment, rising to well over a million during the coming winter, and then falling, could endanger the whole of the Governmentspay policy and hence the national economy overall.    Some action onunemployment would be essential, and it would be desirable for ministers to have a meeting in the autumn to review the situationand possibly to put forward measures to mitigate the problem.    Inparticular they should understand the choice between cuts in public expenditure and increased taxation.    Some schemes for gettingschool-leavers into voluntary programmes of social work mightwell be justified for their psychological impact, even if their scalewas not large.    It was arguable that every proposal for a cut in public expenditure should be accompanied by some assessment of theeffect upon employment which its acceptance would involve.    Itwould in any case be essential to discuss the public expenditure cutsand the action the Government proposed to take on unemployment withthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Parliamentary Party.    the tuc&apos;s document &quot;The Development of the Social Contract&quot; originallycontained a figure of 500, 000 as the aim the Government should adoptfor the reduction of unemployment; and although the TUC had been persuaded to exclude that figure, the pressure for Government action was still there.    It was recognised that, unless public expenditure and inflation were brought under control, employment would be seriously jeopardised.    Nevertheless, it would be important to identify not only areas for cutting expenditure but priority areas forfuller reflation as soon as that became possible.    It might be helpful if Ministers could agree a figure of unemployment which they thoughtwas tolerable, and could have worked out the public expenditureimplications of dealing with the situation when that figure was exceeded;
but against this it was argued that no unemployment figure wastolerable save that which was compatible with full employment.One presentational difficulty about the cuts under discussion wasthat they related to the years 1977-78 and 1978-79, whereas theunemployment problem was one for the immediate future.     ministers were right to be considering now the situation two or three yearshence and constraining expenditure plans as necessary; but this did not help the short-term problem.    It would be necessary to takethe TUC into the Governments confidence, and let them see the magnitude of the problem the Government faced.More generally the suggestion was made that the strategy underlying the proposals under discussion was a mistaken one.    It aimed to achieve redeployment of resources when the upturn in the world economy got into its stride, and achieve this through unemployment,pay constraint, cuts in public expenditure and restraint in nationalised industry investment.    Presumably it would be backed up by furtherdevaluation of the pound in 1976 to sustain experts.    This strategyignored the fact that if unemployment was not below the one millionlevel by 1977, the whole basis of the strategy would be invalid.    Itmeant risking destruction of the country1 s industrial capacity, whichwould leave other countries free to step in when the boom came.The hole which was being created in the economy would simply leadto a short fevered boom followed by another collapse.    The public expenditure priorities should be such as would cope with the recessionand should be designed to maintain manufacturing capacity, tomaintain employment in the public services, to reduce the impact of the cuts and the price increases on the less well off, and to save foreign exchange.    If there were to be cuts it would be essential to publish the public expenditure figures, not as unique figures, but in the formof a wedge, with upper and lower limits.In further discussion the following points were made:-a. It would be important for Cabinet to decide what werethe areas in which they hoped to claim, at the next GeneralElection, that they had made solid achievements.    It wassuggested that the right candidates for this would be housinginvestment and pensions, perhaps with housing as the toppriority.b. It was arguable that Cabinet should be considering, notsolely priorities in public expenditure, but a mixture ofadjustments in expenditure and adjustments in taxation.It was, for example, questionable whether tax relief on mortgage payments, and tax relief on life assurance premiums,should be left untouched while desirable social expenditure was reduced.    It might be better to lower the starting point for the higher tax rates.
c. While a large Contingency Reserve might be desirable in order to ensure that sufficient provision had been madefor unforeseen or unquantifiable expenditure, it was alsoargued that the reserve should be kept small lest potentialclaimants on it be encouraged to put forward expenditureproposals which otherwise would not see the light of day.d. On present plans the Civil Service would need toincrease by over 100, 000 in 1976-77.    This was not accept-able, and all Departments should be required to make do with their existing staff levels unless they could satisfy the Civil Service Department that it was impossible to findadditional staff needed from within their existing complement.This matter now required a directive to be given to all departments.e. The timing and scale of the likely improvement in world trade was suspect.    The macro-economic plansunderlying the expenditure proposals envisaged a switchof  500 million into private investment; but it was not clear when or how this would take place, since investmentwas the last thing to respond to any stimulus given by theGovernment to the economy.    General reflation was unlikely to occur until the latter part of 1976, so that investmentmight well not pick up until late 1977 or 1978.    It was,however, pointed out that this was in fact the period whenthe expenditure cuts under discussion would bite, thusreleasing the resources needed for an investment expansion.f. If present trends continued, the time would come when there would be more private investment by British nationalsoverseas than was taking place in the United Kingdom.    Thisphenomenon might bear examination.g. The aim of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was tohalve the public sector borrowing requirement, which meant reducing it from its present level of 10 per cent of gnp to 5 per cent by 1978-79.    The cut proposed, however,would in fact bring it down to 2j per cent;  and given thatcutting public expenditure had no direct effect upon inflationor upon imports it was not obvious that the resources freedwould find their way into exports.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, replying to thediscussion, said that, for planning purposes, the public sectorborrowing requirement was probably the least important of thepossible approaches, since, being the residual of two very largequantities, it was extremely difficult to forecast.    He was quite clear that the aim must be at least to stop borrowing for current expenditure.    From the point of view of resource use and taxation,
the Cabinet faced four problems.    First, was the problem of inflation:  the recently agreed pay policy would, it was hoped,contain the position for the next 12 months;  but if, because of highpublic expenditure, tax rates had to be increased sharply, there was always the danger that the trades unions would cease to co-operate inthe voluntary pay policy.    Secondly, there was the immediate problem of unemployment, of which he would welcome a discussion inSeptember.    It might be that some new clutch of measures would be needed early after the Recess to take the edge off the rising figures.Thirdly, there were structural distortions in the economy whichwould take time to correct.    Fourthly, while it was vital to improve the country&apos;s industrial and economic performance, the government must not make the mistake of basing their public expenditure plans on an improvement in performance which had not yet been achieved.The high spending and high borrowing of the last year was acceptablein the present situation;  but it would be essential to correct it beforethe recovery in world trade occurred.    When that would be was difficult to predict, and depended in part on the actions of othercountries.    On any reckoning, by 1977 the recovery should be wellunder way, and if adequate room were not made by cutting other demands the United Kingdom would suffer capacity restraints for meeting exports.    Structural weaknesses in the country&apos;s industry could only be corrected by micro-economic means, in this connection the creation of the National Enterprise Board and the introduction of planning agreements would be a help, but, in addition, theGovernment must have a clearly defined industrial strategy by theend of this year.    There was no real shortage of money for invest-ment, 40 per cent of bank lending was for industrial purposes, butthe institutions were lending less money and did not always takeenough interest in the subsequent management of the businesses towhom they lent.    The central problem was that at present industrydid not want money for investment.    One reason was the low return on investment because the use of capital assets in the United kingdom was poor as compared with the use to which they were put in othercountries.    On investment by British nationals overseas, the totalhad fallen in the last year, and there had in fact been a net inflowinto the United Kingdom, with more investment by overseas nationalsthan the reverse.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,while the Cabinet had reached no final decisions on public expenditurepriorities they could authorise any further work needed and indicatefor the guidance of officials any move towards a broad consensus onpriorities which had become apparent in their exchange of views.The paper by the Treasury and the Central Policy Review Staff(C(75) 82) had provided a most useful background for the meeting, anda comparable document would in future be an essential element in thenew procedure now adopted whereby Cabinet considered expenditurepriorities in the period leading up to the completion by the public expenditure Survey Committee of their annual Report.
There was a general desire that the question of unemployment should be considered further at a meeting of Ministers in September,and careful attention would need to be given to the manpowerimplications of all policies coming before Ministers.    The Septembermeeting would need to be carefully prepared:  and he would considerwhether it should be a meeting of the full Cabinet or of a smallergroup such as the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy.He would also consider further the suggestion that a ministerial group should consider possible strategies for reflation when suchaction became appropriate, and he would arrange for the Secretary ofthe Cabinet to^riiake the necessary arrangements.    It was clear thatreflationary action confined to Europe alone would be insufficient to revive world trade;  this could only be achieved by steps which included action by the United States and Japan.    The possibility ofa five-power economic Summit had been mooted at the quadripartitelunch with President Ford, President Giscard and Chancellor Schmidtat the previous week&apos;s conference in Helsinki, and he would be discussing this idea with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.On public expenditure priorities, there was broad agreement thathousing investment - which included the building of new houses andthe acquisition of existing houses by local authorities - should havea high priority, as distinct from housing subsidies where economiesmight be sought.    There was also support for the proposal that localauthorities should build houses for purchase.    High priority shouldalso be accorded to dealing with the problems of inner city areas,and to industrial re-training.    Differing views had been expressed on the priority to be given to social security cash benefits ascompared with, say, capital investment in schools and hospitals;but there was considerable support for the view that there should be greater selectivity in the field of current expenditure in the social services.    On low priorities, there was a general feeling thatsignificant savings might be made in higher education and byeconomies in the administration of the education service.    on transport expenditure there seemed the possibility of reducing expenditure on the provision and maintenance of secondary roads,although views were divided on this.    These priorities did not ofcourse mean that the areas of high priority should necessarilyescape all cuts or that an unreasonable proportion of the savingsshould be found from the low priority areas:  they would howeverprovide guidance to officials on the Cabinefs broad approach.There was general agreement that more direct control might be needed of local authority expenditure.    The Department of the environment already had work in hand on this problem;  it should now be considered interdepartmentally by officials so that action might be taken when this was judged to be politically feasible.
It had also been suggested that there should be a review of the social services on lines comparable with the Defence Review carried out in1974-75.    This would present technical problems but should beundertaken through the machinery (MI3C 78 and 31) which had produced the Joint Approach to Social Policies.    The results couldnot affect this year!s Public Expenditure White Paper but should beavailable in the spring of 1976 and should cover the problem ofselectivity in the social services.    He would decide how to deal withthe problems of the inner city areas after consultation with theMinisters concerned.There was general support for the proposal that there should be a fundamental review of the growth of central and local bureaucracy,and of the possibility of reducing staff numbers; and that thisshould be linked to the consideration of providing somewhat rougherjustice in terms of public administration.    The Lord Privy Sealshould prepare a plan for such a review, which should also cover the possibiHty of reducing waste in expenditure in both central andlocal government.The Cabinet -1.       Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in-consultation with the other Ministers concerned, toarrange for their provisional views on public expenditurepriorities to be taken into account in the further work onthe Public Expenditure Survey.3.      Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangefor officials to consider and report on the problem ofmore direct control by central government of localauthority expenditure.4.      Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangefor the machinery which had prepared the Joint approach to Social Policies to undertake a review of the social services comparable in depth and scope with the defence review carried out during 1974-75.5.      Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation withthe Departments principally concerned, to arrange fora fundamental review of the growth of the bureaucracy in central and local government, with a view to reducingstaff numbers and cutting out waste in expenditure.15
