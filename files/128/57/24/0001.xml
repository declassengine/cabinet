COPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cc(75) 54th conclusions tuesday 9 December 1975 at 9. 30 am the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(75) 137) and a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (C(75) 143) on public expenditure to 1979-80.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on 13 November the Cabinet had agreed that public expenditure plans for 1977-78 and 1978-79, asset out in the last public expenditure White Paper, should be cut;and that in 1978-79 there should be a reduction of  3, 750 million.The Chief Secretary to the Treasury had been asked to have bilateral discussions with each spending Minister on the contribution whichwould be needed from each programme to make up this total; andas a result savings of  2, 600 million had already been agreed towardsthe required  3,750 million.    This indicated a welcome spirit ofco-operation on the part of the spending Ministers.    However, therewas still  1, 150 million to find, and the report by the Chief Secretaryset out options totalling  2, 300 million from which the Cabinet would need to choose.    Treasury Ministers had made no specific proposals on this choice; but the Central Policy Review Staff (GPRS) had putforward a possible package in order to help focus the argument.PUBLICEXPENDITUREPreviousReference:CC(75) 48thConclusionsTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet had agreed to reduce expenditure in 1978-79 by  3, 750 million.    The factthat this figure had become known made it the more essential to attain it if confidence was to be maintained.    In any case failure tomake cuts of this order would imply an increase in taxes which would jeopardise the Governments pay policy.    Even if final decisions were taken that day, it would not be possible to publish the next public expenditure White Paper until early in February, which would be some two months later than normal.    The effective cut would be significantlyless than  3, 750 million because public expenditure had been growingat well above the planned rate since the publication of the last white paper.    Furthermore, no public credit could be taken for cuts arisingfrom the change in the basis of social security upratings, since the assumptions built into the present figures had never been announced.The White Paper would have inevitably to give debt interest figures,the increase in which would wipe out the savings in the first year orIHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
two; but this was the unavoidable result of running a very largeborrowing requirement.    He reminded Cabinet that when they had reached agreement on the reductions in each programme for 197 8-79,it would be necessary to agree concomitant cuts in 1977-78 and1979-80, a process which could probably be settled in bilateral talks between the Treasury and the spending Ministers.    The task for cabinet was to make a choice reflecting their own political and social priorities so as to add up to total additional cuts of 1, 150 million.    He had tried to discuss what the^e priorities shouldbe with the Trades Union Congress (TUC); but the TUC were naturallyagainst cuts of this order and individual members had sectionalinterests to protect.    The talks had, however, revealed some misunderstanding on the part of the trades unions on how far theexpenditure cuts would affect employment in the coming year, andhe proposed to meet the six TUC members of the National economic development Council again to explain this point.  . It was clear thatthe total reduction needed could not be obtained unless there weremajor contributions from the programmes run by the Department ofHealth and Social Security, the Department of the Environment andthe Ministry of Defence.The Cabinet then reviewed the main spending programmes in turn.A reduction of  166 million had been agreed in the bilateraldiscussion.    Disagreed items totalled  316 million.    Of the latter figure,  219 million was because the Secretary of State for social services had insisted that provision should be made for total capital and current expenditure to rise at lj per cent a year on hospital and community services and at 2 per cent a year on personal social services.    If there were a complete standstill in the growth of this expenditure, this money could be saved.    It had to be rememberedthat the base from which this growth would start was a great dealhigher than that of 5 years ago, and in the intervening period therehad been increases of over 20 per cent in technical and medical staff and of over 60 per cent in administrative and clerical staffs - allfar higher than could possibly be justified by demographic factors.Against this it was argued that the number of elderly people, whoneeded more, and more intensive, Health Service care was increasing - the over 75s were increasing at 2 per cent a year.    -Atthe same time children in care were increasing by 2\ per cent a -year.Even a 2 per cent increase in expenditure on personal social services would mean a severe cutback in planned developments.The more community care was reduced, the more impossible it became to move elderly or handicapped people from expensivehospital accommodation.    Local authorities needed 3, 500 moreresidential places each year and 1, 000 more day care places eachyear simply to keep pace with the increasing need.    At present7, 000 elderly people were accommodated in old workhouses.    Thiswas the reality which lay behind this programme.    The Treasury
proposals on the health service would mean an absolute reduction in expenditure on the service for the first time in history;  and thiswould be totally unacceptable both to the Labour Party and to theNational Health Service (NHS) workers.    Demographic changes alonecalled for an increase of 1 per cent a year in Health Serviceexpenditure and it was not true, as the CPRS had suggested, that this could be offset by the fall in the number of children.    Elderly peopleover 65 cost five times as much as children to care for, and those over 75 cost eight times as much.    A further increase of one halfper cent a year in expenditure was necessary simply to keep pace with changes in medical technology - and this without seeking to do morethan offer a service which was reasonable in present circumstances.If the Government cut the capital expenditure programme further, itwould mean a moratorium on all new building and thus a deterioratingHealth Service at a time when half of the existing hospitals werepre-1914, and one third of them were 19th century.  . Nor was it truethat capital cuts in 1978-79 would not have immediate effects onunemployment, since the only way to achieve them would be by notstarting projects which would otherwise begin in the near future.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,  saidthat the Secretary of State for Social Services should consult furtherbilaterally with the Chief Secretary to consider what would be theleast damaging way of saving  100 million, on the understanding that provision would have to be made to cope with demographic increases in both hospital and non-hospital expenditure.    The object would be toset before Cabinet urgently a statement, in terms of priorities, of whatconsequences would flow from a cut of  100 million.The main point of dispute on this programme related to the upratingof social security benefits.    The figures at present in the programmeassumed that upratings would be in line with the historical movementof earnings or prices.    If the calculations were made on the basis offorecast movements of earnings or prices, it would be possible toreduce the provision for 1978-79 by  508 million.    Of this sum, 200 million had been agreed in the bilateral discussion with theTreasury and was included in the agreed savings of  270 million shownin the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper (C(75) 137); and theSecretary of State for Social Services indicated in the course ofdiscussion her willingness to increase the  200 million to  300 million,but not to  508 million.&apos;\It was argued that complete adoption of the forecast in place of truehistorical basis was wholly consistent with the Party Manifesto,which only committed the Government to linking future increases inpensions and other benefits to the rise in wages and not just prices.There was no suggestion that that commitment should be dropped ,only that there was no need to go beyond it.    Against this it was argued that the historic method had been forced upon the Departmentof Health and Social Security at a time when the forecast method would
have been disadvantageous to the Treasury and that it would bedishonourable, now that circumstances had changed, to alter therules at the point in time at which, because of the fall in the rateof inflation, the pensioners might begin to benefit from the historicbasis.    Furthermore, there were the recommendations of the inter-departmental Group on Financial Poverty which Ministers were about to consider.    It would be wrong to agree further cuts in social securityexpenditure unless it was clear that the cost of the proposals for relieving poverty would be treated as an offset to those savings.    in further discussion it was argued that the compromise figure of 300 million saving on this score was not sufficient; and that thefull  508 million should be agreed on the basis that if, in the event,the earnings forecasts upon which the proposed expenditure figures were constructed proved to be false, then the Trsasury would makesufficient funds available to compensate for this factor.     The proposalsfor the relief of poverty would have to be considered separately ontheir merits.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the CabiasA were agreed &amp;a psrineipl^ that additional savings of 308 million should be secured on this programme by changing thebasis of the uprating;  but that this decision would be considered further when Cabinet had a report on the further bilateral exchangeon the Health and Personal Social Services programme which theyhad invited the Secretary of State for Social Services and tte chief secretary, Treasury to conduct.It was pointed out that the bilateral discussions had resulted inacceptance of the &quot;formula cuts&quot; in full, plus a further  400 million.The Department of the Environment was responsible for 17 per cent of total expenditure, and had accepted 38 per cent of the total cutsagreed in the bilateral talks.    Proportionately more had been cutfrom this programme in the bilaterals than from any other.On Roads expenditure, it was suggested that in theory, if no new roadswere started for the next 3 years, some  500 million could be saved.This would not, however, be a practicable proposition, but it wassuggested that some  150 million could be saved in starts in the roads programme, and a further  10 million on car parks.    It was observedthat in Wales the completion of the M4, which was regarded asimperative for regional regeneration, continued to carry the highest priority.On Housing expenditure the building programme was an open-end edone, with no direct control exercised by the central Government.The figures entered in the Survey were simply estimates of whatlocal authorities were expected to build.    Local authority houses were expected to increase by some 165, 000 a year, and if this estimate were cut by 11, 000, it could provide the  124 million o.*fsavings which the Treasury had proposed.    However, even if such an adjustment to the estimate were considered justifiable, theDepartment of the Environment would be reluctant to publish sucrafigures.
On local authority mortgage lending, the Survey provision stood at 393 million, and this might be cut by  200 million if the building societies could be encouraged to lend the money instead.    one possibility might be for the Government to guarantee Building Societymortgages;  but it was pointed out that it was the age of the propertyrather than the unreliability of the mortgagor which made theBuilding Societies reluctant.    In any case, additional lending by theBuilding Societies would be reflected in a lower holding of giltedged stock by them, which would exacerbate the problem of managing the public sector borrowing requirement.In Wales, housing was of the utmost importance and called for ahigh order of priority.    Success was now beginning to be achieved in getting more houses built, and it would be difficult to pull back -indeed present prospects were that local authority building would go beyond the Survey allocation.    If there were to be cuts, theproportion as between England and Wales would need to take accountof the fact that 45 per cent of Welsh houses were pre-1914 and that60 per cent were owner-occupied.On the sale of ccancil houses, it was suggested there might be somemerit in a scheme for the life enfranchisement of tenants who had.occupied a local authority house for, say, ten or twenty years.Such a scheme could produce large savings in the cost of ?..dministra-tion, maintenance and repair.    Average expenditure on themaintenance of local authority houses was some  68 per house per year; and some authorities had to spend a great deal more than this because of the age of their housing stock.    It would however bedifficult to quantify the savings which would arise from a move of thiskind.Total cuts of  580 million had been agreed on Education in the bilateral discussions.    The Treasury sought a further  124 million.It was pointed out that Education expenditure had a long history of expansion, and that in England and Wales there was an increase in real terms from  3, 745 million in 1970-71 to  4, 606 million in1978-79, even after the agreed cuts.    Teaching staffs had risen by25 per cent and non-teaching staff by 21 per cent, whereas pupilnumbers had risen by only 11 per cent.    Fees for evening classescovered only 30 per cent of costs and fees for overseas studentscovered only 10 per cent cf costs, regardless of the personalcircumstances of the student concerned.    It was considered thatthere must also be room for administrative savings.Against this it was argued that the cuts which had already been agreedwent to the limit of what was defensible, and perhaps what was practicable.    Expenditure on Further Education was connectedclosely with industrial training, and was needed to meet increasing demand.    The Treasury argument appeared to be that Education had done well under the previous Administration and should therefore be5
cut under the present Government.    It was pointed out that, ascompared with the last Conservative expenditure White Paper,Education expenditure would show a 15 per cent cut at a time whenDefence showed an 8 per cent cut and housing showed a 69. 5 per cent increase.    The situation was significantly worse in Scotland where,because of differences in the educational system, the formula cutsproduced a much greater percentage reduction in expenditurecompared with England.In further discussion reference was made to the outstanding successof the Open University, which received 50, 000 acceptable applicationsevery year, was the biggest educational publisher in the world, and alarge earner of foreign exchange. High fixed costs, however, meant that cuts would have a disproportionate effect upon student numbers which would have to be reduced to 6, 520 in 1978-79; expenditure cuts of this kind would be most unwise.In the bilateral discussion, the figure of  180 million for food subsidies in 1978-79 had been reduced to  150 million as a first stage in the elimination of such subsidies by 1979-80.    The Treasuryproposed that the run-down should be advanced by one year to1978-79, which would save a further  100 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, gamming up a brief discussion on thissubject, said that the Cabinet agreed that the figure for food subsidies in 1978-79 should be reduced by a further  50 million onthe understanding that nevertheless the figure for food subsidies was likely to be an element in the bargaining which would have to beundertaken with the TUC in the evolution of counter-inflationarypolicy for 1976-77.The bilateral discussion had led to agreement that expenditure on defence in 1978-79 should be reduced by  100 million.    In the viewof the Treasury a further  350 million should be cut:  it would be wholly unacceptable to the Labour Party if the Government were to cuttotal public expenditure by  3, 750 million with all that such a cutimplied for Education and the social services programmes, and atthe same time reduce defence by no mere than  100 million.Against this it was argued that the defence budget had very recently-been subjected to a thorough review of a kind experienced by no otherprogramme, and was now down to the minimum acceptable level.To cut it further would have serious political, industrial, militaryand international consequences.    Further cuts would appal theGermans and the Americans;  would begin the break up of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), would be contrary to the UnitedKingdom&apos;s obligations under the Brussels Treaty;  and would jeopardise the negotiations for mutual balanced force reductions in Europe.Export orders - for Chieftain tanks to Iran, for example, worthbetween  600 and  1, 000 million - might be lost if confidence were6
disturbed by cuts of this kind.     The defence policy of the UnitedKingdom had already been drastically changed by the Defence Review,and Britain would be withdrawing from Singapore, from Ghan, from Malta,and     from Cyprus, and would be concentrating on her NATOobligations.    That Review would reduce service and civilian manpowerby 68, 000;  and would cut Ministry of Defence staffs by 10 per cent,with a mangement review in hand to bring about a further 10 per cent reduction thereafter.    The further cuts now demanded would lead tothe widespread deferment and cancellation of equipment, on which, 000 jobs in industry could depend, and the closure of Defenceestablishments; it would seriously interfere with the policy ofdispersing staff from London.    The shipbuilding and aircraft industries could be seriously damaged, and it would, for example,be impossible to save Swan Hunter, who were asking for the advanceplacing of a defence order in order to survive.In further discussion the international implications of further defencecuts were emphasised,    If failure to achieve the overall cuts of 3, 750 million was likely to lead to loss of overseas confidence,it was equally true that severe defence cuts at the present time were just as likely to lead to loss of confidence overseas.    On domesticprogrammes most cuts meant either a standstill or a reduced rateof growth which could subsequently be repaired.    But cuts in defence expenditure implied a change in our   historic position in theworld which was irreversible.    Thare was a danger, if Britainbegan to contract out of NATO, that some elements in Germany would wish that country to become a bigger force in central Europe, andmight well press for Germany to become a nuclear power.    It mightbe that a future German Government would have reason to embark onvast military expenditure, provoke a change in the whole attitude ofthe USSR, and thus jeopardise international peace.    Furthermore, thepresent moment was the worst possible time for cuts which mightcall in question the possibility of a successful negotiation for mutualbalanced force reductions, on which a basis for an offer to the USSRhad just been agreed by the West.    To endanger this might be to lose the first opportunity of reducing the armed forces facing eachother in Europe.    The Americans tended to regard us as their mostreliable partners in NATO; but further defence cuts might well mean that Germany would begin to take our place in American eyes.Against  this it was argued that it was very odd if our allies did notmind if we undertook inflationary defence expenditure which wecould not sustain when the real question was whether other countrieswanted Britain as an economically strong ally or were content forher to be a weak power.    One of the reasons for our weakness wasthat over the years we   had spent proportionately more on defencethan other countries.    Even after the cuts proposed by the Treasury,we would be spending 5 per cent of our GNP on defence compared withthe NATO average of 3. 9 per cent.    This could hardly be represented as a betrayal of the alliance.    The Ministry of Defence were
proposing to spend in 1978**79, primarily on NATO, more than had previously been spent ou a much wider range of defence activity.    Itwas not true to say that the further cuts would mean contracting outof NATO, since we should be willing to spend as much proportionatelyon defence as our allies did, merely asking them to recognise theweaker condition of the British economy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, while no final decision could be taken at the present meeting,there would be advantage if Cabinet could have before them a paperindicating the practicability and consequences of a total cut of 275 million in defence expenditure concentrating mainly on supportservices and not allowing expenditure on NATO to fall below the critical level or failing to meet the United Kingdom obligation underthe Brussels Treaty.    This might be made up of  100 millionslippage on equipment ordering;    75 million from reductions onheadquarters staff numbers;  and  100 millinn from, research anddevelopment, which was normally controlled by ceilings on numbers and expenditure and which therefore expanded to take up whatsverceilings were fixed.    The Secretary of State for Defence should prepare a paper setting out the consequences - including theconsequences for industry - of cuts of this kind.In the course of discussion the following additional points were made -a. The Cabinet had so far considered only the majorprogrammes.    This did not imply that the smallerprogrammes were too insignificant for consideration,and it was possible that a collection of small cuts wouldbe able to contribute significantly to the required total.b. The cuts under discussion would not bite until 1977-78,by which time it was hoped the economic upturn would be under way.    Nevertheless, there were some reductions which would require immediate action and would impingeon the employment situation in 1976-77.c. It was arguable that it was unnecessary for ministers to suffer the difficulty of making expenditure cuts so far ahead;  but against this it was pointed out that unless theGovernment were seen to be planning major expenditure cuts, overseas confidence would be lost and it would become impossible even to get through 1976-77.d. It was illogical to be considering cutting public expenditure without at the same time considering thepossible taxation alternatives.    On the other hand, theprospect was such that all tolerable taxation increases were likely to be needed in addition to the expenditure cuts now under consideration.
e.    The Secretary of State for Industry had indicated to the Treasury that an additional 50 million would be needed in 1978-79 for theNational Enterprise Board.    The Treasury preferred to keep the present, strictly conventional, stji of figures;  but if in fact the  50   million were added,this would increase the total additional savingsrequired from  1, 150 million to  1, 200 million.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the position to date was that theCabinet had agreed to an additional reduction in 1978-79 of 50 million in expenditure on Food Subsidies; had agreed inprinciple to an additional saving of  308 million on Social Securityexpenditure, but would review this in the light of the ultimatedecision on expenditure on the Health programme.    There was no time to conclude their examination of public expenditure that day:they would, continue their discussion at the next meeting of theCabinet when further consideration would be given to the programmes of the Departments of the Environment and Education and Science.They awaited the result of a further bilateral consultation between theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary on thepossibility of a further cut of  100 million in Health expenditure; andawaited a paper by the Secretary of State for Defence on the implications-tions of a further cut of  175 million in defence expenditure.     Ifpapers on these questions could not be circulated in time for the next meeting of the Cabinet, there should be oral reports on these twosubjects so as to make it possible for the Cabinet to agree, at that meeting, on the overall magnitude of the public expenditure cut.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up.Cabinet Office9 December 19759
