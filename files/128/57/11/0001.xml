INQUIRY INTO        1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theGAMBLING Secretary of State for the Home Department (C(75) 99) about theestablishment of an inquiry into gambling.THE HOME SECRETARY said that at their meeting on 2 July 1975the Home Affairs Committee had agreed that there was a strong case for setting up an inquiry into gambling, and the main questionnow at issue was whether it should take the form of a RoyalCommission or of a Select Committee.    There had been nocomprehensive review of the subject since the Royal Commissionof 1949-51, and the present legislation dated in the main from theearly sixties.    There had of late years been a very largeproliferation of the gambling industry, and its turnover was nowin the region of  2500 million a year.    It was run almost entirelyfor private profit (since the Tote was making little impact) andthere had been a rapid growth of large combines straddling thedifferent forms of gambling.    The social impact of gambling was great and the financial contribution which accrued to desirablesocial objectives was slight.    The law was now inadequate to dealwith the situation, and although there had of late years been somepiecemeal legislation, it had been possible to do no more than tinkerwith the problems.    The time was therefore     .  ripe for a thoroughinquiry.    In his view the complexity of the subject matter, theimportant social implications and the presence in the industry ofpowerful pressure groups made it necessary that the inquiry shouldbe carried out by an independent body with the status of a RoyalCommission.    It should be asked to produce an early interimreport on the idea of a levy on the football pools, since this was a subject where urgent action was needed.In discussion, there was general agreement that a wide ranginginquiry was necessary.    It was also generally agreed that since thequestion of financial support for sport was now urgent - in particular the horse racing industry was in danger of collapse - this aspectshould be dealt with separately and to a shorter time scale.    the recently announced inquiry into the financing of the arts, which were already receiving far greater financial support than was sport,strengthened the case for expediting this part of the inquiry.    It was indeed for consideration whether the terms of reference should not allow recommendations to be made about the use of income from apools levy, or any other similar source of funds, for artistic aswell as sporting purposes.In favour of a Select Committee, it was argued that since it was a considerably less remote type of body than a Royal Commission itmight command greater public confidence and be more likely toproduce workable recommendations.    Moreover, it would do its work much more quickly and would probably open the way to1
legislation during the lifetime of the present Parliament:  royal commissions were notoriously slow.    Moreover, a SelectCommittee sitting in public would serve a useful public educativepurpose and would enable Parliament to perform the kind ofinvestigative function which was carried out so effectively by theUnited States Congress.In favour of a Royal Commission it was argued that, although a select Committee was often extremely effective when dealing witha fairly limited subject, it was less so when dealing with a verycomplex and wide-ranging matter such as gambling.    A RoyalCommission with a well chosen membership would have a better chance of success.    Moreover, a Royal Commission need not be unduly slow, particularly if the chairmen were carefully chosen;and, like a Select Committee, it could perform a useful educativefunction if it met in public.    There were powerful vested interefetsin the gambling industry which would be highly resistant to investigation;  and this pointed to a body with the prestige of a royal Commission, which would also be particularly well placed to resist the intensive lobbying to which it would be exposed.Moreover, recommendations by a Select Committee, should theyprove embarrassing to the Government, would be more difficult toshelve or vary than those of a Royal Commission;  and there wasthe immediate practical difficulty of manning a Select Committee,given the present very heavy pressures on the time of the types ofbackbench Member of Parliament who would be suitable.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be a wide ranging inquiry intogambling and that an early interim report should be sought on thequestion of financial support for sport by means of a levy on footballpools or otherwise.    It would be undesirable to widen this part ofthe inquiry so that it covered the arts;  there would be a serious riskof embarrassing recommendations, and in any case this part of thefield was already being dealt with through the inquiry which he had asked the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to undertake.    on balance, the Cabinet considered that the inquiry should be carriedout by a Royal Commission rather than by a Select Committee.But there were unsatisfactory features sometimes associated withthe work of Royal Commissions which should if possible be avoided;and much would depend on finding a suitable chairman.    The HomeSecretary, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,should make recommendations to him about membership as soon aspossible.2
The Cabinet -10 Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary, inconsultation with the other ministers concerned, to be guided accordingly.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Lord Privy Seal (C(75) 98) on the completion ofthe present legislative programme.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that at the start of the Session the Government had embarked on an over-large programme, which had been added to throughout the year.    57 bills had already been placed on the Statute Book, but there was nowacute congestion in the House of Lords because of the number of bills remaining to be completed in that House.    In the summerthe Chief Whip had met the Opposition Whips, who had agreed thatthe Lords would sit alone during the present week, and had undertaken to do their best to ensure that the remaining Lordsstages of all outstanding Bills were completed by 7 November.The Chief Whip had entered into a personal understanding that,provided the new Session started on 12 November, no majorGovernment Bills would be introduced next Session after Easterunless in an emergency or by agreement.    Y/hile the officialOpposition in the Lords would do their best to get outstanding Billsthrough, there could be no certainty about the form in which the lords would pass these Bills.    Problems might arise on threeBills in particular.    On the Trade Union and Labour Relations(Amendment) Bill, he and the Secretary of State for Employmenthad tried unsuccessfully to reason with Lord Goodman, who seemeddetermined to persist with his amendments relating to the press and would probably get majority support.    There might also be amajority in the Lords for retaining unacceptable amendments to theHousing Finance (Special Provisions) Bill.    Difficulties were possible, though less likely, on the Industry and Petroleum and submarine Pipelines Bills.   A special problem arose on theCommunity Land Bill, which would leave the Commons early inthe week beginning 13 October, allowing little time for all stage sin the Lords and any exchanges of messages between the two houses.    The Opposition in the Lords would do their best to keepto the timetable, but could give no guarantee that there would beno damaging amendments to the Bill.    The possibility of using the
Parliament Act to pass the Community Land Bill next Session inan acceptable form would depend upon its having been sent to the lords at least a month before the end of the present Session.This would not be possible if the Session were prorogued on7 November, and it would be necessary to decide soon whether toprorogue on that date or to prolong the Session for a week.The Queen was keeping open dates in the weeks beginning 10 and17 November as possible dates for the State Opening of the new session, but delay in reaching a decision would cause problems in connection with the State Visit of President Nyerere.    action under the Parliament Act would ensure that the Community land bill was passed into law by the end of next Session.    Thealternative would be an amending Bill next Session to put right anydamaging Lords amendments; but if the Lords continued to make difficulties the eventual passage of the Community Land Bill intolav/ in an acceptable form might take up to a year longer than underthe Parliament Act.    On the other hand, an extension of the present session for a week would reduce the time available forGovernment legislation next Session,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had held two frankdiscussions with the Leader of the Opposition in the Lords.    Therewas no question of obstruction, but Conservative leaders could nolonger control backbench peers as effectively as in the past.    TheCommunity Land Bill could not be completed in the Lords until5 November.    There might be a need for more than one exchangeof messages between the two Houses on this Bill, which would notbe possible if the Session ended on 7 November.    The fact thatthe Parliament Act would not be available if the Session ended thenmight encourage some peers to obstruct the Community Land bill and to disagree with Commons messages;  the ability to use the parliament Act if necessary would help to avoid such a risk.    his judgment was that it should be possible to get through all the other outstanding Bills without difficulty except for Trade Union andLabour Relations (Amendment) and Housing Finance (special provisions).    Confrontation was the more likely on the former,and if this were taken first there would be a better chance that the lords would allow the latter through in the form the government wished.    Given extra flexibility in the timetable, to allow timefor exchanges between the two Houses, there was a fair chance of completing all outstanding Bills satisfactorily, since the Lordsmight well decide at the last available moment that a direct clash with the Commons over one provision of the Trade Union and labour relations (Amendment) Bill would be unwise.    But if the Sessionended on 7 November the Trade Union and Labour Relations(Amendment) Bill was unlikely to be completed in an acceptableform, and there could be considerable difficulty in completing theCommunity Land Bill satisfactorily.

But if the Sessionended on 7 November the Trade Union and Labour Relations(Amendment) Bill was unlikely to be completed in an acceptableform, and there could be considerable difficulty in completing theCommunity Land Bill satisfactorily.4
THE DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP said that great efforts had been madeby the &quot;Whips in recent months to enable the Governmentslegislative business to be completed by 7 November and he hopedit would not be thought necessary to lose the results of these efforts by extending the Session,    This would delay progress onnext Session&apos;s programme - which the Government had undertaken to manage better - by increasing the number of Bills which couldnot be started until after Christmas0In discussion of the Community Land Bill, the point was made thatto proceed by way of an amending Bill next Session to put right anyunacceptable Lords amendments, rather than to make use of the parliament Act, would create fatally damaging uncertainty in theland market and have harmful effects on the housing programme.The Lords might wreck the amending Bill in its turn, but localauthorities and others concerned with land must be able to make their plans on the basis of a firm Government policy;   someConservative local authorities were delaying plans to implementthis legislation pending Royal Assent, and further delay couldcreate serious difficulties in bringing it into operation.    Speed ofenactment was therefore most important, the more so as theCommunity Land Bill was to be followed by the second part of theGovernments proposals on land, Development Land Tax;  and any delay would discourage Government supporters.In discussion of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment)Bill, it was recalled that there had been concern among some government supporters about the application of this Bill to the Press.To meet this concern Lord Houghton had moved amendments for theestablishment of a code of conduct;  but the Lords had preferredLord Goodman!s amendments, which amounted to the application ofthe Conservative Industrial Relations Act to a single trade union.Following discussions with editors and Government supporters itwas now proposed to invite the Commons to restore Lord Houghton&apos;samendments, and to insert express references to the code dealingwith the rights of editors and with access to the Press by non-unioncontributors.    Lord Goodman was likely to persist with hisamendments giving the code force of law, and would probably obtainmajority support.    If enough time was available for exchanges ofmessages between the two Houses it was just possible that in the end the Lords would accept the improved version of Lord Houghton&apos;samendments;  but there could be no question of the Governmentsaccepting the principle of a legally enforceable code,hi further discussion, it was suggested that the Lords were creating a serious constitutional situation by refusing in successive Sessionsto accept amendment of the law on trade union and labour relations to which there had been specific commitments in both the 19745:&apos;Y ,i:\:v.;/Y.
Manifestos and by insisting on their amendments to theEmployment Protection and other Bills.    The Queen&apos;s Speechshould make clear that the Government would not tolerate suchinterference by the Lords in its legislative plans.    It was pointedout, however, that the Lords had not been unreasonably obstructivethis Session;  the main cause of difficulty was the late arrival of bills from the Commons.    None of the amendments which the lords had recently carried against the Government on theEmployment Protection and Submarine and Petroleum PipelinesBills was of great political significance.    Moreover it would be most unwise for the Government to make a statement of intent todeal with the House of Lords without having first decided what to do.The following points were made in further discussion -a. It would be necessary to renew the Prevention of terrorism   (Temporary Provisions) Act before itsexpiry on 28 November.    A promise had been made that ifsuch a second renewal became necessary this would be doneby statute and not by order.    It would be desirable to beable to debate an order renewing the present Act for a fewmonths on the same day as the Second Reading of the newBill, but there might be difficulty about doing this by28 November if the present Session was extended.    this problem would need further discussion between ministers concerned.b. Following acceptance by the Commons of the deletion of Clause 4 of the Housing Finance (Special&quot;Provisions) Bill a general line in the Press had been thatthe Lords should accept this as a reasonable compromise.In any event the Government could not accept the lords amendments which affected 400 Labour Councillors in localauthorities other than Clay Cress, and the recoupment oflost rent income from the rates.c. The Lords had made a number of unacceptableamendments to the Industry Bill which would have to be putright in the Commons; Government supporters would bevery suspicious if the Government gave way on any of these amendments.d. It was essential to avoid delay in getting the petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Bill into operation.e. It was hoped that the Lords would not insist on any amendments to the Scottish and Welsh Development AgencyBills of a kind which would necessitate amending Bills next session.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment were committed to do their best to get through the outstanding Bills in an acceptable form;  any delays would causedamaging uncertainty.    It was also important to avoid over-loadingnexi&apos; dessionS programme by having to reintroduce Bills which hadno; been satisfactorily completed this Session.    The clearconcensus of view in the Cabinet was that the present sessions should be extended into the week beginning 10 November, since this would both make available the possibility of using the parliament Act in relation to the Community Land Bill and also provide the extra flexibility needed to give the best hope of avoiding a clash between Lords and Commons and securing the enactment of all the outstanding Bills in an acceptable form.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.7
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services (C(75) 100) proposingincreases in National Health Service (NHS) dental and opticalcharges,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatdental and optical charges had remained frozen since the cabinets decision in September 1974 not to increase dental charges whendentists&apos; fees were increased that year.    When the NHS public expenditure allocation for 1975-76 had been reduced by  62f millionearlier in the present year, she had indicated that it would beimpossible to accommodate the consequent shortfall in revenue ifthe charges remained frozen.    The present position was that therewas a shortfall of about  18 million which had to be made good;and, consequent on the recent award by the Doctors and DentistsReview Body and the recent recalculation of dentists&apos; expenses,she had to make Regulations, coming into effect from 1 November,providing for a new scale of dental fees.    These regulations would have to be laid not later than the week beginning 6 October,To meet this position, she proposed that dental charges, whichsince 1971 had been on a cost-related basis, should revert to a flat-rate of  3, 50 for a course of treatment (or the actual cost if that were less);  but where dentures were provided the charge would vary up to a maximum of  12.    In the case of optical charges,it was proposed to revert to the previous practice of chargingpatients the full cost of spectacle frames, together with flat-ratecharges for lenses which would replace the present cost-relatedcharges.    The new charges would be  2.25 per single vision lens, 4.25 for a glass bifocal lens and  5, 00 for a plastic bifocal lens.As part of the package, she proposed some relatively inexpensiveconcessions which, as well as being fully justified on merits, wouldbe presentationally helpful.    It was intended that children should become eligible for plastic lenses, for the provision of contact lenseswithout charge where they were clinically necessary and for a plasticspectacle frame as an alternative to the present unattractive models.She also had in mind to announce that negotiations were being openedwith the interests concerned to try to provide more attractive NHSframes for adults, and that the Government intended when possibleto amend the National Health Service Act 1951 so as to abolish opticalcharges for the registered blind and the registered partly sighted.Finally, the margin above the supplementary benefit level takeninto account in assessing income for the purpose of determiningexemption from charges would be increased from  1,50 to  2,50a week.
In discussion, it was argued that there were strong practical andpolitical objections to the proposed increases in NHS charges.These charges were a matter of quite unusual sensitivity, secondonly to rents, in the mind of the public generally and of LabourParty supporters in particular.    This might not be a logicalmatter,&apos; but it was a fact, and the Government would ignore it attheir peril.    The immediate danger was that, particularly at atime of heavy and growing unemployment, an increase in NHScharges would cause a reaction which might endanger theGovernments counter-inflation.      policy as a whole.    It wouldnot only cause a hostile reaction amongst the government&apos;s supporters but would also give the Conservative Opposition a ready-made stick with which to beat the Government.    It would,furthermore, tend to push more patients into the market for private glasses, where unacceptable profits were already beingmade.    And it was surely false economy to do anything whichwould deter patients from seeking treatment at an early stage,when the trouble could often be dealt with simply and economically.On the other hand it was strongly argued that the proposed increasein NHS charges followed directly from the decisions which theCabinet had taken earlier in the year about public expenditure in1976-77, and that it would be impossible tc reopen one aspect ofthose decisions without reopening the whole field and provoking ageneral re-examination of priorities;  for if there were -myquestion of finding the  18 million from outside the agreed NHSallocation ii; would be arguable that there were other needs towhich even higher priority should be attached.    An increase inthe charges would undoubtedly be highly unpopular; but all ministers had had to take many unpopular decisions during recent months, and would have to go on doing so.    If one particular issuewere re-opened in this way it would also jeopardise the wholebasis on which the Cabinet took their public expenditure decisions.In further discussion, it was suggested that since an increase inNHS charges was politically highly undesirable it might be worthexamining the prospects of finding the necessary savings from elsewhere in the NHS allocation.    At their meeting on 4 August,the Cabinet had invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for a fundamental review of the growth of bureaucracy in central andlocal government, with a view to reducing staff numbers and cuttingout waste and expenditure.    Though the prospects could not berated highly, it might be worth deferring a decision on NHS charges for long enough to enable the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation withthe Secretaries of State for Social Services, for Scotland and for wales, to consider what were the prospects of identifyingadministrative savings within the NHS sufficient to enable theproposed increase in charges to be dispensed with.9
C Qi JFIDEI ITIALTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up thediscussion,  said that, because of decisions taken by theCabinet earlier in the year, a saving of  18 million had to bemade in NHS expenditure in 1975-76.    The question now beforethem was whether this should be secured by the proposed increasein NHS dental and optical charges, about which serious disquiethad been expressed by some members of the Cabinet, or whether some other method could be found from within the agreed NHSallocation.    They would resume their discussion of this question on 16 October;  and in the meantime the Secretaries of State for social Services, Scotland and Wales and the Lord Privy Sealshould consider urgently what other possibilities were open, andin particular whether economies on the necessaiy scale could besecured in the cost of administration;,    The detailed points aboutthe exemption of children from optical charges which had been raised in discussion by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theSecretary of State for Education and Science should be pursueddirectly with the Secretary of State for Social Services*The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Lord President ofthe Council and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office25 September 197510
