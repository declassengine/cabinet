Y   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    In connection withthe debate on 8 December about the effects of Government   policy onoffshore oil, it would be helpful if the current Ministerial discussions about the appointment of the members of the British National OilCorporation could be completed in time for an announcement to bemade during or just before the debate.It was reported that increasing pressure was being brought to bear on ministers and backbench Members of Parliament by trade unionsother than those representing the dock workers which would be affectedby the Dock W&amp;rk Regulation Bill, wnich was due to receive its SecondReading on 10 December.    It might be worth considering whether any concessions could be offered to them at a later stage;  but the most pressing need was to do everything possible during the Second reading debate to allay their immediate concern.    The fact was that there was an unavoidable clash of interests between the trade unions concerned;the aim of the Bill was to mitigate it, but it could not be removedaltogether.    There had been full consultations with the trade unionsnot primarily concerned with the interests of dock workers, andfurther consultations had been offered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that there was a clash of interests which could notbe wholly removed.    It was however important that the Secretary ofState for Employment should, during the Second Reading debate, do all he could to reassure the trade unions not primarily concerned withdock workers and stress that there would be continuing consultations with them.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.THE HOME SECRETARY said that it was important that there shouldbe a good attendance at the debate on 11 December on a private member&apos;s Motion for the restoration of capital punishment for terroristoffences causing death.    There would be a free vote, and if the Houseof Commons did not produce a substantial majority against capital punishment pressure in the country for it to be restored, at any rate inrelation to terrorist offences, might become irresistible.    The policyof releasing all the remaining detainees in Northern Ireland before christmas presented some problems for the handling of the debate.The number of detainees affected was 46 and the Secretary of State for northern Ireland would like to release them all by the end of thefollowing week, so that the whole operation could be completed well1
before Christmas,    But this would be a substantial increase in thenormal rate of releases and supporters of capital punishment mightargue that it was a policy of appeasement.    It would be all the moreembarrassing if one of the released detainees committed a terroristact before the debate took place.    It would therefore be worthwhileconsidering whether a preferable course might not be to release only some 20 detainees during the following week and the remainder afterthe debate and shortly before Christmas.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatin his view the benefits so far as Northern Ireland was concerned of releasing all the detainees as quickly as possible outweighed thepossible difficulties which might arise in relation to the debate.Opinion in Northern Ireland now generally supported his policy of bringing detention to an end and dealing with terrorists through thecourts.    His contacts with politicians and with the police and the armyshowed substantial support for his view that it would now be preferable to end detention as quickly as possible.    Moreover the ProvisionalIrish Republican Army was already in disarray, and the complete end of detention would remove one of the most important and most popularplanks in their programme;   furthermore it would deny them any excuse .for staging some act of violence on the ground that the Government didnot in fact intend to^honour its promise to release all detainees.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion,  said that theCabinet recognised that there were conflicting considerations whichwere nicely balanced.    On balance they agreed that the preferablecourse would be for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland toproceed as planned with the immediate release of all the remaining46 detainees and that any risks this might involve in relation to the debate should be accepted.    Every effort should be made to secure agood attendance at the debate, since it was important that the motion should be rejected by as large a majority as possible.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Debate on It was argued that it was important that time should be found for aUnemployment debate on unemployment before the House rose for the christmas recess.    If this were not done there was some danger thatGovernment backbench supporters would seek an emergency debate,which might well result in the Governments defeat.    It would haveto be accepted that the House of Commons might in consequence have to sit during Christmas week rather than rise on 19 December as had been hoped.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be an announcement during thebusiness statement later that day that there would be a debate onunemployment before the Recess, probably in the week beginning15 December.    It should take place on the basis of a Motion seeking approval to the package of measures to counter unemployment, the precise content of which Ministers would be settling shortly.    the debate could also deal with Chrysler, and if appropriate, with import restrictions.    As a consequence of finding time for the debate theHouse of Commons would have to sit at the beginning of Christmasweek;  but the business taken should be as uncontentious as possible.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval of the Prime Minister!ssxuriming up of their discussion and invited theParliamentary Secretary, Treasury to be guided accordingly.3
iflliddleOREIGNrFAIRSEastSaudi Arabia2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thedecision of the United Nations Security Council to renew the mandate forthe United Nations Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan Heightshad averted a grave situation which might have involved a real possibilityof a new Middle East war.    The Soviet Union had undoubtedly scored a success with regard to the possibility of participation by the representa-tives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in the security council debate on the Middle East to be held in January.    This questionof participation would be re-opened in January at the beginning of the debate, but since it was a procedural matter no veto could be cast.    the Israelies, who were bitterly disappointed with this development, had saidthat they would not co-operate in the January debate, but he had offeredMr Allon, the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, his advice that theymight be wise to reconsider the danger of leaving the field clear fortheir adversaries.    He personally considered that the Israeli Governmentwould eventually have to reconcile themselves to dealing with the PLO insome manner: he thought that they should be turning their attention toexacting in return the price of recognition of the statehood of Israel bythe PLO.    He had arranged to discuss the question with the United states secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, when they met; n^xt week at the north atlantic Treaty Organisation Council meeting.    Meanwhile, it was important that nothing should be done to harden attitudes on either side and clearly the recent Israeli bombing of targets in the Lebanon, in which some 70 people had been killed, had been a moat unfortunate development.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he hadbeen very impressed by his visit to Saudi Arabia during the course ofhis recent tour of the Arabian Peninsula.    British exports to Saudi Arabiathis year would be of the order of      200 million and there was no reason why this figure could nnt be doubled.    He had heard from the Saudis theusual complaints against British businessmen and for his part he had donehis best to reassure them about the reliability of sterling and about the underlying strength of our economic position, as well as more generallyabout the Governments determination to remain in command of events.He had formed the strong impression that Saudi Arabia, although itsregime was in many ways totalitarian, had much better prospects of stability than many of the neighbouring Governments.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
uropean THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported on theCouncil meeting of the European Council which the Prime Minister and he had attended in Rome on 1 and 2 December.    There had been no communiquebut a number of agreements had been come to in the form of workingdocuments.    On the Community Budget and financial control thediscussion which the Prime Minister had had with the Federal german chancellor in July and the work which the Prime Minister had since putinto elaborating our proposals had paid a substantial dividend,,    Therehad been a general welcome at the European Council for our proposalswhich we would now publish as a White Paper and agreement in particular to pursue actively our proposal for a Committee of the European assembly on the lines of the &quot;House of Commons&apos; Public Accounts Committee to watchover Community expenditure.     On the basis of the discussion detailed proposals would be submitted by the Commission to the Council of Ministers.On direct elections, seven countries had agreed that elections to theEuropean Parliament should take place on a single date in May or June 1976It had been agreed that any country which at that date was unable to holddirect elections should be allowed to appoint its representatives from among the elected members of its national Parliament.    The Council hadnoted the Prima Ministers statement that further consultations would benecessary before the British Government could commit itself to final arrangements.    Denmark had also reserved its position.    foreign ministers had been instructed to take further their examination of thequestion and to submit a report to the next European Council in March.This would probably lead to considerable argument on the size of theEuropean Assembly between the French, who wanted the number of seats to be proportional to the population of the Member States, and the Irish,who wanted to increase the share of the total seats held by the smallercountries.On Passport Union the Council had agreed that a uniform passport mightbe issued as from 1978 and had asked the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) to resolve all outstanding questions in this area including the difficult issues of the abolition of frontier controls and the harmonisationof conditions of entry.M. Tindemans had reported very briefly on the progress of his report on european Union but there had been no substantive discussion.    a united Kingdom proposal for a meeting of Ministers of the Interior todiscuss common problems with particular reference to law and order hadbeen agreed.    The President of the French Republic had also suggestedthat this meeting should discuss the associated question of the right ofasylum.On the Conference on International Economic Co-operation there had beenlong and fierce discussion.    The Prime Minister had fought very hard forour position and, while we had not gained everything we had publiclyaimed for, there had been some significant practical gains.    The french had agreed to the principle of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and emer-gency sharing arrangements for oil although the latter point was not for
publication, and thus had come into line in everything butname with the International Energy Agency. which they had earlier refused to join.    In so far as representationof the United Kingdom was concerned it had been agreed that theCommunity spokesmen should be the President of the Council and theCommission, but that the President of the Community Delegation wouldbe able to invite two countries, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg(as the country due to succeed to the Presidency at the end of the year)to &quot;present additional statements&quot; providing that they did not actuallycontradict the Community mandate.    But, of course, any Communitymandate required unanimity and we would only agree to one which fullytook account of our own interests.    So, both at the Ministerial Conferencein December which he would attend and in the various Commissions, theUnited Kingdom would be able to put its own point of view.    Thisarrangement was not as satisfactory as the separate seat for which wehad pressed.    But in reality the gains of substance we had made in securing French agreement to MSP and the emergency sharing arrange-ments and the separate voice we had gained for the United Kingdomrepresented a good compromise.    We could not have obtained more and what we had secured had only been got by tough and sustained negotiationon the part of the Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had in fact secured the substance ofwhat we had set out to get.    Not only had the French agreed to theprinciple of an MSP and emergency oil sharing but we had secured theright to state our case.    The Press reports of a row between himself and the Federal German Chancellor had been entirely unfounded.    Indeed,Herr Schmidt had been helpful throughout.    After the compromise hadbeen reached President Giscard had said that the result had shown thevalue of the European Council and that the Community had been strengthened by the compromise.    And an editorial in todayJs Le Mondehad pointed out that, as a result of the Prime Minister&apos;s tactics,Community energy policy had made more progress in a few hours thansince the birth of the Community.The Prime Minister added that he had been asked at the lunch attendedonly by Heads of Government about our intentions on import controls.He had said that we were still considering our position.    In the case of cars a decision would depend on the fate of the Chrysler operations inGreat Britain.    President Ortoli of the Commission had been unhelpful andthe other Heads of Government had said that import restraints in theUnited Kingdom on cars would present difficulty.    Action on our part ontextiles and footwear particularly in so far as imports from low costproducers were concerned, would cause much less difficulty as wouldaction on television tubes providing that this was limited to types notsupplied by the European market.
In discussion it was argued that as represented in the media the decisionof the European Council on passports, in particular the proposal that a community passport should have the words &quot;European Community&quot; atthe top, was likely to arouse nationalist reactions in this country.Moreover the practical utility of a European passport was open to question.    On the other hand it was pointed out that the Prime minister had made it clear at the European Council that we would not wish toiu.treduce the new passport before the new nationality legislation whichhad been projected had come into force.    And a whole range of technicalissues which remained to be resolved would need to be studied furtherby the Council of Ministers.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the statements bythe Prime Minister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.7
ARNINGS RULE      3c The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Social Services(C(75) 138) about the earnings rule which governed the amount aretirement pensioner might earn before starting to lose benefit.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in the previousSession of Parliament, an amendment to the uprating Bill had been forced upon the Government;  the amendment raised the earnings rulelimit from  13 a week to  20 a week from April 1975, to  35 from april 1976 and  50 from April 1977.    The expenditure this entailedwas not of high priority in the social security programme and the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had been unanimous inthe view that a short Bill should be introduced to substitute  24 (or ifnecessary  26) for the  35 and thereafter allow the limit to move in line with the movement of earnings in the country at large.    To makethe change in the April 1976 figure it was essential to get a SecondReading of the Bill before Christmas and R.oyal Assent before19 February.    If this were impossible, and an amending Bill couldonly be effective from April 1977, the savings to be had in later years would be greatly reduced and would provide much less justification forthe Bill.    There were two major problems;   could the Bill be fittedinto the timetable, and could the Government carry it in the House?On the first, the position might be easier now that Cabinet had decidedthat the House would not adjourn until Tuesday 23 December.    On thesecond he thought there was a good chance of carrying the Bill sinceone increase in the earnings rule was already effective as a result ofthe amendment, and there was now a much better general unstanding of the need to contain public expenditure.    It would be extremelydifficult for the official Opposition to oppose a move which reducedpublic expenditure, and even if they did so some of their own supportersmight well not support them.    It could be made clear that if this expenditure were not cut some other expenditure, perhaps of highersocial priority, would have to suffer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that thesituation on public expenditure in the medium term made it essentialto try to obtain these savings.    In her view however it would be extremely difficult to get an amending Bill through the House unlessthe Government were prepared to say that the  50 million which wouldbe saved in 1976-77 would be switched to some other socially desirablepurpose.    She had proposed to the Ministerial Committee on economic policy that a fuel bonus of   10 should be paid in February.    Thiswould have cost just over  100 million, and it had been rejected by theCommittee.    She would be prepared to cut the bonus to  5, whichalthough small would be better than nothing.    On this basis she wouldbe willing to talk to the dissident backbenchers to seek to win theiracquiescence in an amending Bill.8
In discussion it was pointed out that there could be no prospect ofgiving such a Bill a Second Reading in the week beginning 8 December,the business for which would have to be announced that afternoon to theHouse.    It would, however, be possible for the Bill to be approved by legislation Committee on Tuesday 9 December and published on10 December, with the possibility of a Second Reading before the christmas adjournment; but the programme was already full andsomething else would have to give way.    One possibility would be to delay by a week the Second Reading of the Armed Forces Bill and seek to persuade the Opposition to agree to complete its SecondReading in half a day, leaving the other half of the day available for aBill on the earnings rule.    It must be doubtful whether in fact theOpposition would agree to such an arrangement.    Other items in theprogramme included the Consolidated Fund Bill, which was essentialbusiness, a Supply Day, which was in the Opposition^ hands, theRate Support Grant Order, which must be approved, and a dayJs debate on unemployment, which had been promised.    On the question ofcarrying the Bill, it would obviously be necessary to speak in advance to the backbenchers who abstained or voted against the Government onthe last occasion, and it was thought that at least some of them wouldbe willing to go along with the Governments proposal,,    While it mightbe difficult for the Opposition to oppose it, the possibility that theymight do so could not be ruled out.    As regards the suggestion that the savings in 1976-77 might be switched to some other socially desirablepurpose, it was strongly represented that it would be wrong tohypothecate savings in this way.    Furthermore it would hi any case bedifficult to switch the saving in a way which did not involve somecontinuing commitment after the first year: the leoaoa of the Christmasbonus should not be forgotten.    It would be tactically better to indicatethat if these savings were not made some other item of desirable public expenditure would have to be cut.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view in Cabinet was that an attempt should be made to reverse the effect of the amendment on the earnings rule carried against theGovernment in the uprating Bill in the previous Session,    As a first step the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Whipshould see the individual Labour Members who either voted againstthe Government or abstained on the last occasion, explain theGovernments intentions to them and seek their acquiescence.    in doing this it would be helpful to indicate that if the Government couldnot make this change other programmes of public expenditure wouldhave to suffer.    The Secretary of State for Social Services should puta Bill forward to Legislation Committee for approval; and the chief whip should consider what re-arrangement of the parliamentary programme between now and Christmas could be made to accommodatea Second Reading of the Bill.    It was noted that, to be effective inApril 1976, the remaining stages of the Bill would need to be given priority after the Christmas Recess so as to ensure Royal Assentby 19 February.9

US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 4 December 1975 at 10. 15 amCHRYSLER(UK) LTDPreviousReference:CC(75) 51stConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of State for industry (C(75) 139), the Secretary of State for Employment(C(75) 140) and 141), and      the Secretary of State for Scotland(C(75) 142), on the future of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that at the last meeting of the Cabinet he had been invited to continue negotiationswith the Chrysler Corporation on the scheme of support for thecontraction of Chrysler (UK) Ltd, listed as scheme B in the annex to his memorandum C(75) 128, and to put in hand a number of studies.Two further meetings had been held with the Chairman of chrysler corporation.    The first at Ministerial level, at which the Ministerof State for Scotland and the Paymaster General together with officials from the Central Policy Review Staff (GPRS) and the PrimeMinister^ office had been present, and the second at official level.The Chrysler Corporation had refused to make any increase in thieirfinancial contribution or to reveal the basis of their offer.    Withthe agreement of the Minister of State for Scotland, Coopers &amp; Lybrandhad been engaged to form an independent assessment of the costs and prospective viability of scheme B.    Their verdict was that it was notviable.    The Secretary of State for Scotland had questioned whetherthis was the right conclusion to draw from their report but they haddirectly agreed to the use of these words.    As the Cabinet had requested he had consulted the chairman of British Leyland (BL) onthe question of whether they could expand their output by taking over some of the assets of Chrysler (UK)Ltd, and in particularwhether they might use the Linwood facilities to expand production ofLand Rovers.    BL were strongly opposed to this; the only partsof Chryslers business in which they might have an interest would bethe Iranian contract, certain test facilities and some of the dealerships.Both he and the Chairman of the National Enterprise Board consideredthat if scheme B were to be adopted this would be damaging toBritish Leyland, while Ford and General Motors had warned him that support for Chrysler could put the plans for their British companies in jeopardy.
The Cabinet had invited him, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Employment to seek the views of trades union leaders onthe possible courses open to the Government.    This he had done.The union officials had been appalled at the prospects v/hich had tobe faced.    Although the merits of scheme B had been made clear tothem they had spontaneously and uncompromisingly rejected it and said that it would be unacceptable to all Chrysler employees.    Theyhad commented that the contracted company envisaged in scheme Bwas too small to be viable and would collapse within two years andthat the right course for the Government was to make no deal withthe Chrysler Corporation but force them to take the odium for the closure.    The Government should however take steps to providealternative employment, should pay the wages of all Chryslerworkers for six months while other plans were produced and shouldimpose restrictions on the imports of cars.    It was true that noScottish trade unionists had taken part in the meeting but the composition of the trades union party had been left, rightly in his view, to the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress.It was clear that, whatever the views of Scottish trades unionists,the representatives of the workers at Ryton were not prepared toagree to any arrangements which sacrificed jobs at l&amp;sir plant vtobring employment to Scotland.During the past four weeks he had examined many options fordealing with the Chrysler problem.    If there were any prospectof restoring Chrysler (UK) Ltd to viability he would have put aproposal forward immediately, even if it involved large expenditure;but he had concluded with great reluctance that none of the optionscould be supported.    He warned the Cabinet that the timing of adecision was not entirely in their hands: there was nothing to stop the Chairman of the Chrysler Corporation making an announce -ment at any time he wished.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that while he did not quarrel with the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s reportof their joint meeting with trades union officials he did not considerthat its conclusion was so clear cut.    The union representatives had all been angry about Chrysler&apos;s behaviour but he believed thatif they were brought to recognise that scheme B was the only alternative to closure of the entire company they would not oppose it.On the central issue he came to a different conclusion from theSecretary of State for Industry, principally because of his concern for the consequences in Scotland.    Closure of Linwood would makefar worse a situation which was already bad and would put injeopardy the whole of the Governments position in Scotland.    TheGovernment could not put all the blame for closure on Chrysler.It would inevitably become public knowledge that the corporation had been prepared to make a large contribution towards the costs of saving a substantial number of jobs and that this proposal had been rejected by the Government.    Closure would mean the loss of
55, 000 jobs; the costs,  150 million in unemployment pay and lossof taxes and.  30 million for a redundancy scheme, were higher thanthe highest estimate of the cost of proceeding with scheme B.While it might be that some further contraction would have to followat additional cost the scheme would both permit a slower rundownand have a lower initial cost.    There should be further investigation of whether it could go ahead without the physical transfer ofmachinery from the Midlands.    The Government should not be pressed to an ill-considered decision by Chrysler.    They shouldtake at least a further week to consider what further improvementscould be made to scheme B.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that a decisionon this matter could not be taken without full regard to the political consequences which it would bring in Scotland.    The Linwood planthad a symboHc importance.    The Governments proposals for devolution had been widely criticised in Scotland on the grounds that insufficient economic powers were to be developed and because ofthe overriding powers to be retained at Westminster.    They hadbeen attacked not only by the Opposition but also by the ScottishTrades Union Congress.    If the Government announced that itsupported total closure of Chrysler (UK)Ltd when there was thealternative of preserving a part of it their position would be indefensible.    He had noted that at the previous meeting of the Cabinetthe Chrysler Corporation had been quoted as describing scheme Bas &quot;politically viable, but not economically viable&quot;.    Mr Riccardohimself denied having said that and believed that it was both politically and economically viable.    When a scheme had been considered by theIndustrial Development Advisory Board (IDAB) they had dividedequally on it, but this was on the assumption that if Chrysler made any contribution to its costs it would be no more than  10 million,Now Chrysler were offering  35 million, and the waiving of debtsof  20 million.    The Government contribution would be  43 million:the cost to the Government of closure would be  180 million.    Thereport by Coopers &amp; Lybrand did not itself say that scheme B wasnot viable.    As to the consultation with the trades unions he feltthat it was unfair to have expected an immediate reaction.     Whilethe union leaders had opposed scheme B this view had to be readagainst their desire for nationalisation of the complete company ashad happened with British Leyland.    It would not be right to decideagainst scheme B because it might involve industrial disputes atone plant.    If the closure went ahead there would be industrialtrouble at every Chrysler plant and the situation in Scotland wouldbe exacerbated by the knowledge that there had been a continuousoutflow of job opportunities to England.    He believed that theGovernments approach had been over-influenced by the GPRS rejport.He believed that it was necessary to get closer to the chrysler corporation by further negotiations, to look further at the options ,and to have further and wider talks with the trades union movement.3
In discussion, it was argued that some parts of Chrysler (UK)Ltd&apos;business could be continued profitably - the contract with Iran whichcould have large consequences for the balance of payments, thecommercial vehicle business, the Avenger engine and the spare partsbusiness.    It would be a mistake to allow these worthwhile activities to be closed because the company as a whole was unviable.    the chrysler Corporation would not themselves be proposing a contractionrather than a closure if the contracted company had ho prospect ofviability.    The report by Coopers &amp; L/ybrand was not totallyunfavourable to scheme B.    On the other hand it was argued thatif the Government supported one unviable company because of the fear of consequences of closure this would lead to a series of othersuch cases.    A number of options had already been explored overthe previous 4 weeks.    Whatever might be the viability of scheme B,it was not feasible because it involved the movement of work from theMidlands to Scotland.    If the closure went ahead now the odium for it would at least be shared with the Chrysler Corporation.    If theGovernment took over the Company any subsequent closures wouldbe its responsibility alone, yet if the contraction plans led to industrial disputes the plans might have to be abandoned within amonth or at some time later when it was even more difficult for theGovernment.    There would always be strong arguments against taking a painful decision but if it were not faced the Government&apos;industrial and economic policies would be discredited.    The issue of devolution could not justify continual measures to appease thenationalist movements.    There was already a strong backlash inEngland against the proposals on devolution and additional concessionswould mean that the devolution legislation would not be passed.In further discussion it was questioned whether the cost comparisonswhich had been quoted ware correct.    If scheme B were supported itwould defer but not avert the costs of closure, these should thereforealso be taken into account and the eventual coot would be in the region of  260 million.    Furthermore if scheme B went ahead some two fifths of Chrysler&apos;s employees would still become redundant andin consequence costs of  60 million, two fifths of the costs of completeclosure, would still fall on the Government.    It was also questioned whether the estimated costs of closure took sufficient account of theincrease in employment by other British manufacturers which couldfollow the imposition of import controls and whether it was right toassume that there would be a net increase of unemployment of55, 000 for a complete year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would need to resume their discussion the following day.The arguments which he had heard so far did not seem to him to answer completely the case made by the Secretary of State for industry.    Before the discussion was resumed however some additional course of action should be investigated urgently.    First
the Government might itself take over Linwood and arrange theproduction and marketing of Land Rovers and Range Rovers.    If anorder was placed p*V the Governments account there might be good prospects of the vehicles being sold overseas when world economic activity increased.    The armed forces might also increase their purchases.    The second course would be to insist that if Chryslerclosed the Linwood plant should be transferred free of charge to theGovernment.    This would give some assurance at least that theGovernment would make every effort to ensure that alternative employment was brought there at the earliest possible moment.It would also be helpful if the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwould involve himself, before their next meeting in an examinationof the practicability of securing the continued operation of those parts of Chryslers business which had a viable future.    In doing so he should concentrate particularly on the possibility of preservingemployment at Linwood.The Cabinet -1.
