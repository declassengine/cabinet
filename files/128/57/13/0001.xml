THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the lifting of the United States ban on arms deliveries to turkey and the more settled political situation in Turkey following the elections cleared the way for a move by the TurkishGovernment towards a Cyprus settlement.    representations were being made in Ankara by the United States Government, by ourselves and by the European Community, desigaed to convince the Turkish Government that a very early move from them was now required.    They must delay no further in indicating whatterritorial adjustments in Cyprus they were prepared to make:this could either be done direct to the Greek Cypriots or throughwhatever third party they might like to use.    The Prime minister had had useful discussion with the Prime Minister of Greece,Mr Karamanlis, whose visit to this country had been fruitful in several directions.Latin america the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that wewere continuing to strengthen our relations with the latin american countries.

But they had not publicly made this link as indeed they would have been wrong to do; their reason
for opposing our Line on aid was simply that they were not preparedto find the money.

INDUSTRIAL 3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of the strategy Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Industry (C(75) 106) towhich was attached a draft paper on an approach to industrialstrategy for circulation to the National Economic DevelopmentCouncilTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Governmentwere publicly committed to a discussion on an approach to industrialstrategy at the meeting of the National Economic development council (NEDC) on 5 November.    The Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy (MES) had considered the question on 6 october and the draft paper took account of their views.    The approachproposed did not aim to tackle the problems facing the British economy in the next twelve months;  it was designed for the medium and long-term - 5 to 10 years ahead.    Apart from a short period of.growth in the 1930s, britain s manufacturing industry had declinedsteadily since the 1870s, compaxed with its competitors;  withinrecent times the decline had accelerated.    As the economyrecovered from the present slump demand would increase for imported manufactured goods; this would damage the balance ofpayments.    In the Industry Act, and through planning agreements and the National Enterprise Board the Government would havevaluable new instruments to influence the development of manufacturing industry.    But they lacked a framework or strategyin which to use them.    There was no way of deciding wherepriorities lay or relating policy for one industry to that of anotherover the medium-term.    An industrial strategy had to be evolved,and closely linked with manpower planning in all its contexts.The Secretary of State for Employment would therefore be producing a parallel paper for the NEDC on manpower.The new approach was designed to be flexible, and to engage thesupport and co-operation of management and unions with theGovernment.    The national plan of 1965 and its predecessors had failed because they sought to be too comprehensive and were basedtoo rigidly on unattainable growth targets.    The kind of approachnow proposed had been followed successfully in Scandinavia and austria and by the Japanese and the French.    The Government would developcriteria for deciding which industries deserved support because oftheir contribution to exports and import saving; because they werecritically important to other industries; because they were doingwell, or were potentially successful.    The  100 million he hadallocated in  his last     1 Budget to assist certain industries and improve manpower planning was an initial step towards the develop-ment now intended.    Detailed criteria, and their application to major sectors of industry would be presented to the NEDC early inthe New Year.    In a normal year there would be three stages;first the Government would set out to the NEDC its medium termprojection; then the sectors would receive further study from the4
individual economic development committees starting from thekind of profile annexed to C(75) 106;  and towards the end of theyear, this work would be brought together at a meeting of the Councilso that its findings might influence the Governments Budgetdecisions.   The scheme would apply to the nationalised industries aswell as to the private sector, and would complement planning agreements and the investment made by the National EnterpriseBoard (not).    As the scheme developed, the trades unions and employers would become more closely involved with the Governmentin the planning of macro-economic policy.MES had decided that the paper for the NEDC should be published atthe time of circulation, to avoid premature and distorted disclosure.The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) had both said that they opposed publication inadvance of the NEDC discussion, and he believed that the Governmentshould accept this view.    It would however be right to publish the document after the meeting had taken place, or if there were any premature leak.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that, althoughthe paper was not designed to deal with the immediate economicsituation, a coherent industrial strategy was essential to beat the longer term problems.    The paper had been written in the light ofthe pamphlet &quot;Labour and Industry;  The Next Steps&quot; which hadbeen prepared by the National Executive Committee of the Labour party and endorsed by the Party Conference.    The pamphlet recognisedthat there was no point in producing goods which could not be sold,and that industrial performance must take priority over socialdemands.   Low productivity, over-manning and the interruption ofproduction through industrial disputes were too prevalent in Britishindustry;  it had been demonstrated that, even with comparable plant,it took twice as many man-hours to make an identical car in britain as in Europe.    Through planning agreements and industrial democracy the support of the workforce must be engaged.    The TUChad an essential part to play.   He believed that the CBI as well asthe TUC would lend their support to the new approach.In discussion, it was suggested that, although the approach was generally correct, it would be wise to emphasise the preliminarynature of the proposals and to point out that the paper dealt with an approach to an industrial strategy rather than a strategy itself.That strategy must not be framed too narrowly;  it would have to take account of the development of world trade and of the competitive position of British industry relative to other countries in world markets.    In particular, the approach should be framed in the context of the European Economic Community (e.c.), where all internal&apos;tariffs would be removed by 1977.    The consequences for Britishindustry of this new tariff situation should be covered in the paper.5
Although the approach -vac confined to manufacturing industry, it wouldbe unwise to concentrate wholly on visible trade and ignore the contribution of investment for example.    The new sectoral approach should not be allowed to overshadow planning agreements nor to diminish the importance of Departmental planning at company level.It was debatable whether short-term and medium-term problemscould be separated to the extent that had been suggested.The paper rightly drew attention to the causes of past weakness,but it had to be recognised that there were many efficient industries,judged by world standards, and efficient firms   within decliningindustries.    The Government could greatly influence industrialdevelopment through public sector purchasing.    The export potential of many industries, such as those engaged in making drugs ormedical equipment, could be enhanced by positive initiative in thisdirection.    The paper should be directed with greater effect toengaging the support of trades unionists.    It was inevitable thatimproving the competitive posture of many industries would meanmassive redeployment of labour.    Even in those industries wherethe Government had invested heavily, productivity was below target.The paper should highlight the essential contribution of the trades union to overcoming the weaknesses that were exposed.There were other factors that needed to be mentioned:  the link between macro-economic and micro-economic policies; theinfluence of cultural and social values in attitudes towards industry;the importance of integrating training and education in order to stimulate a better quality of management and better understandingby trade unionists of the problems involved.On the other hand, it was argued that the paper required fundamental changes to make it acceptable and that it should not be put forward for discussion by the NEDC in November.    In its present form itwas turgid and diffuse, and bore little relevance either to theimmediate economic problems or to the solutions, as opposed to the analysis, put forward in &quot;Labour and Industry:  The Next Steps&quot;.It was neither a plan nor a strategy;  industrial strategy could not bedivorced from social strategy and the emphasis of the present paper on the subordination of social objectives to industrial performancewould dismay the Governments supporters and alienate the TUC.There was too much emphasis on holding back expenditure and onthe need to retain profits.    It was wrong to aim for a consensusapproach;  the Government should strengthen and extend the powersof intervention which the Industry Bill provided.   More resources should be given to the not, so that it might intervene more effectively in industry.    There was no reference to import controls,although these had been an important element in the resurgence ofindustry in the 1930s.    The part played by large firms inmanipulating world trade was entirely ignored.    The paper should6
therefore be rewritten in a -wider context, which could relate longertex-m c&apos;./,jv^C.-Ua to the immediate problems of the next six months;the Governments social strategy;  the manpower implications;and the part to be played by the trades unions.    Although a further postponement of the NEDC discussion would be difficult andembarrassing, the political consequences of going ahead with an inadequate and ill-considered policy were the more damaging.Whatever the Government said, the paper would.be interpreted asa response to the proei;2ifc situation and would give rise to a greatsense of disappointment.In further discussion it was argued that, although the short-term problems were serious, action to improve the competitive positionof British industry in the medium and long-torm could not be postponed.    The present weaknesses arose from a number of factors, including the framing of Government macro-economic policy without full regard to the effects on individual industries.The criticisms of detail could be met by adding a preface to thepaper showing the link with short-term problems and by redraftingthe main document to bring out the points made in the earlier partof the discussion.    As for the fundamental objections to the content and the timing of publication, it had to be accepted that a further postponement would damage the Governments credibility with the cbi and the TUC.    The nature of planning agreements and thepowers entrusted to the not as set out in the Industry Bill now before Parliament had been determined by the ministerial committee on Industrial Development (IDV).    It would be unwise toadopt a fiercely interventionist stance, since only by enlisting theco-operation of both sides of industry could a new approach to industrial strategy succeed.    The aim must be to identify growthpoints in industry and to give them full backing;  social factors wereimportant, but a continuing decline in our industrial performancecould only lead to a tattered and ineffective social programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion within the Cabinet was in favour of presenting a paper on industrial strategy for discussion by the NEDC at Chequerson 6 November which       set out the basic approach described inC(75) 106.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Industry should however jointly arrange for the present draft to be revised in the light of the discussion.    In particular,it should be prefaced by a passage relating the medium and long-term objectives of industrial strategy to the immediate short-term economic problems.    Many of the criticisms from those whoaccepted the basic approach were directed at omissions from the text or at the tone of the presentation?particularly at its likely impact on the Governments supporters and on the TUC.    The new draft should bring out the need to set British industrial performance inan international context, with particular reference to e.c. tariff policy.It should refer to the role of public procurement policy in promoting
exports.    It should relate the industrial policy to the role of theNEB and planning agreements, as agreed by IDV and contained in theIndustry Bill.    Finally, the paper should bring out clearly theessential role of the trades unions, as well as of the Governmentand the CBI in developing the new economic strategy.The revised paper should be considered by MES as early ag possiblein the following week, and subject to their clearance, should be circulated in the normal way to the NEDC.    It would be best not to publish the paper before the NEDC meeting on 5 November, althoughpublication might be necessary if a leak occurred.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Industry, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment, should arrange for speaking notes for Ministers to be prepared and circulated to all members of the Government after clearance of thepaper in MES so that all Ministers might be aware of what the new approach to industrial strategy was designed to achieve and be ableto respond to any criticism.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Industry to revise the draft paper on an approach to industrial strategy on the lines indicated in the summing up, and to circulate it to the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy fordiscussion in the following week.3.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Industry, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Employment, to preparespeaking notes for Ministers on the implications of the new approach to industrial strategy and, subjectto clearance of the paper by the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy, to circulate them as indicatedin the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.8
THE STATE OF 4. The Cabinet considered the present difficulties of theTHE NATIONAL, National Health Service (NHS) and the desirabiHty of establishingHEALTH SERVICE     an inquiry into the NHS.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthere had recently been an unprecedently violent campaign against their personally, on the ground that, as a result of her policies,the NHS was about to collapse.    The suggestion that a crisis ofthis nature was imminent was completely misleading.    Much playhad been made with the number of doctors alleged to be emigrating;but the fact was that, although the number leaving this country during the present year would show an increase, it would notapproach the numbers who had been emigrating in the earlysixties or give grounds for expecting a crisis.    There were,however, many serious problems in the NHS.    In particular,financial stringency meant that there were many areas whereadequate provision could not be made.    This was a source of lowmorale amongst staff, which was made all the worse by the fear that the inevitable search for economies would lead toredundancies.    The position had been worsened by the effect ofthe recent administrative reorganisation of the NHS carried out bythe previous Conservative Government.    The new  structure wasinefficient, wasteful, frustrating and unnecessarily elaborate,particularly at the regional level,    But a remedy was difficult tofind because any suggestion that there might be another earlyrestructuring would damage morale still further.   All types of staff were becoming more assertive; but the difficulty was particularlyacute with the doctors, where an immediate crisis was threatened by the dispute over junior doctors&apos; pay.    Here the position wasthat the doctors had been promised a new contract, to be effective from 1 October, which would include a new scheme of overtimepayments.    In deference to evidence from the Government aboutthe application of pay policy , the Doctors and Dentists review body had accepted that the new contract must be priced within thecost of the present pay bill;  and the result of this was that, whilehalf the junior doctors would be better off, about one-third wouldactually lose financially.    The junior doctors negotiators had reluctantly agreed to the new contract on this basis; but then,following pressure from their constituents, had resided from their agreement.    If the Cabinet endorsed the view which had been expressed by the Secretary of State for Employment that in theinterests of pay policy no concession should be made (for example,by allowing a &quot;no detriment&quot; provision, at a cost of  1.5 million),there would almost certainly be industrial action by the doctors whostood to lose, and consequent harm to patients.    It would then be essential to make clear that the decision had not been takenpersonally by the Secretary of State for Social Services but was adecision reached by the Government collectively, having regardto the overriding importance of protecting the pay policy.j i    H 1 1 lAL
Another fa.ctor in the hostile attitude of the doctors was thesituation in relation to pay beds and private practice    Here the doctors were particularly concerned about the proposal that, inconjunction with the phasing out of pay beds, additional powers should be taken to control the private sector.    This was an area where she was under as much pressure from the NHS trade unionsas from the doctors; the former took the view that, if they were tobe able to prevent precipitate action by their members againstprivate patients, there must be urgent legislative action both tophase out pay beds and to control the private sector so as to protect the interests of the NHS.There had for some time been demands for an independent inquiry into the NHS.    On the doctors side, part of the motivation was thehope of showing that, given the restriction on the resources whichthe Government could provide, valuable additional resources mightbe obtained from the private sector.    It was in her view unlikelythat any independent committee would support this view.    other groups, in particular the nurses, were now supporting the demandfor an inquiry.    In present circumstances an inquiry had in herview become desirable, in particular on tactical grounds.    It had ,come to occupy a position of major symbolic importance in the minds of the doctors, and it was doubtful whether the present difficulties with them could now be settled without an inquiry.Moreover, it was unlikely that, in the absence of an inquiry, staffin the NHS would be prepared to co-operate in securing badly neededadministrative economies.    She therefore recommended the 1establishment of an inquiry, which might have as its terms ofreference:  &quot;To examine the financial and manpower resources available to the NHS, their use and management;  and to make recommendations. &quot;   It should not be asked to deal with pay bedsand private practice, since these were matters which, in theinterests of removing uncertainty with the minimum of delay,should be dealt with by direct discussions with the interests concerned.In discussion of the pay of junior doctors, there was generalagreement that, in view of the paramount importance of protecting the Governments pay policy, no concession involving any breach of that policy could be offered.    The doctors could however begiven a choice between standing by the agreement which had beenreached but repudiated by them, and deferring the introduction ofthe new contract until April 1976.    It would then be possible toinclude a no detriment clause, the cost of which would be set offagainst the total pay increase agreed for junior doctors as a whole.10
In discussion of the desirability of an inquiry, it was argued that although it might produce little in the way of new information orhelpful recommendations it was in present circumstances essential for tactical reasons that one should be set up.    Moreover therewas a prospect that it would at any rate be able to suggest somebadly needed improvements in the present highly unsatisfactoryadministrative structure (and thus incidentally vindicate thewarnings about the new structure which the Labour Party had givenwhen in opposition).    It might also be able to identify more precisely the grievances of some of the groups of NHS staff.The Government had little to fear from such an inquiry, andprobably something to gain;  for there had hitherto been littlegeneral realisation of how much had been done during the lasteighteen months to provide additional resources for the NHS andin particular to restore some of the pay relativities which theprevious Government had allowed to become depressed.    Thedanger was that, if there were no inquiry, staff militancy wouldescalate, leading to industrial action j   and that the public wouldthen become alarmed, forcing the Government to make concessions -for example, to the junior medical staff - which would underminepay policy.    On the ether hand, it was argued that an inquiry,though unlikely to produce valuable new ideas, could well make recommendations which would be unacceptable and embarrassing.Moreover, it would not necessarily raise the morale of the staff:the majority were going about their work conscientiously, and news of a further inquiry might merely lower their morale.    And it was doubtful whether the question of private practice could be excludedfrom the inquiry - indeed,   there might well be pressure on theGovernment to hold up their plans even for phasing out pay bedsuntil the inquiry was complete.In further discussion, it was argued that any inquiry should be aimed primarily at finding ways of meeting the needs of patientsmore effectively rather than at remedying the real or imaginedgrievances of NHS staff.    Moreover, an inquiry must not beallowed to pre-empt the Governments decisions on public expenditure:  since shortage of resources was one of the major problems of the NHS, there was an obvious risk that an inquiry would recommend major increases in the size of the healthprogramme.    This would be unacceptable and unfair to the ministers responsible for other spending programmes; and it would be essential for the terms of reference to be framed so as to precludethis type of recommendation.    It was desirable that the inquiry should deal with the future of private practice, since the presenta-tion and timing of the Governments proposals on pay beds and private practice had given rise to not unjustifiable concern on thepart of the medical profession.11
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing t\p the discussion, said that theCabinet had agreed that the junior doctors must not be allowed tobreach the Governments pay policy.    They should therefore be offered a choice between adhering to the agreement to which their leaders had assented, recognising that on this basis some individualswould gain financially and others lose, or postponing the introductionof a new contract until April 1976 on the basis which had been indicated in the Cabinets discussion.    In view of the unjustifiedpersonal attacks which were currently being made on the Secretaryof State for Social Services, Ministers generally should take every opportunity of emphasising that the decision on junior doctors&apos; paywas one which the Government had taken collectively in the lightof the overriding importance of counter-inflation policy.    On the wider question of the general state of the NHS, the Cabinet agreed in principle that it would, be desirable in present circumstances toarrange for the early establishment of an independent inquiry.Its terms of reference would need careful thought: they shouldrelate to the interests botb. of patients and of staff in the NHS;  and while inviting recommendations about the use and management ofthe available resources, both material and manpower, they shouldexclude recommendations for increases in the financial resourcesprovided by the Government.    The Government would proceed onthe lines already agreed with the phasing out of pay beds; but itwas lor further consideration what if anything the terms ofreference should say about whether the inquiry could touch on the broader question of the future of private practice.    The cabinet had authorised him, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretaries of State for Employment, social services, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to settle the precise wording of the terms of reference in the light of the points made in discussion.    The same group of Ministers would alsodecide what form the inquiry should take - in particular whether itshould be a Royal Commission or a Departmental inquiry - and what arrangements should be made for announcement of theGovernments decisions.    It was clear, in view of the stage reached in the negotiations with the medical profession, that a very-early announcement was desirable.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office16 October 1975
