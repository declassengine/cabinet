PARLIAMENTARY   10 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the\FFAIRS House of Commons during the following week.fHE 2, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordQUEEN&apos;S President of the Council (C(75) 104) to which were attached drafts ofSPEECHES The Queen&apos;s Speeches on the Opening of the new Session and on the prorogation of Parliament.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that both draftSpeeches were longer than usual, because they contained moreexplanation and attempted to relate specific proposals to theGovernments general strategy.    He understood that Speeches of thislength would be acceptable to The Queen0    The draft Opening Speechdid not mention all the Bills in next Session&apos;^ legislative programmebut only the more important ones.    Passages relating to somematters on which firm policy decisions had not yet been taken were in square brackets.The Cabinet considered the draft Opening Speech paragraph by paragraph, and the following main points we-.ce made.Paragraph 10.    The Ministers concerned would consider further the wording of the passage relating to the courts dealing with those responsible for violence.Paragraph 12.    The opening sentence should refer to the attack onunemployment as well as inflation, and the final sentence should follow more closely the wording of the White Paper, &quot;The Attack onInflation&quot;.    The reference to legislation on prices should be omitted,although a Prices Bill had a firm place in next Session!s programme.The Lord President of the Council, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer3 the Secretary of State for Employment and theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection, should prepare a redraft of this paragraph on the lines agreed in thediscussion.Following paragraph 13 a new paragraph should be inserted indicating the Governments intention to give effect to the proposals flowing fromthe Review of Civil Aviation Policy,    It was not yet certain whether legislation would be required for this purpose, and the new paragraph should not be in terms which committed the Government to introducingsuch legislation, if required, in the course of the next Session.Paragraph 20 should be retained.    It was noted that the lord president of the Council had in mind that the Committee to reviewParliamentary practice and procedure might include some members from outside Parliament.
Paragraph 22.    It was expected that the Bill on Agricultural TiedCottages would be ready for introduction before Easter, andconsultations with interested parties, including the National Farmers1Union and local authorities, were now in progress.Paragraph 23a    The Select Committee on the Wealth Tax was alreadyfour months late in reporting, and it was not certain whetherprovisions for a wealth tax could be included in next year&apos;s finance bill.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer intended at the least to publish draft clauses during the course of next Session, but the wealthtax could not in any circumstances come into operation until 1977-78.The Opening Speech could therefore not contain any very precisecommitment;  and the best course would be for the somewhat vague and unsatisfactory sentence in the draft to be omitted and for the positionto be explained by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Debate on the address.Paragraph 24.    It was pointed out that the Cabinet had decided not toinclude legislation on the phasing out of pay beds and the control ofprivate practice in the programme for 1975-76, but instead had put itat the top of the reserve list of Bills.    It was for that reason that thedraft Speech referred to &quot;proposals&quot; rather than to the introduction oflegislation.    The best course would be to keep the content of theprogramme under review as the Session proceeded and to introduce aBill on pay beds if time permitted.    The next Session would beunusually short because of the need to defer the date of its opening,and if a firm commitment to legislation were made at this stage itwould be necessary to remove a Bill which was already in theprogramme in order to provide the necessary time;  moreover itwould involve giving legislation on pay beds higher priority than all theother reserve Bills, even though some of them were of considerable importance.    On the other hand, it was argued that the political importance of legislation on pay beds had much increased ajnce theCabinet&apos;s discussion of the next Sessiou&apos;s legislative programme.The Prime Minister had recently made clear to a deputation from theBritish Medical Association that the Government were not prepared to defer their plans for legislation on phasing out pay beds pending theReport of the Royal Commission on the National Health Service (NHS);and it was important that early action should be taken in order toremove the uncertainty which would otherwise ensue and to meet thestrongly held views of the Governments supporters in Parliament andin the trade union movement.    It was therefore desirable that the queen&apos;s Speech should contain an undertaking that legislation onphasing out pay beds would be introduced in the course of the Session,but it would not be essential that the legislation should reach theStatute Book by the end of the Session or that it should be introduced atan early stage - indeed, the converse might be desirable, given thatconsultations on the Governments proposals were still in progress
and might affect the timetable for phasing out, and that the issue was of importance in relation to the work of the Royal Commission on the nhs.    The question what controls were needed over the private sector, and in particular whether they should relate to the quantity aswell as the quality of private provision, was a quite separate one.    Itwould be undesirable to give the impression that the Government wereanticipating the outcome of the present consultations;  and if legislationultimately proved desirable, it might be best to promote a separate bill rather than to deal with the matter in the legislation on pay beds.The draft Speech should therefore merely say that the consultations which were taking place about the powers needed to regulate theprivate sector would continue.Paragraph 27,    The October 1974 Manifesto had promised to replace the Official Secrets Acts by a measure to put the burden on public authorities to justify withholding information.    The sentence on thissubject should be retained, but should not commit the Government tothe preparation of proposals to liberalise the law, as distinct from thepractice, relating to official information.A new paragraph should be inserted promising early consideration ofthe Law Commission&apos;s forthcoming Report on the Law on Conspiracywith a view to the preparation of comprehensive proposals for reform.The Cabinet agreed a number of other minor amendments to the draftOpening Speech.The Cabinet approved the draft Prorogation Speech without amendment,subject to the addition of a sentence on the arrangements for givingassistance to Opposition Parties for their work in Parliament,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the drafts of the two Speeches, subject to the amendments and additions agreed in discussion, and to furtherconsideration by the Ministers concerned of paragraphs 10 and 12 ofthe Opening Speech and of the additional paragraph on civil aviation.Paragraph 24 of the Opening Speech should be amended to indicatethat legislation on phasing out pay beds would be introduced in thecourse of the Session; but the Cabinet had agreed that this did not imply that the Bill, once introduced, would necessarily reach theStatute Book by the end of the Session,    There was therefore no decision at this stage that another Bill should be dropped from theprogramme already agreed in order to make room for it.    As regardspowers to control the private sector, the Speech would merely saythat the consultations now in progress would continue.    The lord president of the Council should now arrange for revised drafts of the speeches to be prepared and circulated to the Cabinet,

FOREIGN 3, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidAFFAIRS that the official visit by Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia had beenvery successful and useful results were expected.SaudiArabiaBrazil THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visit by the Brazilian Foreign Minister, Senor da Silveira, had alsobeen successful though it had inevitably been somewhat overshadowedby the simultaneous visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.Belize THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theColony of Belize, which had been self-governing since 1964, nowwanted to proceed to independence.    The Commonwealth PrimeMinisters at their last meeting in Jamaica had supported Belizeanaspirations and had urged us to bring Belize to independence in thenear future.    We had no objection to this.    The complication arose from a territorial claim to Belize by Guatemala which9 although it had some arguable historic basis, was quite out of keeping with the spiritof the present age:  and the consequent desire of Belize for amilitary guarantee.    We were attempting to persuade Guatemala ofthe unreality of their claim and to secure in the United Nations aresolution which, while supporting Belizean independence, was not toohumiliating to Guatemala,    There was some risk that theGuatemalans might react by invading Belizean territory:  indeed theyhad already been doing some sabre rattling.    We had therefore sent a small reinforcement to Belize and might need further to reinforce the garrison.    It was however his hope that the situation could be resolved without conflict.    He had spoken about it to the Brazilianand Venezuelan Foreign Ministers in the course of the last week.The United States Government had been consulted some two months ago and had taken certain private steps to prevent an exacerbation ofthe situation.    Assuming that Belize could be brought to independence within the next 12 months, the problem would remain of providing the newly independent country with some guarantee against subsequentinvasion,    We had a responsibility towards our dependent territoriesbut could not continue this after independence, even though manyCommonwealth countries would like us to do so.    It was to be hopedthat suitable international arrangements could be made.    There was afurther complication in the form of a Mexican claim to the territory of Belize: but this was at present a minor factor, particularly as the mexican President and Foreign Minister were themselves divided onthe issue,
In reply to a question THE&quot; FOREIGN AND commonwealth secretary said that the Argentine Government found it necessaryfor internal reasons to maintain publicly their claim to the falkland islands,    He had however had a talk with the Argentine ForeignMinister, Scnor Robledo, about it recently and did not expect it to bebrought to a head for the time being.The Cabinet -1, Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,In reply to a question about reports that Japanese nuclear waste was tobe processed in this country, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORENERGY said that he had asked for the matter to be consideredcollectively by Ministers.    His own view was that there was basicallynothing secret about the proposal and that there would be advantage inmaking full information available to Parliament and the public.The Cabinet -2. Took note.
MEASURESTOALLEVIATEUNEMPLOYMENTIN THECONSTRUCTIONINDUSTRYPreviousReference:CC(75) 40thConclusions4, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(75) 107) on measures to alleviate unemployment inthe construction industry, within the context of the steps that had beenagreed by the Cabinet at their meeting on 22 September.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet had invited him on 22 September, in consultation with the ministers principally concerned, to work out details of increases in expenditure on construction in the public sector v/hich could be put inhand without delay as part of the measures the Government had thenagreed to take to alleviate unemployment.    The proposals for expenditure set out in the Annex to his paper had been discussed with departments, and there had been intense competition for shares ofthe  30 million total.    His proposals represented the bestcompromise that could be reached between conflicting claims withinthe priorities which had already been agreed by the Cabinet.    Thus,the money would be spent on schemes with a substantial labourcontent, whether by commercial firms or direct labour organisations,within a carefully defined programme of work that would be relevant to the Governments principal social priorities.    Departments had agreed that these should be concentrated on the Assisted Areas, withspecial emphasis on inner city areas.    In Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland the money would be spent as the respectiveSecretaries of State decided.    On the allocation for England, halfwould be spent on improvements to local authority housing and theremainder would be allocated equally between the National health service, education, and other local authority services.    Net of savings on unemployment benefit that would otherwise have to be paid,the cost of the scheme would be  15 million.    There would be a smalleffect on the balance of payments amounting to  4 million for imported materials.    It was estimated that the scheme would provide about, 000 jobs and reduce the number on the unemployment register byabout 4, 000,    Since his paper had been circulated, there had beendiscussions between the Government and the Consultative Council on local Government Finance at which attention had been drawn to thefact that the total expenditure by local authorities in the current year was likely to exceed by  200 million the amount that had been allocated to them in his Budget the previous April.    In thesecircumstances it might be undesirable to press local authorities toincrease their expenditure on education or personal social servicesbut rather to concentrate on improvements to local authority housing.In discussion it was argued that distributed expenditure of the kind proposed would have little political impact.    It would make moresense to concentrate the  30 million on one item,, housing forexample.    Against this, it was argued that any attempt to withholdthe  4 million to be allocated under the scheme to local authority expenditure on personal social services would arouse bitter
resentment.     The local authorities were now finding out what wouldbe the effect or. the personal social services of the 6 per cent cutamounting to  39 million v/hich had been imposed by the Governmenton their spending.    This would result in the closure of large numbersof places in homes for the elderly and in children&apos;s homes, and a significant reduction in the services that were being provided underthe Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act.    As for the education service, it was pointed out that the local authority budget was more likely to be underspent than overspent.    It was further argued that theallocation of  2^ million to Wales should be increased.    Unemploymentin the construction industry in Wales was higher than in any other partof the country, while the total sum now to be made available had been calculated on the basis of average unemployment in the construction industry over the whole country.    Local authority services in Waleshad recently been subjected to much more stringent limitations thanLhose in the rest of the country, and there was therefore a strong case for giving Wales a larger share of this money.In further discussion it was pointed out that if the Governmentsmeasures were to have any significant effect on unemployment, verymuch more money would have to be spent, though short of a generalreflation of the economy.    The unemployment figures were risingsteadily, and the Government would soon come under strong pressure from their supporters in Parliament and throughout the country.    Thesum now being allocated to help unemployment in the construction industry was inadequate when the total number of jobs that would be created were set against the unemployment figures.    Nevertheless,the scheme now put forward followed closely the lines which hadbeen laid down by the Cabinet at their meeting on22 September.    Within the limitations that had to be imposed,Departments had reached conclusions between themselves and theTreasury as to how the money should be spent.    It was recognisedthat much more money could be spent to create jobs, but theseproposals, taken with the other measures which had been agreed on22 September, should go some way to meeting the objectives theCabinet had in mind when they last discussed the matter.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would have a more general discussion of the unemployment situation in the near future.    The present paper was concerned only with a specific proposal for alleviating unemployment that had beendiscussed by the Cabinet when they previously considered thisquestion on 22 September.    It had evidently not been easy to reach agreement about the way in which the total sum of money should be spent when there were so many pressing claims to be met, but theCabinet agreed that the proposals in the paper by the Chancellor of theExchequer represented a fair compromise between competinginterests.    The Cabinet accordingly approved the Chancellor of the exchequers proposals which should be announced as soon as possible.
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce his proposals as soon as possible.Cabinet Office23 October 1975
