KLIA ME NT A R YIf a irs10 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.oreignffairslelandreviousleference:1(75) 45thlonclusions,minute 32. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,Me Hatter siey, had returned from Reykjavik without reaching any agreement with the Icelandic Government on fisheries.    Whereas theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee had given him a mandate tosettle for 100^000 tons, the British fishing industry, just before his departure for Reykjavik, had said that they would support theGovernment on an agreement as low as 80,000 tons if necessary,though he was not sure how firm they were on that point.    However,Mr Hattersley had found the Icelandic Government unwilling to makeany advance on their offer of 65, 000 tons except to the very minorextent that they were willing to interpret this as 65, 000 tons of codonly, which might mean a total catch of 70, 000 tons. , allowing for otherspecies offish caught by accident,    Mr Hattersley had reduced our bidfrom 130, 000 tons to 110, 000 tons and had hinted at his willingness tocome down further if the Icelandic side could make a further advance.They had however been unwilling to make any move to bridge the gap,and he had judged it tactically inadvisable to offer any further concession at this stage,    Mr Hattersley&apos;s assessment was that therewas no point in making a new approach to the Icelanders for a fewweeks.    In the short term the Icelandic fishing industry was losingthrough the lack of an agreement, since our industry would be able togo on catching up to 130, 000 tons a year.    Moreover, the icelandic government might well be able to reach a bilateral agreement withthe Federal German Government in the very near future;  at that point it would be their lack of agreement with us which would preventtariff&quot;free access to the Community market for Icelandic fish, underthe provisions of Protocol 6.    These factors might persuade theIcelanders to return to the conference table.    However, lookingfurther ahead, it was likely that the concept of aZOC^mile ExclusiveEconomic Zone would receive further support at the session of theUnited Nations Law of the Sea Conference (UNLOSC) next spring.This might lead to action by additional countries, particularly theUnited States of America, to claim exclusive fishing rights within a200-mile limit, which in turn would strengthen the Icelandic position.He had asked Mr Hattersley to prepare a paper for the Defence and oversea Policy Committee and in it to deal with both oar negotiating position for the next round of talks and the situation we were likely to face after the next session of UNLOSC,    Meanwhile, there was theproblem of protection for our fishing vessels.    Even before mr Hattersley arrived in Iceland on 15 November the Icelandic coast-guard had cut the warps of two of our trawlers;  Mr Hattersley had made a vigorous protest to the Icelandic Foreign Minister,
Mr Agustsson.,    He understood that the three civilian fishery-protection vessels we had chartered were already on their way to the fishing grounds.    It might also be necessary to reconsider the periodof notice at which Royal Navy ships were being held.    The defence and Oversea Policy Committee had identified four levels ofprotection for our trawlers.    &quot;VVe seemed to be proceeding rapidlythrough the first three of these and icnight soon be into the fourth level at which Royal Navy ships would be required to take.action.In discussion it was argued that the reopening of negotiations shouldbe regarded as an urgent matter since otherwise there were bound tobe unpleasant incidents which would inflame opinion and makenegotiations more difficult.    On the other hand it seemed that thepresent mood of the Icelanders was to pocket whatever concessionswe offered and ask for more, in which case an early resumption oftalks with them would be undesirable.    The Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food would be having a meeting with the British fishing industry representatives on 19 November, at which their attitude to asettlement on a catch as low as 80^ 000 tons could be clarified.     as for protection of the fishing fleet the Government had moved moredecisively than the last Administration,    The three civilian fishery protection vessels already chartered were moving into position now and would be ready to start providing protection off Iceland within24 hours.    They were good seagoing vessels and sufficiently stronglyconstructed to deter an Icelandic gunboat by interposing themselvesbetween the gunboat and British trawlers.    But they were slower thanthe gunboats and for this reason a fast tug was also being charteredwhich would have sufficient speed to be able to shadow a gunboat.During the last cod war five civilian protection vessels had provedsufficiently effective for fishing to continue for 12 months before royal navy ships became involved.    On this occasion it was possible thatthe British industry might ask for much earlier Royal Navy inter-vention.    The present availability of frigates was that HMS Leopardwas off North Norway and could be in position off Iceland within three days.    HMS Lowestoft was in transit from Hamburg to Portsmouthand could, if the situation required, go on to Rosyth, so as to becloser to Icelandic waters.    A more immediate measure, whichmight be useful to our trawlers and would also demonstrate theGovernments determination to provide protection, would be for aNimrod reconnaissance aircraft to fly to a position off Iceland at dawnthe following day;  the hours of daylight would suffice for it to surveythe fishing areas between 12 and 50 miles off the Icelandic coast in asingle reconnaissance, although it would not be able to cover the whole200-mile zone.    No infringement of Icelandic air space would be involved, and the aircraft would be able to warn trawlers if Icelandicgunboats were in the vicinity.
In further discussion diseppointment was expressed that the federal german Government seemed to be on the point of concluding anagreement with Iceland without regard to our position: on the otherhand it was pointed out that such an agreement would not in any wayweaken our bargaining strength derived from Protocol 6, since theIcelanders could not get tariff-free access to the Community market for their fish until they had reached agreement with all members ofthe Community concerned.    It was suggested that a. threat of extensionof the United Kingdom fishing limit to 200 miles would bring pressure on the Icelanders since some of their trawlers fished for herring offthe British coasts.    On the other hand it was pointed out that, quite apart from the international difficulties that such a threat wouldinvolve^, the Icelanders seemed ready for reasons of conservation toagree to a total ban on herring catches in the North Sea, in which casetheir fishing off British coasts would in any case come to an end.    Itwas suggested that  a   message to the Prime Minister which was reported to be on its way from the Icelandic Prime Minister might provide an opportunity for a reopening of negotiations: however it seemed that this message would contain little more than a plea forspecial consideration for Iceland^ difficulties and would not advance the negotiations in any way,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatMr Hattersley&apos;s paper should be circulated as soon as possible forconsideration by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee,    the speed with which protection by civilian vessels was being provided was satisfactory.    For the time being there was no need to do more thantake note of the current state of readiness of Royal Navy frigates.However the Cabinet authorised the use of Nimrods for one or morereconnaissance flights off Iceland, subject to consultation between theSecretary of State for Defence and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary on the timing of such flights.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that all who had participated in the Summitat Rambouillet were agreed that it had been more successful than hadbeen expected.    President Ford had been very optimistic about thestrength of the United States economic recovery, but others had been more cautious and he had himself expressed his concern lest theupturn be choked off by renewed inflation or attempts to correctbudgetary deficits too quickly.    The Declaration^ which would bepublished as a White Paper, had reflected British insistence on the
need for responsiveness and flexibility by the stronger economies in promoting the world recovery - and particular attention had been paidto the problem of unemployment.    The progress that had been madein reconciling the French and United States views on parity relation-ships was to be welcomed.    All the participants had been in favour oftrade expansion and opposed to general import controls.    He had however repeated our position on the selective and temporary use of controls in words which he had used in the House of Commons.President Ford had been helpful on this point with his reference to&quot;acute and exceptional&quot; circumstances which might justify action inthe short term to protect an industry which was viable in normalconditions but which might succumb to abnormal outside pressure.The meeting had resisted suggestions for continuing arrangements tofollow up its work: this would instead be done through existinginstitutions and the appropriate international organisations.In discussion there was a general welcome for the fact that theconference had been able to take a forthcoming stance on world tradewhile enabling us to preserve our own necessary options.    Thegeneral attitude seemed to be that the participants were not looking forthe excuse to adopt protectionist measures but reserved the right totake selective action in extreme cases.    The principles of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Tradepledge had been confirmed but no new commitment had been under-taken.    The agreement on monetary matters was perhaps less strikingthan had been portrayed in the Press.    The only real change was thatthe Federal Reserve Bank would smooth out erratic fluctuations in exhange rates, a task which was regarded as a normal duty by othercentral banks.    Nevertheless the abandonment of the French extremeview on fixed parities was a welcome development.    The French were clearly determined to extract the maximum kudos and leverage fromthe Conference on International Economic Co-operation but we had successfully resisted their attempt to place all the problems of the developing countries, including stabilisation of their export earnings and commodity agreements, into the context of the dialogue betweenproducers and consumers.The Cabinet -2, Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Prime Minister.
DIRECT ELECTIONS    3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryTO THE EUROPEAN     of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (C(75) 122) aboutCOMMUNITY the line to be taken at the meeting of the European Council or.1 and 2 December in discussion of proposals for direct elections to the European Assembly.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY&quot; re called that members of the European A&quot;osembly were at present nominatedfrom among members of national Parliaments, but that theTreaty of Rome provided for the Assembly to make proposals for elections by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniformprocedure in all Member States.    The subject had been underconsideration by the original members of the Community for something approaching twenty years, and by December 1974 all butBritain and Denmark had subscribed to the aim of reaching decisions in 1976 which would permit elections by direct universalsuffrage in or after 1978.    The European Council would have before it the report of an ad hoc working party (Annex C of his paper)about the problems which would be involved.    The Council wouldnot reach final decisions on these matters in December, and therewas much to be said for an unhurried approach.    Indeed there might be advantage in inviting the Presidency or M. Tindemansto consider the matter further and make proposals in 1976.Nevertheless it would be helpful to have an indication of the cabinet&apos;s attitude.    The general view in the Community seemedto be that direct elections should as far as possible be conducted in accordance with national procedures and not on a uniform basis.This was to be welcomed.    We ought however to consider our attitude on the size of the Assembly and the distribution of seats andon whether there should be simultaneous or near-simultaneouselections in all member countries.    His own preference was foran Assembly of 350 and a common election day.    He had already made it clear that these issues, and other matters such as theeligibility of Peers and Members of Parliament to stand for theEuropean Assembly, would need in due course to be publiclydebated in the United Kingdom, possibly on the basis of a green paper:  and he had also said that he regarded 1978 as an undulyoptimistic date on practical grounds for the introduction of directelections.The report was concerned with procedures for direct elections and the powers of the Assembly were not under serious discussion at present.    His own view was nevertheless that a directly elected Assembly might well seek enlarged powers in due course.The result might be to increase the influence of the Assembly andof the Council of Ministers at the expense of the Commission;but any decision to increase Assembly powers would be subject tocontrol by the Council and ultimately by national Parliaments.5
THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL expressed his general support for the memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.      Careful consideration would need to be given to the relationship between the WestminsterParliament and the European Assembly;   and inthe course of discussions on direct elections careful account would also have to be taken of developments in the field of devolution in the United Kingdom and the proposed speakers conference on Electoral Reform.    On the size of the european assembly he favoured a figure of about 400 members ratherthan 350 since this would give us better rapresentation.THE HOME SECRETARY also expressed general support forthese proposals.    His preference was for an Assembly of 350and for elections taking place not necessarily on a common day but within a common week.    In this way it might be possible toarrange for the elections to coincide with local elections in theUnited Kingdom, so that one set of elections could buttress the turn-cut for the ether.In discussion it was argued that although the Treaty of Romeimplied a commitment to direct elections the issue had notemerged in the course of the referendum campaign.    Bringing itforward now would be likely to reopen old controversies and therewas in any case no pressure here in favour of direct elections.Our experience of the European Assembly was substantially less thanthat of the   original members.    They had participated for some17 years;  the experience of Labour Party representatives was limited to the last few months.    This was a cogent argument infavour of a slow and carefully considered approach on our part.Furthermore it was questionable whether we should contemplateintroducing direct elections without considering more closely thequestion of powers for the European Assembly.    A directly elected assembly would compete with national Parliaments for powers,and might serve to bolster the influence of the Commission againstthe Council and national Parliaments.    The implications would need to be fully discussed in Parliament in the light of the majorconstitutional issues involved, including the impetus which directelections might give towards a federated Europe.On the other hand it was argued that we were committed to directelections by the Treaty of Rome and our own referendum.    their main effect would merely be to legitimise and make moredemocratic the powers already enjoyed by the Assembly.    Butthey would also help to give greater reality to the improved methods for financial and democratic control in the Community which we and others wanted to see.     Any further extension of the powers ofthe Assembly was a quite separate issue and would be for laterdecision when we would of course have a veto.    There was in anycase no reason why direct elections should of themselves lead to anincrease in the influence of the Assembly: the reverse might well
be the case.    The present situation was most unsatisfactory and we had nothing to fear from taking a step which most people in the Community wanted.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe issue of direct elections raised complex and difficult issues onwhich we should need to proceed slowly and with caution.    TheCabinet accepted however that we were committed to directelections and in any case the present position over nominated members was inherently unsatisfactory.    The proposals of theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would provide a basis forthe line he would take at the next meeting of the European Council,but he would not enter into any commitment at that stage.    In anycase there was r-o question of legislation on direct elections inthe new Session.    Following the European Council meeting theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should consider further the preparation of a Green Paper, its contents and timing; andshould bring the matter before the Cabinet again at theappropriate stage.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.7
fcEAKER&apos;SJONFERENCEInelectoralJawPreviousReference:fC(74) 8 th conclusions,Jlinute 64, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C(75) 121) putting forward proposals for reconvening a speaker&apos;s Conference to consider electoral reform and a number ofother matters.THE HOME SECRETARY said that a number of items had been leftunfinished from the Speaker&apos;s Conference which had been interrupted by the General Election in February 1974, for instance election expenses;  and several additional items for reference to a conference had been suggested subsequently.    In his view there was no questionbut that the Conference should be reconvened in the coming Session toconsider these itemsc    It would then be very difficult not to refer to itthe question of electoral reform, although those most in favour of electoral reform were unenthusiastic about thia course.    Speaker&apos;sConferences had examined this subject in the past - most recently in1966-67 - when interest in it was less, and it would be untenable not torefer the subject to the Conference now.    After discussion with thePrime Minister and the Lord President of the Council he had already informed the other Parties that the possibiHty of such a referencewould be considered.    The present narrow balance between theParties in the House of Commons, and the existence of the minorityParties, could cause problems over&apos; the composition of the Conference.His proposal, which he thought might just gain acceptance, was for15 Labour MPs, 12 Conservatives, one Liberal and one ScottishNational Party Member, together with the Speaker.    The Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland, who was unable to be present, had saidthat it would be difficult to exclude Ulster Unionists; but it wouldequally be impossible to reduce the Conservative representation to 11,and a possible alternative to his proposal would be simply to add anUlster Unionist MP, giving equal numbers of Labour MPs and members from the other Parties,    Because those who wanted electoral reform regarded the Speaker !s Conference as an unsatisfactory body toconsider this subject, he proposed as a sweetener the establishment ofan additional independent body to prepare the ground for considerationby the Conference by making a survey of the various systems of proportional representation.In discussion there was general agreement that the Speaker&apos;conference should be reconvened to consider the matters other thanelectoral reform, but differing views were expressed on thedesirability of referring electoral reform to the Conference,    Infavour of this course it was argued that electoral reform was a majorand serious issue which ought to be looked at.    a Labour Governmentshould not be afraid to initiate informed debate, and discussion of thissubject in the country would receive added stimulus from the devolution Bill and the proposals for direct election to the european parliament.    The subject would be very difficult to handle if it werenot referred to the Speaker&apos;s Conference, whereas a reference to the 8
Conference would be tactically advantageous so as to reduce the pressure.    And the likely outcome was that no change in the presentelectoral arrangements would be recommended.    On the other hand it was argued that proportional representation was totallyunacceptable, and would have damaging consequences both to theLabour Party and to the Government of the country.    TheConservative Party v/cre against proportional representation;  and if no concession of any kind were offered, the pressure for electoral reform, which was narrowly based, would blow itself out.    In thesecircumstances it would be a serious mistake to refer the subject tothe Speaker&apos;s Conference,    The point was also made that if electoral reform was referred to the Conference, further thought should begiven to the proposal for a separate body to prepare a report for theConference on proportional representation.    This report might wellbe highly misleading by presenting some form of proportional representation as the only serious proposition for consideration; andif the Conference felt the need for expert advice, it could perfectly well make its own arrangements for obtaining it.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said the cabinet agreed that the Speaker&apos;s Conference should be reconvened toconsider the matters other than electoral reform.    A majority of theCabinet saw substantial objections to the reference of electoral reformto the Conference, and the Government should therefore not take any initiative in proposing this.    The question of the size and composition of the Conference could give rise to difficulty, and the HomeSecretary, in consultation with the Lord President of the Council andthe Chief Whip, should give further thought to this problem.Proposals for reconvening the Conference to consider the mattersother than electoral reform should then be put to the other Parties.A new situation would be created if a significant demand then arose forelectoral reform also to be referred to the Conference;  and thequestion would have to be brought back to the Cabinet for furtherconsideration.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.9CONFIDENT!.- -
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (C(75) 123), a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to which was attached a note by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, (C(75) 124) and a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (C(75) 125) about the level of rate support grant in1976-77.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe amount of local authority expenditure which was to be accepted as relevant expenditure for grant purposes had already been settled in negotiation.    The distribution of the grant between different kinds of local authority had also been settled.    What was now in question was the level of grant.    A meeting of ministers on 10 November had been unable to reach agreement on what therate should be.    In 1975-76 it was 66f per cent.    The chief secretary, Treasury, had maintained that it should be reduced to64;5 per cent next year; but the rest of the Group had taken the viewthat it should remain at 66f per cent.    The Treasury contended that the grant should assume that local authority expenditure in1976-77 would be no higher in real terms than in the current year;and that the authorities would accept that, in line with Governmentcounter-inflation policy, inflation between November 1975 and mid-1976-77 would run at 7 par cent (equivalent to an annual rate of10-11 per cent).    Both these contentions were unrealistic.    Localauthorities would not be able to reach an absolute standstill intheir expenditure during 1976-77, and were more likely to overspendby about 1 per cent.    This would still be a considerable achievementand would mean that local authorities had reduced the rate of increasein their expenditure over a 3 year period from 10 per cent to5 per cent and then to 1 per cent.    Nor could local authorities beexpected to agree the 7 per cent figure for inflation - 10-12 per centwas a more probable assumption on their part.    On that basis, ifthe rate support grant percentage were reduced to 64 per cent or65 per cent, the domestic rate poundages were likely to increase by15-31 per cent or 18-35 per cent respectively.    A reduction in therate of grant would have unwelcome political consequences.    Itwould be an affront to the Consultative Council on Local government finance who had up to now co-operated most loyally with theGovernment in seeking ways of cutting back local government expenditure.    The local authorities would undoubtedly regard a cutas a betrayal by the Government of the trust that had been built upsince   the Council was established.    If this co-operation were lost,it would react adversely on expenditure control.    Furthermore,the rate increases implied by a 64^ per cent grant would bite justwhen the Governments counter-inflation policy was likely to be under strain.    This could place the incomes policy at risk.    Finally,rate increases would be widely unpopular, and this unpopularitywould be reflected in the local authority elections in May.    Thepercentage of the rate support grant to be borne by the CentralGovernment was essentially a political issue.    The question was^TE support grant
whether, for no gain in public expenditure terms, the Governmentshould risk breaking excellent relations with the local authorities,provoking dangerously high rate increases in spring 1976 andputting themselves in a scapegoat position in the local elections in May 1976.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that although thequestion did not affect the Public Expenditure Survey Committee(PESC) total, the essential issue was how to cut back the expendi-ture of the local authorities.    They had consistently been spendinga gr^at deal more than had been budgeted for.    The Governmentwas tackling this problem in various ways, eg through cash limits.But the main method of control was still through the rate support grant.    At 64^ per cent the rate of central Government support for local authority expenditure in 19 76-77 should give localauthorities sufficient cash to finance the volume of current expenditure already approved by the Government for that year andalso to meet any pay and price increases at an annual rate of around 11 per cent, without any increase in average rate poundages.If a higher percentage were paid, this would give the localauthorities spare money to spend; a rate of 66^ per cent wouldprovide at least  200 million of spare spending money.    Thiswould be regarded as unwarranted extravagance, and taken as an indication that the Government was not really serious when ittalked about reducing local government expenditure.    He agreedthat the issue should be viewed in political terms, but in his view the Government would gain much more politically from a demons tr a-tion that they were determined to place an effective curb on localauthority expenditure.    This was what many of their supportersexpected of them and they would not be seen to be doing it if they agreed that the percentage rate of grant should remain at66^- per cent.He questioned whether the local authorities would in fact makedifferent   assumptions about the annual percentage rate of inflation towards the end of 1976.    But even if local authority fearsabout the success of the counter-inflation policy proved to bejustified, he had given them an assurance that the Government was prepared to review the cash limits on their grants if the pace of inflation generally, or the rate of price increases affecting localauthority expenditure, were to be substantially higher than thoseimplied in the cash limits.    Even if local authorities did spend an extra 1 per cent, as the Secretary of State for the Environmentsuggested they would, it was not for the Government to offer to finance it.    He valued the co-operation of the Consultative Councilon Local Government Finance and could testify from his own experience in discussion with the Council, that they would not regard a reduction in the percentage rate of grant support as abetrayal.    During all the meetings of the Council which he had attended recently, there had been no dispute that th&amp; annual rateof inflation at the end of 1976 was likely to be between 10 and11
11 per cent.    He was sure that the Consultative Council expected the Government to behave in a tough and consistent manner.   Itwas for this reason that he recommended the rate of grant shouldbe 64^ Pcr cent.In discussion it was argued that one of the most important considera-tions of all was that to cut the rate of grant to 64^ per cent would beseen by the local authorities as a breach of faith, particularly in theyear when cash limits were being introduced and had been acceptedby the local authority representatives.    The Consultative council had so far proved to be a great success, and its meetings hadengendered a great fund of goodwill on the part of local authorities for the Governments objectives, and all of this would be put injeopardy if the local authority side felt that they had been betrayed.The local authorities had been pressed to agree to a standstill on expenditure ia 1976-77, and they would naturally expect this to be accompanied by a standstill in the rate of grant.    whatever decision was taken, there would be an appreciable increase in ratedemands next year, and if the grant rate were cut to 64^ per cent the Government would undoubtedly be blamed whether justifiablyor not.    A lower rate of grant could be very damaging politicallyfor the Government, and remembering that the decision would haveto be approved by the House of Commons, it might put many of theGovernments own supporteis in an extremely difficult position.Against this it was argued that the most important factor in thesituation was the need to bring local authority expenditure under control.    Local authorities had consistently spent more than hadbeen planned, and if the rate of grant were fixed at 64-2 per centthis would be a strong incentive upon them to squeeze their expendi-ture.    It should be remembered that, by the time rate poundagescame to be fixed, mosv of the local authority pay increases wouldhave been settled, so that a large part of the uncertainty which local Treasurers might face would be gone.    To fix the rate at66^ per cent meant giving the local authorities  220 million morethan was needed to keep their expenditure next year at tho same level as in 1975-76, and was therefore directly inimical to betterexpenditure control.    On the political plane, it was argued that if,as was indicated by the figures in C(75) 123, the average increasein rate demands next year would be 16 per cent (if the grant were fixed at 66^ per cent and inflation assumed to run at 12 per cent)this would lose just as many votes as a higher increase.    What was at issue was the credibility of the Governments counter-inflationpolicy, and the grant should be fixed at a level which reflected nohigher annual rate of inflation than the 11 per cent implied in that policy.    The local authorities were already unpopular because oftheir high spending, and fixing the grant at 64j per cent would beseen as a welcome act of firmness on the part of the Government.Anything more would suggest that the Government was not serious12is! SFI15 F SSI &quot;I&quot; I ik. 1
about its cash limits policy.    The Treasury had undertaken to reviewthose limits if the rate of inflation turned ozvfc to be seriously different from the rate assumed, and on this basis the 64j per cent proposal should be accepted.In further discussion it was suggested that, given the division of view in Cabinet on the issue before them, there might be merit in adopting a compromise proposal.    The issue was one of psychology ratherthan one of arithmetic, and a figure such as 65-g- per cent might ensurethat the Government was seen to be suitably firm over the expenditureissue without risking an unduly high increase in the average figure forrate demands,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theissue before Cabinet was an important and difficult one, on which thearguments were finely balanced,    It was important to be seen to bekeeping a firm control on public expenditure.    On the other hand thevalue of the work which had been done in setting up the consultative council and through its meetings obtaining such a high level ofco-operation was recognised by everybody, and it would be important not to throw this advantage away.
