LrliamentaryIpfairsTrade Union andLabour Relations(Amendment)bill previous reference;iCC(75) 8thConclusions,Minute 11, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.    It was intended that Parliament should be prorogued on Wednesday 12 Novemberbut this might have to be reviewed in the light of the progress made with current business.The Cabinet then considered the handling of the current differences between the House of Commons and the House of Lords over theprovisions relating to the Press in the Trade Union and labour relations (Amendment) Bill.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that inprinciple three courses were open.    The first was to see whether there was any remaining scope for compromise.    In his view there was not.    He had agreed as a final concession to provide in the Bill for a supervisory body to oversee the operation of the voluntary code of practice;  but this had not sufficed to commendthe Governments proposals to the House of Lords,,    Any further concession would be likely to involve the enforcement of the code of practice by the courts., and this would be unacceptable: itwould involve the abandonment by the Government of a major pointof principle;  it would imperil the unanimous support which theGovernment had, after long discussions, secured from backbenchLabour Party Members in the House of Commons;  and it would much reduce the likelihood of agreement on a voluntary code of practice being reached by the parties concerned.    There was inany event no scope for compromise on Lord HailshamJsamendments providing for compensation to be assessed and enforced by the courts.    The second course would be to accept the amendments by the House of Lords for the sake of enabling the remainingprovisions of the Bill to reach the Statute Book forthwith.    An amending bill on the Press would then be introduced in the next Session.He did not recommend action on these lines, which would strengthen the position of the more extreme members of the National Union of journalists and correspondingly weaken the prospect of agreement being secured on the terms of the Charter.    Moreover, it wouldbe highly undesirable for the Government to accept defeat by the lords on an issue of this importance.    The third course was to invoke the provisions of the Parliament Act.    The result mightbe that the Bill would not become law until late in the next Session,Clearly it would be unwelcome to defer for so long the final repeal of the Industrial Relations Act; but the view of the Trades UnionCongress,   which he shared, was that this course was the leastunwelcome of the three which were open.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there were serious dangers ininvoking the Parliament Act, which had not been used since 1949.The prospects that the Opposition in the Lords would give theGovernment reasonable co-operation in dealing with the legislative programme during the next Session would be reduced, and theposition might be reached where the Parliament Act would haveto be used fairly frequently, with all that this would imply in termsof friction and delay.    There was therefore much to be said forexploring the possibility of some further compromise.    bearing that mind that the Government had given a public assurance that they/ould be prepared to legislate urgently if the freedom of the Pressappeared to be in danger, this might take the form of a provisionempowering the Secretary of State, acting on advice from the supervisory Board, to make an Order rendering the provisionsof the code of practice enforceable in the courts.    It would benecessary to take soundings to see whether such an amendmentwas likely to be acceptable to the Opposition in the Lords: onedifficulty here was that Lord Hailsham and Lord Goodman werenot in agreement about their respective amendments,,In discussion, it was argued that Government supporters in the commons would not understand the abandonment of the Press provisionsadvocated by the Government in deference to opposition in the Lords.Moreover, an amending Bill would no doubt run into the same difficulties as the present Bill;  the Parliament Act would probablyneed to be invoked in the end and thus the Bill might not become law for another two years.    In any event, the prospects of such aBill in the Commons must be uncertain, given that the government might well soon lose their overall majority and that it was doubtfulwhether on this issue they would receive any support from the minority Parties.    Regarding the advisability of using theprovisions of the Parliament Act, it was argued that it would first be desirable to be quite clear that there was no scope for furthercompromise.    Lord Hailsham&apos;s amendments were clearlyunacceptable, but the position was less clear in relation toLord Goodman&apos;s.    His amendment declaring that there was to beno limitation on existing rights under common law seemedacceptable in principle, even if strictly unnecessary.    And theprovision that breaches of the code of practice should be regardedas contrary to public policy seemed harmless, given that it shouldnot result in any widening of the existing causes of action and thatthe Governmenfs own proposals envisaged that, although a breach of the code of practice would not give grounds for legal action, itcould be used evidentially in any court proceedings arising on some other ground.    Lord Goodman&apos;s amendment might tend slightlyto strengthen the case presented by a plaintiff;  but this did not of itself seem to be an insuperable objection to it.    It was, however,argued that some widening of the scope for legal action would2
probably be inevitable.    Lord Goodman&apos;s amendment was mostobscure - this was itself a ground for criticism; but the danger was that,  since much of the code of practice would be couched in very general terms, the field within which something might be done which was arguably contrary to public policy, and consequently a subject for adjudication by the courts, would be very wide.Indeed Lord Goodman1 s avowed intention was to make the codelegally enforceable and therefore to widen the scope forintervention by the courts,,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the House of Commons should be urged that afternoon to agree to a message to the Lords in terms which would effectively restore the Bill to the form in which it had last left the commons.    The amendments which had been moved byLord Hailsham, providing for recovery of compensation throughthe courts, were clearly unacceptable and afforded no scope for compromise.    It would however be desirable, before the message from the Commons was considered by the Lords, to explore urgently the possibility of making further changes in theBill which would go some distance towards meeting the objectives of the amendments moved by Lord Goodman and would be acceptableboth to him and to the Government.    It had been suggested, forexample, that it might be possible to accept his amendment thatall existing common law rights would be preserved, to which there seemed no objection on policy grounds.    It might also be possible -though the difficulties were clearly considerable - to go some way towards meeting Lord Goodman&apos;s proposal that breaches of the code of practice should be declared to be contrary to public policy.In the course of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, it had been stronglyargued that such a provision would widen the present scope for legal proceedings, but it had also been suggested that it might merelyhave the effect of strengthening the basis for legal actions without increasing the scope for such actions to be brought.    These werematters of importance calling for further study.    The LordChancellor, in consultation with the Secretary of State for employment and the Lord Privy Seal, should therefore examineurgently the possibility of including in the Bill provisions acceptable to Lord Goodman which, while making the latter&apos;s point about public policy, would not involve any widening of the causes of action which already existed - ie would not give anyone a right of recourse tothe courts which he did not now have.    For this purpose theMinisters concerned were authorised to enter as necessary intoinformal consultations with Lord Goodman.    If agreement couldnot be reached, or if it proved impossible to secure the deletion ofLord Hailsham1 s amendments, the Cabinet agreed that the provisionsof the Parliament Act should be invoked;  and in that event The Queen&apos;Speech on the Opening of the next Session should include anundertaking to reintroduce the Trade Union and Labour Relations(Amendment) Bill in that Session.3
The Cabinet -10 Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister !s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord Chancellor, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for employment and the Lord Privy Seal, toproceed as indicated in the summing up.The Cabinet were informed that the House of Lords had acceptedamendments, which had been moved by the Bishop of London,making substantial extensions to the concessions which had beenprovided for the churches and charities.    The original concessions,which had been discussed in detail by the Home Affairs Committee,were generous and on merits there seemed no case for goingfurther.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that if the Commons disagreed with these amendments it was unlikely that they would be pressed furtherby the Opposition in the Lords.    They agreed that it would be rightto adhere to the concessions which had originally been included inthe Bill, following discussion by the Home Affairs Committee,except that, in respect of land acquired by a charity after the dateof issue of the White Paper, the period for it to qualify for the prevailing use basis of compensation should be seven years,rather than the ten years originally proposed by the government or   the one year sought by the Bishop of London.The Cabinet -3. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4Ci MFIDENTIAL
-NORTHERN 2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDIRELAND said that the Convention would report on 7 November and wouldbe dissolved at midnight on that date    However, dissolution inNorthern Ireland terminology was equivalent to prorogation at westminster and it was his intention to continue to pay Conventionmembers for another three months during which they would beable to continue talking,    This would provide a further opportunityfor discussion among the members.    At one stage there had seemed to be growing support for the concept of a voluntaryemergency coalition suggested by Mr Craig, but this had been rejected as a result of Mr Paisley&apos;s opposition, and the Convention^report would be signed by the United Ulster Unionist Coalitionmembers only.    The Official Unionist Party was however now splitand it remained to be seen whether support for Mr Craig&apos;proposal would grow.    His intention was to make a low-keystatement to the House of Commons on 10 November, saying only that the Convention^ report had reached him and that he wouldbe engaged in consultations to see whether it was acceptable tothe community as a whole, as by law it must be.    He would avoid any suggestion of a crisis and he would keep the political dialoguein Belfast going.    This initial reaction would not create problems with the Government of the Republic.Although the ceasefire had only been partially effective it hadnevertheless changed the security situation to our advantage.    TheProvisional Irish Republican Army were having trouble incontrolling their members and this was damaging their standing.Their position had been further weakened by the counter-attractionto extremists of the Irish Republican Socialist Party.    The royal ulster Constabulary had been doing very well recently and were increasingly able to operate in the Catholic community areas.Their morale was high and he did not think that they would everrevert to the former attitude and practices.    He was avoiding any interference in their activities so as to emphasise their independent status.    The Irish Government, although they would not want it tobe said in public, were co-operating effectively in security measures.    He had announced that no new prisoners would be given special Category treatment in the Northern Ireland prisons after. March 1976.    It was also his intention, as he had announced, to release the last 140 detainees by Christmas.    The ending of detention was bringing about a radical change in the attitude of the catholic community and he was convinced that the Catholic community would as a result refuse to support renewed violence by the irish republican Army.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.5
FOREIGNAFFAIRS3, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the situation over Belize was disturbing,,    Following increasingsupport in the United Nations for Belizean independence there hadbeen Guatemalan troop movements to the border area and therewas now a serious risk of a Guatemalan invasion without furtherwarning.    He had therefore accepted the Governor^recommendation that the garrison should be reinforced.    We werenot seeking any confrontation with Guatemala but we could not allow Belize to be overrun, especially given the support for Belizeanindependence expressed at the Commonwealth Conference and atthe Conference of Non-Aligned States.    He had been in touch withthe United States Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, but the latter had not been very hopeful that the danger of invasion could beremoved.    It was of course possible that our reinforcements woulddeter the Guatemalans but if not our forces would have to take theminimum action necessary to repel an invasion.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.THE ECONOMICSITUATION4.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of..........................................TOP  SECRET1Copy No.cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 46th Conclusions Minute 4Thursday 6 November 1975 at 10.15 amECONOMIC The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor situation the Exchequer (C(75) 114), a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Energy (C(75) 113),  a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade (C(75) 115) and amemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C(75) 111).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his papersummarised the main features of the latest short-term economicforecast.    In their discussion Ministers should keep in mind thatsuch forecasts were subject to a great deal of uncertainty,particularly in present circumstances: nevertheless the picturewas a disturbing one.    The gross domestic product was expectedto rise slowly from now on, but growth would not become rapiduntil 1977.    There was a considerable lag between changes in output and changes in employment, and as a consequenceunemployment was expected to rise to a peak of some 1.4 million by the end of 1976.    The balance of payments deficit in 1976 was expected       . to be no better than in the current year due partly torising imports as activity began to improve and partly to someadverse movement of the terms of trade;  the invisible surplus wouldalso be reduced by the burden of interest on accrued debt.    In 1977the external position was forecast to deteriorate although it wasespecially difficult to forecast the balance of payments that far ahead.    The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in1975-76 was now thought likely to be some  12,000 million (comparedwith the  9j000 million forecast at the time of the Budget).    In1976-77 it would be far from easy to keep it down even to 12000 million, with the forecast unemployment rate.    &quot;Whilesavings were high and private investment low, there was no greatproblem about financing this level of PSBR, but it would be essentialto reduce it after 1976 as other demands upon resources rose withthe recovery of the economy.    It was not possible to cut the PSBRin 1976-77 without increasing unemployment.   Rather the problem1TOP   SECRET
was to find means of reducing unemployment which would not increase the PSBR and damage overseas confidence,.    To reflatedemand by tax cuts or by increases in transfer payments would place a burden on both the PSBR and the balance of payments andwould also be very slow to have an effect upon unemployment - areflation of  1^000 million by these means would only reduce unemployment by 30-50, 000 in the ensuing twelve monthsc    Itwould be better to look for micro-economic measures which were more effective and quicker-acting.    The package of  75 millionannounced in September would have as much effect on unemploymentin 3-4 months as an increase in demand of  1, 000 million wouldhave in 1Z months.    He had suggested a range of micro-economicsteps in his paper:   selective investment incentives (a 20 million extension was being announced that day);   selectiveimport controls introduced under Article XIX of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), designed to save viablefirms from  collapse       during the recession;  some relaxation ofhire purchase controls;  the identification and removal or reductionof capacity bottlenecks which would otherwise frustrate Britainfrom taking advantage of the upswing in world trade when it came;and the identification of domestic and foreign obstacles to exportexpansion, on which the Secretary of State for Trade would be putting papers forward to the National Economic development council.    These were all areas in which early study and action were desirable.    The question of a conventional demand reflationshould be considered at a later stage, when it could be seen thatthe pay policy was working effectively.    While he was notpersuaded that a general control over imports was either necessary or wise, since it would provoke retaliation and reduce the level of world trade, he would not wish to exclude it as a possibility atsome later date.    However, he was doubtful whether Britishindustry could successfully be regenerated behind a protectivewall; neither side of industry was pressing for it;  and he did not regard it as a practical option at present.Turning to the question of financing the overseas deficit, heshared the view expressed in the paper by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster that as far as possible the deficit should be financed by borrowing in non-sterling.    He calculated that overthe next six months there was a prospective financing gap of some 600 million.    Our creditworthiness had not recovered sufficiently to justify the risks involved in trying to borrow on the commercialmarkets.    He had therefore concluded that it would be right atthis juncture to apply for two unconditional borrowings from theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).    The first of these, for 700Special Drawing Rights (SDR) would represent our first credittranche in the Fund.    The second would be a borrowing from the oil facility set up by the Fund, and would be for 1, 000 SDR.    The2
total sterling value of these two borrowings would be  975 million.Unless we indicated to the IMF in the course of the next week thatwe wished to make this borrowing from the oil facility, it would cease to be available.    The interest rate on the first credit tranchewas 4-6 per cent, and that on the oil facility (which would be for five years) was 7-f per cent, compared with something like9 per cent which would need to be paid on a commercial borrowingif it could be obtained.    The managing director of the IMF,Dr Witteveen, had confirmed that he would support our applicationon the basis of no change being required in our present economic policies.    The borrowing from the oil facility would be subject toan undertaking not to interfere with monetary and other transactionswithout prior consultation with the Fund, and in this connection hehad warned Dr Wittevaen that we might wish to impose someselective import controls.    The latter had said that, if so, therewas much to be said for taking this action before the drawing was approved.    But failing this he had agreed with Dr &quot;Witteveen thatwe would need to give the Fund two or three days1 notice beforethe announcement of any selective import controls.    He had not discussed with him the possibility of general import controls whichthere was in any case no intention of introducing at present.    Butprovided a delay of three to four months were allowed between the drawing from the Fund and an announcement of general import controls, the additional problem created by the terms of the IMFdrawing would be miniscule compared with the other difficultieswhich such action would generate.    He intended, if Cabinet approvedthis proposal, to announce the following day the intention to make a formal application to the Fund.    It would not foreclose any optionsfor the future and it made sense, and could strengthen confidence,to take this money while it was available,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he had tried to make it clear to the public and to Britain&apos;s trading partners thatwhile the Government favoured a high level of international tradethey were not prepared to allow major British industries to bewiped out by import penetration.    He had kept open the possibleoption of using selective import controls to this end.    The paper which he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had circulated set outthe case for selective import controls and the difficulties entailed.It was true that we had the right to apply such controls underArticle XIX of GATT, but one of the provisions of that Article wasthat those who suffered thereby could claim compensation, and itwould be necessary to weigh the balance of advantage in individual cases; work on this should now go ahead.    He did not minimise the importance of using anti-dumping powers to the full, butdumping was not the main problem.    The main problem was thestrength and efficiency of Britain&apos;s competitors.    He agreed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequers general approach but if there3
was to be any question of applying general import controls, adecision would be needed well before May 1976 when the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) trade pledgewas due for renewal,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Cabinetfaced a major turning point in the Governments economic strategy.The situation was graver than even the Chancellor!s papersuggested, and in his view the policies proposed were bound to fail3What was more the present pay policy had been sold to the trades union as the only alternative to increased unemployment andmassive public expenditure cuts, and also on the basis that therewould be stable prices.    Now unemployment was rising, it was proposed to cut public expenditure heavily, and the present policy on prices would allow  1, 000 million to go into the company sector.If this continued, the pay policy would also fail.    There was nonational consensus for the present economic strategy, which wasdeflationary.    The industrial strategy which had been presented thepreceding day to the National Economic Development Council wasno more than a generalised discussion plan.    The need forrecovery in industry was to be used as an excuse for public expenditure cuts, but it was far from clear that cutting expenditure and putting such people as nurses out of work would add to thecountry&apos;s productive capacity.    It would be wrong to ignore thefact that the Trades Union Congress (TUC) was deeply uneasy aboutthe present situation.    He had put forward two options in his paper,the first of these - to devalue, hold wages and boost profits - wouldbreach the conditions on which the pay policy was based and gaveno guarantee of achieving the higher investment which was needed.The second - to rebuild the country&apos;s industries behind a wall ofprotection - was a policy he had urged for the last 18 months.    he believed that senile industries, like infant industries, needed a wallbehind which the necessary restructuring could take place.    TheGovernment needed a target rate for reducing unemployment, and while he accepted that there should be no general reflation at thepresent time, it was desirable to undertake more effective micro-economic measures, at the same time controlling overseas investment and protecting the social services.    There would beagreement in the country to a national recovery plan on those lines.He was glad to note that the possibility of general import controlswas not ruled out.    In his view the Government needed an evencloser link than it had now with the trades union movement in policyformulation.In discussion it was argued that, even allowing for uncertainties inthe unemployment forecast there could still be one millionunemployed by the end of 1977, and this would be intolerable.Neither the Government, nor the Governments agreement with the4
trades unions, would survive such a situation. In the immediatefuture, the most vulnerable point would come around May or June1976, when the gap between the movement of prices and themovement of pay would be at its greatest, while unemployment would still be increasing,,    It was therefore crucial to decide what could be done during the next few months.    The Chancellor of the exchequers micro-economic proposals should certainly be explored, but there was need for other micro-economic measuresof a more ambitious character.,    Fresh training proposals, a lowerlimit for temporary employment subsidy, an enlarged work creationprogramme, and more expenditure on community industry alldeserved further consideration.    The possibility of selectiveimport controls should be considered swiftly so that some could bebrought into operation at an early date.    What was needed was apackage of minor measures aimed at curbing the increase in umemployment.    Among these might be some addition to the 30 million recently announced to provide employment in theconstruction industries, and such an addition might be concentrated on housing construction in those areas where male unemployment was at its highest.On demand reflation, it was argued that it was neither necessarynor desirable to do nothing until next spring.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had confirmed that there were no conditions attaching to the proposed IMF loan which would prevent the Government fromreflating when it saw fit.    Although reflation would not reduce unemployment until after a lag of some months, it would change the Governments relations with the trades union movement in away which would enable the Government to survive politically andto implement the plan for the regeneration of British industry.Work should begin at once to study a reflationary package designedto bring the maximum advantage to Government policies,,    In thisconnection support was expressed for the idea of a gradual reflation,starting fairly soon, but linked to incomes policy by a rolling dealwith the trades unions.    Thus as the  6 a week limit was seen tobe sticking there could be some reflation to ease unemployment andas progress was made on the re-entry problem there could befurther reflationary measures.    This would however need very careful presentation and there should be no public canvassing ofwhat might be deemed to be a permanent incomes policy.In the course of further discussion the following main points weremade -a. Of the additional  31)00 million added to the forecastPSBR for 1975-76, 15 per cent was directly attributable tothe recession in terms of extra unemployment benefit and loss of tax revenue, but this would rise to 40 per cent if other5
items, such as the assistance to British Ley-land and the financing of Coal Board stocks, which could also be attributed to the recession, were added in.    It was notedthat not all action to reduce unemployment would simultaneouslyreduce the PSBR.b.      While work should be done on selective import controls,what was really needed was improved economic performance.British industry was being beaten by its competitors.    Thus,productivity in British shipbuilding had improved by 1 per centsince 1968, whereas in foreign shipyards it had improved by30 per cent.    It had to be recognised that Planning agreements were so far no more than a slogan;  and it would be of greatimportance to ensure that the National Enterprise Board wasnot allowed to become a repository of lame ducks.    the underlying need was to build up an efficient base for Britishindustry through appropriate micro-economic policies,c.      In considering or applying selective import controlsaccount should be taken of the position of developing countries.It would also be important not to slide gradually into the napplication of general import controls.    This would be avery major decision raising quite different issues.d. The relaxation of hire purchase controls was worthconsideration, but such a relaxation at the present timemight have the wrong psychological effect, leading the public to think that there was less need fcr the restraint implied bythe present pay policy.e. The Buy British campaign, which had been mootedat an earlier stage, should be pushed ahead vigorously aspart of the campaign to protect British industry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should thefollowing day announce his intention to apply for two bur rowingstotalling  975 million from the IMF.    This was on the under standingthat it required no change in our existing policies and foreclosed nooptions which we might wish to take in the future.     There was alsowide approval for the general approach embodied in the Chancellorof the Exchequers paper on the economic situation and it was agreedthat this approach should govern the Governments attitude untilearly in the New Year when the Cabinet would again consider the issues of reflation and the balance of payments.    There was alsoagreement that the micro-economic measures suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer, relating to the relaxation of hire purchasecontrolo, the identification and elimination of capacity bottlenecks andthe reduction or elimination of export constraints should all be pursued;6

but other proposals for micro-economic measures which had beenput forward during the discussion should also be urgently studied.The doubts which had been expressed about the wisdom of a relaxation in hire purchase controls should be considered carefully.On selective import controls there was general agreement that these should be studied further as a matter of urgency and proposalsbrought forward on a case by case basis.The Cabinet -1.      Endorsed the general approach in the Chancellorof the Exchequers paper (C(75) 114), and agreed thatthey would again consider the issues of reflation and thebalance of payments early in 1976.2.
