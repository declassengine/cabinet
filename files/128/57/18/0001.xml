if his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government copy NO   41CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 48th ConclusionsThursday 13 November 1975PUBLIC The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of theEXPENDITURE        Exchequer (C(75) 117), a memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Environment (C(75) 120) and a note by the Chairman of thePrevious Steering Committee on Economic Strategy (C(75) 118) dealing withReference: public expenditure in the period up to 1979-80,CC(75) 3 9thConclusions THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet hadthe previous week discussed the short-term economic situation, andhad agreed on the approach to be adopted to the problems itpresented.    The questions now to be considered related to the period from early 1977 on, when output was likely to be rising rapidly, andthere was almost certain to be a shortage of resources and of fivance.The fundamental question was how much of the available resources should be earmarked for investment and the balance of payments;  and how should the rest be allocated.    In order to get the country out ofits present economic difficulties it would be essential to make room for more productive investment and for increased exports (or importsubstitution).    What he was proposing was to make room for anincrease of 10 per cent a year in investment from the present very lowbase.    If this was, not achieved, the country might lose forever the chance of recovering its position.    Such an increase was by no meansunrealistic, similar and indeed higher rates of increase having been achieved in the past.    He pointed out that the level of investmentcalled for in the Labour Party document &quot;Labour and Industry:  TheNext Steps&quot; would be 15 per cent higher than that which he wasenvisaging, and      . would require a cut of  1, 000 million in public expenditure over and above that which he was proposing.    On thebalance of payments,, he was clear that the country must aim atgetting into balance on external account by 1978,    Even if this were achieved, the accumulated external debt in the period up to 1978 wouldbe of the order of  15, 000 million, and if this went any higher thecost of servicing it could take up the whole of the external income from North Sea oil.    More immediately, unless we were seen to be
moving towards the possibility of external balance, it might well prove impossible in the interim to borrow overseas in order to finance the current account deficit, and the Government would then be forcedto borrow from international institutions on conditions which would almost certainly include public expenditure cuts even more severethan those now contemplated.    He was aware of the view held by somethat neither the productive investment nor the balance of paymentstarget might be met; but he did not see that this justified planninghigher public expenditure which would automatically pre-emptresources and make those targets quite impossible of achievement.If they were not achieved the Government would need to considermore extreme measures and still make public expenditure reductions on the scale he had put forward.On the financial prospects, he observed that at present the public sector was borrowing 20p for every  1 which it spent.    Of that 20p,2fp was borrowed abroad and 17-lp at home.    The growing burden ofinterest payments on this debt placed added strain on both real andfinancial resources.    At present it was possible to borrow at homebecause private savings were high and productive investment low.Once the recession was easing^ people would be likely to save less andthe company sector would have the incentive to transfer financial resources into the productive investment which was essential torecovery.    If the Government attempted to continue with a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) at the present level it would either have to print money, as the previous Administration had done,with disastrous consequences for inflation^ or it would have to raiseinterest rates, which would choke off the essential industrial investment and would seriously damage the housing programmebecause the local authorities would not be able to afford to borrow.The Government could not continue with a borrowing requirement of anything remotely approaching the present level of  12,000 million -even allowing for the fact that some  3, 000 million of this was directly attributable to the recession and would disappear as the economy recovered.On taxation, he said that there was no escape from some taxincreases in the years ahead, even if public expenditure were cut bythe  3, 750 million in 1978-79 which he proposed,    Suggestions hadbeen made that indirect taxes and corporate taxes should be raisedrather than expenditure cut; but if indirect taxes were raised beyondthe rate of inflation (and he would in any case have to raise them tothat extent) the effect was to put up the cost of living and make tradesunion support of the Government!s incomes policy much harder toretain.    Higher corporate taxation would result in a reduction in theessential investment which the Government wished to see, or lead tocash flow difficulties, or result in increases in prices.    It followed that the only real scope for tax increases lay in the field of income
tax.    Even the &quot;formula cuts&quot; of just under  2, 000 million in 1978-79would still require - depending upon the level of private and corporatesaving - an increase of 5-9p in the standard rate of income tax.    with national insurance contributions, this would mean that once a wageearner had crossed the tax threshold he would be facing a marginal taxrate of 45-50 per cent.    In his view the Government could neither win the next Election nor hold their pay policy on that basis^ the high rates of tax meant that the trades unions would wish to startbargaining on post-tax increases in pay.    There was also theadditional problem of relieving low earners from income tax.increasing numbers of low income recipients were being drawn into the tax net, and a family on two-thirds average earnings, which 15 yearsago paid tax at 4p in the pound, was now paying tax at 20p in the pound.Had he raised the tax threshold to the extent he considered desirablethis year, he would have had to increase the standard rate by 4pinstead of 2p.      In his view the high income tax rates were generatinghostility to public expenditure among the Labour Party&apos;s own supporters.    If the forecasts proved wrong, and thexe was   slack inthe economy in the period under review, the most sensible use to bemade of that room for manoeuvre would be to raise the tax threshold,rather than to increase public expenditure.    He pointed out that public expenditure over the last three years had risen by over 18 percent in real terms, whereas the gross domestic product (GDP) had probably risen by only lj per cent.    There had been an enormousshift of employment into the public sector, expenditure on which nowrepresented 60 per cent of the GDP compared with 45 per cent in1965.    Public expenditure was still not being held down to the plannedrate, and in 1975-76 would probably be some 4 per cent more than theprevious year, against the planned increase of l\ per cent.    1976-77would only be marginally down on the current year, which meant itwould be 3 per cent more than was forecast in the last public expenditure White Paper.    He considered it essential to take as the target for the cuts the upper end of his range, ie  3, 750 million at1975 prices.    Even this was based upon assumptions about the growth of productivity which might well prove optimistic.    What was quite clear was that if cuts on this scale were not made, there was a very grave risk of economic disaster.    He did not believe such cuts wouldbe unpopular with the country, certainly compared with fjhealternative of substantial increases in income tax.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he fully accepted the economic objectives propounded by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    His disagreement related to the size and the timing of the proposed cuts.    He found the economic scenario presen-ted by the Treasury to be highly improbable.    He did not believe thatit was likely that we would achieve external balance by 1978, and he doubted whether it was, in any case, a sensible aim.    On investmenthe accepted that there had been high rates of increase in the past, but
reminded the Cabinet that these had been achieved on the back of aboom, and not against the background of a depressed and deflatedeconomy.    In his view there would be no pressure on resources in1978, and to make public expenditure cuts of the size proposed bythe Chancellor would be to dig a hole which would remain unfilled.Nevertheless, he accepted that there was a financing problem, thatthe PSBR needed to be reduced - and that some cuts in public expendi-ture were therefore inevitable - although he- saw a danger that if therewere still slack in the economy in 1978, the public expenditure cutsmight have the perverse effect of leading to some increase in the borrowing requirement.    He agreed that income tax was now bitingdangerously hard but considered there was scope for substantial increases in indirect taxes.    In his opinion a cut of  3, 750 million was too high, and he proposed instead a cut of  2, 500 million of which 500 million would be &quot;on the shelf&quot; in the sense that it would consistof planned cuts to be kept on one side until such time as the economic prospects clearly made them necessary.    The  2, 000 million wouldbe achieved by making all of the &quot;formula cuts&quot; proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the further  500 million being selected from other options.    He regarded the formula cuts as politicallytolerable, and pointed out that reductions of this order would leavepublic expenditure broadly constant at the 1975-76 level, without anyabsolute cut in the total.    This would be a much better propositionto put to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) than the Chancellorsproposal which would lead to an absolute reduction by 1978-79.If - which he did not believe - more reductions were considered necessary, these should be considered against the alternative of increases in indirect taxation, which would in his view be no moredifficult to negotiate with the TUC than many of the proposed expendi-ture cuts.    He noted that a number of indirect taxes in this country,notably national insurance contributions, were markedly lower thanin other countries of the European Economic Community.    His mainconcern was that the Government should not incur the odium of makingcuts on a scale which might never be necessary.    Because of the uncertainty about the future, the Cabinet should review the situationagain in six months1 time, and although they might be little betterplaced then than now to judge the likely position in 1978-79, this wasno argument against regular reviews of the developing position everysix months.In discussion it was argued that the strategy which had been putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a recipe for economicdisaster for the country and political disaster for the Government.It was based upon a number of false assumptions, which needed to be examined.    It assumed that a recovery in world trade was coming,which would pull the British economy up with it; but there was no evidence that such a recovery would in fact take place in time to help us.    Even if there were such a world recovery, it was assumed thatwe would benefit from it; but this was by no means certain, sincesuch efficient economies as the German and Japanese might well steal
a march, on British industry by taking most of the benefit themselves.Again, it was assumed that a recovery of output would lead to areduction in unemployment;  but this too was far from sure, and we might find that output increased while unemployment remainedunacceptable/ high.    Again, the Chancellor of the Exchequer assumed that private investment would rise; but there could be no certainty that this would be achieved.    It was assumed that external balance would be achieved by 1978 by traditional methods;  but if there werein fact an upturn in economic activity this was more likely to lead toa larger balance of payments deficit, in which case the Governmentwould be driven to the use of general import controls.    the assumptions rested heavily upon the reliability of the forecasts;  butthe truth was that any forecast could be shown to be plausible in thepresent fluid situation, and the only moral to draw was that allforecasts were unreliable.    It was also assumed that manpowerreleased from the public sector as a result of expenditure cuts wouldbe taken up by private industry;  but this was improbable, since the root trouble was that the private sector had not invested sufficiently.The strategy was a strategy for high unemployment.    While workers were undoubtedly concerned about the effect of taxation upon theirtake-home pay, it had to be recognised that the biggest cut in take-home pay came with unemployment, the hardship of which, once thebenefit of redudancy payments was expended, was very real.    Therewas a danger that the Government was on the edge of a classicbetrayal of the Labour movement, whereby the poor would be madepoorer and the Government would accept that public expenditure was of itself an evil.    The world was experiencing an internationaldeficiency of demand of a depth and persistence unknown since the1930s.     Because of the level of inflation the Government had been driven to agree a policy for pay with the trades union movement.That pay policy - not just for the current year but for the next threeyears - would be a central part of the Governments approach, andthe relationship with the trades union movement was a vital part of it.The Government must be able to face the next election with the trades union supporting their policies.    For working people the benefitsreceived from social service expenditure were just as important as their cash wage.   It had been argued that expenditure cuts were necessary to avoid direct tax increases; but this ignored the effect the cuts could have on the standard of private life.    Thus, a familywith two children, a take-home wage of  50 a week, living in a councilhouse, could, under the Chancellors proposals, be  4, 80 a weekworse off from additional rent on their house, the failure to upratechild support payments, and the phasing out of food subsidies.Cabinet needed to have put before them a more comprehensive pictureshowing the inter-relationship of fiscal, social and economic policies,so that proper choices could be made between expenditure and taxation.If cuts in planned expenditure were to be made they should not exceed the  2, 000 million proposed by the Secretary of State for the environment, but even this would have to be negotiated with the tradesunion movement.
The need to discuss these questions with the TUC and theParliamentary Labour Party was vital, and Cabinet should take no decisions until such discussion had taken place.    In these discussions a cut of  2, 000 million would be less provocative thanone of  3, 750 million, though it would be possible in the course ofsuch talks for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put the case for thehigher figure.    The Government faced a difficult presentationalproblem, since the public would not readily understand their makingreal cuts in public expenditure at a time when unemployment was so high.    There could be no certainty about when the world recessionwould ease or how rapidly the effects of recovery would be felt in theUnited Kingdom.    For this reason, any decisions which might betaken on public expenditure should be tentative.Against this it was strongly argued that the most urgent problem wasnot whether the cuts would make too large a hole in 1978-79, but whether the country would be able to get through to 1978-79 without a financial collapse.    The risks were not equally balanced:  theconsequences of failing to achieve the targets put forward by theChancellor of the Exchequer could be catastrophic;  the consequences of setting too high a target could be controlled.   Only by aee^pting theChancellor&apos;s proposals could the Government attain the room for manoeuvre in their economic policies which was lacking at thepresent time.     The need was to achieve a firmer base for the economy, and for this the country&apos;s international credit must bemaintained, which meant in turn that external balance by 1978 shouldbe seen to be a conscious aim.    The major problem facing theGovernment was still inflation, which had not yet been overcome.To get inflation down to an annual rate of 10 per cent by the end of1976 was necessary, but could not be represented as a triumph, andsuch a rate would be an urxs.cs*?ptably high base from which to re2S&amp;i&amp;.Scepticism about the validity of forecasts did not mean that theGovernment did not have to take responsibility for trying to plan theway out of the present inflationary situation, reviewing the positionperiodically in the light of the extent to which reality diverged fromforecast.    It was true that, even if recovery were well under way by1978, there could be a continuing unemployment problem;  but itwoulc1 not be solved unless inflation were first mastered.    public expenditure was now running at more than 60 per cent of GDP:  unlessexpenditure were curbed and our low rates of increase of GDPimproved, the figure would soon by 70 per cent.    It was essentialto release more resources for industrial investment if we were tohave any hope of improving our GDP at a satisfactory rate.Discussion with the trades union movement was clearly wise, but theGovernment must go into such discussion with clear agreement on thequantum of the total cut.    If the Government were put out of officethrough failure to deal effectively with the economic crisis, their successors would impose cuts which would take no account ofLabourS social priorities.
In further discussion the following points were made -a. The Governments existing public commitment on future expenditure would need to be borne in mind.    On21 July, in the debate on the counter-inflation White Paper,the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said - and his words hadbeen previously agreed by Ms Cabinet colleagues - that:&quot;It is clear that in carrying the reassessment of spending programmes forward beyond 1976-77, therewill at best be very little room for overall growthbeyond the reduced level for that year&quot;.b. No final conclusions on the total cuts should be reached and flexibility might be maintained by identifying three possible levels of reduction:  one would be a level of cutsbelow  3, 750 million which ought certainly to be achieved.The next would be the  3, 750 million;  and the last would be some higher figure.    The means of achieving any of these levels should be identified and held ready for use asdevelopments in the economy might indicate.    This was afurther development of the Idea of a &quot;shelf1 of possible cuts.c. Such a tehelfmight be operated in reverse.    Under thisarrangement the Government would make the maximum cuts itconsidered necessary, but should be prepared with steps whichcould be taken if there proved to be greater slack in the economy than forecast - steps which might consist of taxationreductions or expenditure increases, for example in transfer payments.d. While consultation with the TUC was essential, the strategic economic decisions were the responsibility of theCabinet.    The Cabinet should first agree on the total quantumof cuts they considered necessary given the economic prospect,and it would be important not to allow the TUC to argue theGovernment down from that figure.    Discussion with the TUCshould centre on the composition of the cuts needed to achieve the required total.e. The traditional Labour Party view that higher public expenditure was desirable had been a valid attitude when public expenditure represented some 40 per cent of GDP; but it was questionable whether it should not be revised now that public expenditure represented some 60 per cent of GDP, and theequally traditional counter-arguments about the effect uponincentives of high rates of taxation began to bite.
f. The importance of explaining the case for expenditure cuts to the Parliamentary Labour Party should not be under-estimated.    It would need to be put in a way which would makequite clear the appalling consequences which v/ould flow froma failure to set the economy right.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, replying to the discussion,said that if the cuts in public expenditure lie proposed were made, andin the event demand proved to be too great., the situation could easily be remedied either by tax reliefs - raising the direct tax threshold,or reducing Value Added Tax and thus cutting the Retail Price Index -or by modifying transfer payments.    Generally speaking the use ofpublic expenditure cuts to deal with demand problems was a mostinefficient way of proceeding.    Given this existing degree of flexibility, he saw no grounds for the proposals which had been madefor going for an initial low level of expenditure cut and- identifyingfurther cuts to be introduced if the situation warranted.    He reminded the Cabinet that the Government were committed to publication of apublic expenditure &quot;White Paper,    In the last two years it had been published late, and, even if decisions were taken that days this year&apos;sversion would already be two months late.    It was imperative that itbe published, since if it were not the Governments internationalcredit might be destroyed - indeed, it might be necessary for thisreason to publish total expenditure figures by the end of the year and before the detailed White Paper was issued,    On the question of keeping the level of public expenditure flat, or making an absolutereduction, he reminded the Cabinet that they were concerned not only with the total of Departmental programmes but also with the contin-gency reserve, the shortfall and the figures for debt interest.    Ifthese were taken into account - as thev must be - and the cuts were confined to the formula reductions totalling some  2,000 million, thenpublic expenditure would increase by 2,8 per cent in 1976&quot;77(compared with the 1 per cent forecast), by 2 per cent in 1977-78, andby 1 per cent in 1978-79 - all on the fundamentally optimisticassumptions of the economic forecast.    Jf a cut of  3,000 million were made there would be increases of 2.4 per cent in 1976-77 and1, 2 per cent in 1977-78, with a fall of only 0. 5 per cent in 1978-79.Even his proposed cut of  3, 750 million would lead to increases of2. 3 per cent in 1976-77, and 0.4 per cent in 1977-78, with a fall of only 0. 9 per cent in 1978-79-    In considering these figures theCabinet should remember that they related to a base in 1975-76 whichwas itself 4 per cent higher than 1974-75.    Even if the full 3, 750 million of cuts were made, the figures would not be easy tosell to overseas opinion, which was concerned not with individual programmes but with the total burden on the economy.    Suchoverseas opinion could not be ignored, since if later credit tranchesfrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had to be called for,public expenditure cuts were certain to be imposed as a condition of
such assistance,,    He fully accepted that public expenditure would haveto be discussed with the TUC, but he was equally clear that it shouldbe on the basis of the Governments own view of the quantum -recognising that that figure would almost certainly leak.    Once thedecision on quantum had been taken, it would be possible to spendperhaps a month discussing priorities within that quantum with the tuc, but agreement would be needed by Christmas or soon after,,9SE -RE r
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that by asmall majority the Cabinet agreed that a reduction in public expenditure of  3, 750 million in 1978-79 should be made, as proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The next step would be for theChief Secretary, Treasury, to conduct bilateral discussions on this basis with spending Ministers to consider what contribution would be needed from their programmes to make up the required total.    Heshould report back to the Cabinet in two to three weeks1 time: and theCabinet would then resume their discussion with a view to takingfinal decisions as quickly as possible.    At the next stage theywould be concentrating on priorities between programmes rather thanon the total cut, although it was possible that there might then haveto be some small adjustment in the latter.    In the meantime it wouldbe helpful if Ministers who had views on expenditure priorities, notmerely in relation to their own Departmental spending but on therelative priorities of other programmes, would send their views inwriting to the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    Further considerationcould be given to the idea of a reserve or shelf which could beactivated if the forecast proved to be wrong, but in general the effectof public expenditure changes was not sufficiently quick-acting for control of demand, save in the field of transfer payments.     In anycase it might be better for such a shelf to consist of cuts which couldbe restored rather than further cuts to be made.    There should bediscussions with the TUC to ascertain their views on prioritiesbetween programmes, though not on the size of the total cut.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, todiscuss bilaterally with spending Ministers thecontributions which would be needed from their programmes to make up the total cut of 3, 750 million in 1978-79 which Cabinet had agreedto be necessary; and to report back to the Cabinetwithin two to three weeks.-3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,after consultation with the Prime Minister, toarrange for consultations with the Trades UnionCongress to ascertain their views on how the totalcut of  3, 750 million might be distributed between different programmes.Cabinet Office14 November 1975
