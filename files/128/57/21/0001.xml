?ARLXft.M&apos;ENTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thePFAIRS House of Commons during the following week0PRIVATEkkCTICE INthe national[health$SERVICEPreviousReference;CC(75 ) 44th[Conclusions.,Minute 220 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council about the separation of private practicefrom National Health Service (NHS) hospitals (C(75) 132),THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that at a meetingon 20 November the Social Services Committee had considered and agreed proposals by the Secretary of State for Social Services for legislation on the separation of private practice from NHS hospitals.The Secretary of State was caught between two fires:  on the onehand there were the doctors3 who were in a highly militant mood,and on the other there were the NHS trade unions, amongst whose members feeling against pay beds was running high.    It wastherefore proposed that a short Bill should be introduced and enactedas soon as possible.    Its main objectives would be to establish beyond doubt the power of the Secretary of State to phase out pay beds fromNHS hospitals;  to fix a timetable for phasing out; to reaffirm theright of an NHS consultant to engage in private practice outside the nhs;  and, as a holding measure, to confer a simple control power under which anyone who wished to provide a private hospital of morethan 75 beds would have to obtain a licence from the Secretary ofState.    This latter provision would serve to protect the NHS untildiscussions were complete on the much more thorough and flexiblecontrols outlined in the consultative document which had recentlybeen issued.    The Bill was at present in the priority reservecategory and The Queen&apos;s Speech had merely said that it would beintroduced in the course of the Session,    The position had howeverchanged since the Cabinet had last discussed the matter and urgentaction now seemed necessary.    The provision most likely to causedifficulty was the proposed control power.    On the control of theprivate sector The Queen&apos;s Speech had merely said that consultationswould continue, and early legislation on the matter might thereforelead to charges of bad faith.    The Secretary of State for social services proposed, however, to offer full consultations with themedical profession before legislation was either announced orintroduced.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the nhs consultants had now decided, as from the following Monday, to treat only emergency cases until the whole matter of pay beds and private practice was referred to the Royal Commission on the NHS.There was an immediate danger that the NHS trade unions, whoseleaders were having difficulty in restraining their rank and file, mightimmediately &quot;black&quot; all pay beds.    More hopeful features were that
some of the doctors&apos; leaders had indicated publicly that the profession might regard a new situation as having been createdonce Parliament had legislated on pay beds;  and that the opposition in the House of Commons were taking a responsible line.    If thesituation was to be kept under control, it was in her view necessaryto legislate at once on the lines described in the Lord presidents memorandum.    Legislation providing for the early phasing out of pay beds was likely to lead to a rush of proposals for developments in the private sector - her Department already knew of 37 such proposals, involving some 2, 500 beds;  and some of these - forinstance a plan for a 500-bed private hospital in Bristol - could be extremely damaging to the NHS.    At present, factors connectedwith the planning of health services were not amongst those whichit was statutorily permissible to take into account in consideringapplications for planning permission.    There was not time to implement the detailed and sophisticated controls which the consultative document proposed should in the longer term apply tothe private sector and on which thorough consultations were essential.    She therefore proposed, entirely as a holding operation,that a simple licensing procedure should be applied to developments of more than 75 beds;  and it was to be hoped that the british medical Association (BMA) would take up the offer she intendedto make of consultations before the legislation was announced orintroduced.In discussion, agreement was expressed with the Social ServicesSecretary&apos;s analysis of the situation and with the broad objectivesshe had in mind.    There was in particular acceptance of the need to ensure that developments in the private sector did not harm the nhs during the period before long-term arrangements could bemade for regulating the private sector following completion of thediscussions of the proposals in the consultative document,    It was however argued that the control power now proposed, even if only temporary, was extremely far reaching and would be regarded bythe doctors as evincing an intention to eliminate the private sectoraltogether - all the more so because it would take some years toreplace the 4, 000 pay beds which it was intended to phase out ofthe NHS within a quite short period.    It would therefore be preferable to explore the possibility of achieving an agreed solutionwith the medical profession without threatening them with immediate legislation to control the private sector.    Similarly it would be wise to consult the profession about the timetable for phasing outpay beds, rather than to present them with cut-and-dried legislative proposals.    The situation was one where rational discussion in acalm atmosphere might be productive;  moreover, it could not be overlooked that there was scope for flexibility which might help in securing agreement - for example, if satisfactory arrangements could be made for regulating the private sector, it might be possible2
to agree for certain NHS facilities to be made available on payment for private use when not needed by NHS patients.    A settlementcommanding the widest possible amount of agreement was particularly desirable because of the danger that in its absence a future Conservative Government would relax whatever long-termcontrols might be applied to the private sector and thus allow it to expand to an extent which would do irreparable harm to the NHS.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that ithad not proved necessary at this stage for the Cabinet to reachfinal decisions on the detailed proposals contained in the lord presidents memorandum.    They had however agreed that theremust be thorough consultations with the medical profession before there could be any question of introducing legislation containingprovisions for phasing out pay beds or controlling the private sector.    These consultations should take place on the basis thatthe Government were firmly committed both to the phasing out of pay beds and to preserving a healthy private sector; that the relationship between the private sector and the NHS was a matter which the Royal Commission was free to examine and report on;that the Government would continue with detailed and thoroughconsultations on the long term arrangements needed for regulating the private sector and ensuring that it did not cause unacceptabledamage to the NHS.    The Cabinet agreed that the outcome of these consultations or of the Royal commission s deliberations could notbe pre-empted by decisions on applications for planning permission for new private hospitals, in the consideration of which factorsrelating to the planning of health services could not at present enter.The Secretary of State must therefore be in a position if necessaryto say that short term statutory powers of control would have to betaken.    Given a favourable atmosphere for these discussions and given reasonable flexibility on both sides, it might be possible to achieve a satisfactory outcome.    The discussions would be handledwith the help of a small Ministerial group which he himself wouldchair;   and it was essential that strict confidentiality should be preserved as to the Governments negotiating position.    the outcome would be reported to the Cabinet, and no legislation wouldbe introduced without further discussion by the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.

selectiveImportcontrolsColourI TelevisionI Tubes4., The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Industry (C(75) 133) and a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Trade (C(75) 135) about the possible imposition of controls upon imports of colour television tubes,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the questionof applying selective import controls to certain products was discussed at the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on21 November when the balance of opinion was against imposingcontrols on imports of colour television tubes pending clarification of the future of the Thorn plant at Skelmersdale and the posoibilityof a restructuring of the television tube industry in the UnitedKingdom.    In his view this delay was mistaken.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer would be announcing the decision to impose otherimport controls in the first half of December, and inevitably suchan announcement would create some adverse international reaction.It was hardly likely that the Government would wish to risk a repetition of that by later deciding to announce controls on colour television tubes.    He acknowledged that the Secretary of State for trade had done well in the arrangement on prices which he had successfully agreed with the Japanese;  but that arrangement did notovercome the present difficulties facing Skelmersdale,    the ministerial Committee on Industrial Development had agreed to expenditure of up to just over  1 million to buy time at Skelmersdalewhile the possibility of a restructuring of the industry which would save the plant was explored,    A report he had received from Phillips,the other British tube manufacturer, was not optimistic, but he himself still thought restructuring was a possibility.    In his view it was unthinkable that the Government should announce a packageof import controls which would exclude television tubes at a timewhen the industry was facing such difficulties and the Governmentwas considering ways of saving it.    The trades unions concerned would certainly not understand such an action, and he remindedCabinet that a Motion had just appeared on the House of CommonsOrder Paper, signed by 54 Labour Members, on unemployment inthe television industry and calling specifically for import restrictionson tubes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that there was no difference between him and the Secretary of State for Industry onthe objective of a viable and continuing television tube industry inthis country.    The only question was the way in which this shouldbe achieved.    He reminded Cabinet that a great many of the tubesimported into the United Kingdom were of a size and type notmanufactured here, so that, at least for the present, such importsmust continue.    The 22 inch tube was the most popular size, butBritish capacity for this was in excess of 2j million tubes a year,while production of television sets was only running at 1.2 million
per year.    This problem of over-capacity in the most populartube size was one which would remain whether import controlswere imposed or not.    Restructuring would not be easy, since theMullard system (Mullard being the Phillips1 subsidiary) wastechnically very different from that of Thorn and it would take an appreciable amount of time to make the changes necessary tointegrate the two.    When he had visited Japan earlier in the year,the manufacturers in this country had said that the most helpfulthing the Government could do would be to get an increase in theprice of Japanese exports;  and this had been achieved, theJapanese now quoting  38 - the price at which the United kingdom manufacturers could compete - as against the  3l- 32 they werecharging previously.    He pointed out that if import controls were now imposed, the Japanese would certainly break this priceagreement;  and other voluntary agreements which he had reached with them - on ball bearings, on pottery, and perhaps also on carswhich was still under negotiation - would be put seriously at risk.The British television set manufacturers, who employed ten times as many people as the television tube industry, would be put in avery serious position, since they would be compelled to purchaseBritish tubes at a higher price that would make their exports lesscompetitive.    Furthermore, in his view there was no prospect ofmaking out a case under Article XIX of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade, since there had been no increase in imports oftubes.In discussion it was noted that Phillips had plans to extend the range of their present production so as to cover the bulk of the tubesizes now imported, and it would be helpful in securing the implementation of these plans if they could be backed up by import control covering the period of reorganisation.    On the other hand,it was pointed out that the Governments attitude as expressed atRambouillet was that selective import controls might be imposed,not on protectionist grounds, but simply to help temporarily an industry which in normal times was viable but was likely tocollapse    during the recession because of competitive imports.This was not quite the present position with television tubes.Nevertheless, there was obvious advantage in facilitating are organisation of the industry so as to make it viable and retainSkelmersdale.    One possibility would be to seek an arrangement with the Japanese on television tubes comparable with that nowbeing sought on cars.    The Japanese could be told that the BritishGovernment wanted them to reduce their present exports to theUnited Kingdom of colour tubes to a lower level, and that if they didnot do so the Government should have no option but to imposecontrols.    It was unlikely, however, that this course would actrapidly enough to help at   Skelmersdale, and it might therefore be necessary to offer more assistance to Thorn&apos;s to keep
the situation open.    An approach of this kind would safeguard theother voluntary arrangements with the Japanese.    It was, however,argued that, while a message to the Japanese was in draft pressingthem strongly to avoid any increase in their exports to the UnitedKingdom of television tubes, it would be difficult to go further and seek a positive reduction, since other countries, notably theUnited States and Canada, would also be involved.    Furthermorethere was strong opposition from the set manufacturers to any restrictions on tube imports.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet seemed to be that, taken on theirown, the disadvantages of imposing import controls on colour television tubes appeared to outweigh the advantages.    However,it was not possible to dissociate this question from that of import controls on cars;   and if import controls were not imposed on thelatter the political case for strengthening the import restraintpackage by imposing controls on television tubes would be stronger.The matter would therefore need to be re-examined in the context of the package as a whole.The Cabinet -Took note with approval cf the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their dissussion.Cabinet Office27 November 1975
tHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO      4 5CABINETCHRYSLER(UK) LTDPreviousReference:CC(75) 50thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cc(75) 51st Conclusions Minute 3Thursday 27 November 1975 at 10. 00 am the Cabinet resumed their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY, said that with theSecretary of State and Minister of State for Scotland and the paymaster General he had, the previous evening and that morning,renewed his discussions with the Chairman of the chrysler corporation.    The meetings had concentrated on the scheme forthe reorganisation and contraction of Chrysler (UK) Ltd which had originally been put forward by Chrysler.    The scheme involved the preservation of 15, 000 of the current 25, 000 jobs atChrysler (UK) Ltd including some 4, 000 of the 6, 000 jobs at Linwood.He had pressed the Corporation for their views on the viability ofthe scheme.   Although in earlier correspondence they had describedit as &quot;malting commercial and industrial good sense&quot; they nowdescribed it as &quot;politically viable but not economically viable&quot;.That was quite different.    He himself had two very considerabledoubts about the scheme.    The first was that it involved a plannedoutput of 93, 000 cars per year;  although this might rise to 140, 000it had to be set against the assessment in the report by the central policy Review Staff (CPRS) that a scale of 250, 000 cars per year was the minimum figure for viability.    The other major problem was that it involved the transfer of production of the Avenger carfrom the Midlands to Linwood.    Even if the transfer were carried through without problems it would take 6 to 8 months.    It was however to be expected that the workers who would in consequencebe made redundant in the Midlands would do all in their power to resist this transfer.   As the Cabinet had requested he had pressedChrysler on whether they would be willing to share the risks andany losses arising from continuing operations.    They were adamantthat they would not agree to any continuing liability.    They wereprepared, however, to envisage two possible forms of contributionto this scheme.    The first was that they should have a continuingshareholding of less than 20 per cent in the company, which would
continue to trade under the Chrysler name.    In thesecircumstances the Chrysler Corporation would be prepared to write off the  20 million of loans which Chrysler (UK) Ltd alreadyowed to them and would be prepared to invest  13 million of newmoney.    This would, however, be the limit of their commitmentand they would not be prepared to increase the amount if lossesproved larger than had been estimated.    An alternative arrangement was that they should have no continuing shareholding and that thecompany would cease to use the Chrysler name.    In this case theywould be prepared to put in  35 million of new money in additionto the loan write-off.    The difference between the two situationsarose from the fact that if they had a continuing shareholding andthe United Kingdom company continued to use the Chrysler namethey would not be able to write off past losses in the United Kingdomagainst profits in the United States.    In either case they would beprepared to continue to provide management for the company andwould enable it to use their wo rid-wide distribution system.    Itwas clear to him that these proposals needed to be further discussed with the Chrysler Corporation.    He had asked them whether they would be willing to extend the deadline for the closure of Chrysler (UK) until the end of the year.    This they werenot willing to accept, but he believed that they would be preparedto wait until the middle of December.    However they had made clear that the process of running down had already started.    no new materials were being ordered for example.    In consequenceif the Government took over the company it would not be able to start up again until the middle of February.He was not at all optimistic that a satisfactory outcome could bereached in these negotiations.    In his view the object of Chryslerwas to transfer all the responsibility for redundancies and for thefuture of the company onto the Government by contributing an amount which they would otherwise have to use for redundancy payments.Nevertheless he thought it was essential to have further talks withthe Corporation.    He would bring a further detailed paper to theCabinet in the following week.THE MINISTER OF STATE, SCOTTISH OFFICE, said that in his view the negotiations had made substantial progress.    The viabilityof the reorganised company was the crucial question.    Clearlythere could be no guarantee of this but he thought that there was areasonable prospect.    The cost and profit estimates produced byChrysler were based on detailed calculations and Chrysler did not accept the views of the CPRS on the dependence of viability on production at a scale of 250, 000 cars per year.   Important mattersremained to be negotiated.    These would include the details of thearrangements that Chrysler would make for future management andfuture distribution; these would be crucial, at least in the shorter
term.    It was also likely that in negotiation some increase couldbe secured in the sum which Chrysler would be willing to invest.It would, moreover, be essential to secure the co-operation of thetrades unions concerned, without which the scheme could not go ahead.    Their support would have to be sought on the basis thatthe scheme provided a means of saving 15, 000 jobs and that without it all the 25, 000 jobs at Chrysler would be lost.In discussion there was general agreement negotiations should becontinued with the Chrysler Corporation.    But it was arguedstrongly that there was very little chance of an acceptable solution on the lines envisaged.    It was most unlikely that the reorganisedcompany would be economically viable and any support for itwas likely to be damaging to British Leyland and to Ford andVauxhall.    The strategic consequences for the whole industry must therefore be kept in mind.    If cars were not marketed underthe Chrysler name they were unlikely to sell well and it was unlikelythat Chrysler would have a strong incentive to press them in competition with cars produced by other companies in their group.It would be necessary to examine with great care the assumptionswhich underlay the forecasts of capital requirements for the reorganised company, particularly about the share of the british market which it might command and the extent of overseas sales.It would be unsatisfactory to rely on figures produced by Chryslerand it should be a condition of further negotiations that independentestimates should be made by consultants.    These might also cover the contingent liabilities, such as for redundancy payments andcreditors, which the Government would assume if they took overthe company.    It also had to be recognised that even if nationaltrades union leaders expressed their support for the reorganisationscheme they could not ensure that all the workers concerned would co-operate.    It was inconceivable that redundant workers in theMidlands would stand by inactive while plant was transferred toLinwoods this factor was of the greatest importance to any finaldecision.    If the Government took over the company they would assume all the political, economic and social responsibility for future decisions about it and would incur all the odium for anyclosures which took place thereafter.    The worst outcome of allwould be if the Government assumed responsibility and the companycollapsed within a matter of months because the workers would not allow the reorganisation to proceed.On the other hand it was argued that it was imperative to secure thecontinued operation of the Linwood plant.    Without this theGovernments devolution proposals would fail, with incalculableconsequences for the future.    In the light of the very substantialcontributions which the Chrysler Corporation were ready to makethe Governments position would be indefensible if they did not
secure the continued operation of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.    Even if the reorganised company did not have a good long term future thescheme would permit a phased rundown which was greatlypreferable to a redundancy scheme.    Any further contractioncould be planned carefully;  for example the Iranian contract couldbe carried on.    If the Government were to avoid the odium for theconsequences which were likely to be associated with any decisionthere should be consultation with the trades union movement overthe range of options which was open before any decision was taken.In further discussion there was general agreement that in additionto pursuing negotiations on the possible takeover of Chrysler (UK) Ltdconsideration should also be given to alternative means ofsecuring the continued operation of their facilities, particularly those at Linwood.    Rather than take over all the liabilities of Chrysler (UK) Ltd it might be preferable to allow Chrysler to rundown the company and to provide British Ley land with additional funds to expand their output so as to offer employment at some ofthe plants which Chrysler might close.    In particular there was an unsatisfied demand overseas for Land Rovers and the government might pay for an additional production line for these at Linwood.Local authorities were having to import spare parts for buses andBritish Leyland might be able to increase output of these by using the Luton plant.    Wide ranging consideration should therefore begiven to the possible ways in which the Government could continueproduction by the motor industry at Linwood and at other Chryslerplants.    It was further argued that in the event of substantialGovernment support for Chrysler (UK) Ltd it would not be right toproceed with the proposals for a supplementary redundancy &quot;payments scheme nor with the proposals for import restrictionson motor cars.    On the other hand it was pointed out that the high level of imports into Britain and the reduction in output by Chrysler(UK) Ltd which was in any case inevitable would justify theintroduction of import restrictions even if the Governmentsupported a substantial reorganisation.THE PRIME MINISTER,    summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Industry shouldcontinue his negotiations with the Chrysler Corporation in good faith, even if with some scepticism as to their chances of success,since no decision had yet been taken on whether an arrangement ofthe kind discussed could be accepted.    He should say that a necessary condition was that the Government should forthwith putin consultants to assess the validity of the cost estimates of thescheme proposed by the Chrysler Corporation and also to assess the magnitude of the contingent liabilities which the Governmentwould assume if it took over ownership of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.    Hecould indicate to Chryslers that the Government would expect to
give them a decision in principle in the course of the following week.    While these negotiations were continuing it was important that the public should not be led to expect a rescue of Chrysler(UK) Ltd: this could be misleading and would in any case beharmful to our negotiating position.    The Chrysler corporation should say no more than that negotiations were continuing, and nomembers of the Government other than himself and the Secretaryof State for Industry should comment.    While these further discussions took place with Chrysler, consideration should alsobe given to whether the money which the Government would haveto put into a scheme of this kind would be better spent if Chryslerswere allowed to collapse and if British Leyland were helped toprovide continuing employment at Linwood.    There was for examplean accepted need for increased capacity for the production ofLand Rovers and Range Rovers and British Leyland might been abled to undertake this at Linwood.    British Leyland were alsounable to meet current demand for spare parts for buses and theymight be able to increase their output by taking over Chrysler1 sfacilities at Luton.    In any case an assessment should be made ofthe impact on British Leyland of all the options which were beingconsidered.    A full scenario should also be prepared of all theconsequences which would follow a decision not to prevent the closure of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.    This should cover the financial implications for the Chrysler Corporation and for the Government,and also physical consequences such as the rate of redundancies indifferent localities.    It was clear that the reorganisation scheme proposed by Chrysler, which involved the movement of Avengerproduction from Coventry to Linwood, would raise major problemsof industrial relations.    The views of leading trades union officials should therefore be sought on the options open to the Governmentassuming that Chrysler (UK)Ltd could not be maintained in itspresent form.    In particular they should be given an opportunityto comment on the alternatives of preserving some part of Chrysler (UK) Ltd which implied the transfer of work from theMidlands to Linwood, or assisting British Leyland to increase their output and in particular to maintain employment at Linwood,The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto resume negotiations with the Chrysler corporation on the basis indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.
3. Invited the Secretary of State for industry to assess the impact on British Leylandof the options open to the Government and toexamine with British Leyland what steps that company could take to operate some of thefacilities of Chrysler (UK) Ltd., in particular theLinwood plant, if Chrysler (US) were allowedto collapse,4. Invited the Secretary of State for Industry,in consiiltation with the Secretary of State for employment, to obtain the views of the appropriatetrades union leaders on the possible courses opento the Government.5. Invited the Secretary of State for Industryin consultation with the Secretaries of State for employment and Scotland to prepare a fullscenario of the consequences which would follow a decision to allow Chrysler (UK) Ltd to collapse.6.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto make a further report to the Cabinet in thefollowing week to enable a decision in principle to be made.Cabinet Office27 November 1975
