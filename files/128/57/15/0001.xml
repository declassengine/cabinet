PARLIAMENTARYFFAIRS1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.    It was notedthat there would on 5 November be a debate on a Motion relatingto the R.oad Vehicles Lighting (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations.A Prayer to annul the Regulations had been signed by a largenumber of Government backbench supporters;   and the opposition had now put down a separate Motion calling for their withdrawal.The Governments defeat was inevitable.    For technical reasons it was not possible for the Regulations to be withdrawn, and itwas therefore proposed to take first the Prayer for annulmentand to announce that a free vote would be allowed.    The Prayerwould be carried, and the need for debate on the Opposition^Motion would thus be avoided.It was reported that,  contrary to reports which had appeared inthe Press, the Opposition had not placed a ban on pairingarrangements, though they were taking a more restrictive linethan previously.CONFIDENTIALITY    2. THE PRIME MINISTER drew the Cabinets attention to theOF MINISTERIAL       unauthorised leakage to the Press of extensive (and largelyDISCUSSIONS misleading) information about the outcome of the meeting of the ministerial Steering Committee on Devolution (DS) which, had takenplace on 24 October.    The leaks, which appeared to have been calculated, suggested - wrongly - that the meeting of DS had revealed major differences of opinion between Ministers;  andthey had done great harm to the Governments standing in Scotlandand Wales by suggesting that Ministers had not been acting in good faith in their earlier statements about their proposals for devolution.    They had also placed him in a very difficult positionwhen answering Parliamentary Questions shortly afterwards, andhe had had no choice in the circumstances but to answer a parliamentary Question about the introduction of legislation inmore robust terms than he might otherwise have done.&quot;Government by leak&quot; was totally unacceptable;  and all ministers should in future adhere strictly to the guidance which was clearlyset out in the memorandum &quot;Questions of Procedure for ministers&quot; (C(P)(74) 6).The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister^ statement.1
FOREIGN 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidAFFAIRS that talks had been held in London on 23-24 October with an___ Icelandic delegation led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs,Iceland Mr Agustsson.    It had become clear that the Icelanders had madelittle progress in solving the negotiating problems they faced as aresult of differences of opinion within their coalition Government.In response to our opening bid for a catch limit of 130, 000 tonsa year the Icelanders had offered only 50, 000 tons, but had asked us not to reveal that figure: his interpretation of this was that the icelandic Foreign Minister wanted to be able to make an increase on this offer but knew that he would be bound by the figure if it became public.    The next step v/as for the scientists of both sidesto discuss data on the fish stocks in the waters around Iceland.These discussions would bring us dangerously close to the date of13 November when our current agreement with Iceland was due to expire and Ministerial talks would probably not resume until after that date.    Our rights following expiry of the agreement were clear and had been confirmed by the International Court of Justice.Nevertheless the British fishing industry was willing to exercise its rights with moderation, and we had told the Icelanders that wewould act after 13 November as though the agreement was still inforce.    The Icelanders would have to take the public position thatthey stood on the 200 mile rights they claimed, but the presentIcelandic Government were more reasonable than the administration in force at the time of the last cod war and he thought it possiblethat they might limit their action against our fishermen to somesymbolic gesture such as the cutting of one or two warps.    Thequestion of protection of our fishing vessels would then arise.    Itwas tempting to provide Royal Navy protection immediately, but thiswould make it more difficult for the Icelanders to negotiate with us;there was therefore something to be said tor using civilian vessels in a protection role.In a brief discussion the suggestion was made that civilian vesselsmight be used for protection within the 50 mile zone with Royal Navy-vessels patrolling outside the 50 mile zone.    The British fishing industry was in very poor shape at present and any reduction in thecatch from waters off Iceland would exacerbate its difficulties.    Oneconsequence would be great pressure from the industry on theGovernment in connection with the negotiations for a CommonFisheries Policy.2
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,although nothing could be said publicly at this stage, he was engaged in very active exchanges with the Greek and turkish governments on the Cyprus issue.    He had proposed to both sidesa package containing three elements;   a bi-zonal federation;boundary adjustments;  and a central government with weakpowers.    The Greek Government were ready to accept in principle,subject to clarification of details, particularly on the boundaries.The Turkish Government response was less satisfactory: theywere being deliberately vague about boundary adjustments andwere demanding that in the central government the Turkishcommunity should have equal rights with the Greek community.He was continuing his mediation with the object of reaching asufficient measure of understanding to allow the Clerides/Denktashtalks to be resumed with good prospects of success.    He could not exclude the possibility that the Turks were playing a double gamewith us in these negotiations since in parallel discussions with theFederal German Government they had suggested not a bi-zonalfederation but three zones, the central zone to be jointlyadministered.    He was keeping in close touch with the federal german Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher.    The American secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, was also pressing both sidesto move to a solution.    So were the    European economic community countries acting as a whole, but the Turks seemeddisinclined to pay much attention to the representations of theCommunity Presidency.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthere were three factors involved in the very disturbing situationin the Lebanon; the Muslims were demanding greater powers onthe ground that they now outnumbered the Christians;  the LebaneseGovernment could not use the Army to restore order;  and the palestinian refugees were an unsettling influence,    Syrian policy on the issue was by no means clear:  at times they appeared to betrying to mediate, though with little success, whilst at other timesthere was evidence that they were infiltrating Syrians into the conflict disguised as Palestinian refugees.    There was a danger that Syrian intervention might induce the Israelis to move intosouthern Lebanon.    He had been considering the possibility ofmediation and had discussed this recently with the Saudi ArabianForeign Minister, Prince Saud, who had told him that the Saudishad been unsuccessful in their own attempts at mediation and thathe thought it unlikely that British mediation could succeed.    he proposed to discuss the possibility with his European economic community colleagues in Rome but thought that the prospects of successful mediation were slim.    The United States Government
were not attempting mediation for the time being.    He thought itwas just possible that the Lebanese Christians might finally agreeto partition the country, but it would be tragic to see the Lebanonbreak up in that way.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
NATIONAL,HEALTHSERVICEDENTAL ANDOPTICALCHARGESPreviousReference:CC(75) 41stConclusions;,Minute 34. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the proposed increases in National Health Service (NHS) dental and opticalcharges.    They had before them a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C(75) 105) about the possibility of making the necessarysavings by economies in the cost of administration of the NHS and related services.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that adecision on the proposed increases was urgently needed;  the longer it was delayed the greater the increase in charges that wouldbe necessary.    She found the prospect of the increases mostunwelcome.    They were bound to cause distress and annoyance toGovernment supporters, all the more so because there was no prospect that any move could be made towards achieving theGovernments long-term objective of abolishing of at least reducingprescription charges.    But the Lord Privy Seal had concluded thatit would be impossible to make savings of  18 million a year bymeans of administrative economies;  and she and the other health ministers could not find that sum from within their healthprogrammes, which had already been cut so severely that it was doubtful whether even inescapable commitments could be met.Unless the necessary money could be found from elsewhere shetherefore saw no choice but to increase charges in the way proposed,despite the damaging political effects.In discussion, it was argued that serious political harm was boundto be caused by any increase in NHS charges, which for manyGovernment supporters were an area of unique sensitivity.    TheGovernments overriding priority must be to maintain the effectiveness of their incomes policy;  opposition to the  6 limitwould be at its maximum in the spring of 1976, by which time thefurther price increases which were unavoidable would be makingthemselves felt.    It was therefore essential to retain the confidence of the Governments supporters generally and of the trade unions inparticular;  and from that point of view an increase now in NHScharges, which could do nothing but harm to the prospects ofmaintaining a successful incomes policy, would be an act of politicalrecklessness.    In these circumstances the lesser evil would be toprovide the necessary money by increased public sector borrowing,bearing in mind that the amount involved would be too small to undermine confidence.    It was also argued that the proposed increase in charges would in effect represent a further deflation ofthe economy by  18 million at a time when, in view of increasing unemployment, what was needed was probably a controlled reflation.And if it were unacceptable to increase public sector borrowing,the necessary money might be raised by seeking some new form oftaxation which would make possible a net increase in tax revenue.
On the other hand, it was argued that there would be greatdifficulty in borrowing on the scale needed to bridge the alreadywide gap between public expenditure and revenue, and that further increases in the borrowing requirement must be avoided.Moreover, even if some reflation were judged necessary the right course would not be to increase public expenditure but to raise the tax threshold and thus reduce the burden of direct taxation fallingupon those earning lower incomes, which on present trends was liable to increase to a degree which would be judged intolerable by-many of the Governments supporters, including the trade unions.And even if there were scope for increased expenditure, therewere strong arguments for the view that the highest priority should not be given to preventing an increase in NHS charges,which would in fact do no more than keep pace with generalinflation.    It would be quite unacceptable to reopen the basis ofwhat the Cabinet had already agreed in relation to public expenditurein 1976-77, bearing in mind that many Ministers had in consequencehad to take and announce difficult and unpopular decisions,sometimes involving unwelcome reallocations within their departmental budgets,    In any event, it was doubtful whether NHScharges now aroused the strong emotions which they once had.Many Government supporters would accept the increases as reasonable and necessary - indeed, they might help to secure widerrecognition of the seriousness of the economic situation.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that, whilefully recognising the political dangers involved, a clear majority ofthe Cabinet agreed that there was in present circumstances no effective alternative to proceeding forthwith with the increases inNHS charges proposed by the Secretary of State for Social Services.Even if an additional  18 million could by some means be madeavailable, top priority would not necessarily be given to devotingit to the avoidance of increases in NHS charges.    The Cabinetsdecision would have to be presented with the greatest care, and thecarefully chosen concessions which the Secretary of State had proposed would be valuable in this context.    It would also bedesirable that, in announcing the increases, she should bothemphasise the increase which had taken place in the real cost of the nhs, and set the present increase in charges firmly against the background of the degree of general inflation which had taken place since the last increase.    It might also be helpful for any announcement in Parliament to be timed so that the Secretary of State would havean opportunity on the same day of explaining the decision to theParliamentary Labour Party.6
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for social Services, in consultation with the secretaries of State for Scotland and for wales, to proceed accordingly.?
5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(75) 110) to which were attached revised drafts of The Queen&apos;s Speeches on the Opening of the new Session and onthe Prorogation of Parliament,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that on 23 October the Cabinet had approved the draft Opening Speech, subject to a number of amendments and additions, and the draft Prorogation Speechsubject to one addition.    These changes were incorporated in the revised drafts now before the Cabinet.The following points were made in discussion -Paragraph 12 of the Opening Speech, in its revised version,referred to &quot;the present quite intolerable level ofunemployment&quot;.    This phrase might subsequently be used against the Government, and &quot;quite intolerable&quot; should bereplaced by &quot;unacceptable&quot;.Paragraph 20 of the Opening Speech said that the Governmentwould bring forward &quot;detailed proposals&quot; for theestablishment of Scottish and Welsh Assemblies.    But asa result of the damaging leak which had followed themeeting of the Steering Committee on Devolution (DS) at chequers on 24 October, the Prime Minister had been obliged to give an assurance, when replying to questions in the House on 28 October, that legislation would beintroduced as early as possible in the next Session.    Inview of this it would be necessary for the Speech to refer to legislation rather than to &quot;detailed proposals&quot; whichcould imply no more than a White Paper.    This was however complicated by the fact that Ministers had accepted, and might have to indicate during the debate onthe Address, that it would not be possible for the Bill toreach the Statute Book by the end of the Session.    In anycase it was desirable to allow ample time for public opinion to form and to be taken account of.    In these circumstances it was necessary to avoid a form of words in The QueenJsSpeech which seemed to suggest that the Government were committed to no more than the publication of a White Paperearly in the Session and at the same time avoid a commitment to legislate by the end of the Session.Paragraph 24 of.the Opening Speech should say that legislation would be introduced &quot;for a development land tax&quot; so as toavoid the use of the word &quot;impose&quot;.
Paragraph 11 of the Prorogation Speech should refer to the&quot;devotion&quot; rather than the &quot;integrity&quot; of the Armed forces and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the drafts of the two Queen&apos;s Speeches, subjectto the further amendments which had been agreed.    He would now submit the drafts to The Queen.    Paragraph 20 of the opening speech would say that the Government would bring forward&quot;legislative proposals&quot; for the establishment of Scottish and WelshAssemblies.    The timetable would then be that the White paper would be published in November or December.    The draftDevolution Bill would be published when ready - probably in Marchor April of 1976 - and a Parliamentary debate on the substance ofthe Bill - not necessarily a formal Second Reading debate, though this was not excluded - might be arranged in the summer.Comments on the Bill and on the White Paper would then be takeninto account in the drafting of the new Bill which would be introduced in the 1976-77 Session.    The Government might be criticised on both the timing and content of their devolution plans,,    Therewere of course some very real difficulties;  but it was essentialthat the whole Cabinet should present a united front in support ofthe policies which were approved and of colleagues with responsibility for devolution matters.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office30 October 19759
