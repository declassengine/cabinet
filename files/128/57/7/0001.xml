CONFIDENTIALiRLlA-MENTARY  I, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in therpAIIlS House of Commons during the following week.jmuneration. It was reported that serious difficulties had arisen in connection with-arges and the Committee and remaining stages of the Remuneration, Charges-ants Bill and Grants Bill, which it had been hoped to complete later the same day.    Some hundreds of amendments had been put down by theConservative and Liberal Parties, the greatest danger to theGovernment probably arising in connection with Clause 3,    hi viewof the broad public acceptance of the policy embodied in the Bill, itmight well be that the Opposition^ will to press the amendmentswould weaken when it became apparent that the Government wereprepared for the House to sit continuously to deal with them, ifnecessary until the morning of the following Saturday (26 July).    Butif this did not prove to be so, it might be necessary to consider aTimetable Motion, which would have to be put down in time for it tobe moved at 11 am on the following day (Friday, 25 July),    Ifproceedings on the Bill in the House of Commons were allowed toextend into the following week, for example, by allowing a separateday for the Report Stage and Third Reading, this would reduce thetime which had been allocated that week for consideration of theCommunity Land and Employment Protection Bills, and it might become necessary to consider putting down Timetable Motions for those Bills also.    They and the Petroleum and Submarine PipelinesBill must receive their Second Reading in the House of Lords beforethe Recess if they were to have a fair prospect of reaching the statute book during the current Session,    At the moment the Opposition inthe House of Lords were disposed to be reasonably co-operative; butthis would no longer be the case if Timetable Motions were adoptedin the House of Commons and it might well become impossible tocomplete all essential legislation this Session.    A bargain might bereached with the Opposition on the basis that the Community land bill would be postponed, and this might be made more acceptable tothe Government by tabling a Motion allowing the Bill to be reintroducedin the following Session at the stage at which it had reached this session.    But there were serious procedural and other objections tothis course, and in any case any delay in passing the Bill into law waswas likely to have harmful practical consequences.    Other courses ofaction which were theoretically open were to defer the beginning of the recess until later than the planned date of 8 August and to providefor a longer spillover, but both were open to very severe objections,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet could not settle their tactics until proceedings on the remuneration, Charges and Grants Bill had started and there hadbeen an opportunity to assess the temper of the House of Commons.1
Accordingly the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Employment, the Secretaryof State for Prices and Consumer Protection, the Lord Privy Sealand the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury should meet at 10 pmthat evening in order to consider what tactics should be adopted.If there were any question of increasing the time available for the remuneration, Charges and Grants Bill by delaying considerationof the Community Land Bill, it. would have to be on the basis that theOpposition would subsequently facilitate progress on the latter sothat it could reach the Statute Book by the end of the plannedspillover.    The Ministers should in particular consider, in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion, whether there was a case for putting down a Timetable Motion to be debated at 11 am on thefollowing day.    If such a Motion were put down, as much notice aspossible should be given,  since it was important to avoid giving theOpposition any legitimate complaint on procedural grounds and thusrisking that they would receive the public sympathy which had hitherto been denied them in view of their attitude towards thesubstance of the Bill,    If the Ministers concerned considered thatsuch a Motion should be put down, but wished their conclusion tobe endorsed by their colleagues, an immediate meeting of the cabinet would be arranged.    In view of the Parliamentary situation themeeting of the Cabinet to discuss public expenditure prioritieswhich was to have taken place at Chequers on Friday, 25 July wouldbe postponed until Monday, 4 August.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theLord President of the Council, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to be guided accordingly.2
litEIGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidfAlRS that the situation in Portugal was confused.,    The Armed ForcesMovement (afin) were disillusioned in the face of their politicalttugal and serious economic problems:   and it was believed that theofficers of the Lisbon garrison were divided about the desirabilityjVious of ousting General Goncalves from the post of Prime Minister0ference: The Socialist Party leader, Dr Soares, aimed to achieve this and;(75) 16th would like to replace Goncalves by an alliance of Crespo andaclusions Antunes.    Soares was however impetuous and might in fact havejaate 3 saved GoncrJves by calling for his resignation: the PopularDemocratic Party were probably wiser in not working openly forhis removal.    Dr Soares, who might call for a general strike,feared large scale arrests of his supporters (and also his ownassassination), but it was doubtful whether the Communists were themselves strong enough to move in force.    There was however apossibility that the Communist Party, with the backing of some members of the afin, might stage a left-wing coup ostensibly to forestall intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO):  precautions were therefore being taken about NATO navalmovements in the area to avoid providing a pretext for this.    Atthe European Council meeting there had initially been a divisionof opinion about aid to Portugal and it was possible that the french had been motivated more by domestic political considerations thanby the merits of the situation: the final statement had however been a good one.    It had begun on a positive note but had then made it clear that the provision of aid depended on Portugal being apluralist democracy.    The European Council had agreed that thePrime Minister and the French President, M Giscard d&apos;Estaing,should discuss Portugal with Mr Brezhnev, the Secretary Generalof the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the forthcomingHelsinki Conference.    There was no doubt that the Soviet union was supplying substantial funds to the Portuguese Communist Party,so Mr Brezhnev had it partly in his power to control the situation as evidence of his wish for genuine detente.    The Prime Ministerand he would attend a meeting of Socialist leaders in Stockholmwhich the Swedish Prime Minister had called for 2 August and whichmight help to strengthen the position of Dr Soares, who would attend it.inference THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSecurity third stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation ind Co-operation Europe, which the Prime Minister would be attending in HelsinkiEurope the following week, was of great importance.    The results of thesecond stage of the Conference had been as good as, or perhapsbetter than^we could have expected. One of the critical issues hadbeen the provision about inviolability of frontiers.    The Federal3
sec!Republic of Germany had accepted a statement to the effect thatfrontiers, while inviolable by force, could be changed by peaceful means and in accordance with international law.     It was important to the Germans to maintain the principle mat frontiersshould not be sanctified in concrete and the provision for peacefulchange might some day have application elsewhere in Europe.     this did not mean that the East European countries would now detachthemselves from the Warsaw Pact, but he attached significance toa remark made to him by the Polish First Secretary, Mr Gierek,that &quot; detente gives us room for manoeuvre&quot;.    It was up to the west to play their     part in developing that room for manoeuvre.    TheBritish role at Helsinki would be prominent since, by luck of the ballot the Prime Minister would be the first speaker at the openingsession and would also be chairman for the closing one.    Lookingbeyond the third stage, our next objective was to make 1976 a year for reaching agreement on some reduction in arms in central europe.    We favoured a resumed meeting of the Conference in early 1977 at Ambassadorial level to assess the results thenachieved over the whole range of subjects agreed at the third stage of the Conference,    In the meantime the development andexploitation of trade contacts was of the highest importance.    Hewas in close contact with the Secretary of State for Trade about this and would himself be visiting Hungary in the following week.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that bothHouses of the Indian Parliament had now approved Mrs Gandhi&apos;semergency powers which meant that there was no need for parliament to meet again for at least a year.    It was a serious matter that the correspondents of four leading British newspapershad been forced to leave India and that the British broadcasting corporation had decided it had to withdraw its correspondents.A protest had been made through our High Commissioner in Delhi:and he had put in hand an urgent study of the situation.    There wasno sign as yet that the Soviet Union was seeking to exploit thesituation in India.The Cabinet -1, Took note of the statements by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Government could be wellsatisfied with the record of their foreign policy over the 17 monthsthey had been in office.    Both President Ford and Dr Kissinger had said that our relations with the United States were now better thanat any time since the war.    Relations with the Soviet Union hadbeen dramatically improved:  indeed the Soviet Prime Minister,Mr Kosygin, had described the success of their meeting in Februaryas &quot;outstanding&quot; and there were prospects of major trade contractssince Britain was being given priority in the Soviet plan for purchaseof consumer goods.    Our relations with other countries in eastern europe were also very good.    Our standing in the Commonwealthwas high, as had been demonstrated at the Commonwealth Heads ofGovernment Meeting at Jamaica.    The Rhodesian situation remainedunresolved, but we had much improved our position in the eyes of african leaders.    The recent European Council meeting had shown a welcome advance in that discussion had concentrated on importantpractical issues such as commodities and raw materials rather thanon procedural or institutional matters relating to the Community&apos;sown development.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of thestatement by the Prime Minister.5
CONFIDENTIALrgp^S&apos; 3C The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordXPENSES Privy Seal (C(75) 84) recommending that the peers ExpensesLLOWANCE Allowance should be increased by  2 a day with effect from1 August 1975,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Peers&apos; Expenses allowance was increased to its present rate of  11, 50 a day on 1 August 1974,At that time the whole question of the rates and conditions of payment of the allowance was referred to the Top Salaries review body (TSRB),    The Review Body had been unable, because of pressure of other work, to deal with the Peers&apos; Expenses allowance in the first part of their report submitted on 13 June, but mey had promised to produce a further report before the end of the year which would deal, among other matters, with this allowance.However, in the meantime the chairman of the TSRB had written tothe Prime Minister on 27 June proposing on behalf of the review body that there should be an interim increase in the allowance whichwould bring it up to a maximum of  13, 50 a day.    The proposedinterim increase was in recognition of the fact that the TSRB had recommended increases in the allowances of Members of Parliament,and took account of the increase since 1 August 1974 in the costs whichthe Allowance was intended to cover.    The Peers&apos; ExpensesAllowance was a daily limit within which Peers could reclaim theiractual expenditure for attending sittings of the House of Lords.Peers had been asked to claim only their actual expenses rather thanthe full amount of the allowance, and as a result of this appeal, only60 per cent of those attending claimed the full daily rate.    If theCabinet agreed to increase the allowance by the amount proposed,there would be a further appeal to Members of the House of lords to claim only their actual expenditure and not the full allowance.The proposal to raise the allowance by  2 a day represented anincrease of 17 j per cent, compared with the 28^- per cent increasein the subsistence allowance of Members of Parliament which had recently been approved.    Members of the House of Lords were beginning to feel that they were not receiving the same treatment as the Commons, and this could create problems for the management of business in the Lords,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the proposal that the daily rate of Peers&apos;Expenses Allowance should be increased by  2.    It would be unfortunate presentationally if the increased allowance were to bepaid with effect from 1 August 1975, which was the date from whichthe Governments incomes policy began to operate.    The Lord Privy-Seal should therefore make arrangements for the payment of thehigher rate of allowance with effect from 13 June, the date on whichthe first part of the report of the TSRB had been submitted.6
The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2, Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrangefor the payment of peers Expenses Allowanceat a daily rate of  13.50 with effect from13 June 1975.Cabinet Office24 July 1975
