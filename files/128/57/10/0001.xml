ALSO PRESENTThe Rt Hon Roy Hatters ley mp minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsSECRETARIATSir John hunt mr J A MarshallMr A M MacphersonSUBJECTMEASURES TO ALLEVIATE UNEMPLOYMENTii
ASURES The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment (C(75) 95), a memorandum by the Secretary of State forLEVIATE the Environment (C(75) 94) and a memorandum by the Chancellor ofEMPLOYMENT    the Exchequer (C(75) 96) on measures to alleviate unemployment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the Cabinet meeting on 4 august the Chancellor of the Exchequer had referred to a need for a clutch of measures to take the edge off the rising figures of unemployment.There had been a discussion at a meeting of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC)/Labour Party Liaison Committee earlier that day when Ministers had told TUC representatives of the governments intention to take steps to deal with the present high level ofunemployment.    It had been made clear to the TUC that these measures would not amount to a general reflation of the economy,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the unemployment figures had to be considered in the context of the present and prospective economic situation.    The rate of increase in theunemployment figures appeared to be falling, but the figures would still continue to rise until the New Year, by which time the number ofunemployed, seasonally adjusted, might be about 1,2 million.    There-after it was likely that the figures would level off and begin to decline.Domestic demand would probably increase in the fourth quarter of1975;  and world demand was already increasing, though more slowlythan had previously been hoped.    This would have a bearing on therate at which unemployment began to decline.    General reflation toreduce unemployment was not possible because of the adverse effectit would have on the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments position.Indeed, he had to warn his colleagues that there might well be difficulty in financing the balance of payments deficit over the next four to five months.    As de-stocking came to an end and industrialorders revived the balance of payments would inevitably worsen.    Theacceptance by the TUC of a  6 a week pay limit had encouraged foreignconfidence but there could be no significant reflation of the economyuntil that limit was seen to be working.    The scope for measures totake the peak off the unemployment figures was therefore limited bya number of considerations.    The country could not afford a large increase in the present public sector borrowing requirement;  and itwould not be possible to increase employment by steps which had a damaging effect on the balance of payments.    Moreover, theGovernment should avoid any steps which would impede the shift of resources into manufacturing investment in the medium term once the economy began to pick up again.    Finally there should be no commitment to measures which would lead to increasing public expenditure either in the medium or long term.    What was requiredtherefore was a combination of measures which had a quick effect onunemployment and which could be swiftly brought to a close asunemployment declined with the recovery in the economy.
The possible steps which could be taken were discussed in his paper.The Government had already agreed that a subsidy to employers who took on school-leavers should be introduced from 1 November, andthat proposal had become public knowledge.    It was now proposed thatthis subsidy should be introduced from 20 October,    The total cost ofit would amount to  5 million, but against this should be offset theprobable saving of  2^ million in unemployment benefit.    This shouldproduce 35-40, 000 extra jobs by Christmas, mainly for school-leavers.    There had been widespread concern at the number of young people who were unable to find employment on leaving school, and theGovernments decision to introduce this step would be well received.The figure of  5 million was an estimate of take-up rather than a ceiling and he would be ready to accept a higher figure if necessary.On the question whether the subsidy should be made available to employers in the public sector, he did not think there would be any difficulty so far as the nationalised industries were&quot;concerned; butit might be unwise to make the subsidy available to local authorityemployers in view of the Governments pressure on them to reduce their manpower costs.A Work  Creation scheme was proposed by the Manpower services commission,    There had been no great enthusiasm for the proposalwhen it had previously been considered by Ministers, but it was clearthat the TUC were very much in tavour of it, and the expenditure of 30 million would create some 15, 000 new jobs fairly swiftly.Against this there would be offset a sum of between   9 million and 12 million in unemployment benefit together with a flow-back ofrevenue in the form of taxation.His proposals that  20 million of further work should be undertaken on the building and modernisation of factories on Government andindustrial estates, and that a further  50 million should be allocatedunder section 8 of the Industry Act for the acceleration of capital projects by individual firms and for further industry schemes, wouldnot have a marked effect on unemployment in the short term, but themeasures were relevant to the development of the Governmentslonger-term industrial strategy and they would be supported by the tuc who were keen to see an expansion of investment in manufacturing industry.    The industrial investment proposals, which he and theSecretary of State for Industry had been considering jointly, werehighly cost effective, and he was ready to consider further schemes which might increase total expenditure proposed from  70 million to 100 million.There had already been a major expansion of the trainingprogrammes in the public and private sectors, but he was willing toconsider the further proposals which the Secretary of State for employment had put forward after consultation with the Training
Services Agency (TSA).    These consisted of an expansion of existing schemes and the introduction of new schemes mainly for the trainingof young persons in apprenticeships or otherwise at a cost of 20 million; the uprating of the training allowances when unemploy-ment benefit was increased in November at a cost of  5 million;  andthe increase of the training allowance for young persons at a cost of 1^ million.    The temporary employment subsidy already operated inthe assisted areas and applied to redundancies of 50 or more.    He hadno objection to the extension of the subsidy to the non-assisted areas,but it would be prudent to review the operation of the scheme after thefirst three months to see if any revision was necessary.    There hadbeen a larger number of applications for the subsidy, but a smaller number of approvals, than had been expected when the scheme was started, and this might indicate that the money was not being spent asthe Government intended.On the proposals for additional expenditure to reduce unemployment inthe construction industry, on house improvement and new housebuilding and r enovation, one difficulty was that in the past they hadbeen very slow to start and they tended to go on long after the need forthem had passed.    The experience of the previous Government hadbeen that they were very difficult to control.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the suggested figure of 1.2 million as the unemployment peak wasoptimistic, and the figure might well reach 1. 5 million.    He felt that measures under discussion were in the nature of palliatives to dealwith the immediate situation and that it would be necessary for theCabinet to have a further discussion before long about the medium-term prospect.    Nevertheless the present measures would, if adoptedin full, go far to abolish the problem of the unemployment of school-leavers on which there was deep feeling throughout the country.    Hewas in favour of applying the recruitment subsidy to all public sectoremployers, including local authorities.    It would not however bepossible to announce details of the scheme until mid-October, althoughthe Government should confirm in general terms that the scheme wouldbe put into operation at an early date.    He was very much in favour ofthe Work Creation proposals of the Manpower Services Commissionbecause they would have an immediate effect on unemployment.    Theywere strongly supported by the Commission and by the TUCe and the projects chosen would favour the employment of young people.    he appreciated that local authorities might feel resentment that they werebeing asked to operate the scheme at the same time as they were being forced to cut down on their own manpower, but the Work Creationscheme was not compulsory.    As for the temporary employment,subsidy, there was a strong case for extending it to cover the non-assisted areas.    Indeed, the amount of the subsidy could be increasedto  20 and the scheme would still be self-financing.    He appreciated that the European Commission might raise difficulties, but
he hoped that these would not be regarded as insurmountable.    his proposals to expand the training schemes as suggested by the TSAhad not been cleared in detail with the Treasury, but he hoped thatthat could be done the following day if they received broad approvalfrom Cabinet.    The TSA had been asked to produce the most effective schemes that they could think of for reducing the level ofunemployment, and their suggestions had his strong support.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that hewas opposed to the Work Creation scheme.    Some of the projects that had been proposed were of a trivial nature and would be received withderision not only by the local authorities but by the unionsrepresenting local authority employees.    The tuc&apos;s enthusiasm forthe scheme was not shared by some of the constituent unions.    Ascheme for the expenditure of  30 million to create employment should be designed to bring the Government some political advantage,and to result in a worthwhile contribution to the nation&apos;s wealth.    TheGovernment should give priority to work that would help theconstruction industry, and he suggested that money should be devotedin 1975-76 and 1976-77 to housing improvements.    Extra sumsallocated now could prevent substantial redundancies in local authoritydirect labour departments and his Department had effective ways of ensuring that the money really was spent in these years and not allowed to spill over into later years.In discussion the following points were made -a. Recruitment subsidyThere would be difficulty in extending the payment of thesubsidy to local authorities.    A substantial part of localauthority wage costs were already met by the Government inthe form of the rate support grant, and it would be difficultsimultaneously to persuade authorities to cut down on main-power as part of general public expenditure retrenchment, andto encourage them to increase the recruitment of school-leaversby the payment of a special subsidy.    This difficulty would notarise in the case of the nationalised industries, and there wasno reason why the scheme should not extend to them.b. Temporary employment subsidyThe proposal would create difficulties with the european commission since the extension of the subsidy to non-assisted areas would be in conflict with Article 92 of the Treaty of rome,    The best chance of persuading the Commission to acquiesce would be to engage in consultation with them but thiswould stand in the way of an early announcement.    In the
absence of such consultations, there was a risk that theGovernments action to extend the scheme might be the subjectof litigation in the European Court.c, Work Creation schemeSome of the projects proposed by the Manpower services commission could be criticised as trivial and the commission should be asked to review their list.    This review should take account of the desirability of helping the urban programme.The Cabinet had previously agreed to the need to give priority to the inner city areas, and the sort of work which could beundertaken as part of the urban programme could easily be started and quickly wound up.    It might be possible, forexample, to put in hand various minor works for theimprovement of housing (for example the redecoration of old people&apos;s houses) and for improvements to educational and health Service buildings.    Local authorities and health service authorities could readily suggest a number ofimaginative schemes which would help sorely pressed staffin the field of the personal social services;  and wherever possible the projects should be linked with training schemes.It was arguable that, although the introduction of the scheme should not be held up, the Manpower Services commission should be asked to consider possible improvements to thescheme in case it became desirable later to extend it over aperiod of 18 months for the creation of up to 50, 000 jobs.Work Creation schemes were already in operation in NorthernIreland and any proposals agreed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment would need to be applied in Northern Ireland in such a way as to fitinto schemes already in operation.    In Scotland the localauthorities already had experience of winter work programmes which had been financed by way of a 100 per cent grant,Scottish local authorities were ready with a number of schemesfor house improvements if money became available.d. Advance factory and investment programmeAn extension of the advance factory programme would bothcreate industrial assets and have a beneficial short-termeffect on the construction industry.    Work could be put inhand fairly quickly.    Further expenditure on industrial investment schemes, although medium-term in effect, wasalso a sensible use of resources.
e0 &quot;Buy British&quot; campaignOther members of the European Economic Community had no hesitation in pressing public authorities whose expenditurethey controlled to favour domestic industries in theirpurchasing programmes, and the Government should pressindividuals and organisations to &quot;Buy British&quot; wherever possible,f. Encouragement of school-leavers to stay on at schoolIn view of the unfavourable employment prospects for school-leavers, young people about to leave school should be encouraged to stay on for further educational courses.    Thiswould entail some additional expenditure by local authorities,possibly of the order of a further  5 million on the rate support grant, but there would be an offset in unemploymentbenefit unclaimed,g. Selective increases in public expenditureThere was a strong case for approving a selective increase in public expenditure to assist the construction industry.    many local authorities had stopped all work on house improvements,and similar work on educational and Health Service buildinghad been severely curtailed by recent decisions on public expenditure.    The aim should be to create the maximum number of jobs as quickly as possible, and to ensure that anyschemes undertaken could be wound up quickly when the needfor them was past.    The Government should therefore approvean increase in public expenditure on housing, particularly inthe inner city areas, in such a way as to make the maximum number of new jobs available in the construction industry.Ministers would be able to suggest a number of possibleschemes for the consideration of the Chancellor of theExchequer,h. Overall strategyIt was argued that, while the present measures were welcome,it would be wrong to rely, as the Governments present policydid, on an upturn in world economic activity to provide the wayout of the country&apos;s current trouble.    There was little sign ofany such upturn at present:  and the United Kingdom&apos;sproblems were both different and worse than those of othercountries.    We needed a wall of protection behind which the modernisation of British industry could take place on the basisof a bigger investment programme than anything so far
contemplated.     The strategy should therefore be consideredanew after the statement on unemployment measures had beenmade.    Against this it was strongly argued that any such move to protectionist policies would be highly dangerous, and couldstart an international beggar-my-neighbour race.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a statement should be made by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on Wednesday 24 September announcing the measureswhich the Government proposed to take to mitigate the present high level of unemployment.    These measures would consist of thefollowing.    First, the payment of a recruitment subsidy of  5 per head per week for 26 weeks to employers taking on school-leavers whohad not previously obtained a job.    This was estimated to cost 5 miUion and would start from 20 October.    The statement would bein general terms, leaving details of the scheme to be announced later.The subsidy should extend to the nationalised industries, but not to thelocal authorities given the other financial restraints which theGovernment was seeking to impose on them.    Secondly, theexpenditure of  30 million on a Work Creation scheme.    While thescheme should be biased towards the use of young people it should notbe confined to them.    There had been some reservations about the list of projects put forward by the Manpower Services Commission intheir proposals, and the Commission should be urged to give priorityfrom the outset to projects which would assist in urban renewal,including minor housing improvements (eg painting) and minor improvements to educational and Health Service buildings.    TheCommission should also be encouraged to bear in mind the trainingneeds of the young people who would be engaged in many of the projects.    Thirdly, the three proposals by the TSA to the Secretaryof State for Employment to increase the adult training allowance at a cost of  2-1 million, to increase the lead which training allowance for young persons had over the corresponding rate of benefit at a cost of if million, and to expand existing training schemes and introducenew schemes mainly for the training of young persons at a cost of 20 million.    Details of the last two, however, had not been discussed at the official level with the Treasury, and the Cabinefs approval was subject to the satisfactory outcome of such discussions the following day.    Fourthly, the extension of the temporary employment subsidyscheme to cover the whole country at a cost of  71- million.    As a safe guard, to ensure that the subsidy was being applied as theGovernment intended, the Secretary of State for Employment and theChancellor of the Exchequer would review the operation of the scheme at an early date.    Fifthly, the improvement of the EmploymentTransfer Scheme at a cost of a further  3 million.    Sixthly, further work at a cost of  20 million on the building and modernisation of factories on Government and industrial estates, as part of the advancefactory programme.    Seventhly, a further  50 million under
section C of the Industry Act for the acceleration of capital projectsby individual firms and for further industry schemes.    Furthermore,Cabinet agreed that the  70 million for the last two items could beincreased to  100 million if suitable proposals could be identified.Finally, the Cabinet agreed that the statement should indicate that ministers were considering some selective increases in expenditureon construction in the public sector and that details of these increases would be given within the next two or three weeks.The statement would be drafted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment and would be cleared as necessary with the other Ministers concerned.    Therewould be no time to consult the European Commission about theGovernment1 s decision to extend the temporary employment subsidy to the whole country.    The Commission should however be informed of the Governments decision just before it was made public;  and itshould be stressed to them that the payment of the subsidy on anationwide basis was a temporary measure, that it took account of present reality, viz the high level of unemployment outside the assisted areas, and that its operation would be reviewed very quickly.    The European Community were already well disposed towards the Governments recent handling of economic affairs, andthe Commission might be persuaded that the present temporary measure was much less objectionable than some other steps whichmight have been forced on the Government.The proposal by the Secretary of State for Employment thatencouragement should be given to organisations and individuals to&quot;Buy British&quot; would be considered later in the context of proposalswhich the Secretary of State for Trade had yet to submit to hiscolleagues.    The exhortation to &quot;Buy British&quot; was of particularrelevance to organisations in the public sector.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment,to draft and clear with the other Ministers concerned the terms of an announcement to be made onWednesday 24 September describing the measureswhich the Cabinet had approved.
3. Invited the Secretary of State for employment to arrange for the introduction of a scheme, at an estimated cost of  5 million, for paying a recruitmentsubsidy of   5 per head per week to employers in theprivate sector and to the nationalised industries takingon school-leavers who had not previously beenemployed.4, Agreed that the Work Creation scheme proposedby the Manpower Services Commission should be implemented at a cost of  30 million; but that theSecretary of State for Employment should press theCommission to give priority to projects which would assist urban renewal, including minor improvements to housing and health and education buildings, and tokeep in mind the training needs of the young peopleinvolved.5. Agreed that the proposals by the TrainingServices Agency for increasing training allowances and expanding training schemes should be implemented at an estimated cost of  24 million,6. Agreed that the temporary employmentsubsidy should be extended to the whole country atan estimated additional cost of  7^ million;  and invited the Secretary of State for Employment andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to review theoperation of the scheme at an early date.7. Agreed that the Employment Transfer scheme should be improved at a cost of  3 million.C. Agreed that up to a further  100 million should be spent on the advance factory programme and on industrial investment schemes.9. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Ministers principally concerned,to consider what selective increases in construction inthe public sector should be approved.10.        Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, having regard to what thePrime Minister had said in his summing up, to arrangefor the European Commission to be informed of theGovernments decision to extend the temporaryemployment subsidy to cover the whole country.Cabinet Office23 September 1975
