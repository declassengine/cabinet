OREIGN 1. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD^FFAIRS said that harassment by Icelandic gunboats was preventing British trawlers fishing off Iceland.    On Sunday the skippers had sent aHgjand message saying that they would withdraw from the fishing grounds bythe following day unless a decision were taken that they would be,previous given Royal Navy protection.    Our objective rmist be to continueReference: fishing on the grounds off Iceland: there was nowhere else for ourCC(75) 49th trawlers to go and thousands of jobs were at stake.    Together with conclusions, Ministers from the other Departments concerned, he had discussedMinute 2 the position with representatives of the fishing industry the previous day.    The discussion, which he had reported to the Prime Minister,had established that naval protection was essential to keep thetrawlers on the fishing grounds and that the catch with such protectionwould exceed the amount likely to be allowed under any agreementwith Iceland.    In consequence arrangements were being made forHMS Leopard to enter the fishing grounds that day to assume controlof the civilian support vessels and to organise operations.    Furthernaval vessels would be ready to enter the area on 29 November.    Anannouncement was being made that morning.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs, Mr Hattersley, said that we were continuing to make clear to the Icelanders our wish to reach a settlement and our willingness to be flexible.    He had given a personal assurance to that effect tothe Icelandic Ambassador that morning.    The introduction of naval vessels would reduce marginally the chances of negotiations, but theattitude of the Icelandic Government had in any case been obdurate.On his instructions Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had asked the[Icelandic Prime Minister on Sunday whether the Icelandic attitude would change as a result of the message from the trawler skippers.His answer had been that the Icelandic offer of 65, 000 tons was oursto take or leave.    The only way to persuade the Icelanders to returnto the conference table during the next six months was to demonstrateIthat with naval protection our trawler fleet could take more fish thanthey would if an agreement were reached.     It was, however,important to observe the needs of conservation of fish stocks, andIsuitable arrangements to protect the breeding grounds were beingworked out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food withthe fishing industry.    It must be recognised that the month aheadwould be a difficult one, in which the Icelanders would make everyeffort to carry conviction through the media that our behaviour wasboth unreasonable and unlawful.    Although this was the reverse of the truth, some would believe it.In discussion it was noted that HMS Falmouth, HMS Brighton and a royal Fleet Auxiliary would join HMS Leopard off Iceland on29 November.    Sorties by Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft would alsobe flown.    Rules of Engagement would be issued later that day.    They
would permit Royal Navy ships to deter and frustrate harassment byIcelandic vessels.    They would not permit the firing of weaponsexcept in self-defence.    Permission to open fire would be specifically sought from Ministers,    in the absence of theirSecretaries of State the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, Mr Hattersley, and the Minister of State,Ministry of Defence, would be added to the group of Ministers to be consulted in those circumstances.In further discussion it was noted that no fisheries agreement had yetbeen concluded between the Icelandic Government and the federal german Government.    A proportionately much larger catch figure had been offered by Iceland to the Federal Republic of Germany than to us because the fish they wished to catch was not cod.    But it was by no means certain that the provisional agreement on this basisbetween the Icelandic and German Governments would be ratified bythe Althing.    In discussion of the presentation of our case it was argued that full weight should be given to the ruling of the Inter-national Court of Justice in July 1974 that Iceland was not entitledunilaterally to exclude British trawlers from waters outside her12-mile limit: but the balance of advantage was against requestingthe International Court of Justice to impose any formal restraint onthe action at present being taken by the Icelanders against our vessels.It was suggested that the reduced Icelandic catch of cod providedevidence of stock depletion;  on the other hand, much of this reduction was due to Icelandic trawlers being engaged in industrial disputes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the arrangements that had been made to provide protection by the Royal Navy for our trawlers.    In replying to questions already put down for Answer in the House of Commons later that day and in other public statements we should be prepared to setout our case fully and to give proper emphasis to the rnling of theInternational Court of Justice.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2, The Cabinefs discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.Cabinet Office25 November 1975
SE GRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF PIER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCHRYSLERLTDPreviousReference:CC(75) 47thConclusions,Minute 3Support forChryslerBK) LtdCOPY NO     ^  cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 50th Conclusions, Minute tuesday 25 November 1975 at 11.30 am the Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of State for industry (C(75) 128), the Secretary of State for Scotland (C(75) 129),the Secretary of State for Employment (C(75) 130) and the Secretaryof State for Trade (C(75) 131) about the future of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY paid that throughoutthe year there had been growing doubts about Chrysler&apos;s financialposition.    They had made losses in six of the previous nine years:their losses for the current year would be about  40 million, with theprospect of a similar loss next years    His predecessor had asked theChairman of Chrysler Corporation to keep him informed about thecompany&apos;s plans.    In July the company had discussed the possibilityof financial assistance with his Department and had alsc been in negotiation with Finance for Industry,    These discussions had beenterminated by Chrysler.    The present crisis had been created by a press conference given by the Chairman of the Chrysler corporation in the United States on 30 October in which he had hinted at the Group&apos;spossible withdrawal from the United Kingdom.    At a meeting with thePrime Minister on 3 November the Chairman of the Corporation had said that unless the British Government took over responsibility forall its future losses from the end of November Chrysler (UK)Ltd wouldbe rapidly run down from that date and wound up in a short period.He had considered a range of possible actions.    The first was to takeover Chrysler (UK)Ltd as a going concern.    This would cost 100- 140 million up to 1979 and would result in 6, 000 redundancies.The second was a proposal put forward by the Chrysler Corporationwhich would preserve some 15, 000 jobs out of the company&apos;s totalemployment of 25, 000, including 4, 000 at Linwood.    This would
involve closing the plant at Ryton (Coventry) and the movement ofAvenger assembly from there to Linwood.    The cost would be 80-E100 million.    The third option, which the Ministerial Group onthe Automobile Industry had asked to have examined, was to concentrate all the continuing activities of Chrysler (UK)Ltd at Linwood.This would result in 19, 000 redundancies and would cost  80 million.The last option for keeping part of Chrysler (UK)Ltd in operation would be to support the continuation of production at Stoke to meet their Iranian contract.    This would cost  32 million and 235 000would be redundant.    His reluctant conclusion was that none of these courses could be justified and that the Government must tell Chryslerthat they were not willing to take over the firmss responsibilities.The Ministerial Group had invited him to ask Chrysler if they would beprepared to make a financial contribution to the future operation of theUnited Kingdom company on a continuing basis.    The company had replied that they would be prepared to consider the possibility of a contribution towards a production scheme which made commercial andindustrial good sense, but that it would be a fixed amount determined in advance and they would not be prepared to increase the amount iflosses proved to be larger than presently forecast.    He regarded their letter as being designed to enable them to transfer to the Governmentthe future responsibility   for the company by agreeing to make a payment which was small in relation to their savings in redundancy payments and other closure costs.    He did not believe that there organisation scheme proposed by Chrysler would in practice beviable - if it had prospects of viability they would have been preparedto share in its profits or losses on a continuing basis.   Only one member of the Industrial Development Advisory Board thought that the chrysler option could be viable.    If assistance were given to Chryslerit would be difficult to refuse assistance also to Vauxhall and thesubsidy of their competitors would cause damage to Ford and british leyland as well.    The report by the Central Policy Review Staffwhich was to be published made clear that there was excess capacity in the industry, while the Trade and Industry Sub-Committee of theSelect Committee on Expenditure had severely criticised theGovernments support of British Leyland.    The National EnterpriseBoard did not wish to take on this responsibility nor was it LabourParty policy to encumber the Board with unprofitable companies with no reasonable prospect of viability.    Against this background he couldnot justify the preservation of Chrysler (UK)Ltd.    He reluctantlyconcluded that the right course was for the Government to spend money on a redundancy scheme to mitigate the consequences of Chrysler&apos;sclosure, and to impose temporary import restrictions until other british producers could meet the former Chrysler share of theBritish market.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he would regard it as indefensible if the Government did not explore all the options that were open to them.    The economic consequences of closure would be extremely grave j the balance of payments costs would be  130- 200 million, while the effect on unemployment wouldbe very serious, particularly in Scotland, bearing in mind the other employment prospects there.    The political consequences would alsobe of the utmost gravity.    Closure of the only section of the motorcarindustry in Scotland would be fatal for the Governments policy for devolution which involved economic and industry matters continuing to be decided from Westminster.    The conditions contained inChrysler&apos;s letter setting out the basis on which they would make a financial contribution to the continued operation of their UnitedKingdom business were not incompatible with the scheme in his memorandum.    Having received this reply it was imperative that theGovernment followed it up with detailed negotiations.    If they did nottheir position would be indefensible.     The analysis in his papersuggested that the cost to the Government of a scheme based on the chrysler proposal would be  71 million but the balance of paymentsgains and the saving of redundancy payments and unemploymentbenefit needed to be set against this cost.    Nor did he accept that thefuture prospects for a reorganised company would be as poor as someanalyses had suggested.    The report by the Central Policy review staff had not been discussed by the Cabinet or accepted as theGovernments view.    Recent reports suggested that the marketprospects for 1976 were already better than suggested in forecastsmade only a few months ago.    A closure decision of such momentousconsequence should not be taken on the basis of such uncertainprojections.    He agreed that a scheme for concentration at Linwoodalone was not viable and he would not argue for acceptance in andvance for whatever terms might be put forward by Chrysler in negotiation.He did however believe it imperative that negotiations should becarried forward to see what could be achieved.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be wise, evenif only for tactical reasons, to seek further negotiations with the chrysler Corporation on the basis of their letter.    The latestChrysler approach might prove to be no more than a propagandaexercise since the limited basis on which they appeared willing tocontribute finance seemed incompatible with whole-hearted support for a continuing operation.    Nevertheless the political and social consequences of a closure of this magnitude were so severe that everyeffort should be made to explore all reasonable alternatives.In this context it was argued that the piecemeal closure of sections ofthe country!s industrial base would eventually result in irrecoverabledamage to the national economy.    On the other hand it was pointedout that the amount of finance available for supporting British
industry was limited and that help given to totally unprofitableoperations like Chrysler would damage the prospects of helping more promising parts of British industry.    The country was in a mood toaccept severe measures, as the response to recent government decisions on health charges and rate support grant had shown.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that no final decision could be taken without further negotiations with the Chrysler Corporation to elucidatethe meaning of their latest letter.    It was doubtful whether such negotiations would prove fruitful.    Nevertheless the chrysler corporation^ offer to participate in future operations gave them at least a strong presentational advantage and it would be necessaryto explore how sincere this offer really was.    The Secretary of Statefor Industry should therefore pursue negotiations with the Chairmanof Chrysler Corporation on the basis that while the Corporation werenot willing to finance continuing losses neither were the Government.Equally so the Chrysler Corporation had said they were prepared toput some new money into the business:  so was the Government.    we need not necessarily insist on more than a 20 per cent Chryslershareholding but there must be an equitable sharing of the risks andany losses arising from continuing operations.    The negotiations should therefore explore what future plans could be viable, andshould review what provision could be made for new models and how the future financial burden might be shared.    To facilitate these negotiations and to demonstrate their good faith Chrysler should beasked to extend by one month their previous deadline for the start ofthe rundown of their United Kingdom company.    If they would not extend the deadline it would be clear that their offer was in bad faith and that they were not interested in serious negotiations.    TheSecretary of State should report the results of these further negotiations to the Cabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto resume negotiations with the Chrysler corporation on the basis indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that his memorandum outlined a scheme  or supplementary redundancy payments which had been drawn up on the assumption of a completeclosure by Chrysler (UK) Ltd.It envisaged that a scheme might involve expenditure of  30 million and that the details of the arrangements should be discussed with theunions concerned.    It would be confined to direct employees of Chrysler (UK)Ltd and would not cover those who were made redundantby components suppliers as a consequence of Chrysler S closure.In a brief discussion it was suggested that firm decisions should notbe taken on the amount to be paid out under the scheme if it were to beintroduced until decisions had been reached on the way the money wasco be spent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that no decisions would be taken on this scheme pending the outcome of thefurther negotiations with the Chrysler Corporation.The Cabinet -3. Took notes with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he proposed thatin the event of a complete or substantial closure by Chrysler (UK)Ltdquota restrictions should be imposed on motorcar imports from all sources.    The longer the restrictions could be maintained the more effective the scheme would be in view of the fact that there were substantial stocks of imported cars already in the country and very low stocks of home-produced cars.    He proposed that quotas shouldbe calculated in relation to a base period of spring 1974 to spring 1975because the industry had been in general difficulties since then.    Theannual quota would be split into two six-month periods with only 40 percent of the quota being allowed to be imported in the first half-year.The restrictions would cover cars of a size up to 2200cc and would not include commercial vehicles.    Informal approaches had already beenmade to the responsible European Commissioner,M Gundelach,    The latter had indicated that he would support theGovernments proposal if it were put formally to the Commission, but would press for some alterations to be made to it,.    These would bethe limitation of the duration to less than two years, perhaps to oneyear to be followed by a review, and a change in the base period.This latter change would increase the quota by 20, 000 cars per annum.
In a brief discussion theie was general agreement that it would be inadvisable to seek the formal agreement of the European Commissionto the imposition of import restrictions before Chrysler&apos;s position hadbeen further clarified.    Discussion on a contingent basis might beless favourable to the Governments interest than delay until it was clear whether the closure of Chrysler would go ahead,, and might havea prejudicial effect on the Commission^ consideration of other proposals for import restrictions which might be put forward.    Therewas however support for the view that if in the end restrictions wereto be imposed an initial period of one year with provision for a reviewthereafter would be sufficiently long to justify introduction of thescheme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the:    discussion,said that the Cabinet were agreed that no further action should betaken to secure the agreement of the Commission of the european economic Community to the introduction of import restrictions onmotorcars until the willingness of the Chrysler Corporation toprovide continuing financial support for the maintenance of part of theoperations of Chrysler (UK) Ltd had been clarified.The Cabinet -4. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion,Cabinet Office26 November 1975
