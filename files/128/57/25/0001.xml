PARLIAMENTARY 1.AFFAIRSpublicEXPENDITUREPreviousReference:CC(75) 54thConclusionsThe Cabinet were informed of the business tc- be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    It was proposed *hatthe House should adjourn for the Christmas P.recess on 19 december and resume on 12 January 1976.It was proposed that 16 December should be a Supply Day devoted toa debate on the motor vehicle industry, during which theGovernments decision on Chrysler would no doubt be one of the main issues.    On 17 December there would be a debate, arising on a motion for the adjournment, about unemployment and the governments proposals for coxuitering it.    Preparations for these major debateswould involve considerable timetable difficulties.    As regardsChrysler, thete had been recent developments which would have to beconsidered urgently by the Ministerial Group before a report could bemade to the Cabinet and discussed by them.    The aim would be toreach decisions within the next day or so.    After that, it wouldbecome possible to turn to the question of import controls, with the objective of reaching conclusions and completing the necessary consultations with the European Economic Community in time forfirm decisions to be announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inthe debate on 17 December.    This was a matter on which there was much anxiety amongst the Governments backbench supporters; but itwas unlikely that decisions could be taken in time for a separateannouncement to be made in advance of the debate on 17 December.2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of public expenditure. The discussion and conclusions reached are recorded separately. ,Cabinet Office11 December 1975
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government copy NO    , -CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cc(75) 55th Conclusions;, Minute 2Thursday 11 December 1975 at 9,30 am the Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(75) 137) and the memorandum by theCentral Policy Review Staff (C(75) 143) on public expenditure to1979-80oPUBLICEXPENDITUREPreviousReference:CC(75) 54thConclusionsEducation In discussion it was argued that the Treasury proposal of an additionalcut of  124 million was unreasonable.    The whole of the &quot;formulacuts&quot; applicable to this programme had been accepted; and in the caseof the Education programme the formula applied to virtually the wholeof the expenditure, which was not true of all other programmes.Against this it was argued that Education expenditure would be risingsteeply between 1970-71 and 1978-79, even after making the proposedadditional cut, in spite of the fact that demographic considerationspointed in the opposite direction.    There should be scope for cuttingat least  100 million without touching basic educational needs.Expenditure on evening classes of peripheral importance and the costof educating overseas students who could well afford to bear a farlarger part of the cost themselves were two areas where savingsmight be made.    Reference was made to the inefficient use to whichexpensive capital facilities in universities were put as a result of theundesirably short teaching terms, a waste which was compounded whenthe students drew social security benefit during the long vacations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat particular concern had been expressed at the burden on theBritish taxpayer of subsidising well-to-do overseas students.    It was accepted, however, that since universities were independentinstitutions, it would take time to obtain the degree of consent needed
to bring about a substantial increase in the charges made, but it was thought that this could be achieved by 1978.    In the meantime while itwould be unwise to announce a specific saving in the White Paper fromthis source, a saving of  25 million should be scored.    A further 25 million saving - preferably without affecting expenditure on the open University - could be made on the Education programmegenerally, making a total of  50 million.    The Secretary of State for education and Science had indicated that he would be willing within this total to find the Welsh and Scottish share by savings on the expenditure under his control,The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.In the bilateral discussions, it had been agreed that the expenditure under the control of the Department of the Environment (Roads andTransport, Housing and Other Environmental Services) should bereduced by the full extent of the &quot;formula cuts&quot; and a further 400 million over and above that.,    The additional reductions nowproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury., were:   150- 200 millionoff roads;    200 million off local authority mortgage lending(switching it to the Building Societies);  and  100 million off housing expenditure (improvement grants, increased sales of council houses and the adoption of a more realistic estimate of the number of localauthority houses likely to be started).   It was suggested that it mightbe possible to persuade the Building Societies to undertake theadditional lending if the Government were prepared to guarantee themortgages.    Although large cuts had been agreed in the expenditureof the Department of the Environment (which, with 17 per cent of theexpenditure under review, had provided 38 per cent of the cutsagreed) this was not of itself a reason for not cutting further, sincethe Cabinet had agreed at an earlier meeting that it would be important to select priorities rather than to rely upon across-the-board cuts.    There was no special virtue in equality of misery, andit could well be argued that expenditure on eg roads ranked a gooddeal lower in Labour Party priorities than some other socialexpenditure.    Against this it was argued that  250 million hadalready been taken off the roads expenditure shown in the last white paper on Public Expenditure.    On housing, it had to be rememberedthat there had already been a large reduction in local authoritylending; that the question of municipalisation needed to be considered at the same time;  and that the proposed reduction in lending wouldmean that the local authorities would be lending less than they wouldse :ret
ibe receiving in repayments.    Furthermore, if the Building Societylending were increased, the Cabinet had already been told that thiswould make more difficult the problems of financing the public sectorborrowing requirement, because the Building Societies would moveout of gilt-edged securities to the extent that they undertookadditional lending. ,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the general feeling in the Cabinet was that there should be afurther reduction of  225 million in this expenditure.    It would be forthe Ministers concerned to decide how these reductions should bemade, in consultation with the Treasury, but they might lookparticularly at Roads expenditure, and, in the Housing field, atimprovement grants, local authority mortgage lending and sales of council houses: there might be scope for an even greater overallsaving depending on the degree to which local authority mortgagelending could be reduced.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.Civil In discussion it was suggested that there should be scope for a service reduction in the staff of Departments, which wereManpower overmanned.    It was pointed out that in four major Departments -Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, Department of Health and social Security and Department of the Environment - there had been anincrease of 22,000 in staff up to October 1975, and a further increaseof 23,000 was planned up to 1978.    It was, however, recognised that much of this increase was the direct result of new policies.    Since theGovernment took office they had created some 40, 000 Civil Serviceposts, and in the next 18 months the legislation in prospect wouldrequire a further 40, 000.    To offset this, Departments would need tobe more co-operative than they were at present in cutting their numbers as a result of staff inspections and similar operations.    one possibility would be for Departments to be less stringent, and lessperfectionist, in the execution of Government policies; it would haveto be accepted that the public would get a rougher measure of justicethan at present and that Ministers would have to defend this whenquestioned in Parliament.    It was also suggested that some 3,000staff could be saved by the abolition of the Vehicle Excise Duty (thepresent yield from which could be replaced by an increase on the tax on petrol), although it was recognised that this might have undesirableside effects on the pattern of demand for cars.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,  saidthat there was general agreement that there was scope for a majorexercise to bring about a reduction in the forecast level of CivilService numbers.    The Cabinet recognised that new policydevelopments created additional posts, and policy changes in the pipeline or in prospect might need to be reconsidered in this light;but the main weight of the exercise should be directed towards cuttingout existing but unnecessary policies and practices as well as toachieving increased efficiency.    The aims should be to achieve areduction of 5 per cent in the forecast number of civil servants in1978-79, a reduction which vyculd secure savings of some  140 million.The Lord Privy Seal should pursue this urgently.The Cabinet -3. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisterJs summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet was reminded that at their last meeting the chief secretary, Treasury^ and the Secretary of State for Social services had been invited to consider bilaterally the least damaging way of saving  100 million on the Health and Personal Social Servicesprogramme.    The two Ministers had not been able to agree upon a recommendation to put before the Cabinet.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, still recommended an additional saving of  100 million,obtained by restricting the growth of current expenditure on health services (hospitals, community health services and other centralhealth services excluding only the family practitioner services) to1 per cent a year, allowing current expenditure on personal social services to grow by 2 per cent a year from its 1976-77 level, andapplying the full &quot;formula cuts&quot; to the capital expenditure on each service.    The Secretary of State for Social Services, however,considered that current expenditure on the Health services should beallowed to increase by not less than \\ per cent (of which 1 per centwas attributable to demographic factors, and the other \ per cent tothe need to cope with the rising costs of modern treatment and theequipping of new buildings as they came into commission).    It wouldbe impossible to hold the growth down to 1 per cent, and if such a cutwere imposed the capital programme would have to be reduced belowthe level of the &quot;formula cuts&quot;.    This would be totally unacceptableand would in fact mean a moratorium on all new hospital building.The hospital capital programme already faced great difficulties incoping with the expenditure entailed in meeting higher fire precautionstandards; and there was the further difficulty that failure to continue with the building programme would lead directly to increasedmaintenance costs on older buildings.
It was pointed out that it would no longer be practicable to pass a Billto reverse the decision of Parliament earlier in the year on the changein the earnings rule due to come into effect in April 1976,    However,there was a further change due to come into effect in April 1977, andit was felt that there would be merit, in the present conditions of severe restraint on public expenditure, in trying to obtain passage ofa Bill which would avoid that later increase.    The savings would be agood deal less than would have been achieved by a quick Bill, but theywould be worth  18 million in 1978-79.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Secretary of State for Social Services had indicated herwillingness to achieve additional cuvs of  22 million by a standstill on capital expenditure on personal social services.    If, in addition,, anattempt were made to pass a Bill revoking, from April 1977, thechange in the earnings rule which had been made earlier in the year,this would produce savings of  18 million in 1978-79, making 40 million in all.    The general feeling in the Cabinet was that the saving on these programmes (in addition to the  308 million on social security which had been provisionally agreed at the previous meeting)should be not less than  60 million, although it was recognised that 18 million of this was dependent on the passage of the earnings rulelegislation.The Cabinet -4, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.Food In discussion it was suggested that larger reductions in food subsidiesSubsidies than the  50 million already agreed for 1978-79 might be acceptable,since the main function of food subsidies up to the end of 1977 would beto negate the effect of having to harmonise United Kingdom food prices with Common Market prices, a transitional difficulty which finishedat the end of 1977.    Furthermore, it could be argued that food subsidies were primarily an insurance against inflation, and that ifthe Government successfully reined back the rate of inflation, theneed for the subsidies would disappear.    Against this it was argued that account needed to be taken of the fact that the wage round year,which ran from August to July, did not correspond with the financialyear, and therefore that any cut in food subsidies in 1978-79 shouldtake account of the need to retain some subsidies during the period april-July 1978 as part of the bargain which might need to be struckwith trades unions on a third round of pay policy; food subsidiesbeing something to which the unions attached great importance.
THE PRIME MINISTER-  summing up this part of the discussion,  saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the provision for food subsidies in .1978-79should be cut by  75 million instead of the  50 million agreed at their previous meeting.    This took account of the point made on thedifference between the financial and the wage round year;  and further-more it was accepted that, for similar reasons, it would not in thisparticular programme be acceptable to make consequentialreductions in 1977-78.The Cabinet -5. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMj.nister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet was reminded that at the last meeting the Secretary ofState for Defence had been invited to prepare a paper setting out theconsequences of a total cut of  275 million (which would include the 100 million already agreed) in Defence expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that ithad not yet been possible for the Secretary of State for Defence to circulate the paper which had been requested.    For the moment theadditional saving of  175 million should be scored;  but the Secretaryof State for Defences position was that he did not at this stage acceptall these savings and would first wish to set out for his colleagues theindustrial, military, political and international consequences.    Heshould bring the paper forward as soon as possible.    His aim shouldbe to take these savings on equipment, manpower and research anddevelopment, but if it could be shown that savings of this order would impair the critical level of our contribution to the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) or would jeopardise our obligations under the Brussels Treaty, it would be necessary for the Cabinet toconsider the matter further.The Cabinet -6. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that there should be no reduction in the provisionfor overseas aid,The Cabinet -7, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwas agreed that there would be no disclosure of details of the agreedreductions until the full White Paper on Public Expenditure wasrmbiished, probably in February,    In the meantime, it would be essential to avoid leaks about any part of them.The Cabinet -8, Took note, with approvah of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that attheir meeting on 13 November the Cabinet had agreed that public expenditure in 1978-79 should be cut by  3, 750 million.    The bilateral discussions between the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the individualspending Ministers had resulted in agreed reductions of  2^600 million,leaving a furthei  1,150 million to find.    Because it was not considered possible to pass a quick Bill to reverse the decision theHouse of Commons had taken earlier in the year oathe earnings rule, 55 million of the  2, 600 million was lost, so that the totaladditional savings which they needed to find was  1,205 million: thisassumed that there would be no addition to 1978-79 expenditure for theNational Enterprise Board.    It had been agreed, subject to a caveatwhich he would make later on Defence, that savings should be foundas follows:\
ProgrammeCut in 1978-79 (  million at 1975 Survey prices)Food subsidiesHealth and personal social services social securityDefenceEducationE-avironmentCivil Service manpower7560308,075/50225140Total1, 033The total was  172 million below the target, but the Chancellor of theExchequer was prepared to accept this shortfall.    Of the 60 million savings on Health and Personal Social Services,  18 million was contingent upon the passing of a Bill to amend thepresent earnings rule from April 1977, and it was recognised that parliament might reject this.    The full saving of  175 million on defence was not yet accepted by the Secretary of State for Defence,who would put a paper to Cabinet as soon as possible on the industrial,political, military and international implications of a cut of this magnitude.    It had been agreed at the meeting on 9 December that theDefence cuts should be made in such a way as to ensure that expenditure on NATO would not fall below the critical level and that united Kingdom obligations under the Brussels Treaty would be met;and if the Secretary of State for Defence could demonstrate that,even taking the maximum possible cuts on manpower, equipment and research and development, it was impossible to avoid encroaching onthe NATO and Brussels Treaty expenditures, then Cabinet would need to consider the matter further.    The saving of  140 million on CivilService manpower was to be achieved by a cut of 5 per cent in the staff numbers forecast for 1978-79.    The Lord Privy Seal should pursue this particular saving very urgently, and in doing so should layemphasis on the need to examine old policies, procedures and practices which had not perhaps been questioned for a long time.    Theother savings which had been agreed might themselves in part consistof manpower cuts, but there should be no double counting, and the 140 million scored as a saving on Civil Service manpower should be additional to all other savings.The Cabinet having settled the reductions to be made on the main programme, with the reservations he had noted, it would be for theTreasury to pursue bilaterally with the spending Departments thefurther contributions which might be made by the lesser programmes,and the consequential savings which would be needed in allprogrammes in 1977-78 and 1979-80.    Much of the difficultyexperienced in the conduct of the present exercise stemmed, not simply from the need to take decisions so far in advance (which
would continue to be necessary), but from the existing requirement to publish a great deal of detail in the annual &quot;White Paper; and theCabinet took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would considerwhether in fact it was necessary to continue to do this.    The cabinet also considered that present procedures were not well adapted to bringing out at an early stage possible policy changes, such asreductions in Civil Service manpower or the more intensive use of university capital facilities, which would take time to fructify.    Hewould arrange for the Secretary of the Cabinet to consult with the spending Departments on the way in which matters of this kind,needing to be considered in the long term, could be identified,The Cabinet -9, Took notef with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.10c        Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inthe light of the decisions reached, to agree the detailed expenditure figures for the years up to and including 1979-80 with the spending departments for the purposes of the next Public expenditure white Paper.11. Invited the Chief Secretary,, Treasury, todiscuss bilaterally with the Ministers responsiblefor smaller programmes any further contributionthey might make to the savings.12.        Invited the Secretary of State for Defence tosubmit a further paper on the proposed additionalcuts of  175 minion in the Defence budget.13,        Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider urgently the steps needed to bring about a reductionin Civil Service manpower in 1978-79of 5 per cent below the forecast level.14.        Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet toarrange, in consultation with the spendingDepartments, ways of identifying potential policy changes which would only come to fruition in the longer term.Cabinet Office
