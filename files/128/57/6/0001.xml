confidential. THE PRIME MINISTER said that a meeting of the cabinet was not planned for Thursday, 17 July when he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary were due to attend a meeting of theEuropean Council in Brussels.    A meeting of the Cabinet was atpresent planned for Friday 18 July to consider the draft statement on public expenditure which, as the Cabinet had agreed at their last meeting, was being prepared by a group of Ministers underthe chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    If however the group could reach agreement on the draft it would be sufficientto circulate it to the Cabinet for information and a meeting wouldbe unnecessary.PARLIAMENTARY  2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken iniFFAIRS the House of Commons during the following week.    It was hopedthat it would be possible to combine the Second Reading of the remuneration, Charges and Grants Bill with the debate on a motion to approve the White Paper &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; and tocomplete all the Bill&apos;s remaining stages in the House of commons on 23 July.    The Paymaster General would co-ordinate thearrangements for handling the Bill on that day;  but it would be convenient, where there were provisions for which a departmental Minister was directly responsible - as was the casein relation, for example, to prices and to local authority finance -for that Minister to handle the relevant clause.    It was important that the Bill should be completed on that day if at all possible;otherwise - even with Parliament sitting until 8 August, as wouldprobably be necessary - it would not be possible to complete the petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Bill, the Community Land bill and the Employment Protection Bill in time for all of them toreceive their Second Reading in the House of Lords before the recess,    The timetable proposed for the Remuneration, charges and Grants Bill depended on its being published on the following day.The draft Bill had been discussed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment and was about to be circulated to members of the Cabinet.    Any comments must therefore be made very urgently.The Bill giving the Government reserve powers to control pay wouldnot be introduced before or during the economic debates during thefollowing week.    Publication should if possible be deferred until after the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress inSeptember.    Its text should, however, be agreed by ministers collectively as soon as possible on a contingent basis and withoutprejudice to a decision on publication or introduction.[abinetIuSINESS;reviousinference:;C(75) 35thinclusions1
s:y OF 3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the handling of the IviBERS OF report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) about the pay andARLIAMENT allowances of Members of Parliament.previous reference:C(75) 32nd^elusions,minute 3THE PRIME MINISTER said that at their previous discussion on July the Cabinet had agreed that Parliament should be told that theTSRB report would be published early in the week beginning 14 july and that there would be a Government statement at the same time.It was the intention that this statement would indicate that theGovernment accepted in full the recommendation on the increase inallowances to Members of Parliament; but that in presentcircumstances it was out of the question to accept in full the TSRBrecommendations for the increase in Members&apos; salaries.    He had asked the Lord Privy Seal to calculate how the salaries of members would have moved between the date of their last increase (l January1972) and 1 January 1975 on two bases:  the first, applying acompound increase of 10 per cent per annum which produced a figureof  5, 990 as at 1 January 1975;  or if it were decided to apply theincrease from the date on which the TSRB report was received(13 June 1975), a figure of  6,270: the second, adjusting the existingsalary to allow for the increases which Members of Parliament mighthave received under Stages 2 and 3 of the statutory provisions of theprevious Administration, together with an increase in the retail price Index under the social contract provisions;  this yielded a figure of  6, 075 from 1 January 1975, or  6, 630 from 13 June 1975.In discussion of the amount of the increase in salary which should bepaid to Members following the recommendations of the TSRB, it was argued that a decision to give Members an additional  1, 500 as hadbeen suggested at the last Cabinet discussion would be unacceptable to public opinion in present circumstances, coming so soon after theGovernments recently announced counter-inflation policy which laidit down that no-one earning under  8, 500 a year was to receive anincrease greater than  6 per week.    It could be argued that Membersof Parliament were entitled to receive an increase which would atleast permit them to catch up with the rise in the cost of living since their last increase, but there would be great resentment in thecountry if Members were given a rise of roughly  30 per week.    TheGovernment were already proposing that the TSRB recommendations on the payment of allowances should be accepted in full, and thiswould give a typical Member  2, 000 per year extra, which was asubstantial relief, even although much of this was intended to cover the cost of secretarial assistance.    In so far as the increase in salary was intended to be retrospective, some account would need tobe taken of the rise in the cost of living since the time of the lastincrease, but it would be better to choose a figure which, evenalthough it might be arbitrary, would be politically acceptable in thepresent climate.    On this basis, an increase of  1,000 a year might
be justified, even although it bore only a crude relationship to themovement in the cost of living since the date of the last increase paidto Members.On the other hand, the feelings of Members of Parliament were running high on the question of their pay, as they had made clear tothe Prime Minister when they met him on 2 July.    Although there wasa high degree of understanding and sympathy with the Government overthe new pay policy, backbench Members increasingly devotedthemselves full-time to their work and therefore depended entirely ontheir Parliamentary salaries to support themselves and their families.Since their last increase in January 1972, everyone else had receiveda rise in pay which was related to the increase in the cost of living,and the least that Members should expect was to be given the minimumincreases to which they might have been entitled under the formerAdministration&apos;s statutory pay policy and, since July 1974, under thesocial contract.    If they received this minimum entitlement it would increase their salary roughly by  1,500.    This was  2, 000 less thanthe increase recommended by the TSRJ3 so that it could be said that members would be renouncing a substantial part of an increase towhich they were entitled under the award of a review body.    the session that was now coming to a close had been a very arduous one,and Members had been required to work long hours in Parliament andthey could not be relied upon to do so without protest if what they regarded as their legitimate right to an increase in salary were to beset aside.In further discussion the following points were made -a. If the Government was now to restrict the payment of increases to those earning under  8, 500 a year to a flat rateof  6 a week, there was something to be said for applyingsuch a flat rate to any increase paid to Members of Parliament.It might be possible to do this by calculating the increase towhich Members were entitled under existing pay policies up to1 January 1975, and awarding the equivalent of a  6 flat ratewith effect from that date.    There was however the risk thatif a flat rate of increase of  6 a week was awarded, this wouldbe seen by everyone else who claimed an increase as the riseto which they were entitled and not the upper limit within whichpay negotiation was to take place.    In general, it would be prudent not to relate the final increase in salary to anyprecise calculation, lest this should prove an embarrasment in any subsequent review of Members1 salaries.b. The manner in which the Governments decision was presented would have a decisive effect on the way in which itwas received by the public,,    The announcement should start
by referring to the full increase in salary recommended by theTSRB and go on to point out that in view of the exceptional circumstances through which the country was passing,Parliament had agreed that its Members should renounce asubstantial part of the increase recommended by the review body; but there should be no suggestion that the Governmentendorsed the recommendations.    The rise in the cost ofliving since the date of the previous increase should then be mentioned;  and the statement should go on to say that theincrease now being awarded to Members of Parliament amountedto considerably less than half of the increase that would havebeen necessary to keep the value of their salaries in step withthe cost of living.    Members of Parliament would therefore continue to accept a decrease in the real value of their remuneration.c. The suggestion that the pay of Members of parliament should be linked with one of the grades either in the CivilService or in the Parliamentary Staff had been welcomed bybackbench Members when the Prime Minister referred to thematter on 3 July.    The Government should repeat their readiness to discuss the matter with backbenchers.    the choice of an analogous link either with the Civil Service or theParliamentary Staff would be governed by the consideration that most Members devoted themselves full-time to their work and did not have an outside income to support them.In continued discussion on Ministerial salaries it was suggested that ifMembers of Parliament were to renounce a substantial part of theincrease awarded to them under the TSRB report, Cabinet ministers should play their part in setting an example in support of theGovernments counter-inflationary policy by accepting a cut in theirown salaries, even although the TSRB were still reviewing thequestion of Ministerial salaries.    Alternatively, Cabinet ministers who were Members of the House of Commons could renounce all or part of the  2,000 increase in the Ministerial Parliamentary salaryrecommended by the TSRB.    Since the TSRB had still to report aboutMinisterial salaries, any cuts in Cabinet ministers salaries, or anyrenunciation of allowances to which they might otherwise be entitled,would have to be presented as a gesture in deference to the stringentpay policy which had now to be universally applied.    But there was no suggestion that Ministers were overpaid;  indeed Ministerial salarieshad steadily declined in real terms since they were last fixed at thebeginning of 1974.    There was the further difficulty that tax would continue to be calculated on the full rate of salary even although partof it was voluntarily renounced.    This could be overcome if the cutwere effected by means of a short Bill, but such a step would mean that pensions would be adversely affected.
The position of Cabinet Ministers who were not Members of the Houseof Commons would require to be considered separately.    It was notedthat the TSRB had proposed that Members of the House of lords should be awarded, as an interim measure, an increase of  2 per day in their attendance allowance.    This matter should also be considered separately.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that in present circumstances it would net be possibleto pay in full the increases which the Review Body had recommended.They agreed that the increases in Parliamentary allowances,amounting to roughly  2, 000 per year, should be paid in full; but the recommended increase in salary would need to be curtailed by asubstantial amount.    The consensus of opinion in the Cabinet was thatthe increase in salary should be limited to  1,250, &apos; The question ofthe consequential effects on pension rights still required to be settledbefore a statement could be made in Parliament.    He therefore proposed that a small Ministerial group, consisting of the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal and a TreasuryMinister, with the Lord President of the Council in the chair, should consider this matter before the statement was finalised.    On thequestion of Ministerial salaries,, the Cabinet agreed that cabinet ministers who were Members of the House of Commons should not receive the  2,000 increase in the Ministerial Parliamentary salaryrecommended by the Review Body;  Ministers not in the cabinet should receive the same proportion of the  2,000 as had been agreed for the increase in Members&apos; salaries.    On the other hand, there wasa consensus against any reduction in Ministerial salaries.    He would discuss further with the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Privy Seal theirown position as Members of the House of Lords.    It would not bepossible to make a statement in Parliament later that day; the lord president of the Council should therefore arrange to announce theGovernments decision the following day.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord President of the Council toarrange for a small Ministerial group consisting ofhimself, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,the Lord Privy Seal and a Treasury Minister to consider further the question of Members&apos; pension rights as theywere affected by the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on salary.3. Invited the Lord President of the Council to makea statement about the Governments decision in parliament the following day.5SECRET --..........&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL;\y 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary,parliamentary   of State for the Environment and the Lord President of the CouncilTIDING about the future of the new Parliamentary building(C(75) 75).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that anearly decision was needed on whether work should proceed on the newParliamentary building, in particular so that the architects,Messrs Spence and Webster, could know where they stood.    In June1973 the House of Commons had voted for the construction in due course of a new Parliamentary building on the Bridge Street site;and they had also approved the competition-winning design by messrs Spence and Webster.    The cost of the building and associatedworks would be at least  30 million at current prices.    He and theLord President of the Council took the view that in the present economic circumstances the only feasible course was to postpone the new building indefinitely and to pay off the architects.    But there were still 138 Members of Parliament without proper offices, and therefore the Services Committee should be invited to consider the rehabilitation of Norman Shaw South, which within two years of a decision could provide accommodation tor 81 Members, 81 secretaries and 38 staff,at a cost of  l^- lf million, exclusive of the cost of rehousing thecivil servants now occupying the building.    The Services committee might also be invited to consider the rehabilitation and use for members of one of the other existing buildings on the Bridge Streetsite.    A further possibility which was being investigated was the useof some accommodation in the Speaker&apos;s Residence.    A draft statement announcing these decisions was annexed to the paper whichhad been circulated, and it would be convenient for it to be made onthe same day as the statement about Members&apos; pay,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it would be undesirable at the present moment for the Government publicly to commit themselves to any expenditure on raising the standard ofMembers&apos; accommodation.    The statement should therefore do no more than announce the indefinite postponement of the proposed newParliamentary building and promise to consider the conversion ofNorman Shaw South when funds were available.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, had circulated a minute proposing some minor amendments to the draft statement which would produce this effect.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL,  summing up a briefdiscussion, said that the Cabinet approved the proposals in C(75) 75subject to the points which had been made in discussion by theChancellor of the Exchequer,    A statement on the lines of the draft which had been circulated, but taking account of the amendments proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should be made on thesame day as the statement about Members&apos; pay.6
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Lord President ofthe Council&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office15 July 19757
