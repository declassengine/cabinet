The rate of exchange against a&apos;basket&apos; of other currencies had been slipping gradually ever sincethe last quarter of 1974, but recently the decline had accelerated.In April and May it fell by 4 per cent;  in the first three weeks of Juneit fell by a further 4 per cent; and on the previous day alone it had fallen by 1 per cent.    Up to the end of 1974 its fall had been with the dollar;  and this had meant that the oil producing countries had no incentive to transfer their funds from London to New York.    Now therate was going down against the dollar, and at 9. 15 that morning the dollar rate stood at 2. 1740 compared with a rate of 2. 2248 on theprevious Friday,    Among the big sterling holders, Nigeria had indicated a month previously that they were planning to diversifytheir holdings;  the Kuwait Government had said that they would begin to move funds when the rate fell below 2. 20; and the Saudi ArabianGovernment had said that they would start to move funds once the rate was below 2. 17.    The Government was therefore faced with the riskof a massive withdrawal of funds and if action were not taken the rate would drop further still.    This would have an adverse effect uponTOP  SECRET
inflation, since every 5 percentage points depreciation in the rateof exchange led to an increase of about 1 per cent in domestic prices -especially food - about six months later.    There were $6, 000 million inthe reserves, of which $5, 000 million were needed for current liabilities.Any further drain would mean borrowing from the international monetary Fund, who, after the first, limited, tranche, would certainlyrequire not only an effective incomes policy but also deflationaryaction and heavy cuts in public expenditure as the price of further assistance.    Cuts in public expenditure would not help the inflationarysituation, but would certainly lead to additional unemployment.    It wastherefore imperative to announce that afternoon how the government proposed to deal with cost inflation and incomes.Enormous prcgress had been made with the Trades Union Congress(TUC).    Although the General Council had so far only asked theEconomic Committee to consider the proposals in the papercirculated as C(75) 67, both Mr Len Murray and Mr Jack Jones had committed themselves to getting inflation down vo a level which wasroughly the same as that which the Government had in mind and alsoto rela.ting pay increases to that target.    Such a policy would probablyget a two-to-one endorsement on the General Council.    It would bepossible to demonstrate to the TUC that such an inflation targetrequires?, keeping pay increases down to 10 per cent, or about  6 ata flat rate.    The problem was how to convince opinion both at homeand abroad that such a &quot;norm&quot; would be observed, the TUC havingthe previous year committed themselves to easier guidelines which many of their constituent members had ignored.    This year thesituation was even worse in that some unions had already rejected the idea of pay restraint at all.    How then could compliance beachieved?    He had considered various sanctions.    In the public sectorit would be possible to establish cash limits for nationalised industries and local authorities, and require the cost of any excessive pay settlement to be offset by cuts in other expenditure.    This might require legislation.    For the private sector, it would be possibleto amend the Price Code so as to disallow for price increase purposes the cost of any excessive pay settlement;  but this was likely to have little or no effect on capital intensive industries and on those engagedprimarily in exports.    He doubted whether a voluntary policy,coupled with financial sanctions of this kind, would carry the convictionneeded to stop further loss of confidence in sterling.    He consideredtherefore that it would be essential for the Government to say thatthey proposed to take action to make it illegal for employers to pay more than the norm.    If this were done the overwhelming majority ofemployers would comply with the law.    He was not proposing legalsanctions on the workers.    His impression was that, while the TUCcould hardly be expected to approve such a policy , they would wish tosee the Labour Government survive, and, in spite of criticising them,would do their best to make the policy work.2
In discussion it was argued that the propose! put forward by theChancellor of the Exchequer presented great difficulties.    Making anynorm into a legal limit was something which would be strongly opposed by the whole trades union movement.    It bore all the hallmarks of apolicy thought up hurriedly and without adequate consideration of allthe difficulties and anomalies to which it could give rise.    It was not proposed to use criminal sanctions against workers; but once started on the statutory road, no-one could be sure how things would develop.If there were a legal limit, and the coal miners vresi on strike against it, it would in effect be a strike in defiance of the law.    Furthermorethere would be grave difficulties over the transitional period, not only with the seamen who were awaiting the results of arbitration, but other groups, such as the police, who had already made a settlement above10 per cent to start in September, and post office workers who had a forward indexation provision in their last settlement.    It was not infact possible to draw a clear distinction between the two pay rounds.Any anomaly could lead to industrial action in a situation where theGovernment would have no sympathy from the TUC, who would certainly be opposed both to the general policy and to the particular level of wage increase contemplated.    If negotiations with the TUC could continue, there was a chance that agreement might be reached on, say,a 12j per cent norm, which would not in practice be so much different from a 10 per cent one as to justify putting at risk all the goodwill andco-operation that might be lost by going for a statutory policy.    Ineffect, the proposal was that there should be a wage cut, with nodiscussions and no advance preparation.    Such a policy might collapsein the outcry which it would provoke.    It was essential to continuediscussing the problem with the TUC.Against this it was strongly argued that, desirable as an agreementwith the TUC would be, there was no prospect of getting one sincethe Government would not be able to concede the quid pro quo whichthe TUC, judging by the document circulated as C(75) 67, would belikely to demand.    There had been a considerable change in the moodin the country, and the overwhelming weight of opinion amongst thegeneral public and amongst ordinary trades union members was by nomeans identified with that of the TUC and the union activists.    In favourof making an early statement it was argued that the situation was extremely serious - more so than in 1966-67 - and unless control was-established the Government might be destroyed.    Indeed the hyper-inflation that would follow a collapse of sterling could lead to the totaldestruction of the value of the currency and of society itself.    Even ifthe support of the TUC could be obtained - and this was by no means certain - there simply was not time.    What was needed to stop theslide on the foreign exchange markets was an unambiguous statementof the Governments determination to control pay increases.    Thiswould provoke a strong challenge from the trades union movement,and the Government would have to face a very difficult period.Nevertheless, to delay the statement till later could precipitate anirretrievable situation.    It had to be recognised however that the worst3
situation would be a statement which failed to stop the outflow, sothat the Government were then compelled to return within days tomake a further, and much tougher, statement.Against making a statement that day it was argued that it was not yetclear that such a move was in fact necessary.    If it were, it was questionable whether anything which the Government could say wouldin fact hold the rate.    Alternative courses which might be examinedincluded the possibility of giving sterling guarantees to the majorholders, a possibility which should certainly be examined beforeadopting an incomes policy which would divide the Labour movement.Such guarantees would, however, be likely to be extremely costly,and it was improbable that they could be confined to the major holdersonly.    Another alternative course was to allow the rate to continue to fall until it found the level at which market forces would push it up again.    It was accepted that this could involve a very difficult period for the country, but equally so the proposal by the Chancellor of theExchequer was in effect to put into reverse the whole strategy andphilosophy of the Government just at the moment when responsibletrades union leaders were making dramatic moves to achieve a voluntary incomes policy.In further discussion it was argued that, if there were to be astatement that afternoon, it was important that it should say clearly that 10 per cent or equivalent was the maximum pay increase whichthe Government had in mind, together with some reference to prices and price control, although the latter would need to be touched on onlylightly in view of the need to avoid a further squeeze on profits anda consequential adverse effect on investment prospects.    On thequestion of sanctions, it could be said that the Government had a formidable battery of sanctions, some financial and some statutory,already at its disposal, and would be prepared to take further powersif necessary.    While the statement would make it clear that excesssettlements in the public sector would mean cuts in other expenditure,it should not be ruled out that the available wages fund might beallowed to be higher if genuine productivity could be achieved orreductions in overmanning.    It was important that the statement should make an impact on foreign opinion, but it was suggested that itmight avoid detail on either prices or wages and take the form of ageneral statement of intention and determination.    The inflationtarget could be given, together with an assurance that the Governmentwould take all appropriate measures to achieve it, and was even nowdiscussing the problems of wages and prices with both sides ofindustry.    Precision about objectives and targets rather than aboutmeans would avoid giving hostages to fortune.    Against this it wassuggested that such studied vagueness could be both ineffective in helping the exchange rate and arouse the worst suspicions of thetrades unions.    In fact both the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePrime Minister had already, in public speeches, referred to the inflation target, without any visible effect on foreign opinion.    It
might be possible to say that the Government were determined to controlpay increases., and explain in general terms how this might be done,but to add that the Government would seek to achieve this by voluntarymeans, but would take reserve powers for use in case this failed.Another possibility might be to say that the Government would discussthe possibility of a voluntary policy further with the TUG, but that ifthey could not show within a matter of days that an effective agreement could be reached, then the Government would be prepared to takelegislative powers.    On the other hand, there was much to be said for the view that if there were a statement containing some reversal of present policy, that reversal should be total and complete, since a partial retreat would only provoke pressures which would eventuallyforce the Government further along the same road.    Whatever theformula adopted it should be made clear that a major purpose of thepolicy was to remove the disabling effect of inflation on the Governmentsability to stem the increase in unemployment.    The statement shouldalso emphasise the importance of a policy of this kind in protectingthose, least able to fend for themselves,In the course of discussion the following further points were made;-a. Any question of imposing criminal sanctions againstworkers should be completely ruled out.    Not only would this provoke strong opposition from the trades union movement, but it would also be quite impracticable to operate.b. The use of the Prices Code to discourage excessivewage settlements, for example by disallowing the cost of the excess for price increase purposes, would have little effect upon capital-intensive industries, where wage costs were asmall proportion of total expenditure or in exporting industries,where the Prices Code did not apply.    This meant that such industries would have little incentive to resist excessivesettlements, and once they had been made comparable workersin other industries would seek parity of treatment.    Thisargued for    legislative controls over employers.    one possibility would be to use the Prices Code as a sanction by allowing no price increase for 6 months (compared with theusual 3 months) where an excessive settlement had been agreed.c. Rents presented a difficult problem, and the rightsolution might be to relate rent rises to the wages norm.d. It should be possible to restrict assistance under sections 7 and 8 of the Industry Act to those firms whoobserved the pay policy, and to refuse it to others.5TO:.- SECRET
e. One possible alternative course would be to impose atotal freeze on prices and wages for a limited period, thusbuying time to think out the details of a longer term policy.The disadvantage of this was that it would not restore foreignconfidence since it would imply that the Government had notyet found a solution.f. There would no doubt be pressure from some quarters for a further cut in public expenditure designed to reduce the size of the public sector borrowing requirement.    Thisshould be met by referring to the cash limits which it was proposed to impose upon the nationalised industries andlocal authorities, and to the extension of the system of cashcontrol for public expenditure where this was appropriate.It might also be possible to indicate that the stringency appliedto public sector spending in 1976-77 would be extended to later years.g. The comparisons which had been made with 1966 and1972 were not apt.    The true comparison was with 1931.Whai was now contemplated was a real cut in wages, a policywhich would not command TUG support.    No policy could bemade to work without trade union goodwill.    The policywhich had been proposed would be profoundly damaging to theLabour movement.    A 10 per cent norm would be difficultto justify to low-paid groups of workers, such as the national health Service ancillaries.    They would have suffered25 per cent erosion cf the value of their pay since their lastsettlement, and over the coming 12 months might suffer afurther erosion of 12-f- per cent.    Against this total erosionof 37j per cent, they were to be offered compensation of only10 per cent.    The only answer to this was that they would havereceived a considerable boost at their last settlement, so thattheir subsequent decline was from a high point.h. A 10 per cent norm would, if fully applied, and assumingno large-scale withdrawal of savings, lead to a deflationaryeffect of some  300 million, equivalent to an addition to unemployment of some 30, 000.    However, in such a situationdrawing on savings was likely to occur;  and success with the inflation rate could increase exports and investment and thusadd to employment, perhaps sufficiently to offset the adverse effects.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the strong balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of a statementbeing made that afternoon.    They were more evenly divided on whatsuch a statement should contain.    But if an early statement was to bemade it was essential that it should be framed to have the best possiblechance of dealing with the crisis of confidence in the foreign exchangemarkets and also of keeping open the possibility of reaching an6
agreement with the TUC.    It should therefore begin by stating firmlythe complete determination of the Government to deal with thesituation, indicating that the Governmenfs target was to get the rateof domestic inflation down to 10 per cent by the third quarter of 1976,and down into single figures by the end of 1976.    The importance ofthis for the housewife and for social security beneficiaries should bestressed.    Furthermore, it should indicate that this would require that pay increases be kept within a maximum of 10 per cent (or its equivalent) for the whole of the coming pay round.    The statement would say the Government had reached an advanced stage in working out a policy to deal with the situation, and that consultations had begunwith the TUC and CBI.    The policy would have to cover the range of sanctions open to the Government, including the use of the Prices Code,the imposition of cash limits on nationalised industries and localauthorities to ensure that the cost of any excessive pay settlementshad to be met from expenditure cuts elsewhere and not from additionalsubsidies, increased borrowing or higher charges;  and the limitationof dividends.    It should be made clear that, while the Governmentwould greatly prefer to proceed on the basis of a voluntary policy agreed with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the TUC, if an effective agreement could not be obtained on the basis of the government&apos;s targets by a very early date, then the Government wouldbe obliged to legislate to impose a requirement on both public and private sector employers to comply with the 10 per cent limit onwage increases.He proposed that the Cabinet Secretariat should be instructed toprepare a draft on these lines, which could then be consideredimmediately after lunch by a small group of Ministers consisting ofhimself, the Lord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretaries of State for the Environment, Employment, prices and Consumer Protection and Trade.    After the statement had beenmade, work should proceed rapidly to draft both the legislation which would be necessary if agreement could not be reached with the tuc, and the White Paper which would be needed in any event.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up.2.      Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet toprepare a draft of the statement on the lines indicatedin the summing up.Cabinet Office2 July 1975
