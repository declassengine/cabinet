1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the threat of an invasion of Belize seemed to have receded, atleast for the time being0      In Guatemala the Foreign Minister,Senor Molina, had made a speech designed to calm public opinion and had then retired to hospital.    The Belize an resolution at theUnited Nations had attracted 55 co-sponsors and was sure to be passed with a large majority.    He would then at once proposediscussions with the Guatemalan Government so as to save theirface.    Our action in sending reinforcements had been timely:  he hoped the situation would now settle down.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGovernor General, Sir John Kerr, had taken the unusual step ofdismissing the Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, because of his refusal to resign following rejection of his budget by the Senate,    Theconstitutional position in Australia seemed to be different from thatin the United Kingdom in two respects: the Senate there was a fullyelected body and in Australia it was the responsibility of bothHouses of Parliament to vote Supply.    In place of Mr Whitlam&apos;administration, the Governor General had appointed a caretakerGovernment, whose task was to vote Supply and then call a GeneralElection,    The situation which had arisen in no way involved theUnited Kingdom Government.    The Governor General was responsible to The Queen in her capacity as Queen of Australia.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theResolutions on Palestine passed by the General Assembly had beenbad.    The United Kingdom had voted against both of them.    the nine members of the European Economic Community (e.c.) had notachieved unanimity of voting,,    In the Resolution on PalestineLiberation Organisation participation the United Kingdom the federal republic of Germany and the Netherlands had been among the eightadverse votes, whereas the other six e.c. members had been amongthe 25 countries abstaining.     The Resolution on Palestinian rightshad been adopted by 93 votes in favour to 18 against, with six eec countries among those 18.    The passage of these two Resolutions had raised the temperature in the General Assembly and their effect couldonly be harmful.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
TRADE union and labour relations(AMENDMENT)bill previous reference:CC(75) 46thConclusions,Minute 12. The Cabinet considered further the differences between theHouse of Commons and the House of Lords over the provisions relating to the Press in the Trade Union and Labour Relations(Amendment) Bill.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, following the cabinets discussion on 6 November, there had been informal consultationwith Lord Goodman on the amendments relating to the enforcement of the Charter on the Press and to its content.    On enforcement,Lord Goodman insisted on the retention of his amendment that anyrule, agreement, act or conduct contrary to the provisions of the charter should be deemed to be contrary to public policy, but would accept the omission of the words &quot;act or conduct&quot;.    This was aconsiderable improvement, but still left open the possibility thatthe amendment would create new causes for legal action.    he proposed the addition to this amendment of the words &quot;but no person shall be subject to any legal liability by virtue of this sub-section towhich he would not be liable apart from this sub-section&quot;, but this had not yet been agreed by Lord Goodman.    There was greater difficulty over Lord Goodman1 s amendment specifying the matters to be covered by the Charter.    Lord Goodman would not accept thatthe amendment by the Manifesto Group which had twice been passedby the House of Commons was adequate;  he wanted this amendment to refer to the^availability&quot; rather than the &quot;question&quot; of accessfor contributors - which was acceptable - but he also insisted thatthe Charter should include provisions covering the rights of journalists not to be unreasonably excluded or expelled from tradeunions and to belong to the union of their choice, and the rights ofeditors not to belong to a trade union.    Lord Goodman wanted anundertaking to Parliament that, if the parties did not agree on a charter which included provision for these matters, the Secretaryof State for Employment would then use his powers to ensure thatthe Charter contained such provisions.    It might be possible,though it was by no means certain, to persuade Lord Goodman toagree on the enforcement point, and the question for the cabinet was whether or not to take a stand on the wording twice passed bythe House of Commons relating to the contents of the Charter.Lord Carrington had said that, if the Government were able toreach agreement with Lord Goodman, he thought he would be ableto dissuade Conservative peers from voting for Lord Kailsharc^amendment which would provide compensation for persons sufferingloss in consequence of breaches of the Charter,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he accepted that the words which the Lord Chancellor proposed shouldbe added to Lord Goodman&apos;s amendment on public policy would meet the Cabinefs decision of 6 November that this amendment should not give anyone a right of recourse to the courts which he did
not now have, though he thought it unlikely that Lord Goodmanwould accept this addition.    He considered, however, that theGovernment should insist on the retention of the amendment onthe contents of the Charter which had been devised by the ManifestoGroup, and passed in the Commons by majorities of 30 and more,following months of discussion.    The Commons could not now beexpected to go back on these decisions at the dictation of the Lords,in order to introduce one-sided provisions proposed byLord Goodman, all of which were directed against the NationalUnion of Journalists and in favour of editors.    The inclusion ofsuch provisions would amount to writing into the Charter, inadvance of any negotiations between the parties, the rights of one side.    This would greatly reduce the prospects of an agreedCharter and might lead to industrial trouble in the Press industry.If he were to give an undertaking about the way in which he would use his own powers, this would equally amount to pre-judging the outcome of negotiations on the Charter.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the wording of Lord Goodman1 amendment on the contents of the Charter was, for the most part,the same in spirit as the Manifesto group&apos;s wording.    Thedifference concerned the rights of journalists to belong to a unionof their choice and not to be unreasonably expelled or excluded,and the rights of editors not to belong to a union.    He would find it very difficult in any Parliament to argue that the Charter shouldnot deal with these matters, and the issue was how the commons would react and how Lord Goodman1 s wording would affect the chances of an agreed Charter.    Lord Carrington was fairly certainthat he could persuade Conservative peers not to supportLord Hailsham if the Government were in agreement with lord Goodman, and he favoured making one last effort to reach agreement with Lord Goodman on a form of words to describe the contents of the Charter.    It hardly seemed justifiable to use the parliament Act because of this one point of difference, and he feared that, if this were done on this occasion, it would become a practice in the Lords to obstruct Government legislation and leavethe Government to use the Parliament Act.    The Lords would bythe end of the Session have passed all the other Government Bills;and the question was whether this single amendment byLord Goodman was worth a constitutional crisis.In discussion it was argued that the main point was to ensure thatthe Charter created no new rights of legal action, and that theGovernment should not go to the last ditch on Lord Goodman&apos;amendment on the contents of the Charter, which merely spelt out what was implied by the Manifesto Group&apos;s amendment.    The issue would presentationally be unfavourable ground for the Governmentto take a stand on.    On the other hand it was suggested that
Lord Goodman did not want Press freedom, but a victory and a charter for newspaper proprietors.    Acceptance of his wordingwould undermine the Government&apos;s stance that the Charter shouldbe voluntary, and would be represented as a major climb-down bythe Government whose supporters in the Commons would jib atbeing asked to reverse their previous votes.    Nor was this a mount to be seen to be giving in to the House of Lords,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that if Lord Goodman would accept the additionalwords proposed by the Lord Chancellor as well as the omission ofthe words &quot;act or conduct&quot; his amendment on public policy wouldbe acceptable.    But on balance his amendment on the contents ofthe Charter must be regarded as unacceptable;  the Governmentcould give no further ground on this point and should adhere to the wording of the Manifesto Group&apos;s amendment.    The Lord Chan celloin consultation with the Secretary of State for Employment and theLord Privy Seal, should accordingly explain the Government&apos;position to Lord Goodman before the debate in the House of Lordsthat afternoon, and should make one last attempt to secure his agreement.    Unless Lord Goodman acquiesced and the House ofLords then passed the Bill in the form agreed between theGovernment and Lord Goodman and rejected Lord Hailsham&apos;amendment, the Cabinefs decision of 6 November should stand andthe Parliament Act should be invoked next Session,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister !summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.3. The Cabinet considered the position of Chrysler (UK) Ltd,Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.
4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(75) 119) covering the draft of a White Paper ondevolution to Scotland and Wales.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the draft white Paper represented the working out of the  commitments which the Government had undertaken, and reflected the decisions reached by the Ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy.The Committee&apos;s wish to avoid commitment to every detail 01 theproposed devolution schemes was met by paragraphs 5 and 288 ofthe draft.    The text, if approved by the Cabinet, needed to go tothe printers by 14 November at the latest for publication on27 November,    Certain infelicities in the drafting would be removed in final editing, and any other suggestions for minor adjustmentscould be considered at the same time.In discussion, it was said that Parts I and II of the draft did notstrike the right note;  elements were too defensive, and morerobust material currently appearing later in the draft might usefully be brought forward.Differing views were expressed on whether the White Paper shouldreiterate, or alternatively soften, the commitment in the september 1974 White Paper (Cmnd 5732) to adopt for theAssemblies the same voting system as that used to elect the Houseof Commons.    It was hard to predict whether this system would bemore likely than some system of proportional representation to lead to separatist majorities.In discussion of whether the House of Lords should have a role inthe Parliamentary approval of &quot;override&quot; on policy grounds, it wassuggested that such a role could come into play only in circumstances where it was highly undesirable that the lords should have power.    On the other hand, it was suggested that this difficulty could be avoided, without major constitutional departure,by giving the Lords a role on the general lines envisaged in the1968 Parliament No 2 Bill - a role, in effect,simply to compel the commons to think again, however briefly.Differing views were expressed also on whether or not responsibilityfor the probation service in Wales should be devolved in the welsh assembly.    In favour of this, it was argued that the service wasindependent of the penal system, that its work bore an increasinglyclose relationship with the social services (which were to be devolved) and that the effective absorption of the probation serviceinto the social work field had worked well in Scotland.    On the otherhand, it was pointed out that the work of the service in Wales, as inEngland, was bound up with that of the magistrates&apos; courts and the5
police;  that devolution in Wales could generate pressures forundesirable reorganisation in England;  and that it would makepoor administrative sense to hive off to the Assembly a fragmentnumbering little over 200 people from the current England andWales service.On the costs of devolution, it was suggested that experience showed that staff costs always turned out to be greater than had been expected and that it was therefore undesirable to publish specificfigures;  on the other hand, it was argued that more careful examination might well show that the present cost estimates were too high.A number of other detailed suggestions were made on the text ofthe White Paper.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theLord President deserved the congratulations and thanks of theCabinet for carrying forward to this stage the preparation of a white Paper which should undoubtedly be seen as an impressivepiece of work by the Government.    The Cabinet agreed that theWhite Paper should be published as proposed,  subject to finaladjustment by the Lord President, in the light of the points madein discussion and, if necessary, after reference to himself.    the references in the text to the Assembly elections, to the probationservice in Wales, and to costs of devolution, should be leftunchanged.    The Cabinet agreed that the House of Lords shouldhave a role in &quot;override&quot; procedures on the general lines of the1968 Bill, and the Lord President should arrange for the furtherworking out of a detailed scheme.    Other outstanding questions of substance, such as future responsibility for the appointment ofHer Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Schools in &quot;Wales, should be considered further by the Lord President with other Ministers concerned.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office11 November 19756
fTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO     40CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3Tuesday 11 November 1975 at 10.00 amCHRYSLER THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that at a meeting(UK) LTD with the Prime Minister on 3 November the Chairman of the chrysler corporation reported that his Board had taken a firm decision toprovide no further finance to support the continued operation of Chrysler (UK) Ltd after the end of November.    He had gone on to saythat if the Government wished Chrysler to continue operating theywould have to take over all future financing requirements; these were estimated by Chrysler at  55 million for losses up to 1979 and 80 million for the development of new models,     but in the view ofthe Department of Industry these estimates were likely to be much too low.    Failing this Chrysler would start to run down their british company at the end of November.    Redundancies would startimmediately and closure would be completed in about three months.Chrysler (UK) Ltd employed about 25, 000 workers.    It had been known for some time that their position was weak; the parentcompany had earlier discussed the possibility of financial assistancewith his Department but had then withdrawn their proposals.    Thepresent crisis had been precipitated by recent public statements inthe United States by the Chrysler Corporation,    For the&quot;Governmentto take over complete financial responsibility for Chrysler (UK) Ltdwould be an open-ended commitment.    The company&apos;s market sharehad fallen from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in 12 months: it was certainly lower than 5 per cent now.    Even a share of 5 per cent was too small to offer any prospects of viability.    If the Governmentsought to preserve Chrysler (UK) Ltd the future of British Ley land would be put at risk, thus jeopardising the cornerstone of theGovernments policy for the motorcar industry.    Moreover theVauxhall company were also known to be in difficulty and would almost certainly seek Government support if Chrysler were rescued.    Therecent study by the Central Policy Review Staff made clear that therewas excess capacity not only in this country but in the whole ofEurope, and recommended that capacity should be reduced in Britain,
The Trade and Industry Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on expenditure had also concluded that there was excess capacity.Against this background the preservation of Chrysler at the tax-payer^ expense could net be justified,,Closure would result in the loss of 25, 000 jobs directly a with additional losses among component manufacturers and dealers,,There was no prospect of early re-employment for such numbers andindustrial action would be likely to follow.    He had pressed Chryslerabout extending the rundown over a longer period to ease the problemsof redundancy but they had been adamant that they would make no more money available.    It was nevertheless his view that further efforts should be made to secure a slower rundown and that theGovernment should be prepared to contribute towards the cost of this.He was also examining the desirability of introducing temporaryimport restrictions on motorcars to ensure that the share of theBritish market which had been held by Chrysler was secured byBritish production and not lost to a further increase in imports.    an examination was also being made of how Chrysler&apos;s importantcontract with Iran could be preserved for Britain,In discussion it was argued that closure would represent the biggestindustrial collapse in the history of this country.    Chrysler had givenrepeated undertakings to the Government about their future intentionswhen they had acquired the former Rootes company: and the white paper on the &quot;Regeneration of British Industry&quot; had foreseencompulsory acquisition in circumstances such as these.    Vigorousaction should be taken to preserve Chrysler (UK) Ltd: this could include the Government taking control of Chrysler (UK) and requiringChrysler to disclose information about its affairs, representations tothe United States Government and a prohibition on imports fromChrysler&apos;s other overseas subsidiaries.    It was further argued thatclosure would have very damaging effects on relationships with thetrades union movement and in Scotland.    It was an essential feature of the Government policy on devolution that the economic integrity ofthe United Kingdom had to be preserved and overall control of the economy exercised from Westminster.    Closure of Chrysler&apos;s plant at Linwood would mean the disappearance of the motorcar industry from Scotland: it would be seen as an abuse of central control and a body blow to the Governments devolution proposals.    Closure also had to be seen against the prospects for contraction in other industryin Scotland, and particularly in Clydeside,    More time was needed to explore options other than complete closure before final decisions were reached: it would also be essential to consult the leaders of thetrades unions most closely concerned.
On the other hand it was strongly argued there was no basis on whichChrysler (UK) Ltd could be made viable and consequently noaltairaative to allowing its closure to go ahead.    if the Governmentonce acquired the company in order to provide time for a fullerinvestigation of all the alternatives, it was extremely doubtful whetherthey would then be able to go ahead with a close-down even if itwas then manifest that there was no prospect of the company becomingviable.    Nor was it clear what could be achieved by making representations to the United States Government; they had no locus inthe  matter.    The Governments efforts should now be concentrated ona study of means for mitigating the effects of a close-down, includingprolongation of the rundown period, generous redundancy payments,restrictions on imports, and the continuation of the Chrysler contract with Iran,    Particular attention should be paid to the problems of the chrysler plant in Scotland,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet was not being asked to take final decisioas at this meeting.Much work remained to be done; but he had felt it right that theCabinet should be put fully in the picture at this stage,    A group of senior Ministers was considering all the possible courses of action,and would take account of the points which had been made in theCabinet discussion.    No announcement would be made beforeParliament was prorogued,    A full report would be made to theCabinet shortly to provide a basis for final decisions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office12 November 1975
