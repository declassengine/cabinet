THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no Ea DCABINETDRAFT white paper ONINFLATIONPreviousReference:CC(75) 31stConclusionsCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 10 July 1975 at 10. 00 am the Cabinet had before them a printed proof of the White Paper oninflation which had been made available shortly before the meeting and which superseded the draft circulated with C(75) 76,Introducing it THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatthe Secretaries of State for Employment and for Prices and consumer Protection and he had held an intensive series of meetings over the past week with members of the EconomicCommittee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and withrepresentatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).There had been a marked and helpful shift of view by the TUC.At first they had been reluctant to consider any limit for pay increases below 15 per cent, and were also opposed to any legislation in support of a voluntary policy.     They had however agreedto a flat rate limit of  6 a week, which was equivalent to a littleover 10 per cent, and had also agreed that legislation was needed to enable penal sanctions to be operated through the Price Code; to relieve employers of their contractual obligation to pay more thanthe proposed limit; and to provide sanctions against individual localauthorities through selective use of the Rate Support Grant.    He had made it clear to the TUC that the Government also reserved theright to introduce a reserve power to make it an offence for employers to pay over the limit if this were thought necessary eventhough the TUC would be opposed to this.    The CBI had finallyaccepted the proposed Price Code sanctions, and they had urgedthat a reserve power was necessary.    There were elements in theproposals which they disliked but they had said that if they concluded that the policy eventually announced by the Government would work,they would support it.The Cabinet then considered the printed proof paragraph by paragraph,and agreed to a number of amendments.    The following were themore important points made in this part of their discussion.
tThe Pay On paragraph 6 it was noted that the equivalent of 10 per cent forlimit the average adult worker was  5. 50 a week;  but the agreed flat rate of 6 would not carry through into overtime, and this, taken with thefact that some employers would in fact not be able to afford to paythe  6, meant that the overall effect of a  6 maximum could beequated with 10 per cent.    It would however be important toemphasise that   6 was a maximum and not an entitlement.   A flat rate had been adopted because a simple percentage, which wouldgive only  3 to the worker on  30 a week, would have beenunacceptable to the TUC; while a mixture of flat rate and percentage increase would have been too complicated and made much lessimpact presentationally.    Nevertheless the flat rate createdproblems.    One was that because there were large numbers of low paid workers - who benefitted most from the flat rate - in the clothing, retail distribution and food industries it could have a disproportionate effect on the movement of the Retail Prices Index(RPI).   Another was that by compressing differentials and creatinganomalies it would increase the problem of re-entry at the end ofthis phase of the Governments incomes policy.Expenses It was noted that there was no reference in paragraph 6 to expenses.It was agreed that expenses should not be affected by the limit, butthat this was a point more suitably made in a speech in the subsequent Parliamentary debate.Upper limit On paragraph 7 it was agreed that the upper limit for the  6 increase should be  8, 500 a year.    This would not satisfy fully either the tuc or CBI but was a reasonable compromise which would inparticular ease the problem in relation to the power engineers.Transitional On paragraph 8 it was argued that the cut-off date for transitional arrangements arrangements should be 1 August instead of 1 September,   Admittedlythis would involve hardship to certain public employees (including thepolice, the university teachers and the railway workers) whose laterpayments would then have to count against the   6 limit, but if theGovernment were to carry conviction they should allow no exceptionsafter the date for the introduction of the new policy.   Against this itwas argued that where public faith was pledged, or where the employees concerned were at the end of the previous pay round, itwould be wiser to act with generosity, as long as the transitional provisions were clear and defensible.    After further discussion itwas agreed to retain the date of 1 September but to allow only
settlements and not firm offers. It was noted that if this led tothe need to reduce judicial salaries, or to amend contracts with national Health Service consultants, this would require legislation.Food subsidies        As regards the alternative paragraphs (34 and 35 or 34A and 35A)and rents dealing with food subsidies and rents THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR PRICES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION argued that the wholeof the  150 million which the Chancellor was prepared to make available in 1976-77 should be devoted to postponing the phasing outof food subsidies.    Certain major food price increases were already in the pipeline, including those which would arise from therecent decision to adjust the representative rate for the &quot;GreenPound&quot;.    The flat rate pay limit would be likely to hit the food anddistribution industries more than others, with consequential effects on prices.    Other increases would arise from agreements underthe Farm Price Review.    There was also the prospect of a badharvest due to the dry summer.    The redistributive and egalitarianeffect of food subsidies upon incomes was far greater than that ofany other form of subsidy.    Moreover, rent rebates protected the poorest people from the full impact of the rent increases, whichwould in any case not be felt until April, whereas the effect uponfood subsidies would be felt from September.Against this THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTarguedthatthe available  150 million should be partly devoted toholding down, the rise of  1 a week which would otherwise take place incouncil rents.    This meant an increase next April of 23 per cent which would be highly damaging both politically and economically.People were not very greatly aware of the effect of food subsidies on their shopping bills, whereas the addition of  1 to their rent,coming at a time when local rates would almost certainly suffer anas yet unquantifiable increase, would make a far greater impact.He therefore favoured holding rent increases in line with probableprice increases, which would mean a rise of 15 per cent or 60 pence.After a short discussion, it was agreed that  80 million should be devoted to holding down the increase in council rents, and  70 million to postponing the phasing out of food subsidies.Employment and      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY proposed that public paragraphs 38-45 and 47 of the draft White Paper should be deletedExpenditure since he felt that the draft put forward an economic strategy totally different from that on which the Government had been elected.    Itwould involve real cuts in pay, rising unemployment, and rising prices designed to increase profits in the vain hope that this would
lead to increased investment.    It was a recipe for a major slumpwhich would lead to a continuing loss of manufacturing capacity.The TUC favoured an in vestment-led expansion; but there was nothing in the text referring to the National Enterprise Board, theintroduction of planning agreements or the generally interventionistpolicies of the Government to stimulate more investment.Furthermore, the proposed incomes policy had been represented asan alternative to public expenditure cuts, whereas paragraph 42foreshadowed further cuts in any case.    In his view the strategywas a Conservative one, and would not work.In discussion, there was no support for the deletion proposed; buta number of amendments were agreed.    On public expenditure, itwas agreed that the references in paragraph 42 should be amended to make it clear that the review in train was the regular annualprocedure, and to ensure that nothing should prejudice the discussion which the Cabinet would shortly have about the level of public expenditure in future years.Occupational It was suggested that a reference to occupational pensions,pensions exempting improvements in them from the pay limit, which had appeared in the Annex to the version attached to C(75) 76, but wasnot in the printed version, should be restored; but after a briefdiscussion it was accepted that this would provide an undesirableloophole, particularly for the better paid.Reserve The Cabinet then considered the provisional passage saying that thepowers Government proposed to invite Parliament to enact reserve powers which, if applied in particular cases, would make it illegal for an employer to exceed the pay limit.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this issue was one upon which thefuture of the Government could depend.    If the White Paper was not seen to be credible and there were a further run on sterling theGovernment could be forced into much severer policies, includingpossibly even criminal sanctions against workers to which he had long been, and was still, firmly opposed.    He saw the argument forreserve powers as the need to show that there was an effective means of coping with those few employers who settled over the limit,whether out of doctrinaire obstinancy or to poach skilled labour or because they were prepared to buy industrial peace at any price.This was a loophole which the Government needed to be able to close.    The reserve powers envisaged could however only beactivated by an Affirmative Resolution in Parliament and thereafter
by a specific Order against an individual company.    There wouldbe few, if any, cases in practice, since firms would shrink fromthe publicity which this procedure would involve.    He had a strongpreference for a policy which was fully agreed with the TUCparticularly since the latter had moved further from their originalposition than had seemed possible.    Nevertheless, the size of the minority vote at the TUC General Council the previous dayinevitably left doubt about how far they could secure compliance with the agreed limit.    The TUC would strongly oppose legalsanctions against workers; but they had accepted the need to legislate in order to relieve employers of their contractual obligations and he believed that they would acquiesce in the proposalfor reserve powers against employers even though they would prefer to avoid it.    He was as publicly committed against a statutory policy as any other Minister but he believed that theconfidence factor made it necessary to take this limited reservepower as part of the legislative package which the TUC had already accepted to be necessary,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, whilethe Cabinet would necessarily wish to give full weight to thearguments put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer attheir meeting on 1 July there were other important factors which must be taken into account.    In his view the adoption of the proposal to take reserve powers would lead tothe destruction of the Government.    He had two main reasons forsaying this.    First, it was important not to underestimate theParliamentary difficulties.    The voluntary policy in the white paper already needed to be buttressed by legislation eg to providepenal sanctions through the Price Code, to extinguish employerscontractual obligations and to take discriminatory powers for theRate Support Grant.    They would lead to a sizable Bill, but the tuc had accepted legislation on these points and there was noescape from it.    It would however inevitably feed suspicions thatthe proposed policy had a strong statutory element.    If the reserve powers were added to this it could double the size of the legislation and would certainly involve long and contentious arguments in theHouse of Commons,    There would be strong objections from theGovernment&apos;s own supporters;  and the Opposition would be able touse the position to its own advantage.    In the resulting Parliamentaryshambles, the Governments position would be seen as very weak and this would be just as damaging for sterling as the absence of areserve power.    Secondly, and concurrently with the Parliamentarytroubles, there would be great difficulties with the trade union movement.    He agreed that the vote at the previous day&apos;s TUCGeneral Council had been disappointing, but the TUC document hadbeen better than we had dared expect and this in itself must have lost some votes.    There would probably now be a passionate debate
within the trade union movement to influence the vote at the meetingof Congress on 1 September.    The TUC leaders who had done mostto help the Government hitherto would be greatly hampered in this debate if reserve powers were now taken against their advice andwishes.    This in itself could lead to an adverse vote at the Congressmeeting which could in turn be very bad for foreign confidence.The truth was that it was not possible to run an effective incomes policy without the support of the trade union movement.    TheGovernment and the trade unions should move in step and he pleadedwith Cabinet not to agree to reserve powers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the decisionfacing Cabinet was not an easy one; but he felt that he had a duty torecommend the adoption of the reserve powers proposal.    The TUCpolicy for pay coincided almost completely with that of theGovernment; but the problem of compliance remained and the credibility of the policy had suffered a setback from the previous day&apos;s TUC General Council vote.    In his view there were threereasons for adopting the reserve powers.    First, it was essentialto be able to assure the workers who settled early in the comingpay round that, if they conformed with the policy, they would not beovertaken by others who came later.    The sanction through thePrice Code was unlikely to be effective in the case of capital-intensive firms, but if it were made illegal for employers to pay more than the limit, this would - without actually invoking thepowers - enormously increase the degree of compliance.    Secondly,while he acknowledged the Parliamentary difficulties, he believedthat there was overwhelming public support, both in the country andin Parliament itself, for a policy backed by reserve powers.    Itwas better to take the powers now rather than have to ask for legislation later when the mood might have changed.    Thirdly, itwas absolutely essential that the White Paper should carry convictionimmediately to foreign holders of sterling.    The general expectationwas that reserve powers would be included in the policy, and if theywere not there was a danger of an even more serious run on sterling.This situation might be impossible to retrieve and could lead to a collapse both of the currency and the Government.    He recognisedthat the proposal would create great difficulties for the trade union movement, and particularly for those who had been most helpful inshifting opinion within the TUC in the previous fortnight.    But he believed that they would still fight to make the policy work and he believed that without the reserve powers the policy would not be acredible one.There was a general recognition that neither of the alternative courses was easy, and that each presented its own danger and difficulties.    The Cabinet had to weigh the relative cost in terms oftrade union goodwill against the risk of a run on the pound.    Theessential thing to avoid was a White Paper which did not carry
conviction and which then led to a fall in the exchange ratecompelling the adoption of even sterner policies than those now in contemplation.    It would in any case ba a mistake to put too muchemphasis on the reserve powers.    In terms of anti-inflation policy,they were of little significance compared with the importance of theGovernments willingness to stand up to strikes.    It should bestressed that the main weight of the Governmenfs policy rested onthe financial sanctions.In further discussion the following main points were made:-a. The previous day&apos;s TUC General Council vote was aserious disappointment, particularly since a yea** earlierthe Council had voted unanimously in favour of much lesssevere guidelines which had subsequently been ignored by many unions.    If the Council were divided over severerguidelines, the prospect of compliance with them must bemuch less even than last year.    Against this it was argued that in 1974 the TUC had been voting on some general and rather ideal guidelines, whereas this year they had beendealing with far more practical and detailed suggestions.It was remarkable and significant that these had still won amajority vote.b. It was fallacious to suggest that the reserve powersproposed would operate only against employers.    Eventhough trade unions would be absolved from any liability tobe charged with conspiracy, the truth was that in the pres enteconomic climate an employer would only pay an increaseabove the limit under pressure from a trade union.   In thattsituation if the Government went to Parliament to obtain anOrder against that employer, they would be effectivelyseeking to exercise a sanction against the workers.    Further-more, they would be seeking to impose a penalty upon an employer who was by definition in a position of greatdifficulty.    It must be doubtful whether the House of commons would in fact approve such an Order.c. The political problem would be a continuing one.Even if the Bill were passed, there would be further crises,and the Parliamentary Labour Party would become brokenand dispirited.    The Government would then becomedependent upon the capricious support of the Conservatives.The real test of a voluntary policy would come when a majorunion sought to use its muscle in defiance, and at that point the Government would need the strong support of the TUC.This consideration overrode the more immediate arguments in favour of taking reserve powers.
d. The reserve powers were in any case a transparentbluff. They meant that an employer could be driven intobankruptcy by the action of a powerful union;  and it mightbe that when a case were brought against an employer he wouldbe able to plead force majeure,  in which case the credibilityof the power would rapidly be undermined.    Even if he couldnot effectively make this plea and were fined, the fine wouldhave to be both large and continuous to make the sanctionwork.    This was hardly likely to be an effective policy.e. If the operation of reserve powers was likely to be both limited and unfair, this would become apparent in theCommittee stage debate in the House of Commons (where theGovernment might well face defeat) and would hardly impressour overseas holders of sterling.    The truth was that any policy could only succeed by a consensus.f. On the other hand it was very difficult for members ofthe Cabinet other than the Chancellor to assess the likelyeffect on foreign confidence of a policy with or without reserve powers.    Great weight had therefore to be attached to his judgment.In further discussion it was suggested that one course which mightease the dilemma facing Ministers would be to refrain from includingthe reserve powers in the Bill which would be introduced following the White Paper and instead to include in the White Paper a pledgethat the Government was determined to ensure success and astatement that the Government had a further Bill in reserve, whichwould be introduced at once if it were needed, to compel observance of the pay limit by all employers.    In considering this proposal, itwas argued that there was a risk that, if the reserve powers werenot included in the first Bill, it would be difficult to carry conviction that the Government would in fact face up to taking statutory powerslater.    It would also be a mistake to think that reserve powers wouldhave little effect upon the course of events - on the contrary, their existence would be likely to have a considerable influence, whichwas one reason why the CBI were in favour of them.    Nevertheless,the battery of sanctions, including some legislation, with which the voluntary policy would be supported was impressive, and theGovernment had achieved a surprising degree of support and under-standing from the Unions.    It might therefore just be possible tohold the exchange rate with the intermediate proposal which hadbeen made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had to reach a very grave judgment, and they should notunderestimate the seriousness of the situation they would face ifthe White Paper failed to carry conviction and a further serious runon the pound developed.    The distinction which had been drawn
between taking reserve powers and holding legislation in reservewas however a subtle and significant one.    The latter course would do much to ensure whole-hearted trade union support for the new policy; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had indicated that hethought it should just go sufficiently far to reassure overseas opinionprovided the statement about the Governments readiness to introduce the further legislation, if needed, were made in sufficiently robustterms and provided tb.&amp; White Paper as a whole appeared to carryconviction at home.   It seemed clear that the existing balance ofopinion in the Cabinet was against the inclusion of reserve powers in the immediate legislation and in favour of a clear statement inthe White Paper that the Government had a further Bill ready for presentation and enactment if this became necessary.    He proposedthat he and the three Ministers who had conducted the negotiationswith the TUC and CBI should meet to consider the redrafting of the relevant paragraphs of the White Paper which would be necessary togive effect to this consensus.    They would also be seeing the tuc and CBI later in the afternoon.    If necessary he would ask theCabinet to meet again following these meetings.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office11 July 19759
