MEDIUM TERMZCONOMICASSESSMENT(previous reference:CC(75) 25thConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(75) 78) covering a note by the Treasury on the allocation of resources in the medium term; a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(75) 79) on the Medium Term Assessment andpublic expenditure;  and a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (C(75) 80) on the issues arising on the other two documents.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Cabinet that this was the first step in the new approach to public expenditure which had been agreed at the Cabinet meeting of 22 May (CC(75) 25th Conclusions, Minute 3).At the present meeting they should aim to take decisions on thetotality of public expenditure.   On 25 July they would considerpublic expenditure priorities, and aim to take decisions on the broad division of resources between the programmes.    In theautumn they would take detailed decisions to be reflected in thenext Public Expenditure White Paper.    The Chancellor of theExchequer had gone further than ever before in displaying to cabinet the considerations which affected the medium term planning of public expenditure, and the Treasury paper set out the quantitative analysis for which Ministers had asked.    It would however be understood that this did not put into commission thefisca! responsibilities ox the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    Hesuggested that the meeting might use the very helpful paper by theCentral Policy Review Staff as an annotated agenda for their discussion, taking first the assumptions underlying the medium term assessment and the Chancellor!s analysis; and thenconsidering the alternative strategies and the proposed cuts in public expenditure.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the background to the proposals under consideration was a severe imbalance in the economy.    In 1974 expenditure by the United Kingdom was 5 per centmore than earnings; and the expenditure of the public sector hadbeen 19 per cent more than the revenue.    The difference had been met by borrowing, half of the public sector deficit being coveredby borrowing abroad (which also helped bridge the balance ofpayments gap) and half at home: the domestic borrowing waspossible only because of an unusually high level of private saving,part of which was the result of the low level of private investment.He was clear that the balance of payments gap would need to be closed by about 1978; and that the public sector borrowing require-ment should be reduced from the 10 per cent of the Gross domestic product (GDP) which it represented at the moment to something more like its normal 2j per cent.    Over the last decade or so, public expenditure had grown from 42 per cent of the GDP to 58 per cent;and in the last five years it had increased by  7, 000 million and 500, 000 people had been added to the public services.    Theproportion of the income of an average family taken in tax had risen from 5. 6 per cent to 18, 9 per cent.    This was the background tothe assessment before them.
The estimates in the official paper were neither a plan nor astrategy;  they were an attempt, using econometric techniques,to foresee what would be likely to happen if present policies were left unchanged.    He was strongly in favour of achieving an improvedeconomic performance; but unless there were reasons to expectthis it would be wrong to take it for granted that an improvementwould be achieved when making forward expenditure plans.    Inconstant prices, and on an average annual basis, it was expectedthat GDP would grow at around 3. 2 per cent, making an additional 1, 600 million of resources available by the end of the period.Of this, some  500 million would be needed to achieve a balanceon external account by 1978 (to set a later target for balance wouldmean borrowing more than the   12 -   15, 000 million which wouldalready be necessary before 1978, and would add appreciably tothe burden of debt which would have to be serviced thereafter).Another  500 miSHon was earmarked for private investment.    Itwas not, of course, possible to say what private investment wouldin fact take place, but this was the order of magnitude needed tomaintain a constant ratio of capital to output.    This left  600 million to be divided between public expenditure (other than the investment of the nationalised industries, which was allowed for in the private investment figure he had just given) and private consumption.    on present plan3 public expenditure would increase by some 2 per cent a year (and add a further 500, 000 staff to public administration by1980), so that private consumption would be able to rise by lessthan 1 per cent a year on average.    In. order to keep private consumption to this low level of growth, taxes would have to beincreased so that the marginal rate of income tax for the averagefamily would be about 5 Op in the pound, a level which wouldcertainly not be acceptable to the trades union movement.In discussion it was argued that the factual analysis in the Treasurypaper was imperfect and wa s not sufficient as a basis for a decisionof this importance.    There were many possible variants whichwere not discussed.    Thus, the assumption that  500 million would be needed for private investment implied that there would bean investment boom in the next few years and it was not at ail clearthat this would take place.    On the balance of payments, to achievebalance by 1978 was a very ambitious target, and it had not beendemonstrated that the price involved was one which should be paid.The figures given by the Chancellor for public expenditure as a proportion of GDP were not significant, because the definition ofpublic expenditure used covered both transfer payments andexpenditure on the acquisition of assets, which were totally different in the claim they made on resources.    Again, the concentration of the tax impact on income tax was misleading,since in practice it would be likely to be met by increases in othertaxes as well.   It was by no means clear what had happened, afterthe Cabinet took the expenditure decisions which were embodied in
the last public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd. 5879), to make such savage expenditure cuts necessary.    The major inputs intothe medium term assessment had not substantially changed, the onlymajor difference being the unexpectedly rapid improvement in thebalance of payments situation.    It seemed that the change was morea change in the value judgment applied than in the resourcespicture.    The Cabinet needed to see some alternative policies andtheir consequences before they could judge if the present proposals were acceptable.    At the last meeting of the National economic development Council, there had been a demand from all sides forthe resumption of some form of national strategic economic planning, and it was arguable that, before any arbitrary targets were agreed, there should be discussion  in the Council and publicdebate on what the priorities should be.    Not only did the term&quot;public expenditure&quot; cover very diverse forms of expenditure with very different effects upon resource use; it also treated transfer payments as if they were not part of personal disposable income,which they undoubtedly were.    There was a tendency to regardhousing financed by private sector funds as a good thing, whilehousing financed through the public sector, which addedito thepublic sector borrowing requirement, was regarded as a bad thing.These semantic difficulties could confuse consideration of the realproblem of resource allocation.Against this it was strongly argued that although there might bedoubt about the precise figures assumed in the analysis, overallih&amp;y  were beyond question an optimistic assessment of what was likely to happen.    It followed that the reductions in plannedexpenditure put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer werethe minimum adjustment that would be needed.    While the definition of public expenditure might be arbitrary from some points of view it all had to be financed either by raising revenue or by public sector borrowing and it was the size of the borrowing requirement that influenced overseas holders of sterling.    Nor would spreading the tax burden differently help the problem: increased indirect taxation added to the cost of living: increased direct taxationproYOkedhigher wage claims.    There was no easy way of raisingmoney.In further discussion the following points were made -a.      There was nothing in the paper to show howproductivity, and thus total production, could be improved.Indeed, it could be argued that even to get back to theaverage annual increase of 3. 2 per cent in GDP positedin the Treasury paper was itself optimistic and Cabinetneeded further information on the micro-economic measuresthrough which this would be done.
b. It would be unrealistic to plan on the assumptionthat balance would not be achieved by 1978 on externalaccount.    The fact that the balance of payments had, inthe last six months, improved a great deal more rapidly than had been expected, meant that more resources, notless, were going into the balance of payments, and did not imply that any extra resources would be available for other purposes.    In any case, it could be argued that the recentimprovement was a temporary phenomenon, stemming fromthe effects of the recession, particularly de-stocking, andthat we should move further back into deficit when economic activity began to pick up.    The question of import controlshad not yet been adequately evaluated and this should bedone.c. The increase which had taken place in public expenditure over the last decade or so would be a matter for congratulation if it had been accompanied by a willingness to shift resources into socially desirableexpenditure such as hospitals and out of socially unjustifiedexpenditure such as inessential private building.    Butthis had not happened and there was a case for some measure of control over such unnecessary building.International comparisons of public expenditure were nohelp when the economies of other countries had improvedso much more than that of the United Kingdom.d. Before deciding on the proposed cuts, Cabinet needed to know more about the effects on employment both in thepublic sector, and in those industries which supplied thepublic sector, particularly the construction industry.    Itwas of fundamental importance to take action to encouragecounter-cyclical investment.    Unemployment would riseabove the 1 million mark before long, and could go as high as ijr million in the course of the following year.    would the reductions in expenditure mean that trained teachers and nurses would be unable to get jobs?    The paper was less thanfrank on the employment implications.    There were alreadysigns that the fear of unemployment was giving rise to increased militancy amongst workers.e. It was questionable whether the Government shouldembark upon savage cuts in public expenditure just at thetime when the Trades Union Congress (TUC)had reached an unprecedent degree of acceptance ofGovernment policy on incomes.
SE......:RETf.       On the one hand it was argued that it was specious toassume that people at large preferred lower taxation to increased public expenditure.     Against this it was argued that higher taxation, particularly higher direct taxation was greatly resented, particularly when people saw what they believed to be evidence of gross waste in public services.In continuing discussion it was argued that it would be prematurefor the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make an early announcement about prospective cuts in public expenditure, before the Cabinet had had an opportunity to discuss how and where such cuts should bemade.    Moreover it was essential that the cuts should be selectedwith due regard to the importance of the individual programmes andnot imposed across the board.    An early announcement would inany case add to the problems of the Party and the Government, andConfederation   before any decisions were taken there should be discussion with theof British     /   (CBL)and the TUC - although it could be predicted that the formerIndustry would want to reduce public expenditure and the latter wouldprobably not welcome any increases in taxation.    Indeed, one possible reaction to the forthcoming pamphlet &quot;The Social  Wage&quot;might be that the Government was already spending quite enoughon a whole range of expenditure programmes and that more attention should be devoted to getting proper value for the money which was being spent.    Any early statement would be a devastatingblow to the recently launched counter-inflation policy, and couldcontribute towards an adverse vote at the full meeting of the TUCon 1 September.    In view of this the possibility of an announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer within the next week should certainly be discussed at a further Cabinet before any decisions were reached.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,while a majority of those who had firmly declared themselvessupported the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposal, it seemed,that the Cabinet were not yet ready to reach a decision on whetherthe planned rate of growth of public expenditure in the years bey ond1976-77 should be reduced to the extent proposed.      Moreover,major points had been raised in connection with the methodology ofthe medium term assessment and the nature of the reductionsenvisaged.    Clearly the Chancellor had to be in a position to maikea suitable reference to public expenditure in the debate beginninggon Monday, 21 July and this should be in as specific terms as was consistent with the progress which the Cabinet could make at thi,sstage.    He therefore proposed that the Chancellor of the exchequer should chair a small group consisting of the Secretaries of Statefor the Environment, for Employment, and for Prices and consumer Protection and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,who would prepare such a statement for consideration by the cabinet at a further meeting to be held later in the week.5
