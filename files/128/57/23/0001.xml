THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO      45CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 53rd ConclusionsFriday 5 December 1975 at 9.30 am10 The Cabinet resumed their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that at themeeting of the Cabinet the day before he had been asked to study the possibility of insisting on the transfer of the Linwood plant to the Government in the event of the closure of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.He would be prepared to put to Chrysler that they should make this transfer free of charge if his recommendations were accepted.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thathe had been asked to explore further the practicabiHty ofmaintaining in operation those parts of the business of Chrysler (UK)Ltd which were profitable.    After careful study he concluded thatthe option presented by Scheme B was even more unfavourable thanthe memorandum by the Secretary of State suggested.    Althoughit involved a payment by Chrysler of  35 million it also involved the Government assuming responsibility for past losses of Chrysler (UK) Ltd.    He would advise against acceptance of any scheme based on a once-for-aU payment by Chrysler,In discussion it was argued on the one hand that the value of a company to the country could not be measured by its profitability.If each unprofitable plant were closed in turn there would be a progressive contraction of the country&apos;s manufacturing base.The domestic market should be protected by the imposition of import restrictions.    From this secure base Chrysler (UK) Ltdshould be taken into public ownership, reconstructed, and broughtto liability.    Once in Government ownership management and workers would have a joint interest in making the company self-supporting.    On the other hand it was strongly argued that thesituation now reached was merely the culmination of a long history.Ten years earlier Rootes had been the weakest of the British motorcar companies.    They had then been taken over by the weakestCHRYSLER(UK) LTDPreviousReference:CC(75) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4
American company,    If the Government took over the companythey would be deceiving themselves and the company&apos;s workers.It would merely postpone the inevitable closure.    While thecountry&apos;s industrial base needed to be reconstructed this companydid not provide the kind of firm foundation on which futurestrength could be built.There was a wide measure of agreement that the Governmentshould not support Scheme 33.    This scheme involved theGovernment taking over the liabilities of Chrysler (UK) Ltd and thereby meeting part of the cost of losses which had already been incurred.    Any arrangement under which the Government alonehad an open-ended financial responsibility for the company, andChrysler made only a defined contribution without any share ofthe consequences of the actual profits or losses, would be extremely hazardous.    The report by Coopers and Lybrand (CL,)commented that the estimates for scheme B contained nocontingency margin for the consequences of a major strike and made inadequate provision for depreciation.    They described itas an inappropriate base for an investment decision.    On the otherhand it was pointed out that the viability criteria in CL&apos;s report were unduly severe and that the report did not specifically saythat scheme B was not viable.    But even setting aside the CLreservations the whole future of the company after reorganisationwas critically dependent on the Iranian contract;  60 per cent ofthe company&apos;s car output depended on this contract.    In practice,however, actual deliveries to Iran had never reached the levelsforeseen in the contract, and the contract itself expired in 1978.While it might be renewed this could not be relied on and Iran had made public its intention to achieve self-sufficiency in theproduction of cars by 1981,    Nor was the contract particularlyprofitable.    However if the Government rejected scheme B withoutthemselves making positive proposals to Chrysler they would be ina weak presentational position when this became public.    Therewould, therefore, be advantage in a further approach to Chryslerin which the Government set out the basis on which they would beprepared to participate in such a reorganisation.There was general agreement that in the event of a completeclosure special measures would need to be taken to mitigate theconsequences and that these would need to be concentrated on thesituation at Linwood where the repercussions of closure on Scottishpolitical opinion were likely to be highly damaging to the Governmentand the opportunities for alternative employment were particularlypoor.    It was essential that any announcement of the closure should set out definitive measures which the Government were going totake.    Proposals for a redundancy scheme had been brought forward as the Cabinet instructed but there were valid objections to any such
scheme.    There would certain.1:/ he public criticism of special measures to assist workers in the motor industry who had been particularly highly paid while many others who were paid lesswere being made redundant, come of them as a direct consequenceof Government policy decisions, and were getting no special assistance.    It was to be expected that many of the skilled workers from Chrysler who would get benefits from such a scheme wouldin fact get alternative employment quickly, but by doing so would put out of work other people who would get no special benefits,,One possible course would be to alter the scheme so that it followedmore closely the scheme for payments to redundant mineworkers.Another alternative was to make similar sums available to attractalternative employment,,    The possibility discussed at the previous meeting of arranging for the production at Linwood of Land Roversand Range Rovers to Government order could be pursued further,while fh; attitude of British Leyland to the Linwood plant mightwell alter if it were made clear to them that they would be givenadditional Government finance if they were to take it over.    IfChrysler went into liquidation there might be other purchasersfor their facilities who might be given assistance.    Alternatively,the Government could itself take over from Chrysler the Linwoodplant and take the responsibility for finding a use for it.    Anothercourse would be to give the Scottish Development Agencyadditional finance to bring additional employment to the ClydeValley,    There might be advantage in appointing a seniorindustrialist to supervise all the action taken to secure alternative employment in the areas affected by Chrysler&apos;s closure, includingthe possibility of purchasing some of the company&apos;s assets.There was general agreement that in the event of Chrysler1 sclosure the Government should introduce import restrictions onmotor cars.    Politically it would be imperative to take positive action and the closure would present the best possible opportunityto secure international agreement for import restrictions, thoughit should not be assumed that such agreement would be easily orcertainly obtained.    It was, however, argued that in practiceimport restrictions would confer few benefits.    It was inability to produce rather than a lack of demand which was at presentlimiting the output of British companies.    If restrictions were imposed they should be strictly temporary because the competitivestimulus to efficiency must not be removed.There was wide support for the view that an effort should be madeto preserve the Iran contract for Britain.    The balance of paymentsbenefits were large and the consequences for United Kingdom/Iranianrelations would be severe if the whole Iranian motor industry wereto be disrupted as a consequence of failures in Britain,    the contract with Iran was the property of the Chrysler Corporation,
riot their United Kingdom subsidiary, and it would accordingly be necessary to try to secure their agreement to its being transferred to British Leyland.    Consideration should also begiven to an early approach to the Iranian Government so thattheir assistance might be obtained in finding a solution to theproblemu which both countries would face,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthere was general agreement i:i the Cabinet that the Governmentshould not participate in scheme 3 in its present form.    Therewould, however, be advantage in a further offer to Chrysler inwhich the Government set out the basis on which they would be willing tc participate in a reorganisation of this kind.    If such an offer were to be made in good faith, however, it would be necessaryfor its rex&apos;ms to be carefully drawn up so as to be acceptable tothe Government if they were accepted by Chrysler,    A number offurther studies should be set in hand against the possibility thatno agree.-/^nt would be reached on this basis including means toensure thai the Iranian contract continued to be met from Britainand the . w-sa-rwus to be taken to mitigate the consequences of theredundancies which would follow Chrysler&quot;s closure.    Themeasures to be considered were any redundancy payment schemeand the provision of additional finance - whether through theScottish Development Agency or by any other means - to attractalternative employment to Linwood.    He himself had favoured theGovernment taking over the Linwood plant from Chrysler - therewould be a strong argument for their doing so free of charge - and ensuring employment by means of a Government order for LandRovers and Range Rovers: but other possibilities of using theLinwood site should be examined.    There would also be advantage in the appointment of an industrial executive to take overallsupervision of the follow-up to the closure including the purchaseof some Chrysler assets and the generation of alternative employment both at Linwood and at other areas affected.    these studies should be undertaken by a group of the Ministers most closely concerned under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer.If the Governments offer were rejected it would be necessary to announce the positive measures which they were taking at the sametime as the decision on Chrysler was announced.   Any announcement should therefore be delayed until the formal agreement of the european commission to the introduction of import restrictions on cars hadbeen obtained and until the reaction of the United States and japanese Governments to the proposal was known.    The cabinet would reach decisions in the light of the final negotiation withChrysler and the report from the group of Ministers who would be considering the alternative courses for mitigating the consequences4
o:T unemployment resulting from the closure and of attractingalternative employment.    It was essential that security was maintained about the Cabinefs discussion on this subject.    Itwould be extremely damaging if the substance of their decisionbecame known before it was possible to set out the reasoningwhich led to their decision.    For tactical reasons any debate onChrysler   might have to be separate from the forthcoming debate on unemployment.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMraister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Industryin consultation with the Secretary of State forScotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Paymaster General to continuenegotiations with Chrysler.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Secretaries of State for industry, Scotland, Trade and Employment andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toconsider further the proposals which had beenmade for action to mitigate theconsequences of the unemployment which wouldresult i  Chrysler closed and of the alternative means of attracting employment tothe areas affected, and to report to the cabinet at their meeting on II December.FURTHERAPPROACHTO THECHRYSLERCORPORATION2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the basis onwhich a final approach should be made to Mr Riccardo.    Therewas general agreement that we could accept no share in pastlosses.    As regards the future, there was an argument for askingMr Riccardo whether there was any basis on which the UnitedKingdom Government could share responsibility with the chrysler corporation.    On balance however it was felt that this was not sufficiently specific and that a firm offer should be put which mr Riccardo would have either to accept or to reject.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, summing up a brief discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that an offer should be made to Mr Riccardo on the basis that while the chrysler corporation would have to cover all past losses the United Kingdom
Government would finiance their estimate of losses over the next two years up to a stated maximum0    Thereafter the United KingdomGovernment and the Chrysler Corporation would have to sharebetween them any continuing losses.    A figure of  40 million hadbeen mentioned as the estimate for Chrysler&apos;s losses over thenext two years but the negotiating team, comprising the Secretaryof State for Industry, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Paymaster General^who would be meeting Mr Riccardo that afternoon, should settlebetween them the precise figure to be put forward and any other outstanding details of the offer.    Should Mr Riccardo reject theoffer there would need to be discussions with the chrysler corporation about redundancy arrangements and the Iran contract,but it would be premature to raise these matters with him until hehad rejected our offer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary&apos;s summing up oftheir discussion.3. The Cabinet discussed the timing of consultation with theEuropean Commission and foreign Governments about import controls on cars on the assumption that Chrysler (UK)Ltd would go into liquidation following Mr Riccardo&apos;s rejection of their offer.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, summing upa brief discussion, said that we should want the Commission totake a firm decision at their regular weekly meeting on Wednesday10 December.    The Commission would however need adsquate timefor discussion and consultation with member Governments.Accordingly the United Kingdom Permanent Representative should forthwith warn Herr Gundelach, the Commissioner concerned, that,while we still awaited a final answer from the Chrysler Corporation,it seemed likely that Chryslers would cease operations in the very near future.    If so we would hope that the Commission would give afavourable ruling on import controls on 10 December.    We wouldmake a formal application to the Commission as soon as possible but in any case Herr Gundelach might want to arrange for someinformal discussion within the Commission on Monday 8 December.It would also be important to support our application to theCommission with lobbying in other Community posts, but. the precise timing of this should be left for further consideration in thelight of the discussion with Mr Riccardo.    It would also be important
to consult the International Monetary Fund and to inform theUnited States Government in good time but this should not be doneuntil it was clear that Mr Riccardo had turned down our latestoffer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary1 s summing up oftheir discussion.Cabinet office December 19757
