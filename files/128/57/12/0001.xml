1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    A provisionalindication was also given of business during the remainder of thespillover^ which would end during the week beginning 10 November.The new Session would be opened on Wednesday 19 November,2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) of the European economic community meeting in Luxembourg on 6 and 7 October had had an intensive discussion of their relations wich Spain.    He had beendisappointed by the attitude of the Irish, while the French had beenmarkedly dispassionate and the Germans had said that they were sending their Ambassador back to Madrid the next day.    Neverthelessdespite these differences after three hours of discussion an excellentstatement had been agreed.    In order to work together with ourCommunity partners he had agreed to send our Ambassador back to madrid but this would also be in the context of delivering a personal message about the future from the Prime Minister.    It needed,however, in his view privately to be recognised that the result of theprotests made to Spain would be a polarisation of views in that countryand an increase in the chances of a violent outcome.    Major Antunes,the Portuguese Foreign Minister, with whom he had discussed thesituation in Luxembourg, considered that the prospects of a peacefulevolution in Spain were now more doubtful, at least so long as general Franco was alive.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported thatthe discussion which the Council had had with the Portuguese ForeignMinister had been more hopeful.    The Community had agreed to make available loans of up to 180 million units of account (some $200 million on a project basis until such time as a financial protocol wasnegotiated.    Major Antunes had told him that the Portuguese people were getting tired of indiscipline and anarchy and had expressedconfidence that his Government would get the rebellious troops under control.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he hadtwice visited the United Nations since last reporting to the Cabinet.There had been some favourable developments.    There had been no serious challenge to Israel1 s right to sit at the United Nations: andthe United Kingdom could be satisfied that its efforts had contributedmaterially to avoiding this.    It remained possible that there might be some minor challenge to Israeli credentials, but this would be of little
significance.    More generally the whole atmosphere in the united nations had been much improved compared with recent years and thisreflected the easier relationship between producing and consumingnations.    On the other hand he was seriously concerned about nuclearproliferation . and in particular the consequences of the vasttrade in plutonium which was in prospect as additional countries builtnuclear reactors.    The technology involved in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel was difficult so there were perhaps five years before this problem would become critical, and he felt that this time must be usedto negotiate a new international convention on nuclear fuels whichwould bind those countries which had not been willing to sign theNon-Proliferation Treaty.    We would have Canadian support on this,and perhaps American support.    The attitude of the Soviet Union was so far reserved.    The major difficulty would be with countries suchas Venezuela^ Erazil and India, which were within sight of havingsignificant quantities of plutonium available from nuclear reactors,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe prospects for an early conclusion of the SALT II discussions nowlooked reasonably good, but that in itself was not enough.    It was essential for the United StaSes and the Soviet Union to go beyond it toa mutual agreement actually to reduce their stocks of weapons andwarheads.    He was encouraged by the deep sense of responsibility which he knew the American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, felt onthis subject.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the differences which had emerged in the Council on 7 October on our bidfor separate representation at the Consumer/Producer Conference hadbeen exaggerated by the Press.    He had made clear to the Councilthree months ago our wish for separate British representation and hehad repeated this over dinner in New York three weeks ago to theUnited States Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger,-, and the french foreign Minister, M Sauvagnargues,    He saw no reason for giving up this request.    It was true that this insistence on our part had given rise to difficulties in the Community.    These might dispose ourCommunity partners to find a solution in the form of a betterCommunity mandate perhaps making provision for a minimum supportprice.    But while it was not possible at this stage to forecast the outcome, the issue of United Kingdom representation remained aseparate question from the mandate and would require separate consideration by the Cabinet.
In discussion it was argued that it was doubtful whether we would achieve our aim of separate representation and it was therefore unwise to irritate our Community partners by persisting with this request.In these circumstances it was surely more important to place the emphasis on an agreed mandate.On the other hand it was argued that, as the largest potential oilproducer in the Community, the United Kingdom had substantiallydifferent interests from other Community members as indeed theFederal German Chancellor had several times recognised in recent months.    Moreover, the scope of the dia.logue had now been widenedto include relationships with developing countries, policy oncommodities and financial institutions and, given our many separateinterests in these areas, it hardly seemed sufficient to be represented by Luxembourg; who would hold the Community Presidency,&apos; at aconference where Norway, for example, would have separaterepresentation.    In any case the more we pressed the issue of separate representation the greater the chance of others makingconcessions to achieve a mandate satisfactory to us.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the line taken by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.    We should continue to do what we could tosecure agreement on a Community mandate,   but for the present atany rate we were right to press for separate United kingdom representation.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.se :ret
HE 3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary ofAW ON State for Employment (C(75) 101), the Secretary of State for the Home&quot;iCKETING Department (C(75) 102) and the Lord Chancellor (C(75) 103) on the lawon picketing.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theGovernments Election Manifesto in 1974 promised that theEmployment Protection Bill would include new safeguards forpeaceful picketing.    There was widespread support within the LabourParty for such legislation, and at an earlier stage in the proceedings on the Bill an amendment had been put down to introduce a new clause the effect of which would have been to declare that the rights ofpickets were not limited to attendance only, but also extended toseeking to persuade others (including those in vehicles) by peaceful means.    The Home Secretary and he had been of the opinion that sucha provision would help to clarify the law, but the provision was regarded as inadequate by the Governments supporters and by theTrades Union Congress (TUC), and the clause had been deleted inCommons Committee,    At a later stage an amendment had been putdown at the Report Stage of the Bill which would have conferred onpickets a limited right to obstruct vehicles in defined circumstances.Although this amendment had won considerable support, it was defeated in the Commons with tne assistance of the Opposition,    since then he had had discussions with the TUC on how the law on picketingshould be amended.    They were not in favour of an amendment on thelines of that proposed on Report,    What they had in mind was there introduction of the earlier amendments, but with the words &quot;fallingshort of obstruction of the highway&quot; deleted from the declaratoryclause,    Li the opinion of the TUC such a provision would make itclear that the rights of pickets were cot confined merely toattendance, and by remaining silent on the overlap between the law onobstruction and immunities for pickets it would allow the police andthe courts some discretion as to whether and when picketingconstituted an obstruction.    The law on this point was confused andthe Government ought to take steps to protect the rights of peacefulpickets as it had promised to do before it was elected.    The proposalto amend the law on conspiracy was less directly relevant to the commitment in the Manifesto, but it was a matter about which serious concern had been expressed by the Governments supporters and bythe TUC following the Shrewsbury pickets case.    He proposed thatthere should be an amendment to the Employment Protection bill which would have the effect of removing the sentencing anomaly which existed under section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of PropertyAct 1875,    He appreciated the force of the argument that any alteration in the law on conspiracy should await the publication of theReport of the Law Commission and their draft Bill on the subject andnot be undertaken piecemeal.    But the Governments supporters hada strong sense of grievance about the present state of the law in this4
matter and they would be resentful if the Government, having theopportunity provided by the Employment Protection Bill to change thelaw, took no advantage of this.    He also appreciated that the state ofthe legislative programme in the House of Lords created difficulties over the introduction of these two amendments to the Bill at this stage.Nevertheless, on balance, he considered that the Government shouldbe seen to be taking action on these matters, even if at the end of theday they were defeated on both points in the House of Lords.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the proposed amendment to the lawon picketing would be most unfortunate and would introduce a greatdeal of new ambiguity into the law on this matter.    Moreover, itwould place him as Home Secretary in a very difficult position ir. hisrelationship with the police.    The precise rights of. pickets under thelaw in every situation were not easy to define, and the Governmentsexperience over the new clause 99 which had been introduced in theEmployment Protection Bill showed how extremely difficult it was to legislate in this field.    The best way forward was to promotediscussions between the TUC and the police with a view to reaching agreement on a code of conduct that was satisfactory to all parties.The police were perfectly willing to enter into discussions with the tuc on such a code of conduct, but they would strongly resent theintroduction of a change in the law on the lines proposed without anyprior consultation and explanation.    There was great strength of feeling throughout the police service (including the Police Federation)on the matter of picketing, and if the Government were to proceedwith the suggested amendment this would greatly damage the relationship between them and the police.    This was a delicaterelationship even in normal times, but in present circumstances when there were so many violent threats to public order, it was of thehighest importance that the Government should not do anything toimpair it.    If there was no possibility that the amendment could becarried in the House of Lords, the choice before the Cabinet was whether it would be preferable to antagonise the police by proceeding as the Secretary of State for Employment proposed, or the TUC by notattempting to amend the law.    On the proposal to amend the law onconspiracy, there was little to be gained by a piecemeal amendment inadvance of the publication of the Report of the Law Commission onconspiracy which was expected very early in 1976.    This report would include a draft Bill on conspiracy, and he understood that it was very likely that the Law Commission^ proposals on section 3 of the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 would be acceptableboth to the TUC and to the Labour Party Conference.    Furthermore,a Bill to amend the law on conspiracy which had been drafted by theLaw Commission would stand a very much better chance of passing through the House of Lords than the amendment under consideration.There was therefore a strong case for awaiting the publication of theLaw Commission&apos;s report before steps were taken to change the law onthis point.5
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that ho endorsed what the HomeSecretary had paid about the serious effect which the proposed amendment of the law on picketing would have on the relationship between the Government and the police.    Apart from this, he did notbelieve that this amendment of the law would be to the advantage ofthe pickets themselves.    The proposed amendment would inevitablycause confusion since the clause would be differently interpreted bythe police and the pickets.    The effect would be to worsen relationsbetween them, to antagonise a wide range of public opinion and toincrease the risk of personal injury to the pickets themselves.    Thebest way to enable peaceful but effective picketing to take place withinthe law was to continue the dialogue between the police and the TUCwhich was initiated before the General Election of February 1974.The arrangements which had been worked out at that time had greatlyhelped to reduce the possibility of friction during the miners&apos; strike.On the proposals to change the law on conspiracy, he was in close touch with the Law Commission and he believed that their proposals to amend the 1875 Act would be satisfactory to the Government andtheir supporters.    There was no reason to suppose that the LawCommissions Bill would be held up in its passage through Parliament,The proposed amendment would however be seen as an apologia for theShrewsbury pickets and as such would certainly be rejected in theHouse of Lords.    In political terms therefore the amendment wouldbe wholly damaging and unjustifiable.In discussion it was confirmed that the Report Stage of the EmploymentProtection Bill was due to be taken in the House of Lords the following week, on 13 and 14 October.    If amendments were to be put down, thiswould have to be done quickly.    Although it was possible foramendments to be considered at Third Reading in the Lords, this wasunusual, and proposals by the Government to amend the Bill at that stage would almost certainly lead to a demand for it to be recommitted.This would mean that the Opposition would raise further points on theBill, which could delay its return to the House of Commons until6 November.    At whatever stage the amendments were to beintroduced, however, it was most unlikely that the House of lords would pass them.    Whatever the Government might feel about the way in which the Lords were using their powers on legislation, the fact was that a number of Bills were now seriously at risk in the House ofLords and any further upsets might mean that Bills could be delayedfor a further year.    There was for example a risk that the CommunityLand Bill might have to be handled under the provisions of the parliament Act.    This suggested that the Government would be wisenot to proceed on picketing by way of amending the law by theEmployment Protection Bill.    On its own merits, the proposed new clause could raise serious difficulties.    It purported to confer rights,but these were not defined, and it would cause serious difficulties both for the police and the courts in the exercise of their discretion as to
what constituted peaceful picketing in any given circumstances.    Itwould be much better, and in the long run more satisfactory from all points of view, if the TUC and the police could be persuaded to renewtheir consultations on the drawing up of a code of conduct for picketing.The code which had been adopted during the National Union of mineworkers&apos; strike in 1974 laid down strict rules which ensured thatpotentially disruptive elements from outside the industry were rejected and dismissed from the scene.    There would be great advantage if a similar code of conduct could be drawn up and endorsed by the TUC and the police as a practical guide which would help toensure that occasions when it was necessary to put the law to the testwere kept to the very minimum.    A further point that should be takeninto account was the position of members of Her Majesty&apos;s forces who were called upon to move essential supplies during industrialdisturbances.    On such occasions, the Armed Services looked tothe police for guidance as to their right to enter industrial or other premises which were being picketed by strikers.    It was essentialthat there should be no doubt about this matter.    OtherwiseServicemen might be unable to cross picket lines and this would place the Government in a wholly invidious position: this kind of problem was best tackled by a practical code of conduct.It was however recognised that many of the Governments own supporters would be dismayed if steps were not taken to protect thelawful rights of peaceful pickets when an opportunity to do sopresented itself in the Employment Protection Bill.    The government also owed it to the TUC to do what they could to meet their wishes onthis question in view of the strong support which Congress was giving to the Governments economic policies.     The TUC were willing tocontinue in discussion with the police authorities over a code of conduct, but they first wanted to be sure that the law was to be changed in such a way as to protect the rights of peaceful pickets.If the Government were to show willingness to change the law, thiswould certainly make it easier for the TUC to reach agreement on a code of conduct, but they did not consider that an agreed code onpicketing was an acceptable substitute for a change in the law.    Itmight however be possible to persuade the TUC that the drawing upof a code of conduct would probably be more to their advantage thanthe kind of provision which it was proposed to introduce by theEmployment Protection Bill, and it was suggested that there shouldbe further discussion of this matter in the TUC/Labour PartyLiaison Committee.    Thereafter, it might be possible for theGovernment to make a public statement to the effect that they had tried to change the law to provide greater safeguards for peacefulpickets; but had found that the subject was not amenable to being dealtwith by way of legislation and that instead they were proposing that a code of conduct should be worked out between the police and the TUC.7
On the proposal to introchice a change in the law on conspiracy it was argued that it would be better to wait until the Law Commission^draft Bill on conspiracy became available early in 1976.    Even if theGovernment wished to, there was little likelihood of changing the lawon conspiracy by way of trying to amend the Employment ProtectionBill in the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the proposed amendment on picketing should notbe tabled in the House of Lords but that instead the Secretary of Statefor Employment, in consultation with the Home Secretary, should try to establish informal discussions between the TUC and the police witha view to drawing up a suitable code of conduct.    If no agreement could be reached between the police and the TUC, the Secretary ofState for Employment would be free to bring the matter back to theCabinet for them to consider further whether to legislate and if so in what form.    As for conspiracy, the Cabinet agreed that it would bebetter to await the report of the Law Commission and the draft bill which would be attached to it.    He noted that this was likely to bereceived very early in 1976 and that it would be possible to include theBill in next Session&apos;s programme.    Meanwhile, a statement should bemade during the passage of the Employment Protection Bill in theHouse of Lords that the Government proposed to proceed in this way.The Home Secretary would also take an early opportunity of making astatement in the House of Commons to the same effect.    Care would need to be taken to ensure that there was no premature disclosure ofthe Law Commission^ proposals to amend section 3 of the Conspiracyand Protection of Property Act 1875,The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Employment,in consultation with the Home Secretary, to establishinformal discussions between the Trades UnionCongress and the police with a view to drawing up asuitable code of conduct on picketing.3. Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for astatement on the amendment of the law on conspiracyto be made In the House of Lords while the EmploymentProtection Bill was in progress there;  and the HomeSecretary to make a statement to the same effect inthe House of Commons.Cabinet Office9 October 19758
