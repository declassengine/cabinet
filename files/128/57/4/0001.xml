\FTk?ER ONTLATIONeviousleference:1(75) 33rdjfonclusions,minute copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 34th ConclusionsThursday 10 July 1975 at 6.30 pmTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet, at their meeting earlier in the day, had faced an acute dilemma resulting from the dual need toavoid a further loss of overseas confidence in sterling and at thesame time to retain the active support of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) in support of the new incomes policy.    Given the initiallydivided views on the best way of resolving this dilemma, it had beenremarkable that the Cabinet had been able to go so far towardsreaching a consensus.    Since that meeting he had considered with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State for employment and for Prices and Consumer Protection the amendments which would be required to give effect to this consensus in the white paper.    They had also had meetings with representatives of the tuc and of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).    The amendmentsmade to the draft White Paper had satisfied the Chancellor of theExchequer that there was a good prospect of the external positionbeing held provided the domestic presentation was right and providedthere was a forthcoming response from the TUC following publication.He had therefore made it clear to both parties that he was speakingad referendum the Cabinet.    He had indicated to the TUCrepresentatives what the Government decision was likely to be andhad asked how they would respond if the Government did not takereserve powers but indicated that it had a Bill in readiness against possible need.    In other words the Government would be indicating itstrust in the unions and hoped that they would indicate that they couldbe relied upon.    The TUC response had been extremely helpful.    the cbi had pressed the need for reserve powers but he had given no indication of the Governments decision.    He had asked them toemphasise the toughness of the Governments approach,,   He nowwished to put formally to Cabinet that they should confirm their acceptance of the recommendation by the Chancellor of the exchequer that reserve powers should not be included in the Bill to be presentedafter the White Paper was published, but that the White Paper should contain a clear indication that the Government had a Bill available forimmediate use should the need arise.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT35
It was also vital that complete secrecy should be maintained about the cabinets discussion and that there should be no hints or suggestions that the course which had been readily accepted by all concernedmeant a victory for those who had opposed a reserve power initially.This would do more than anything else to disturb overseas confidence.The truth was that the consensus reached had not been easy, not justbecause initially views differed, but because most members of theCabinet experienced some degree of division in their own minds on what was the right course.    It was now of paramount importance topresent a united front,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the recommendation of the Chancellor of theExchequer that reserve powers should not be taken in the Bill whichwould follow the White Paper but that a firm statement should be made that a further Bill had been drafted to make it illegal for employers topay over the limit and that this would be introduced forthwith if theneed arose.    He proposed himself to make a statement in the Houseof Commons shortly after 11, 00 am the following day, the White Paperbeing made available in the Vote Office when he sat down.    He and thethree negotiating Ministers would hold a Press conference at noon, which would be televised. He was firmly of the opinionthat exposition of the Governments policy over the coming weekendmust be left strictly to the three negotiating Ministers - the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Employment and theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection - and no other minister should accept any invitation to appear on the media, nor should they make speeches on the subject.    If they were compelledto touch on it at all, their text must first be cleared with the responsible Minister,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office11 July 1975
