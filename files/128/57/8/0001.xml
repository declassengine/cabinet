confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.    It was proposedthat the House should adjourn for the Summer Recess on Thursday,7 August and resume on Monday 13 October.It was reported that, despite informal arrangements which had beenmade through the usual channels, the Community Land Bill wouldnot now be reaching the House of Lords until 16 October;  and itwas very doubtful whether it could be completed within the periodof 2\ weeks which would remain until the end of the proposedspillover.    The Whips would shortly be meeting representativesof the Opposition in both Houses and the future handling of the bill would then be discussed.    The suggestion had been made that theHouse of Lords might come back for a week in Septemberimmediately before the beginning of the Party Conferences; butthey were prepared to agree to this only if the House of Commonsalso returned.    This would not be acceptable, given the extremepressure under which Members had been working during the current session,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that means must be found of ensuring that theCommunity Land Bill reached the Statute Book during the current session, and that there could be no question of deferring it.    Itwould be best if agreement on its handling could be reached withthe Opposition so that it could be completed without any need to alter the proposed arrangements for the spillover.    Failing that,both Houses could in principle be brought back for an extra week in September; but the objections to this course were extremelypowerful.    It might therefore be necessary, should all else fail,to consider extending the proposed spillover for another week anddeferring the opening of the next Session until mid-November.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.court Line Ltd The Cabinet were informed that on the following day separatereports would be published by the Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration (important) and by inspectors appointed by theSecretary of State for Trade about the collapse of Court Line Limited,the holiday and travel firm.    Both the reports were critical of theGovernment for their part in the events preceding the firm&apos;scollapse, arguing that, on the strength of reassuring statements bythe Government - acknowledged to have been made in good faith -holidaymakers had booked with the firm and thus lost their money.1liRLlAMENTARYIfFAIRS
In discussion, it was argued that an opportunity for debating thereports would be demanded by the Opposition.    It would be desirableto accede to their wishes, since there was no doubt that theGovernment had a good case, which should be presented as quickly as possible;  and this could most effectively be done by way of a debate.    It would however be difficult to find the necessary time without either curtailing the other business proposed or deferringthe date of adjournment for the Summer Recess.   A possible alternative course might be to use the opportunity of the debate onthe Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill, which was due to takeplace on 31 July; but this would prevent the Government fromdeploying their detailed arguments and replying fully and effectively to any criticism.In further discussion it was pointed out that the ministerial committee on Industrial Development (IDV) had yet to decide whatthe Governments response to the reports should be.    Whether tooffer further compensation or stand firm on what had been done sofar, also still had to be settled.    Moreover there were the furtherquestions whether a statement should be made when the reports were published and, if so, who should make it.    It might howeversuffice merely to promise a debate before the Recess.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be a half-day debate on Wednesday,6 August on the Court Line reports, and that the vote should be at. 00 pm.    The debate on the textile industry should begin at 7. 00 pmand continue until midnight.    The Court Line debate would raiseissues which would need careful handling - for example, because it had become known to the companies concerned that the LawOfficers had offered an Opinion that the Government had a moralcommitment,    IDV Committee should consider, at their meetinglater that day, what the Governments response to the reports should be; whether there should be a Parliamentary statement whenthe reports were published; and if so, by whom it should be made.It would also be necessary to settle who should speak in the debate;but there were strong arguments for the view that the Secretary ofState for Energy, who was criticised in the reports in respect ofhis then role as Secretary of State for Industry, should wind up the debate.The Cabinet -2.

tTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO     40CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 38th Conclusions, Minute tuesday 29 July 1975 at 10.45 am the The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of StateMOTORCYCLE     for Industry (C(75) 86) about the future of the motorcycle industry.industry the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that for someyears the British motorcycle industry had been in considerabledifficulty, and had received considerable support from public funds.In February 1975, when the Ministerial Committee on IndustrialDevelopment (IDV) had considered the position, they had authorisedhis predecessor to appoint consultants to examine possible strategiesfor the future of the industry.    The consultants&apos; report had now beenreceived and circulated to the Cabinet.    It suggested three possiblelines of approach, which were summarised in Annex A to C(75) 86.A &quot;low volume/high premium&quot; strategy providing work for about halfthe present number engaged in the industry, at a cost of  15 millionpublic investment.    A &quot;medium volume, low premium&quot; strategyrequiring  40 million of investment and providing jobs for about, 000 people;  a &quot;high volume/low premium&quot; strategy providingwork for the 3, 000 currently in the industry, but requiring over 50 million of Government investment.    There was a clear risk thatthe amounts of public expenditure needed would be much greater thanthese estimates.    None of the strategies would enable all threeexisting factories to remain in production:  even on the mostoptimistic assumptions the industry would not recover to a zerocumulative cash flow until the late 1980s,    There were veryconsiderable risks that any of the strategies, if adopted, would failin the face of overwhelming competition, largely from the Japanese.The motorcycle industry was now dominated by Japanese products,which had combined large volume production with advanced design.In 1968 British motorcycles held 70 per cent of the North Americanmarket, which the Japanese had not then entered; in 1974 theJapanese held 70 per cent and the British share had fallen to10 per cent.    As a result of this severe competition, the British had,over the years, restricted production to a narrow sector, and now
concentrated on producing machines of 750cc capacity and above.Even there, the Japanese were proving more successful and theBritish firm of Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT) had 13, 000 machinesstockpiled throughout the world which they had been unable to sell.The Japanese had obtained their supremacy not on the basis ofGovernment subsidy or low wages, but on high capital investment,good design and competitive prices.    The Japanese workers earnedhigher wages than those of NVT, but their productivity was alsomuch higher: the Small Heath factory of NVT produced about10 motorcycles per man per year, whereas the corresponding figure for Japanese firms was about 100.The consultants&apos; report had been examined by the IndustrialDevelopment Advisory Board (IDAB) who had concluded that none of the strategies offered any prospect of viability.    They hadsearched for an alternative, but failed to find one;  reluctantly theIDAB had agreed that there was no future for the British motorcycleindustry.If the Cabinet accepted this view, there would be a difficult problemof presentation.    He had met the workers and management of NVTand of the Meriden Co-operative twice in the last week, and they had laid great store on a letter (reproduced at Annex B to his paper)from his predecessor to Mr Checkley, Convener of Shop Stewardsat one of NVT&apos;s factories, which said that the Government was fullycommitted to securing the future of the motorcycle industry in thiscountry, and that this involved the success of NVT no less than theCo-operative.    Although his predecessor had made ciear in talkingto the workers at NVT that there could be no guarantee ofemployment, and it had been argued that the workers at Small Heathhad rejected the offer contained in this letter of 6 November 1974,there was evidence that the letter would be interpreted as a firm commitment.    The NVT workers had made it plain to him that they wanted immediate nationalisation, and the Government to embark on the &quot;high-volume&quot; strategy.    Representatives of the MeridenCo-operative did not want nationalisation, but were anxious to getthe right to use the Triumph name, which was owned by NVT.    if no promise of further help were given, NVT workers were likelyto go on short-time when they returned from holiday, and it was probable that the NVT factory at Wolverhampton would be closed down, and a receiver appointed, but, for the time being, NVT would try to maintain production in the other factory at Small Heath.The previous Administration had invested  4. 9 million in NVT in1973; the present Government had guaranteed a further  8 million in March 1975, provided  4.8 million of assistance for the MeridenCo-operative and a guarantee of  6 million for export credits.    Ifthe Cabinet now agreed that no further help should be given, there2SECRET
were prospects of criticism by the Public Accounts Committee, theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration and, if NVT went into receivership, by inspectors appointed by the Secretary of Statefor Trade.    Nevertheless, he believed that, in the face of theevidence, there was no reason for the Government to give furthersupport to the motorcycle industry, and he sought agreement to making a statement to Parliament in this sense at an early date,simultaneously publishing the report by consultants.In discussion, it was argued that the consultants&apos; report was afearful indictment of British industry.    It showed that the classicresponse of our industry to foreign competition was &quot;segmentretreat&quot; rather than fighting back.    The same phenomenon couldbe seen in the textile industry.    The consultants&apos; report was not sodespondent as had been depicted.    It said that, although there were some risks, all the strategies showed some prospect of profitabilitywhen new models were produced.    This might indeed mean the 1980s,but the Cabinet had accepted the Ryder report on British Leylandwhich also promised no profits for some years, but had saved amillion jobs.    The motorcycle market worldwide was expanding,and, given the right leadership, the workers in the industry would undoubtedly respond to proposals for either the high or mediumvolume strategies.    The collapse of NVT would bring down theMeriden Co-operative, which was doing well, and the psychological effect of the Governments abandoning of the industry would havewidespread repercussions throughout industry and among theGovernments supporters.The motorcycle industry had an appalling record of bad management.The consultants report made it clear that the loss of market sharearose from the short-term profit-taking which private owners hadpreferred to adequate investment.    The industry had been repeatedlysubjected to investigations by consultants.    The closure of Meridenin 1973 arose from a consultants recommendation; the presentconsultants1 report suggested the closure of two of the three plants.It was hard to believe that, with the present oil crisis, there was nota demand worldwide for a utility motorcycle.    Before anyirrevocable decisions were taken, there should be further discussions with the workers in NVT to find ways of preservingtheir jobs.    It would be intolerable to cut them adrift and offer no alternative livelihood.    It would be wrong for the Government toshelter behind an exegesis of the text of the various letters whichhad been written; there was a clear moral commitment to help thosewho had worked with such enthusiasm om. behalf of the industry.
On the other hand, it was strongly argued that the view of the consultants, the IDAB, IDV and the Secretary of State for industry could not lightly be set aside.    The motorcycle industry hadreceived over  20 million of support in the last three years; the 50 million which would be needed to develop the strategy favoured by NVT would be but the first instalment of an endless series of demands for further funds;  even this strategy would only serve tokeep 3, 000 jobs in being at a time when one million wereunemployed.    It would be an irresponsible and frivolous use ofpublic funds to invest in an industry with so little prospect of success;the money could be deployed with better advantage to create jobs in industries with a more promising future, particularly those in development areas.    If NVT collapsed, unemployment in theWolverhampton and Birmingham areas would rise by about1 per cent; but there were prospects that at least the Small Heathfactory would continue in operation.    Although the strategy of&quot;segment retreat&quot; had been criticised, it was only right to concentrate effort where profits could be earned.    German industry had prospered by exploiting &quot;segment retreat&quot;, concentrating on those sectors in which they were competent and experienced, andneglecting others.In subsequent discussion, the following main points were made -a. It might be possible to salvage some part of themotorcycle industry by supporting the Meriden Co-operativeand undertaking to acquire the assets of NVT if they were offered for sale by a receiver.    On the other hand, it was strongly argued that it was essential to give no undertakings in this sense, and that any proposal for further help to themotorcycle industry should first be submitted by theSecretary of State for Industry to IDV.b. It was important to emphasise in any statement thatthe Government were not abandoning the West Midlandsworkers, but would do their best to help through retrainingschemes and assistance in finding new jobs.    consideration might be given to a special redundancy scheme to supplement the payments which NVT might make, if they were forced toreduce their workforce.c. On road safety grounds, the days of large capacitymotorcycles were numbered.    It would be preferable for theGovernment to support research and development- perhaps in a Government research establishment or through theNational Research Development Corporation - with the aim off producing a low capacity machine suitable for the british market.
d0 The NVT workers had made it plain that, if theGovernment denied them help, they would picket the Meridenworks and prevent the marketing of its products.    Therewas no question of worker solidarity, but every man wasfighting for his own job.    The Meriden Co-operative neededsome alternative vehicle for marketing its motorcycles,and Lord Ryder might be invited to consider how this mightbe done;  the National Enterprise Board (not) might havea role to play.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a clear consensus in the Cabinet in support of the proposals cf C(75) 86,If as a result of the refusal of any further financial assistance tothe motorcycle industry, NVT went into receivership, it would beopen to the Secretary of State for Industry to bring proposals toIDV.    He should, at the same time in consultation with Lord Ryder,consider contingency plans for marketing the products of theMeriden Co-operative, if NVT were to fail.    The Secretary of state should prepare a statement to reflect the views of the Cabinet,, and circulate it to IDV before it was delivered.    The statement should,in particular, draw attention to the past failings of the management of the motorcycle industry; the views of the consultants; and the help available to individuals made redundant.    The statement should be made on Thursday, 31 July, and the Secretary of state should publish, at the same time, the full report by the consultants(with sensitive and confidential information deleted).The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Agreed that no further Government funds should be made available to the motorcycle industry.3.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto prepare and circulate to the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Development a statement to parliament on the lines indicated in the summing up;  and, inconsultation with the Lord President, to arrange tomake the statement on Thursday 31 July,4.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto publish the report by the Boston Consulting GroupLimited on the motorcycle industry (with confidential and sensitive information deleted) as a Parliamentarypaper at the time he made his statement.
5c Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto bring before the Ministerial Committee on industrial Development any further proposals forassistance to the motorcycle industry if, as aresult of the decisions they had reached, NortonVilliers Triumph Limited went into receivership.Cabinet Office30 July 1975
