hiThe Economic.Situationand theBalance ofPayments.Food Supplies.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 8thConclusions,Minute&apos;2.)1. The Cabinet considered again, particularly as regards food imports, the programme of action to remedy the economic situationwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to announce to Parlia-ment later in the day. In their previous discussions the Cabinet hadendorsed proposals to reduce stocks of wheat and flour to a levelproviding for 10? weeks&apos; consumption and thereby to save expen-diture of  7 million; and they had understood that stocks of sugar and of oils and fats were not to be reduced. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, after discussion with the Minister of Food, hehad amended his proposal affecting wheat and would now seek toreduce imports by only  4J million, which would leave stocks equalto 11^ weeks&apos; consumption. At the same time he expected to beable to reach agreement with the Minister of Food to save  3 million on sugar imports and  81- million on imports of oils and fats, leavingstocks of these commodities at levels equivalent respectively to 11and 22 weeks&apos; consumption. On this basis stocks of sugar and oils and fats would remain higher than they were at the end of 1951,though stocks of wheat would be lower.The Cabinet were impressed by the strategic dangers of reducingessential food reserves, particularly of wheat on account of its bulkas cargo. They were, nevertheless, anxious, that the target of  150million in savings of foreign exchange, which the Chancellor of theExchequer had set, should be achieved: without it we could not expect to balance our overseas accounts in the latter half of 1952, aswe had promised the other Commonwealth Government we would seek to do.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to endeavour, inconsultation with the Minister of Food, to achieve thelevel of savings involved in his present proposals byadjustments in imports of food-stuffs other than wheat and flour.(2) Agreed that in his forthcoming statement in the House ofCommons the Chancellor of the Exchequer should include a warning that it might be necessary later to reduce thelevel of food rations.(3) Agreed that, although in general the figures of stocks of imported commodities and the extent to which they werebeing reduced would not be disclosed to Parliament, theChancellor of the Exchequer should exceptionally disclose the figure of  22 million which was to be saved by reductions in imports of tobacco.The Budget. The Cabinet recognised that the steps to be announced later inthe day comprised only a part of the total measures required to solve the country&apos;s economic problems; other complementary measures would be appropriate for inclusion in the Budget. In order that too long a period should not elapse between the measures to be announcedlater in the day and the additional measures to be included in theBudget, the Cabinet endorsed a suggestion already made to the PrimeMinister by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the date of theBudget should be advanced to the beginning of March.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform Parlia-ment forthwith that he proposed to open his Budget on 4th March.
washington and OttawaTalks.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet were informed that members of the opposition were expecting the Prime Minister to take an early opportunity of!making a statement in the House of Commons on his visit to north america. The Prime Minister said that he would have preferred to wait until the Foreign Affairs debate in the following week, whenhe would be able to make a fuller statement and to put intoperspective the issues on which some controversy seemed to have arisen. After discussion, however, he agreed to make a short statement after Questions on 30th January.Egypt.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Foreign Secretary circulated to the Cabinet the draft ofa statement on the situation in Egypt which he was proposing to makein the House of Commons that afternoon.In discussion various amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Took note that, in the House of Commons that afternoon,the Foreign Secretary would make a statement on egypt in the terms of the draft which he had circulated, subjectto the amendments approved in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for an identicalstatement to be made simultaneously in the House ofLords.Cabinet Office, SWA,29th January, 1952.
