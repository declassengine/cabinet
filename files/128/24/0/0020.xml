(52) 49.These made plain the limits imposed on our defence effort by our balance of payments difficulties and the need for an equitable sharingof defence burdens between the North Atlantic Powers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that no effective measureshad yet been taken to spread the burden equitably and that, up to thepresent, assistance from the United States had been less than we were entitled to expect. He had stipulated that we could make no further... contribution to infrastructure, except so far as the cost could be metwholly in sterling, either by expenditure on installations in thiscountry or by the export to Europe of equipment manufactured here.He had, however, told the Foreign Secretary that in the last resort he might agree to some small token expenditure in foreign exchange.The Cabinet Took note of C.

purchase tax and Utility.(previous reference:C.C.(52)5thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinetthat the report of a Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir WilliamDouglas, which had been examining the operation of purchase tax and the utility schemes, would be published on 22nd February. Thereport was critical of the present utility schemes and this aspect of itwould no doubt give rise to public comment. He proposed to circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum on the future of the utilityschemes; but it would not be possible for that aspect of the matter tobe handled until decisions had been reached and announced on those recommendations of the Douglas Report which concerned thepurchase tax.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Housing.Miners&apos;Cottages.&apos;(previous reference:C.C. (52) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Minister of Housing and Local. Government said that,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, he had devised ascheme for increasing the number of houses to be built for occupa-tion by miners. As much of this building as possible would beentrusted to local authorities; but, in addition, the National coal board would establish a Housing Association which would itselfbuild miners&apos; cottages for which no local authority was able to take responsibility. The Association would lease the cottages to theNational Coal Board, and this would have the effect of reserving themfor occupation by miners.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the scheme outlined by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government.(2) Agreed that the details of the scheme should be consideredby the Building Committee.Employment. 6.   The Minister of Labour drew attention to the January figureof the registered unemployed, which stood at 378,700, an increase of-75,800 over the previous month. This increase was likely to giverise to some public criticism. Though partly seasonal, it was largely due to a reduction in the employment of women workers in the textile industries and might persist for some time, since many of theworkers concerned could not readily be absorbed into defence work.The additional contracts for Army clothing which had recently been authorised would be of assistance.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of.Labour.Stone of Scone.        7.   The Cabinet were informed that the Leader of the Opposi-(Previous        tion, who had been consulted in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decisionReference:      of 11th February, had now signified his concurrence in the proposalC.C.

Lords on 11th March suggesting that the Stone should be placed inSt. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. The Cabinet agreed that thedecision to restore the Stone to Westminster Abbey should be announced in the House of Commons only, before the date on whichthis Question was to be answered in the House of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to advise The Queen that theStone of Scone should be replaced in the CoronationChair in Westminster Abbey.
(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Dean of westminster to replace the Stone in the CoronationChair.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would make an appro-priate announcement, in reply to a Question in the Houseof Commons, immediately after the Stone had been restored to its traditional place in Westminster Abbey.Cabinet Office, SWA,20th February, 1952.
