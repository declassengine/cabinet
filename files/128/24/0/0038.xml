Road and rail transport(previous reference:CC. (52) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that he had been informed that atleast two months would be required to prepare legislation giving effectto the Governments proposals for regulating competition between road and rail transport. If that were so, urgent consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of introducing a short Bill to prevent inthe interval action which would frustrate, or be inconsistent with,the Government^ intentions. This Bill, in his view, should include provisions preventing further revocations of licences for long-distanceroad passenger services.In a short discussion it was suggested that it would be more con-venient if road haulage services could be dealt with separately fromroad passenger services.The Cabinet Invited the Committee on Road and Rail Transport to con-sider and report what standstill arrangements could be madepending the introduction of long-term legislation for regu-lating competition between the railways and road services in respect of the carriage both of passengers and of freight.Employment.Textile andClothingIndustries.(previous reference:CC. (52) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onthe unemployment in the textile and clothing industries:  C. (52) 94: by the President of the Board of Trade, summarising the various remedies which had been suggested;C. (52) 103: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering areport by officials on the probable effect of those remedies;C. (52) 112: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the effectof possible modifications of the purchase tax on textiles;C. (52) 117: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, recording thearguments advanced by a deputation from the cotton andrayon industries in favour of abolishing the purchase tax ontextiles;C. (52) 100: by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Defence,setting out the possibilities of stimulating employment inthese industries by additional Government orders.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was to make astatement later in the day, during the debate on the Second reading of the Finance Bill, explaining the measures by which the Govern-meht proposed to counter the increasing unemployment in these industries. There was widespread expectation that the Governmentwould substantially reduce, or even abolish, purchase tax on these goods. The complete withdrawal of the tax on textiles and clothingwould, however, cost the revenue some  90 million in a year; it would undermine the structure of the whole tax; and it would be directlycontrary to the anti-inflationary policy which the Government werepursuing. Moreover, the probable benefit to the textile and clothingindustries would be relatively very small. Only about 30 per cent,of the goods manufactured by these industries were chargeable to tax,and on most of these the tax element was only a small proportionof the retail price. The general recession in business and the accumu-lation of stocks in the trade affected tax-free as well as taxed goods;and there was no certainty that, if the  90 million of taxation wereremitted, consumers would spend any large part of this sum on thepurchase of textile goods. The Ministers concerned had therefore considered other methods of giving more direct and immediate assistance to these industries; and he would like to announce as aresult that the Government were proposing to place forthwith ordersfor textiles and clothing for rearmament and civil defence totallingbetween  20 and  25 million, in addition to the provision already madein estimates for these purposes. This might provide additional employment for some 40,000 people; and the orders could bedirected to the places where unemployment was most serious and
23CC. 38 (52)alternative employment most difficult to find. At the same time hewould seek to end the uncertainty about the purchase tax by statingthat no major remission was to be made, that the &quot; D &quot; scheme wasto go forward and that no amendments would be made in the taxother than adjustments of detail designed to correct anomalies whichwould come up for discussion on the Committee Stage of the FinanceIn discussion the following points were made:  (a) The increase in the March figure of unemployment was likelyto be about 40,000; and almost the whole of this was accounted forby the recession in textiles and clothing. While in the long run itwas desirable that there should be some permanent transfer of labour from the textile industries to other industries, this could not be carriedout quickly. It was therefore justifiable to take short-term actionto relieve the situation. If these additional supplies of clothing were obtained in the current year, there would be correspondingly less tobe ordered in the two following years; but by then the engineering and aircraft factories in these areas would be ready to absorb moreunskilled labour on defence production. Moreover, the additionalGovernment orders now proposed represented in part a restorationof cuts which had been made on account of financial stringency.(b) It was desirable that in his announcement the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should draw attention to the balance of defence orders,amounting to some  40 million, remaining to be placed within theprogramme already provided for in estimates.(c) The Cabinet appreciated the objections which the Chancellorof the Exchequer felt to any substantial modification of the purchase tax on textiles and clothing. It was, however, argued that anadditional  20 million of Government orders would not in itselfsuffice to remedy the situation, and that this action should be supple-mented by some adjustment of purchase tax. The general feeling ofthe Cabinet was, however, against abolishing the tax on textiles. Andany forecast of substantial modification of the tax would, unless detailscould be announced at once, greatly increase the uncertainty in theindustry. The falling-off in production and sales was largely attribu-table to the belief that prices might fall further and that the tax wouldbe modified. A firm announcement about the tax on the lines pro-posed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be the most practicalway of reducing uncertainty and of stimulating renewed activity.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce later in the day (i) that the Government, having examined themeans by which assistance could best be given to the textileand clothing industries, had decided against any substantial modification in the purchase tax; that the &quot; D &quot; scheme would be proceeded with; but that, on the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, he would be ready to examine anomaliesand difficulties of detail arising in the administration of the tax; (ii) that in the Governmenfs view a better and more direct means of giving assistance would be by adding forth-with, to those textile and clothing orders remaining to beplaced within the present approved estimates, further government orders for defence purposes to a total of between  20 and  25 million.Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W.8th April. 1952.
