71CC. 47 (52)bechuanaland protectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference:CC. (52) 45thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Commonwealth Secretary said that on the previous day he had again received the deputation from the Bamangwato Tribeand had informed them that the Government had considered the irrepresentations but were unable to modify their decisions. Later inthe day he would make a statement to this effect in the House ofLords. He might then be asked whether the Government were willingto meet the cost of the deputation^ journeys to and from this country.Although they had not been invited to come here, he thought it wouldbe a gracious gesture if he offered to pay their travelling expenses.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Commonwealth secretary and agreed that he should offer to pay the travelling expenses incurred by the deputation from the Bamangwato. Tribe intravelling to and from this country.Jamaica.constitutional changes.Malaya.(previous reference:CC. (52) 10thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet took note of certain changes in the constitutionof Jamaica which had been approved by the Colonial Secretary and announced that morning, both in this country and in Jamaica.3. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a photograph, pub-lished in the Daily Worker on the previous day, which purported toshow a Royal Marine Commando holding the severed head of aMalayan patriot shot during a jungle patrol.The Colonial Secretary said that he had already institutedenquiries with a view to ascertaining whether this was a genuine, ora composite, photograph. The Lord Chancellor said that he had asked the Attorney-General to consider whether proceedings could be instituted against the newspaper in respect of this publication.The Prime Minister asked that these enquiries should be pursuedvigorously and that an early report should be made to him.Korea.(previous reference:CC. (52) 5thConclusions,Minute 6.)Use of NapalmBombs.ArmisticeTalks.4. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the strictures made bythe Archbishop of York in a diocesan leaflet on the use of napalm(jellied petrol) bombs by United Nations forces in Korea.In discussion it was pointed out that weapons of a similar typehad been used by British and United States forces in the last war;and that there was no logical basis for differentiating between different types of incendiary or,flame-throwing weapons. The Cabinet agreedthat there were no sufficient grounds for inviting the United StatesGovernment to reconsider their use of this type of weapon in Korea.The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet recent develop-ments in the armistice discussions in Korea. On two of the outstanding difficulties, viz., the reconstruction of airfields in north korea and the choice of neutral observers, the United States Govern-ment had offered concessions in the hope of securing a generalagreement. But on the third point, the exchange of prisoners ofwar, they had taken a firm stand against surrendering the relativelylarge number of prisoners who were unwilling to return to territorycontrolled by the Chinese Communists. In this they had throughoutreceived our full support, which we had given with the agreementof all other Commonwealth Governments. It had been expected thatthe views put forward on this point by the United Nations Com-mander would be summarily rejected by the Communist negotiators;but they had asked instead that the discussions should be adjourned,and it was possible that they might be ready to compromise on thispoint.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.42221b 2
Egypt and 5.   The Foreign Secretary reported that little progress was beingthe Sudan.       made in the conversations which he had been holding with Amr(Previous        Pasha, the Egyptian Ambassador in London.  It seemed impossibleReference:      to find a formula which would be acceptable to both sides regardingC.C. (52) 43rd   the Egyptian claim to sovereignty over the Sudan.   The ForeignConclusions,    Secretary read to the Cabinet a new draft which he had prepared for minute 2.)       this purpose. In this he had gone as far as he could to meet Egyptiansusceptibilities,  while  safeguarding  the  essential  rights  of  the-Sudanese.   He proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairoshould present this on his return to Egypt at the end of the week;but he had little hope that it would prove acceptable to the egyptian government.  If nothing came of this latest attempt to find a basis on which we could resume discussions with the Egyptian Governmentwith a view to negotiating a new agreement on defence and the Sudan,we should have to try to arrive at some modus vivendi by which wecould retain our existing position in Egypt for the time being.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Foreign Secretary undertook to arrange for his latestformula about the Sudan to be circulated to other members of theCabinet so that he could take into account any comments which anyof them might wish to offer.(b) The Minister of Defence suggested that it might be helpfulat this stage in the negotiations to suggest the appointment of an anglo-Egyptian Military Committee to consider ways and means bywhich we could assist in training and re-equipping the Egyptian Army.This might give encouragement to the Egyptian Army, who were known to be well disposed towards us, and its activities might be welcome to other friendly elements in Egypt.(c) The Prime Minister hoped that no opportunity would be lost of bringing home to the United States Government our unwilling-ness to continue indefinitely to carry alone the international burden of safeguarding the security of the Suez Canal. The Foreign secretary said that, while he would continue to keep this in mind, he was unlikely to make much impression on the United States authorities at the present time, since they were disposed to think that he shouldhave been ready to make further concessions about the Sudan for thepurpose of reaching an agreement with the Egyptian Government.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints raised in discussion.Persian Gulf. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that in Kalba, which adjoins theUsurper of Sultanate of Muscat and had formed part of Sharjah, power hadKalba. recently been seized by a usurper.  The Sultan of Muscat arid the ruler of Sharjah were anxious that, the usurper should withdraw;and it had been ascertained that he would do so if a show of force were made.   Native levies under our control were to be used forthis purpose.The Foreign Secretary said that he had thought it right to mentionthis to the Cabinet as it was possible, though unlikely, that there might be some fighting before the usurper withdrew.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
7. The Cabinet considered the date of publication of the white paper on Transport Policy in the light of the discussions to be held with the British Transport Commission and of the publication inthe Press of forecasts of the Governments policy. The discussions with the British Transport Commission were to be opened later inthe day and the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power hoped to be in a position to report their outcomeat the Cabinefs next meeting. The White Paper might then bepublished in the following week.It was agreed that the Government should take an early oppor-tunity of explaining their policy to the trade unions directly concerned; but this could not be done until after the publication ofthe White Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power to proceed with his consultations withthe British Transport Commission on the Governmentsroad and rail transport policy and to report the outcomeat their next meeting.Passenger Fares. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that he would also be discussing with the British transport commission the problem of passenger fares. The Commission mightbe willing to give effect to the Governments policy on London fares;but on the other hand they might ask for a formal direction, whichthe Minister of Transport would no doubt be ready to give ifnecessary. The modified increases of railway and passenger faresoutside London might, if the Cabinet so wished, be brought into effect in a few weeks&apos; time. But the adjustment in London passenger fareswould take longer to complete and it might be better to defer the changes outside London until all passenger fares could be adjustedconcurrently.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power to aim at making the necessary changesin passenger fares both outside and inside&quot; Londonsimultaneously.   .Road and rail transport.(previous reference:CC. (52) 45thConclusions,Minute 3.)Draft white paper onTransportPolicy.british broadcasting corporation.Renewal of the charter.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(C. (52) 130) covering a re-print of the draft White Paper on broad-casting, which had been amended mainly in order to provide that parliament should have an opportunity of considering the conditions on which licences might eventually be given for television broad-casting by bodies other than the B.B.C. before any such licences were actually issued.The Lord President said that the Postmaster-General and the broadcasting Committee had now, in this new draft of the white paper, submitted proposals which they believed would secure thelargest measure of agreement among Government supporters. Underthe draft, the monopoly of the B.B.C. in television broadcasting would ultimately be ended. But the position of the Corporation would bemaintained in all other respects. No sponsored broadcasts by theCorporation would be permitted and all available resources wouldbe devoted, for the time being, to the completion by them of anadequate national system. This meant that no private broadcastingwould be permitted for a number of years; and government supporters were willing to accept the condition that, before it was permitted at.all, the conditions of the licences to be issued to other bodies should be submitted for Parliamentary approval.
23ciCoaL 9.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theItalian Labour  Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power in the Mines.    and the Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (52) 132) reporting the dead-lock which had developed in the employment of Italians in the mines.Nearly 2,400 Italians recruited for coal mining had arrived in this(In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was pointed out that the provision for parliamentary discussion in paragraph 8 of the draft White Paper, though it might in terms enable Parliament to reject all proposals for the issue of licences for sponsored broadcasting, would be read in the light of the definite statements in paragraphs 6 and 7, which accepted the principleof allowing some sponsored broadcasting. If the intention was thatthe decision for or against sponsoring should be left to Parliamentwhen it became practicable to issue licences, paragraph 8 should be amended to indicate that Parliament would have an opportunity of considering, not merely the conditions to be attached to licences, but&apos;the question whether or not such licences should be issued at all.Such a change in paragraph 8 would require consequential redraftingof paragraphs 6 and 7. The Postmaster-General indicated that, while he would have preferred paragraph 8 openly to reserve the powerof decision for or against sponsored broadcasting to Parliament, itwas clear that those Government supporters who favoured the ending of the B.B.C. monopoly would not be satisfied unless the principleof allowing some sponsored broadcasting were explicitly accepted.(b) It was agreed that, if the White Paper were to continue toindicate a Government decision in principle in favour of sponsoredbroadcasting, paragraph 8 should at least be redrafted to indicatethat those terms and conditions to be attached to private licenceswould be placed before Parliament, not on the occasion of the issueof each licence, but before the first licence was granted.(c) The Cabinet felt that possible opposition to sponsored broad-casting in any form might be lessened by deletion of the word&quot; commercial &quot; in paragraph 8.id) Doubt was expressed about the suitability of inviting the archbishop of Canterbury to act as Chairman of the committee proposed in paragraph 18 of the draft White Paper to appointGovernors of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The purpose ofthe proposal was to remove these appointments from the politicalarena. But the Cabinet agreed that this purpose might more appro-appropriately be served by asking the Speaker of the House of commons to preside over the suggested Committee. In a Committee of five members there would be no necessity to provide for a casting vote.(e) Consideration would have to be given to the handling of theParliamentary debate on the White Paper. One possibility wouldbe to call upon Government supporters to approve the White paper as announcing decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. It waspossible, however, .that opinion against sponsoring might become more vocal after the publication of the White Paper. On the otherhand, there was some risk that a free vote might&quot; be adverse to theWhite Paper, since the Opposition could be exoected to vote solidlyagainst it. It might prove necessary to take account of the develop-ment of opinion after publication; and, if a strong body of adverseopinion were to develop, to modify the Government^ proDOsals in thedirection of leaving the decision for or against sponsoring entirelyopen until nearer the time when it would be Dracticable for stations to be erected by private interests.The Cabinet Subject to the points made in discussion, gave approval inprinciple to the draft White Paper attached to C.&quot; (52) 130with a view to its publication in the week beginning12th May.
75CC. 47 (52)country, of whom about half had actually been placed in the pits.There was, however, firm and growing local opposition to their employment from the National Union of Mineworkers, and placingswere virtually at a standstill. At Bullcroft colliery, near Doncaster,31 Italian miners had been suspended because other miners refusedto work with them. The Ministers concerned had reluctantly reachedthe conclusion that we had much more to lose than to gain by bringing further pressure to bear on British miners in this matter;and the Minister of Labour was being asked to seek other employ-ment for the Italians not likely to be placed in the pits. In thesecircumstances further recruitment from Italy must be suspended.The Cabinet agreed that it would be unwise to press further theemployment of Italians in the mines. The reluctance of the Britishminers to accept them was in part attributable to the increased recruit-ment of British miners to the pits. While it was vital to increaseman-power in the mines, there was a serious risk that the stoppageswhich might result from further pressure on the miners would reducecoal output by far more than the amount which could be raised bythe use of Italian labour. It would not be practicable to solve theproblem by segregation of Italian labour in one or more individualpits.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (52) 132 that the National coal board should not be asked to insist on the reinstatement of italian labour at Bullcroft colliery.Employment.Textile andClothingIndustries.(previous reference:CC. (52) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the debate in theHouse of Commons that afternoon would be held on an opposition motion calling upon the Government to consider removing thepurchase tax from textiles in order to alleviate the rising unemploy-ment in the textile and clothing industries. This was obviously amanoeuvre designed to embarrass the Government, since the wording of the motion followed very closely that of a motion recently tabled by Mr. Ralph Assheton, M.P., and other Government supporters.Mr. Assheton had, however, now tabled an amendment which &quot;putforward the alternatives of reducing or amending the purchase tax and also mentioned other measures, including the acceleration oforders for textile goods, which might provide increased employmentin these industries. The Chancellor said that he proposed to accept this amendment on behalf of the Government.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,.   29th April, 1952.
