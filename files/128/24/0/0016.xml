Demise of theCrown.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements proposed for the attendance of Ministers at the Funeral of. His late Majesty inSt. George&apos;s Chapel, Windsor. ;   -The Cabinet were also informed that the Address from the House,of Commons in reply to The Queen&apos;s Message.would be presented to Her Majesty on the following day by a number of Privy Councillorsrepresenting all political Parties. The corresponding Address fromthe House of Lords was to be presented, in accordance with precedent,by the Lords with White Staves, though the Messages Of Condolenceto the Queen Mother and Queen Mary were to be presented by anumber of Peers representing the Church and political Parties.The Cabinet would have preferred that the Address to The Queenfrom the House of Lords should have been presented by a numberof representative Peers; and they suggested that this procedure shouldbe followed on future occasions when simultaneous Addresses wereto be presented from both Houses of Parliament.The Coronation.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Lord Chancellor said that, since the Cabinefs meetingon the previous day, he had satisfied himself that there were no consti-tutional reasons why The Queen should not visit other commonwealth countries, if She so desired, in advance of the Coronation.Parliament. 3.   xhe Cabinet considered when the House of Commons shouldBusiness in the resume the debate on foreign affairs which had been interrupted byHouse of the death of the King. The Opposition wished to complete the debateCommons. on their amendment to the Government Motion; but they were not likely to press strongly for the debate to be taken in the first week of the resumed sittings. Owing to the meeting of the North atlantic council the Foreign Secretary would not in any event be able to bein attendance for this debate unless it were unduly delayed.The Cabinet Authorised the Chief Whip to discuss through the usual channels a proposal that the debate on foreign affairs shouldbe resumed on 21st February.Germany.denfence contribution.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that discussions were now proceeding with the German Federal Government on thefinancial contribution to be made by them for defence purposes. Wehad originally suggested that they should make a contribution of13 milliard Reichsmarks. It was now clear that they would be unwilling to make so large a contribution, and the United StatesGovernment seemed willing to concede a much lower figure in orderto obtain an early settlement. It was important to us to reach agreement on a figure approaching as nearly as possible the level of contribution which we had first proposed, since a contribution at thelevel contemplated by the German Federal Government would mean:that at any rate after the current year we should have to find our occupation costs from our own resources. Before the Lisbon meetingof the North Atlantic Council he would be discussing the matter withrepresentatives of the other Governments concerned, and in particularwith the United States Secretary of State. He would continue to press for a settlement on as high a figure as appeared practicable and. would refer again to the Cabinet before any final conclusion was reached.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
Gold Coast 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ColonialAmendment of Secretary (C. (52) 28) proposing certain amendments in the newthe Constitution, constitution of the Gold Coast designed to give&apos;an appearance of greater authority to the Leader of the Government Party in the Legis-lature. It was proposed that the Leader of Government Business inthe Legislature should have the title &quot; Prime Minister &quot; and that theExecutive Council should be called &quot;the Cabinet.&quot; The governor would choose the Prime Minister, but would submit his choice for theapproval of the Legislature; and he would consult the Prime minister before,nominating the African Ministers for approval by the Legis-lature and assigning their portfolios to them. It was also proposedthat, in Cabinet, the Prime Minister should rank next in order ofprecedence after the Governor.Government 5.   xhe Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Lordindustrial       President (C. (52) 20) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 21) f)Workers.        on the length of the paid holidays of industrial workers in Govern- ^Paid Holidays,  ment establishments.The Lord President said that the present conditions of employ-ment of Government industrial workers included one week of paidholiday a year in addition to paid leave on the six Bank holidays and on three traditional&quot; privilege &quot; holidays; The trade unions were pressing for an additional week of paid holiday, and they might beable to secure some concession at arbitration, since two weeks ofpaid holiday were now enjoyed&apos; by a majority of workers in privateemployment. The Home Affairs Committee had examined theproblem and, of the alternative courses set out in paragraph 4 of his memorandum, were disposed by a majority to advocate concession of the claim for a second week of paid holiday in 1953 without anyoffer of cash compensation for withholding it in 1952.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was anxious that the Government should not grant an extra week of paid holidayat a time when economic difficulties made it necessary to make ageneral call for sacrifices and for harder work. He recognised, how-ever, that some concession must be made and he therefore proposed the offer of an extra three days of paid leave in 1952.(b) On the other hand, it was argued that, while it would be impracticable to withdraw the three &quot; privilege &quot; holidays, an additionof three days of paid holiday only, which would take them intoaccount, would not be regarded as the equivalent of conditions inmost private employment, which provided for a full fortnight of paidholiday. The Minister of Supply favoured an immediate concession of the full claim in order to avoid resentment among his existingemployees and to make it easier to recruit the others needed for the rearmament programme.(c) Quite apart from its incompatibility with the economic measures which the Government were now taking, immediate con-cession of the full claim would be likely to lead to the rapid extensionof the second week of paid holiday to employments which did not now enjoy it. This would reduce output in a number of key occupa-tions, of which perhaps the most important was work in the docks.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to offer to concede in 1953 the claim of Government industrial workers to an additional week of paid holiday, without offering anycash compensation for withholding this in 1952; and agreedthat the trade unions should be left, if they so desired, to seek application of this concession before 1953 by arbitration.
The Colonial Secretary said that his predecessor had given whatwould generally be regarded as a pledge to make these changes. Theywere, moreover, strongly pressed by the Governor of the Gold Coast.Though he could not welcome them, he was satisfied that, as thingshad gone so far, there was a definite balance of advantage in accepting them.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Paragraph 7 (d) of C. (52) 28 was somewhat ambiguouslyexpressed. It was, however, the view of the Cabinet that, when theGovernor was absent from the Colony, the Officer administering theGovernment should take precedence over the Prime Minister andshould preside over the Cabinet.(b) The Commonwealth Secretary said that these changes mightexcite some alarm in South Africa and he would like to have anopportunity of explaining them to the Union Government before any announcement was made.The Cabinet :Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above,approved the proposals in C. (52) 28.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C. (52) 29) regarding the decision of the economic policy Committee to postpone the erection of a factory at EastKilbride, near Glasgow, for the John Deere Plow Company ofMoline, Illinois,The Secretary of State for Scotland said that in the spring of1951 the previous Government had confirmed the undertaking tobuild this factory, subject only to the overriding priority of the,defence programme; and on the faith of this undertaking the firm had enteredinto large commitments and incurred considerable expense. Thereversal of this decision would be strongly challenged in Scotland,where it would be quoted by nationalists as an illustration of thedanger of allowing Scottish affairs to be controlled from London; andit was possible that the Chairman of the Scottish Industrial EstatesCompany, who would have built the factory, would resign his position on the ground that he could not be a party to a breach of faith.The President of the Board of Trade said that the erection ofthis factory would involve the expenditure of  750,000 of public money and the use of 2,000 tons of steel. The factory, though a valuableproject in the long term, would earn no dollars for three or four years.Faced with the task of sharing out among many claimants a smallallocation of steel for industrial building, he had not felt able to put this project high on his list of priorities. He had been compelled to postpone many factory-building projects which were more deservingof Government assistance. He had explained the position to the firm and to the Chairman of the Scottish Industrial Estates Company, andhad offered to discuss the matter again with them in the autumn, when;it might be possible to indicate when building could begin. He wasalso exploring the possibility that work on the development of the site might be begun in the meanwhile in conjunction with the prepara-tion of a neighbouring site for a factory to be erected by the rolls royce Company.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Unemployment in Scotland now stood at 3-2 per cent. Itwas true that the rate of unemployment was much the same in SouthWales. But under the previous Government a good deal of factorydevelopment had taken place in South Wales indeed, it was arguable that this policy had been carried too far and strong arguments couldbe adduced in favour of undertaking more factory building in theindustrial areas on the Clyde.industrial building.John DeereProject at East Kilbride.
(b) This project seemed to require a large amount of steel in pro-portion to its size. The steel requirement might perhaps be reducedby the adoption of a more economical design. fIn this connection The Prime Minister asked what progress hadbeen made with the enquiry into the possibility of securing greatereconomy in the use of steel by reducing building specifications.ic) All difficulties would be overcome if this American company were able to erect the factory at their own expense and with UnitedStates steel provided outside the total steel allocation already madeto the United Kingdom by the United States Government. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that he was considering to what extent arrangements could be made on those lines.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should not take a finaldecision on this question until they had completed their review ofthe steel situation generally and, in particular, of the extent to whichsteel should continue to be exported from the United Kingdom. Thesequestions were to come before them at their meeting on 14th February.The Cabinet (1). Agreed to resume their discussion of . C. (52) 29 on14th February or at a meeting in the following week.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, as chairman of the Building Committee, to arrange forfrequent reports to be made to the Cabinet on the progressof the enquiry into the possibility of securing furthereconomy in the use of steel by adjusting buildingspecifications.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate tothe Cabinet a note on the other projects for factory building on which work had been delayed or suspendedby reason of the current shortage of structural steel.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th February, 1952.
