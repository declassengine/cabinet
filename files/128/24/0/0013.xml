The Demise of 1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theJie Crown. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 24) on the arrangements to be&quot;(Previous made for public observance of The King&apos;s Funeral. As requestedReference: by the Cabinet on the previous day the Chancellor had consultedC.C. (52) 12th with other Ministers directly concerned and recommended that thereConclusions, should be no general suspension of work on the day of the Funeral.Minute 2.)       Government establishments on the line of route of the funeralprocession should, however, be closed to the public until after theprocession had passed.In discussion there was general agreement with this recommenda-tion. As regards schools the Cabinet considered that the Ministryof Education, though they could not enforce a uniform procedurethroughout the country, should give strong advice to the responsibleauthorities to keep the schools open.It was agreed that, if these proposals were approved, a somewhatshorter announcement should be made than that proposed in annex B of C. (52) 24.  This should be in the following terms:  &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers have advised that, in accordance withprecedent, there should be no general suspension of work on [date- to be inserted] the day of the late King&apos;s Funeral.&quot; Her Majesty knows well that Her Father will be constantly inthe thoughts of Her people throughout the day. It is Her wish that,as a mark of respect for His memory, a two-minute silence should be observed at [time to be insertedl during the time of the FuneralService at St. George&apos;s Chapel, Windsor,&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there should be no general suspension of workon the day of the late King&apos;s Funeral.(2) Agreed that, subject to Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure, a public announcement should be made by the Home Secretary inthe terms set out above.In the light of the Chancellors memorandum (C. (52) 24) theCabinet considered whether they should offer any further suggestionregarding the date of the Funeral. After discussion they agreed thatthere were no sufficient grounds for modifying the view, which theyhad formed on the previous day, that the Funeral might take placeon Friday, 15 th February.The Cabinet were informed of the terms of a telegram receivedfrom The Queen in reply to the message of condolence which hadbeen despatched on their behalf on the previous day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been con-sidering whether, in view of The King&apos;s death, he should advise theFinance Minister of the Irish Republic to postpone his forthcoming visit to London. The Foreign Secretary said that he was due to holdvarious conversations with Ministers from abroad during the period before the Funeral. He had taken the view that public business must continue to be transacted, and that visits of this kind need not be cancelled though he would, of course, refrain from offering publicentertainment to any visitors who came to this country on officialbusiness during this period.  .The Cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, in the light of these,whether it was necessary to modify the arrangements made for the visit of the Finance Minister of the Irish Republic.Parliament 2.   The Minister of Health said that it was proposed that Parlia-business in ment should meet on 11th February to receive a Royal Message onthe House of the death of The Sovereign and to move appropriate Addresses inCommons.       reply.  Members of the two Houses might then attend the inceptionof the Lying-in-State of His late Majesty in Westminster Hall andwould adjourn thereafter until 19th February.
The House of Commons must be informed on 8th February ofthe business to be taken when their sittings were resumed 01^19th February. It was proposed that on 19th and 20th February the*House should consider a number of minor Bills which were unlikely to give rise to controversy. The business for 21st February mightbe left for further consideration after consultation with the Opposi-tlon through the usual channels. It was not yet known whether theOpposition would press for the early resumption of the debate onforeign affairs. It would be difficult for the Foreign Secretary to take part in such a debate in that week, as he expected to have to leaveLondon early on 20th February for the Lisbon meeting of the north atlantic Council. Other possible subjects for discussion in theHouse of Commons on 21st February were Supplementary Estimatesor the National Health Service Bill.Business in the The Lord Privy Seal said that he would consider the forthcomingHouse of Lords, business of the House of Lords in the light of arrangements to bemade in the House of Commons and of the views of the Opposition.It might be desirable for the House of Lords, soon after the resump-tion of normal business, to hold a debate on the economic situation oron foreign affairs.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been discussing with the Indian Finance Minister, who was visiting London,the terms of an agreement limiting the extent to which India coulddraw on her sterling balances in 1952. An agreement limiting India&apos;sdrawings to  35 million in 1952 had been virtually concluded by theprevious Government. The Minister had now given his personalassurance that he would do his utmost to avoid withdrawing the full amount authorised by this agreement. He had also promised toreduce India&apos;s demands on the sterling area reserves by the full amount of nearly  60 million in a full year which had been suggested at the recent Meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers. In thesecircumstances the Chancellor proposed to conclude the sterling balances agreement; but he would seek the Prime Minister^ coveringapproval before finally doing so.The Cabinet took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfiedthat the announcement of the new rates of interest on housing loansshould not be further delayed and he proposed that it should be madeon 8th February. The new rates would become effective on 9th February. In order to meet the views expressed in the cabinets discussion on 5th February, it would be announced at the same time that the Housing Ministers were opening negotiations with the localauthorities regarding the adjustment which should be made in housing subsidies in the light of this increase in interest rates.
