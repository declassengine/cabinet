The Cabinet agreed that for the debate on passenger fareswhich was to be held in the House of Commons on 28th April aGovernment motion should be tabled in the following terms: -&quot; That this House approves the action taken by the Ministerof Transport to suspend the introduction outside the london area of new railway charges which would have increased dis-proportionately the cost of season tickets, workmen&apos;s fares andconcessionary rates for special classes of passenger; upholds thedecision that these disproportionate increases should not beapplied to railway charges outside the London area; and agrees that means should be sought of applying the same principle,so far as practicable, to the rail and bus fares already introducedwithin the London area.&quot;LocalGovernmentElections.(previous reference:CC. (52) 31stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister said that in present circumstances hethought it necessary that Ministers^ including members of the Cabinet,should accept speaking engagements in or near their constituencies inthe forthcoming local government elections. He had authorised theLord President to invite Ministers to do so.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Legislative 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterProgramme.     0f Health (C. (52) 133) indicating that it would not be possible to(Previous        enact both the Iron and Steel Bill and the Transport Bill in the currentReference:      session unless the session were continued until about the end ofCC (52) 17th   February or the summer recess were reduced to no more than threeConclusions,    weeks.   To delay the opening of a new session until the beginningMinute 3.)       of March would leave insufficient time for the completion of essentialfinancial business by the end of that month.   It would in any event be impossible, if both Bills were passed in the current session, to open a new session during  1952;  and there were substantialdisadvantages in deferring the opening of a new session until afterthe end of the calendar year.   In these circumstances it seemed desirable that one or both of these Bills should be postponed untilthe following session.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Cabinet were agreed that the passage of the transport bill was more urgent than that of the Iron and Steel Bill. no substantial change in the actual management of the iron and steelindustry would be made by the latter Bill; whereas the Transport bill would bring about substantial and urgent changes in the management of the road haulage industry. The enactment of. the Iron and steel bill should therefore be deferred until the following session, thoughit might be desirable to publish it later in the current session. Itmight also prove necessary to set up some informal organisation to supervise certain aspects of the industry&apos;s activities pending thecreation of the new Iron and Steel Board.(b) It was now believed that the Transport Bill could be ready for introduction in sufficient time to enable it to be read a second timein the House of Commons before the summer recess. It would notin any event be possible to embark on the subsequent stages of theBill before that recess, since other essential business would occupy the whole of the remaining time of the House of Commons.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th April, 1952.(c) It was desirable that Parliament should have an adequate^1summer break.   If possible the recess should begin not later than8th August and end not earlier than mid-October.   This would enablethe Conservative Party Conference to take place while parliament was in recess.(d) The later stages of the programme drawn up with these considerations in mind would be determined by the time requiredfor the stages of the Transport Bill beyond Second Reading in theHouse of Commons. On the most favourable assumptions, four weeks would be required for the passage of that Bill through theHouse of Lords. Arrangements should be made, if possible, whichwould enable the Bill to leave the Commons in time for its examina-tion in the Lords to be completed before the end of 1952 and for the session then to be ended. The new session might then begin earlyin 1953.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Health, in consultation with the lord privy Seal, to draw up for their further consideration a detailed programme for the rest of the parliamentary session which took account of the points made in their discussion.
