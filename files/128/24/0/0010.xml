Civil Service. 2.   The Prime Minister drew attention to Press reports of theAge of decision to raise the normal age of retirement of established civilRetirement. servants. This decision had been presented in the Press in a manner which made it seem inconsistent with the steps which the Govern-ment were taking to reduce the size of the Civil Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Staff side of theNational Whitley Council had conveyed this information to the Pressprematurely and without his knowledge. He had demanded, and hadreceived, the Staff side&apos;s apologies for their action. The timing ofthe disclosure was admittedly unfortunate. The policy was, however,sound and consistent with the current movement towards an exten-sion of the working life of the population generally. It was also con-sistent with the policy of reducing Civil Service numbers; for thisshould be achieved by dispensing with younger temporary staff who could be absorbed into other employment.The Prime Minister said that he hoped that all Ministers wouldin future bear in mind the desirability of mentioning to the Cabinet,before any public announcement was made, any executive decisions which were of general importance or were likely to attract wide-spread publicity.Agriculture. 3.   The Lord President said that, with the approval of the HomePloughing-up Affairs Committee and the authority of the Prime Minister, the Minis-Sudsidyand ter of Agriculture had announced on the previous day the Govern-Potato Acreage. ment&apos;s decision to introduce legislation authorising the payment to farmers of a contribution of  5 an acre towards the cost of ploughing up land which had been under grass for four years or more and ofsowing an approved crop for harvesting in the current year. the approved crops would be wheat, barley, oats, coarse grains and rootsfor animal feeding, potatoes and linseed. This should encourage thehome production of coarse grains, and should also have the effect of ensuring an adequate acreage of potatoes. In addition, people wouldbe urged to grow potatoes in small-holdings and private gardens.The Cabinets-Took note of the Lord Presidents statement.Man-Power. 4.   The Minister of Supply said that, owing to the shortage ofEmployment    sheet steel and the reduction in the number of cars to be made for thein Motor        home market, workers were being discharged by some of the motor industry.        manufacturers in Coventry.  He was considering to what extent air-craft manufacturers could place sub-contracts in this area, in orderto absorb some of the redundant labour. The Minister of Labour41883-1 &apos;i b2Civs! Defence. 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had been concerned to see,in reports of a Press Conference which the Home Secretary had heldon the previous day, references to the delivery of new sirens for sound-ing air-raid warnings. He thought it unwise that the public should bealarmed by undue publicity about civil defence preparations at thisstage.The Home Secretary said that the purpose of his Press conference had been to stimulate recruiting for the civil defence services, whichwere seriously below their peace-time establishment. It was unfor-unfortunate that the newspapers had given such prominence to his remarkson the subject of equipment. He had no intention of obtruding uponpublic attention the arrangements which were being made to com-plete the air-raid warning system.
SiNational 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterService. of Labour (C. (52) 15) reporting that, in pursuance of their decisionCall-up of of 29th November, he had examined, in consultation with the otherSkilled Ministers concerned, the possibility of deferring the call-up of ex-Workers, apprentices employed on essential parts of the defence production(Previous        programme.Reference: Of the total number of 23,000 ex-apprentices in engineering andC.C. (51) 13th metal-working occupations who became available for calling-upConclusions, annually, the Admiralty and the Ministry of Supply were asking for minute 2.) deferment for about 1,500 skilled men occupied on the most essentialitems of defence production. The Minister of Labour said that he was anxious to take some steps to assist these Departments; but he wasalso apprehensive that any but the most rigidly-limited deferment ofcall-up for skilled workers engaged on rearmament would stimulatedemands on behalf of those engaged on other work, for instance inexport trades, in transport and in agriculture. If these additional demands had to be met, public acceptance of conscription in time ofpeace might be prejudiced. He would therefore prefer to work out an even more limited scheme than that proposed by the admiralty and the Ministry of Supply, confining it to a number of designatedprojects of the highest importance and to a few selected occupationsof the highest skill.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The case for deferring the call-up of all skilled men engaged on the most essential defence work (and not merely of those whohad attained the highest degrees of skill) was that most of these menworked in teams, the efficiency of which was impaired by the call-upof any of their members.(b) On the other hand post-war apprentices were now beginning to return to industry after completing their military service: thereturn of these men, though they would not immediately fit as readilyinto the production teams as those now being newly called-up, would assist in the solution of the problem.(c) The defence production programme was now at the &quot; tooling-up &quot; stage, when the supply of certain skilled men, such as draughts-men, was crucial.(d) Firms working for export were suffering from a shortage ofthe same kinds of worker.The general view of the Cabinet was in favour of a more limitedscheme than that suggested by the Admiralty and the Ministry ofSupply. It might be desirable, in such a limited scheme, to make some concession to export industries as well as arms production. the wider proposal, involving deferment of men possessing lesser as wellas higher degrees of skill, would give rise to pressure which it wouldbe difficult to resist for its extension to a wide range of other occupa-tions. The Ministers directly concerned might draw up such a limitedscheme with the assistance of one of their colleagues who had no directDepartmental interest in the matter.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power, in consultation with the Minister of Labourand with the other Ministers concerned, to draw up and tosubmit to the Cabinet a limited scheme for deferring the call-up of ex-apprentices, confined to a number of designatedprojects of the highest importance and to a few selectedoccupations of the highest skill.said that his Department were working on this problem in consulta-tion with the Minister of Supply and were urgently seeking means of finding alternative employment for the workers who were about to lp)be discharged.
Malaya.^previous preference:C.C. (51) 20thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Seal(C. (52) 16) submitting the conclusions of the Committee which theyhad appointed on 28th December to consider the Colonial Secretary&apos;sreport on his visit to Malaya.The Colonial Secretary said that he hoped the Cabinet would approve the recommendation that the term of office of the Commis-sioner-General for South-East Asia should be extended for the timebeing. The Cabinet endorsed this recommendation, but suggestedthat no public announcement should be made until after the new HighCommissioner had arrived in Malaya.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in the report annexed to C. (52) 16.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to confer with the PrimeMinister regarding the timing of his announcementextending the term of office of the Commissioner-general for South-East Asia.Government 7.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of offices. Works (C. (52) 17) suggesting means of securing further economies in the use of office space by Government Departments.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Substantial savings could be made if Ministers in charge of departments would insist on compliance with the approved standards of accommodation.(b) Care must be taken to ensure that the forthcoming reductions in civil service numbers yielded a corresponding economy in officespace.(c) More vigorous action should be taken to concentrate intofewer buildings the local staffs maintained by different departments in provincial towns. Further consideration might be given to thepossibility of arranging for one Department to act locally as the agentfor another: for example, the Ministry of Labour might be able totransact the business of the Ministry of National Insurance,&apos; on an agency basis, in many areas.(d) The Cabinet were informed that the amalgamation of the ministries of Transport and Civil Aviation could not be brought intoeffect for some little time, and would not in fact result in any largesavings in staff. It would, however, have the result that Aerial house would be available for other use, since the staff now there wouldbe transferred to Acton.(e) The arrangements for checking the unnecessary accumula-tion of official records should be brought urgently under review. TheCabinet considered that most Departments could safely adopt a muchmore ruthless policy of destroying old papers which were of no permanent value or interest.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals put forward by theMinister of Works in C. (52) 17.(2) Invited the Minister of Works to send to his colleagues lists of premises which he thought their Departments mightsurrender by a given date; and invited all Ministers incharge of Departments to support the efforts which theMinister of Works was making to curb the demands of departments for office space, and to comply with the approved standards of office accommodation.(3) Invited the Minister of Works to report in a month&apos;s time theprogress made in securing economy in the use of officespace by Government Departments.
(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theappointment of a Committee to make an urgent review^of the arrangements for preserving valuable official records ^and for destroying those which were of no permanentvalue or interest.The King&apos;sStay in SouthAfrica.8. The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to a motion tabled byMr. Michael Stewart, M.P., and other Labour Members inviting the King to &quot;take into consideration the distress caused to manyof His Majesty&apos;s subjects by the decision that His Majesty is to bethe guest of Dr. Malan in his official residence&quot; during his forth-coming stay in South Africa.The Cabinet agreed that on questions relating to The King&apos;saccommodation during his stay in South Africa it was appropriate that His Majesty should be advised by the Union Government, andthat it would be constitutionally improper for the United KingdomGovernment to offer advice on &quot;such questions. No facilities wouldbe given for the discussion of Mr. Stewarfs motion in the House ofCommons; and its effect on public opinion in this country had been sufficiently countered by the amendment tabled by a number ofGovernment supporters. As this motion had subsequently been tabled, it was no longer necessary to return any reply to a letter inthe same sense which Mr. Fenner Brockway, M.P., and a number ofother Labour Members had sent on an earlier date to the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the circumstances noted above, there was no occasion for the Government to take any action in thismatter.Housing. 9.   The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatAdjustment of he and the Secretary of State for Scotland had discussed with theGovernment Home Affairs Committee the arrangements for reviewing housing subsidies. subsidies in the light of the forthcoming increase in the rate of interest on local authority borrowing. The new rates of subsidy would haveto be negotiated with representatives of the local authorities and forthis purpose it was necessary to fix a figure of notional rent. this figure had originally stood at \0s. per week, but had been increasedby the previous Government to \6s. For the purpose of the newnegotiations alternative figures of 18s. and 195. per week had beensuggested. The Minister had now agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer that the figure of 18s. should be adopted for Englandand Wales. He was discussing with the Chancellor of the exchequer the possibility of maintaining stability in the subsidies for a periodof perhaps eighteen months by fixing the rate of interest on housingloans for that period. Subject to this point he was satisfied that itwas right to proceed with the present negotiations,: though in thelong term he was anxious to find some means of removing the presentdiscouragement to private building caused by the high rates of subsidy on local authority building.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that changes in interest rates generally might necessitate further adjustments in the rate ofinterest on housing loans and he could not promise stability for anyset period. Subject to this, he thought that the negotiations could fairly be represented as being designed mainly to offset by increasedsubsidies the increased cost of housing finance. They would involve an additional cost of  5 million a year to the Exchequer in subsidies for houses and other dwellings..,- Discussion turned largely on the presentation of the Govern-menfs policy and the timing of the announcement of new subsidyrates.  While the proposed increase of 25. per week in the figure of
notional rent would not be directly announced, local authorities would become aware in the course of the discussions of the basisof the Governmenfs calculations in arriving at a new subsidy figure.Even so the notional figure did not represent rent in actual payment,and adjustments which local authorities would need to. make in actual rents as a result of the subsidy change would be smaller thanthe adjustment in the notional rent. It was desirable, however, thatthere should be the shortest possible interval between the introductionof the new rates of interest and the announcement of the new ratesof subsidy, since during that time the Governmenfs position wouldbe open to misrepresentation.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Housing and Local Government to open negotiations with local authority representatives on a newlevel of housing subsidies, taking the figure of 18^. perweek as the amount of notional rent for the purpose ofthese negotiations in England and Wales.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of housing and Local Government on the timing of theannouncement of increased interest rates for housingloans; and to inform the Prime Minister before making this announcement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th February, 1952.
