State of theNation.(previous reference:CC. (51) 11thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with theCabinet&apos;s decision of 17th November, the Secretary of the Cabinet hadcollected from Departments material for a factual report on the stateof the nation&apos;s affairs at the date when the Government assumedoffice. This material had not been prepared with a view to publica-tion. The Prime Minister thought, however, that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer might well present to Parliament, immediately after his Budget statement, a report on the state of the country&apos;s financialaffairs at the time the Government assumed office. &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would considerwhether such a document could be made available. If so, he wouldbe glad if he could have the assistance of the Paymaster-General in preparing it.Transport 3.   The Prime Minister said that he had been disturbed by theCharges. sudden announcement of increased passenger fares on the railwaysand road transport undertakings. Would it not have been possibleto give the public longer notice of these increases, and to explain that they were made on the authority, not of the Government, but of the Transport Tribunal?The Cabinet were informed that the Transport Tribunal hadbeen considering this matter for nearly a year, and that their final decisions differed in various respects from the recommendationssubmitted to them by the British Transport Commission.In discussion reference was made to the powers of the corpora-tions responsible for the management of the socialised undertakings of transport, gas and electricity. It was suggested that the relationsbetween these corporations and Ministers were not in all respectssatisfactory and needed examination.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power to circulate for the Cabinefs informationa memorandum on the recent findings of the transport tribunal on passenger fares.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and Power would consider whether apublic statement should not now be issued to make it.clear that the recent increases in passenger fares gaveeffect to decisions of the Transport Tribunal.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe-House of Commons in the following week.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budget on11th March. The debate on the Budget Resolutions would be heldon 12th and 13 th March and would be completed in the following week, on 17th March. In order to complete the financial businessconsequent upon the Budget, it would probably be necessary&apos; for parliament to reassemble on the Monday, instead of the Tuesday,following the Easter and Whitsun Recesses. It was also likely thatthe length of the Whitsun Recess would have to be curtailed.42123-2 B 2^Name of the 1.   The Prime Minister said that some further points&apos; had beenRoyal Family, raised about the draft Proclamation regarding the name of the Royal(Previous Family.   He had asked the Lord Chancellor to consider these, in reference: consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, the Home Secretary and theC.C. (52) 22nd Minister of Health.Conclusions,Minute 3.)
Civil Service.Salaries of doctors.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the late Govern-ment had appointed an independent Committee to consider a long-standing claim for increased salaries for doctors employed in theCivil Service. The Committee had recommended some improve-ments in salaries, but these fell short of the claims put forward bythe doctors&apos; staff associations. The Chancellor proposed to adoptthe Committee^ recommendations; but he thought it right to warnhis colleagues that this would involve some controversy, not only with the staff associations, but also with the British medical association.The Minister of Health said that the timing of this announcement should be considered in relation to an adjudication, which would becompleted shortly, on the salaries of doctors in the National health service.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of health and the Minister of Labour regarding his proposal to adoptthe recommendations of the Committee which had considered the salaries of doctors employed in the CivilService and, in particular, on the timing of any announcementof this decision.import programme.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 25thConclusions,Minute 2.)Food-stuffs.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (52) 59) submitting proposals for further reduc-tions in the import programme which he had formulated afterconsultation with the Ministers concerned. He recommended thatthe 1952 programme of imports from non-sterling sources should bereduced by at least  100 million, though little could be done nowwhich would affect expenditure on imports in the first half of the year.In discussion of the proposals made in paragraphs 6 to 10 ofC. (52) 59 the following points were made:  (a) WheatThe memorandum suggested that wheat stocks might be reduced from the present level of thirteen weeks&apos; consumption to a level often weeks&apos; consumption by the end of 1952. - This was estimated to produce a saving of  9 million, all in dollars. The Minister ofDefence drew attention to the strategic risks involved. We had started the last war with stocks amounting to thirteen weeks&apos;consumption and we had a similar reserve in hand now. Thedifficulty of maintaining imports, particularly of bulky food-stuffs,in the early months of a future war might be much greater than theyhad been in 1939-40. It was suggested on the other hand that some additional risk might be accepted temporarily in the period beforethe harvest, since war was less likely to break out before the harvest.The Cabinet (1) Provisionally decided (i) to invite the Minister of Food to adjust the import programme for wheat so as to reducethe level of stocks gradually over the next few months to ten weeks&apos; consumption; and (ii) to review the matter again in the light of our own harvest for 1952 with a viewto restoring the level of stocks thereafter to thirteen weeks&apos;consumption.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to inform the Chiefs of Staffof this provisional conclusion and to inform the cabinet of their views.
(b) Canned Corned MeatIt was proposed in C. (52) 59 to stop new purchases of canned corned meat from Argentina and Uruguay, saving  8 million in non-dollar currencies. Stocks already in hand were sufficient to providefor six months&apos; Service needs, amounting to 40,000 tons, and toprovide 10,000 tons for emergency civilian needs. The actualdistribution of consumption between the Services and the civilian population might have to be reconsidered in the event of war.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that no further purchases of canned corned meatshould be made from Argentina and Uruguay for the strategic stockpile.(c) SugarA reduction of the sugar ration to 8 oz. per week would reduceconsumption by a total amount costing  6 million a year in dollars.Because of commitments, however, no actual dollar saving would accrue before 1953. To reduce the ration now would further increasethe value of stocks by  4-^ million in 1952 and would thus help to offset other stock losses. The Minister of Food urged that this reduction should not be made. It would yield no immediate savingand, in combination with the heavy reductions in food imports already made, it would reduce nutrition to a level at which the energy of thepeople, and particularly of heavy manual workers, would be adversely affected. All experience showed that the effect on industrial output and exports might be far greater than any direct saving which itwould achieve.In reply the Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to thefact that he was not opposing purchases of meat from South Americaand said that, if we failed to obtain this meat on acceptable terms andhad to cut the meat ration below Is. per week, he would propose thatthe cut in the sugar ration should be restored. His proposal toreduce the sugar ration was primarily intended to forestall the criti-criticism that savings in imports were being made at the expense of stocks and not by reductions in consumption.After discussion the Cabinet (4) Agreed that the sugar ration should not be reduced from itspresent level of 10 oz. per week.(d) Oils and fatsThe Cabinet-(5) Agreed that imports of oils and fats should be reduced by25,000 tons, partly by reduction of stocks and partly by reduction of linseed consumption by industry. Thiswould save a sum of  3 million in non-dollar currencies.(e) Miscellaneous Government PurchasesThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on further considera-tion he thought it would suffice if purchases of miscellaneous food-stuffs (c a. lined fish, milk products, coffee, rice and dried fruiit) were reduced by  2 million, instead of  5 million; but he hoped that itwould be practicable to make this reduced saving almost wholly in dollars.The Cabinet (6) Endorsed the proposal to adjust miscellaneous government purchases of food-stuffs with the object of saving  2 mil-lion, so far as possible in dollars.Materials. (/) Timber, paper and pulpThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, in additionto saving  3-1- million in non-dollar currencies by tighter licensing ofhardwood and plywood, he proposed to save  18^ million, of which
a small proportion would be in dollar currencies, by adjustment irPthe import programme for softwood, pulp and paper. He wished tohave discretion, however, to determine the distribution of the savingsbetween these commodities and hoped that it would prove practicable to achieve his aim without any reduction in softwood imports. Anyfurther reduction in these, though it would not affect the housing programme for the current year, would reduce stocks to a dangerouslylow level and would increase the necessity for heavy imports in 1953.The savings on pulp and paper imports, on the other hand, would in large part be achieved by forcing down excessive prices. So far ashe might find it necessary to make any adjustment in softwoodimports, he would do so in consultation with the Minister of housing and Local Government.The Cabinet (7) Endorsed the proposals of the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster for adjustments in the import programmes of timber, pulp and paper.(g) CottonConsultation with the Raw Material Commission had shown thatit would be possible to reduce cotton imports by  31 million (of whichperhaps half represented dollar currencies) by lowering stocks to a five months&apos; supply. This adjusted programme rested, however, onthe present low level of demand for textiles both at home and over-seas. If demand recovered it might be necessary to adjust theprogramme; but in that event we might look for a corresponding increase in exports.The Cabinet-(8) Approved a reduction in cotton imports to save  31 million.Miscellaneous   (h) TobaccoImports. It was prop0se(i jn q (52) 59 to postpone purchases of 20 mil-lion lb. of tobacco from 1952 to 1953. This would save  4f million in dollars for the time being. While there was much to be said on social grounds for a general reduction in tobacco consumption, over-seas expenditure on tobacco was small by comparison with the very heavy yield of internal revenue which it produced. If this were notmaintained it would be necessary for the Exchequer to absorbpurchasing power by other means.(/) Machinery and ManufacturesRestriction of the issue of licences for the importation ofmachinery and of certain other manufactures might yield savings of 3\ million, all in dollars.The Cabinet (9) Endorsed the proposals in C. (52) 59 for dollar savingsamounting to  8-  million on the importation of tobacco,machinery and certain other manufactures.Imports from There were some signs that our deficit with the European Pay-Europe., ments Union might be falling.   But we were at present meeting80 per cent, of this deficit in gold and should shortly be paying100 per cent, in gold. Some saving must therefore be made in imports from Europe, though this should be done in the manner leastlikely to damage the European economy and to provoke retaliation.In particular it was not proposed to make any change in the importarrangements for wines and spirits because of the critical situation ofthe French economy and because the amounts of exchange at stakewere small. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President ofthe Board of Trade proposed, over a selected field of imports from europe, to withdraw existing open general licences and to issue no new licences for a period of some weeks. During this time it wouldbe possible to decide, in the light of events and in particular of the
course of our account with the European Payments Union, on theextent to which new licences should be issued. The object should beto reach as nearly as possible a saving of  20 million.The President of the Board of Trade said that he hoped it mightbe agreed that other deterrents on the importation of machinery from europe, including the withdrawal of present facilities for duty-freeimportation, would make it unnecessary to introduce individuallicensing of machinery, which was administratively expensive and caused great irritation.The Cabinet-(10) Endorsed the proposals made in C. (52) 59 for the purposeof securing savings in imports from Europe; and agreedthat, if possible, individual licensing of machinery imports should be avoided.Cabinet Office, SWA,6th March, 1952.
