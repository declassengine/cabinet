^Parliament,Business inthe House ofCommons.Home Guard.(previous reference:C.C.(51)10thConclusions,Minute 8.)Raising of units inNorthernIreland.1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Health also gave notice that the Second reading of the National Health Service Bill would be taken on 27th March.2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the War Officeproposed, in agreement with the Government of Northern Ireland, toraise ten Home Guard battalions in Northern Ireland. For thepresent these would take the form of cadres of fifty men to a battalion.When the Home Guard Bill had been before Parliament in theautumn, it had been suggested that Northern Ireland should be excluded from its scope; and the proposal to raise these battalionswould certainly be criticised in Parliament. Some protests andmisrepresentation in the Irish Republic must also be expected.Despite this, however, the Cabinet agreed that the proposal should go forward.The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for War to proceed withhis proposal to raise units of the Home Guard in NorthernIreland.Council of 3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memoranda byEurope. the Foreign Secretary (C. (52) 40) and the Minister of Housing and(Previous Local Government (C. (52) 56) on the future of the Council of Europe.Reference: They also had before them a further memorandum by the ForeignC.C. (52) 29th Secretary (C. (52) 75) suggesting that it would be premature at theConclusions, present time to propose the fusion of the Council of the OrganisationMinute 8.) for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) with the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that the aims which members of the Conservative Party had pursued atStrasbourg had been frustrated by the isolationist attitude of theLabour Government, which had encouraged European enthusiastsfor the Council of Europe to turn towards federalism. It was not,however, certain as yet that the federalists in Europe would carry the day. It was not even certain that the Schuman Plan and theEuropean Defence Community would come into operation in the formnow envisaged. Was it necessary, therefore, to attempt to define therelations of the Council of Europe With those bodies, before it wasprecisely known in what form the latter would ultimately emerge ?He would himself have preferred that in discussing the new draftStatute the Foreign Secretary should argue at the forthcoming meetingof the Committee of Ministers that the time was not yet ripe for discussing changes in the constitution of the Council. He hoped that even when the Schuman Plan and the European Defence Communitycame into operation the United Kingdom would continue in full membership of the Council of Europe together with the other european countries which were not members of those smaller bodies.If the members of those bodies found, within the Council of Europe,a forum for the discussion of their joint affairs, he hoped that theywould do so as a group within the larger European group. The hopes,., of a united Europe would be seriously disappointed by organisationalchanges which implied a further sub-division between the &quot;federalist&quot;Powers in Europe and the remainder.The Home Secretary said that the language used in the foreign secretary&apos;s paper (C. (52) 40) might have given rise to misunder-standings in Europe; but he accepted the ideas underlying that memo-randum as the Foreign Secretary had presented them to the Cabineton the previous day. On the first of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recom-mendations (paragraph 4(d) of C. (52) 40) he considered that the, Assembly of the Council of Europe should be able to continue tohold general discussions on the matters falling within the scope of42124-2- &quot; b 2
the Schuman Plan and the European Defence Community, thought,executive decisions on those matters would be left to the narrowercircle of States members of those bodies. On the second recommenda-tion (paragraph 4 (b) of C. (52) 40) he thought it important to avoid creating within the Council a separate inner membership confined toStates which were members of the Schuman Plan or of the european defence Community. More generally, the Home Secretary said thatthe Council could not play an effective part in European affairs unless it were able to discuss subjects of first-rate importance. It was for thisreason that he favoured an attempt to bring within its scope, in asuitable way, the subjects to be handled by the Schuman Plan andby the European Defence Community and also though on this hedeferred to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view on timing-by the O.E.E.C.The Lord Privy Seal said that there were phrases in the memo-randum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government whichsuggested that the United Kingdom might become a full member ofa European community. He himself did not believe that the UnitedKingdom should ever commit itself to full membership of acontinental bloc; and he felt sure that in this view he would have thesupport of a substantial body of opinion in this country. We werenot a continental nation, but an island power with a Colonial Empireand unique relations with the independent members of the Common-wealth. Though we might maintain a close association with thecontinental nations of Europe, we could never merge our interestswholly with theirs. We must be with, but not in, any combination of European Powers. -In further discussion it was argued that it was not inconsistent with this view that the United Kingdom should play a part in guidingand forming European opinion. If we stood aside from Europeanaffairs, we should run the risk that Germany would one day establish a dominating influence over a united Europe.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, in presenting these proposals to the Committee of ministers of the Council of Europe, the Foreign Secretary would be able to meetsome Of the points which had been raised in the Cabinefs discussion.In particular, it had been no part of his intention that the Committeeof Ministers should as at present constituted have powers of executivedecision in the business of the Schuman Plan or the European defence community. It was also his intention that the Council of europe should continue to discuss the work of the O.E.E.C., on the basis of reports furnished to them by that organisation. As regards member-ship, he would be careful to avoid any suggestion that european countries which were not members of the federalist organisationswould on that account become less effective members of the Councilof Europe.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he stillthought it premature to forge constitutional links between the Councilof Europe and the federalist organisations of the Schuman Plan andthe European Defence Community, and he feared that this attemptwould give undue prominence and influence within the Council ofEurope to the members of those federalist organisations. The general body of opinion in the Cabinet was, however, in favour of the pro-posals in C. (52) 40 as amplified by the&apos;Foreign Secretary and theParliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the Cabinefstwo discussions.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals in C. (52) 40 and C. (52) 75, subjectto the modifications indicated in the Cabinefs discussionsby the Foreign Secretary and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and authorised theForeign Secretary to speak on these lines at the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council ofEurope.
1/AIL151CC. 30 (52)india and pakistan.Supply ofBritish military equipment.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C. (52) 50) covering a memorandum on the supply of arms to Indiaand Pakistan.The Prime Minister drew attention to the risk that these twocountries might use the arms supplied to them for war against one another. We should then bear a grave responsibility. And we shouldnot in any event receive any valuable return for these supplies, since their cost would be debited against the sterling balances held by Indiaand Pakistan.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he thought it most unlikely that there would be war between India and Pakistan. Itwas not for this purpose that they needed arms, but for the legitimatepurpose of defending their vulnerable frontiers. If we continued tosend them such equipment as we could, we should increase therebythe chance that in any future world war they would ultimately befound fighting on our side. If we declined to supply them they wouldbuy equipment for dollars at the expense of sterling area reserves andwould in time come increasingly to use United States types of equip-ment. This would close an important long-term market to us. While,therefore, we should not denude ourselves of needed equipment andmust regard the claims of India and Pakistan as second to those ofthe older members of the Commonwealth and of foreign countries with which we had firm defence agreements, we should, nevertheless,continue to send them such supplies as we could.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, because of our ownneeeds, we. were having to delay the supply to India and Pakistan of sea Fury and Seafire aircraft which had been promised to them. Wecould, however, supply some Spitfires if these would be be acceptable.Lincoln bombers could not be made available to Pakistan for someyears, but some offer of older types of bomber might be made.&apos; Ingeneral it should be our policy to continue to make limited suppliesof equipment available on a scale. sufficient to prevent India and pakistan from turning to United States sources. The suggestion that 2^ million worth of Army equipment might be supplied in the next twelve months was probably optimistic.The Cabinet-Agreed that, subject to the points made in the discussion,military equipment should continue to be supplied to Indiaand Pakistan on the lines proposed in the memorandum annexed to C. (52) 50.Priorities for 5.   The Prime Minister had directed that priority should be givenDefence to the production of a limited number of specified types of defence production.     equipment, viz., the latest types of aircraft, ammunition for aircraft,(Previous-       the Radar chain and Centurion tanks.   The Ministry of Defence had reference:      worked out, in consultation with the Departments primarily cou-C.C. (52) 4th    cerned, the procedure to be followed in order to give effect to this conclusions,    priority.   They recommended that the priority should also extend to minute 3.)       Gannet naval aircraft, in addition to the types mentioned by the PrimeMinister, to guided weapons and to certain specified items of the anti-mine programme.   Departments were agreed upon the proceduresave on two points, viz. (i) whether the contracts carrying this priority should be identified by symbol below the level of main sub-contractors ; and (ii) whether sub-contractors should have a right topreferential treatment in the supply of raw materials and components.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade said that, if the use of the priority symbol were extended to sub-contractors, there would be serious interference with the pro-duction of civil supplies, especially in the engineering industry, and consequent loss of production for export which, in the current crisis in our balance of payments, was no less important than defence production.   They would therefore prefer that the sub-contractors
should be denied the use of the priority symbol and should be left toOask the Departments concerned to assist them to overcome any difficulties which they might encounter in obtaining the necessarymaterials and components for these contracts.In discussion it was pointed out that this alternative had two main disadvantages; first, it would mean waiting until difficultiesarose before any action could be taken to meet them and, secondly,it would involve a substantial increase in staff. Experience in theearly years of the last war had, it was true, demonstrated that a systemof priorities had great disadvantages as compared with a comprehensive-sive system of allocation; but in current peace-time conditions itwould be impracticable to introduce a full allocation system and, that being so, there was no certain means of ensuring preferential treat-ment for specified items of defence production other than a system of priorities extending to sub-contractors.The Minister of Supply said that he would do everything practic-able to avoid the abuse of this system by sub-contractors. He wouldinstitute a system of sample checks in order to verify that the symbolswere being properly used; and, since the abuse of the system by onefirm would damnify others, he hoped fo be able to enlist the supportof industry in supervising and enforcing it.In discussion the following points were also made:  (a) The Prime Minister had proposed the enlargement of theindustrial capacity available for the production of Centurion tanks.The Minister of Supply said that the existing capacity would suffice for the programmes now contemplated; and the creation of additional capacity would conflict seriously with exports. It was agreed, after discussion, that no further capacity need be provided at present forthe production of Centurion tanks.(b) The Minister of Supply confirmed that the priority procedure would not be applied to the production of firms manufacturing obsolescent-lescent types of aircraft.(c) It was agreed that the priority procedure should apply to theproduction of both 20-mm. and 30-mm. ammunition for aircraft.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the immediate introduction of the proceduredevised by the Ministry of Defence, in consultation withthe other Departments concerned, for ensuring priority forthe production of a limited number of specified types ofdefence equipment, and agreed that this should be appliedto the latest types of aircraft, 20-mm. and 30-mm. ammu-nition for aircraft, equipment required for the Radarchain, guided missiles, certain specified items of the anti-mine programme, and the existing programme of Cen-turion tanks.(2) Agreed that this procedure should extend to sub-contracts,and that sub-contractors should be authorised to secure,by the use of a special symbol, preferential treatment inthe supply of raw materials and components.(3) Invited the Minister of Supply to take all practicable steps toensure that this procedure was not abused by sub-con-tractors ; and asked him to submit monthly reports to theCabinet on the working of the scheme.CivilAviation.Brabazon andPrincessAircraft.6 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Supply (C. (52) 58) proposing that work on the secondBrabazon aircraft and on the second and third Princess flying boatsshould cease, at anv rate until the Proteus III engine became avail-able; that these aircraft should be stored; that the first Brabazon
aircraft should be used for a limited programme of further develop-ment, being scrapped thereafter unless some other use could be found for it; and that the first Princess flying boat should be completed forexperimental purposes.In discussion the question was raised whether these aircraft, andparticularly the flying boats, might if completed be useful as militarytransports. They had a substantial carrying capacity, though neitherthis nor their range was as great as it would be when they wereequipped with the Proteus III engine. On the other hand they might,because of their speed and because they were not vulnerable to sub-marine attack, represent a wiser investment for troop-carryingpurposes than sea transports.After discussion the Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretaries ofState for War and Air, the Minister of Supply and theMinister of State for Economic Affairs, to consider andreport to the Prime Minister on the proposals made inC. (52) 58, and, in particular, on the possibility of usingthese aircraft as military transports.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 73) recommending that British troops in Libyashould be stationed in cantonments away from the main towns, thatthis policy should be applied immediately in Benghazi and thatarrangements for its more general application should be set in handwithout delay.The Minister of State said that anti-British elements in Libyawere making political capital out of the presence of British troopsin Benghazi and other towns; and that, unless we gave early practicalproof of our intention to apply the policy recommended by theForeign Secretary, we should jeopardise our. chances of negotiatinga favourable treaty giving us the right to maintain troops in Libyafor a substantial period of time.The Prime Minister said that, while the whole future of the british garrison in the Middle East remained uncertain, it seemed unjustified-fiable for the Government to commit themselves to substantialexpenditure in constructing permanent quarters for British troops in libya. He would be reluctant to endorse at the present time thelong-term policy outlined in C. (52) 73.In further discussion it was suggested that the immediate needwould be met if the War Office were able to move some troops fromBenghazi and evacuate some of the premises which they occupiedthere; and for this purpose a Military Accommodation Board mightbe appointed, as recommended in paragraph 11 of C- (52) 73, to ensurethat some of the buildings occupied by British troops in Benghaziwere evacuated by 15th April. This might suffice to create favourable conditions for the treaty negotiations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to appoint a MilitaryAccommodation Board, as recommended in paragraph 11of C. (52) 73, Which would meet in Benghazi and arrangefor the early removal of British troops from some of thebuildings which they now occupied there.(2) Agreed to defer their consideration of the long-term policy recommended in G. (52) 73.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, after consultation with theChiefs of Staff, to submit to the Prime Minister a reporton the location of the British garrison, and future troop movements, in the Middle East.
Human Rights.        8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeigrSSecretary (C. (52) 72) seeking approval for the instructions to be givento the United Kingdom representative on the United Nations Corn-mission on Human Rights.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Secretary proposed to instruct his representative to continue to support the preparation ofa Covenant on civil rights with precise obligations, while seeking to eliminate objectionable provisions such as that relating to the &quot; self-determination of peoples.&quot; The Cabinet should, however, be aware that, despite the efforts of our representative, the Covenant was likelyto emerge in a form in which we should be unable to ratify it. Thesecond task of the Commission was to prepare a Covenant oneconomic and social rights. It was proposed that our representative should argue that these were rights which could not be embodied in a Covenant with precise legal- obligations but that he should, ifnecessary, join a majority in trying to prepare a more loosely-draftedinstrument which would be something more than a declaration but less than a Covenant.In discussion it was recognised that, in view particularly of theirColonial responsibilities, the United Kingdom Government were likelyto find great difficulty in ratifying either of these instruments. Itwould be politically inexpedient for us to dissociate ourselves fromthe project at this stage. There was, however, no reason why thecompletion of these instruments should be unduly hastened.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedKingdom representative on the United Nations Commissionon Human Rights to be instructed along the lines indicated-   - in C. (52) 72.Civil Service.Nomination ofa Communistto theArbitrationTribunal.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (52) 74) seeking guidance on the attitude which heshould adopt towards the nomination of a prominent member of theCommunist Party to serve as one of the Staff Side representatives onthe Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal.The Minister of Labour said that he had recently rejected certainnominations of Communists made to an arbitration board. It waspossible&apos;that the nomination which had now been made was intendedto challenge his action on that occasion. If he rejected this nomina-tion, some dissatisfaction would doubtless be expressed; but, if he accepted it, he would be in great difficulty in rejecting similar nomina-tions which might be made on future occasions. He was disposed to reject the nomination.The Cabinet strongly favoured the rejection of this nomination.It was important that arbitrators should be able to command theconfidence both of their colleagues and of those who appeared beforethem. It would probably be necessary, in defending this decision, toindicate that it represented an extension of Government policy towards Communists. It was desirable that this extension of policy should carry the support, or at any rate the acquiescence, of theTrades Union Congress.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour, after informal consultationwith the Trades Union Congress, to reject the nomination of a prominent Communist as a Staff Side representative onthe Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th March, 1952.
