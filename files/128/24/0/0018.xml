Name of the 1.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to reports that someRoyal Family, change might be made in the Family name of the Queen&apos;s children and their descendants. The Cabinet were strongly of the opinionthat the Family name of Windsor should be retained; and they invited the Prime Minister to take a suitable opportunity of making theirviews known to Her Majesty.Germany.(previous reference :C.C. (52) 17thConclusions,Minute 5.)War Criminals.GermanFinanceContribution.SecuritySafeguards.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 41) on Germany&apos;s contribution to the defence of western Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that during the past few days he had held numerous discussions on this and related questions with theUnited States Secretary of State, the French Foreign Minister andthe Chancellor of the German Federal Republic, From these he had learned that the criticisms recently expressed in the French andGerman Parliaments need not be regarded as precluding the possi-bility of agreement on the constitution of the European defence community. There was still a chance that some accommodationbetween the two countries might be reached in time to be taken intoaccount at the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council.Progress had also been made in these conversations on the specificissues which he had reported to the Cabinet on 14th February. on war criminals an agreement was now in sight. Contrary to hisexpectations the Germans had preferred that a neutral judge shouldnot be included in the tribunal which was to exercise the power ofclemency; and he now proposed to acquiesce in an arrangement bywhich the tribunal would be constituted of three Allied judges andthree German judges.The German Federal Chancellor had been pressed to agree thatGermany&apos;s defence contribution should total 11-25 milliard Reichs-marks. Though unable to commit himself to acceptance of this figure,he had promised that discussions with representatives of the threeOccupying Powers should be opened at once at Bonn with a view toarriving at a final agreement by the end of the present week. if agreement could by then be reached upon an acceptable figure, theproblem of dividing Germany&apos;s contribution between the occupying powers could be discussed during the forthcoming meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council.On the question of arms production in Germany only twodifficulties were outstanding. First, the French had urged thatGermany should be prohibited from manufacturing heavy artillery and propellants. But, as the Western Powers were short of pro-pellants, they would be unwise to deny themselves the opportunityof increasing their supplies from German production. It was hopedthat, at a meeting later in the day, the French would be persuaded to make a concession on this point. Secondly, the Americans were unwilling to support our suggestion that Germany should be pro-hibited from manufacturing civil aircraft. It had, however, been ascertained that Germany were not proposing to do so; and theForeign Secretary thought it would suffice if the German government made a formal declaration that they had no present intention of manufacturing civil aircraft and would not begin to do so without prior consultation with the United Kingdom Government.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the progress made in the dis-cussions held by the Foreign Secretary during the past fewdays on Germany&apos;s contribution to the defence of western europe.42121-2 B 2
european defence community.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 17thConclusions,Minute 6.)North Atlantic 4. The Cabinet took note of a memorandum by the ForeignTreaty Secretary (C. (52) 39) outlining proposals for the reform of the NorthOrganisation.   Atlantic Treaty Organisation which were to be discussed by the north atlantic Council at their forthcoming meeting at Lisbon.Egypt and 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign the Sudan.       Secretary (C. (52) 43) covering draft instructions to Her Majesty&apos;s(Previous        Ambassador in Cairo on the resumption of negotiations with Egypt.Reference:      These instructions, which had been drawn up in the light of theC.C. (52) 17th   Cabinefs discussion on 14th February, comprised (i) a draft tele-Conclusions,    gram containing a revised text of the communique which might be minute 4.)       issued jointly by the two Governments when agreement to resume negotiations had been reached; and (ii) a draft despatch setting out theresults which we might hope to see emerge from the negotiations inrespect both of defence and of the Sudan.The Cabinet considered first the text of the suggested com-munique. The discussions were there described as being held &quot; witha view to reaching a defence settlement and an agreement regardingthe Sudan.&quot;   The Foreign Secretary said that he would prefer that. The Foreign Secretary said that, in the course of the discus-sions mentioned in the preceding Minute, further progress had alsobeen made in defining the relations between the European defence community and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. It had, inparticular, been proposed that joint meetings of the two organisationscould be convened at the request of any member of either of the twobodies. This was a valuable proposal, since it would give germany the right, to ask for a joint meeting even before she became a memberof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. He hoped to be able to persuade the French Government to accept this proposal.Officials were preparing a draft of a joint declaration, to be madeby the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom,promising support for the European Defence Commuffity against anymember State which failed to honour the obligations towards theCommunity. There might, however, be some delay before the UnitedStates Government were able to make such a declaration; and it hadbeen suggested to him that it might be advantageous if the UnitedKingdom Government made a separate declaration in advance. this might help to remove any remaining misapprehension that the UnitedKingdom Government had been lukewarm in their support of the conception of a European Defence Community.In discussion there was some support for this suggestion. Theadditional point was made that it was the Conservative Party whichhad taken the first initiative towards the formation of a european army, and that it would be specially appropriate that the present government of the United Kingdom should be the first to make theproposed declaration. On the other hand it was pointed out that effective enforcement of the promise implied by such a declaration would probably require American support; and it might be unwisefor the United Kingdom Government to make such a declaration on their own unless they had a firm assurance that it would befollowed by a similar declaration on behalf of the United StatesGovernment.The Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary, in his further discussion ofthe proposed declaration of support for the european defence Community, to take account of the views expressedin the Cabinefs discussion.
the communique should mention only defence, because of the risk of creating the impression that the future of the Sudan was being settledwithout proper consultation with the Sudanese. If it proved necessaryto make any reference to the Sudanese problem, it might suffice tosay that the discussions were being held &quot; with a view to reaching a defence settlement and agreement on other outstanding issues.&quot; ButHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should be asked to seek fresh instructionsif a reference to defence alone was not acceptable to the egyptian government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should be instructed,if negotiations were resumed, to endeavour to obtain agreement on a joint communique which made no refer-ence, direct or indirect, to the Sudan.(2) Subject to conclusion (1) above, approved the terms of thedraft telegram in Annex A of C. (52) 43.A discussion followed on the draft despatch in Annex B to C. (52)43, in the course of which the following points were made:  (a) The line of approach to the Egyptian Government laid downin this draft was in its main essentials in harmony with the Four-Powerproposals. It was intended to provide for the evacuation of british forces from the Canal Zone base only if it was agreed that the baseshould be made available to an Allied Middle East Command.(b) It was proposed that any agreement under which we relinquished-quished possession of the Canal Zone base should apply only to the fixed installations, such as buildings, and not to movable equipment or stores.(c) The Prime Minister saw objection to the proposal in para-graph 8 (2) of the draft despatch, which involved handing over the base installations to the Egyptian Government as a preliminary totheir being made available to the Allied Middle East Command. Hethought that we should be in a position of dangerous weakness, after we had handed over the installations to the Egyptians, if the Four-Power arrangements did not come into operation at once. He would much prefer an arrangement by which our responsibility was trans-ferred directly to the Middle East Command. It might indeed be best to insist on Four-Power negotiations at the outset and on anagreement by which Egypt would be associated on terms of equality with the other Powers in the Middle East Command as a priorcondition of any arrangement affecting the Canal Zone base.(d) On the other hand it was pointed out that the purpose of the paragraph to which the Prime Minister had drawn attention, as ofthe rest of the despatch, was to link evacuation of British forces fromthe Canal Zone and the handing over of the military base to theEgyptian Government with satisfactory arrangements for the useof the base by Middle East Command. The reason for transferring the base to the Egyptian Government in the first instance was thatit was on Egyptian territory and none of the other Powers who wouldbe concerned in a Middle East Command had at present any right tohold or use military property in Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that his present proposals preservedour position at least as fully as the Four-Power proposals put to theEgyptian Government in the summer of 1951, under which no foreignforces were to be stationed in Egypt without the Egyptian Govern-ment&apos;s agreement. While it would be possible to refrain from entering into direct negotiations, with the Egyptian Government and to insistinstead on Five-Power talks, he must remind the Cabinet that the egyptians seemed more likely to be willing to make a satisfactory settlement with us alone in the first place than with the Four Powers,and also that in Four-Power discussions with them we should belikely to find ourselves under dangerous pressure to make unwise
concessions, particularly in relation to the Sudan. He thought itpreferable to begin with direct talks between ourselves and the egyptians and urged that these should begin at once; we shouldotherwise be open to the criticism of having missed a valuable oppor-tunity and the position of the present well-disposed egyptian government would be seriously weakened.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed to resume consideration of C. (52) 43 at a further meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, SWA,\%th February, 1952.
