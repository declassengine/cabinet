Balance olPayments.(previous reference:C.C. (52)4thConclusions,Minute 3.)Reducedimports of rawmaterials.Reducedimports of food.421191.. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 10) reporting the rapid fall in thegold and sterling reserves, and recommending emergency action inorder to balance the overseas accounts in the second half of 1952.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he estimated that bythe end of June the reserves would be down to  500 million, the level at which the pound had been devalued in 1949. The commonwealth finance Ministers had accepted in principle proposals which he had made for an improvement in their balance of payments with the non-sterling area which would produce a total surplus for them of  100million in the second half of 1952, and his recommendations were designed to ensure an overall balance for the sterling area by reducingthe United Kingdom deficit with the non-sterling area to  100 million in that period. This meant that after allowing for United States aid of  80 million we must improve our position by about  150 million. 92 million of this could be found by consuming stockpiles of tobaccoand raw materials, and by reducing the tourist ration to  25, and he recommonded that the remaining  58 million should be obtained through reductions in purchases of food. He did not recommendfurther reduction of our imports from Europe, which would lead toretaliation, and it would not be practicable to secure reductions in expenditure on petrol or films..It was the general view of the Cabinet that the proposed reduc-tion in the tourist ration should be made, and that expenditure ontobacco and raw materials should be reduced, by drawing on stock-piles as proposed in paragraph 33 of the Chancellors memorandum,in view of the overriding necessity of checking the drain on the reserves and of setting an example to other Commonwealth Govern-ments; though it was pointed out that the running down of stocksrepresented a draft on the future which could not be repeated, andwould necessitate heavy subsequent purchases at higher prices. If theUnited States Government would agree to buy, additionally, about25,000 tons of our available stocks of rubber over-the next six months the  8 million so obtained might take the place of the proposed saving on purchases of softwood, or it might remove the necessity for thevery heavy reduction proposed in food purchases.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to makepreliminary enquiries about the possibility of the UnitedStates Government^ making additional purchases of rubber from our stocks.In discussion the possibility was mentioned of reaching some agreement with the film industry to reduce dollar expenditure. It wasalso suggested that in view of the mild winter the risk involved incancellation of contracts for coal from the United States might beaccepted: this might produce a saving of perhaps  3 million. It wasagreed that these points should be examined further.The Cabinet expressed concern at the proposals for further cutsin imports of food which were put forward in paragraph 29 of theChancellor^ memorandum. It was pointed out that, if these weremade, standards of nutrition would fall below the lowest war-timelevel; at such a level there could be little prospect of achieving theincreased production which was the only ultimate solution of our economic problems. A cut in the supply of coarse grains would gravely affect domestic livestock production, and the suggested reduc-tion in our imports of meat from South America might deprive uspermanently of that source of supply. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he could see no alternative to the reduction offood imports if a balance in our payments was to be secured; and ifwe did not play our part we could not expect the other CommonwealthB 2
Governments to do so either. He did not consider that the proposals in paragraph 29 of his memorandum, all of which need not beadopted, would necessarily require any early reduction in the level of. rations, and he suggested that his colleagues concerned should examine them with a view to selecting those which could least harm-fully be adopted.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Agricul-ture Ministers and the Minister of Food, to examine theproposals for the reduction of food imports in paragraph29 of C. (52) 10.Defence In further discussion reference was made to the increasing proba-expenditure. bility that our balance of payments difficulties would make it neces-sary to impose a further delay on the completion of the three-yeardefence programme. A decision to do so would not substantiallyalleviate the immediate difficulties, since the consequent switch-over from defence production to production for export could not be quickly effected. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the directexpenditure of  400 million in foreign exchange for defence, men-tioned in paragraph 32 of his paper, offered relatively small scope for early reduction: it included  41 million for the purchase pf machine tools and other equipment for the defence programme, and he would examine the possibilities of savings here, as well as in the  127 million to be spent on the purchase of raw materials from abroad. UnitedStates assistance in this field was being sought, but the progress of negotiations was slow, and he could not count on results which wouldbe effective to meet the immediate difficulties. It was pointed out thatthe expenditure of  125 million in foreign exchange on maintaining our armed forces overseas might be reduced substantially in the courseof time, if, for example in the Middle East, bases were maintained inpeace-time to which troops could be flown in an emergency.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that in order toincrease exports of capital goods and engineering products, for which alone there was an unsatisfied market, allocation of steel would haveto be directed more to production for export and less to basic indus-tries and to defence.In discussion it was pointed out that further cuts in defence production would lead to our being unable to equip the forces whichwe had undertaken to supply to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa-tion. The United States might be willing, through off-shore pur-chasing, to finance United Kingdom production for the equipment of our own Forces. This would mean that financially such produc--tion would be equivalent to exports. Such arrangements might bethe only means of preventing a reduction in our planned contributionto the defence effort of the North Atlantic Powers.Summing up the discussion. The Foreign Secretary said that,while there was general agreement with the proposals to reduceimports of tobacco and raw materials, the Cabinet would wish at their&apos;next meeting to give further consideration to possible alternativemeasures which might mitigate the additional cuts in food imports.He would acquaint the Prime Minister with the views which had been- expressed, and the Ministers concerned would wish meanwhile to look into the suggestions made about rubber, coal and reductions in overseas defence expenditure.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed to resume consideration of C. (52) 10 at their next meeting.
The EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 4thConclusions,Minute 3.)The investment programme.Supplies ofdurableconsumergoods.Hire PurchaseRestrictions.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 8) proposing measures to remedy the economic situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the substance of theseproposals had been considered by the Cabinet on 20th December(C.C. (51) 19th Conclusion, Minute 3). Since then they had beenconsidered by the Sub-Committee on the Economic Situation, andhe had discussed them with those of his colleagues who wereprincipally concerned.After discussion the Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in Annexes I and II to C. (52) 8relating respectively to the investment programme andto reductions in supplies of durable consumer goods forthe home market.The President of the Board of Trade said that he regarded theproposal in Annex III to C. (52) 8 that restrictions should be placedon hire-purchase transactions as consistent with the general policyof tightening credit. It was not proposed that the restrictions should extend to purchases of furniture and essential domestic goods.The Cabinet (2) Approved the proposal in Annex III to C. (52) 8.Civil Estimates. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was now a good prospect that the total of next year&apos;s Estimates for the social andadministrative services would, for the first time since the war, show no increase above the total for the current year, since the total for1952-53 of  1,920 million given in Annex IV to C. (52) 8 might bereduced, before the Estimates were issued, to the 1951-52 figure of 1,914 million.Reference was made, in paragraph 5 of Annex IV to C. (52) 8, toan increase of 2d. in the employee&apos;s contribution to the national health Service. The Chancellor said that he was likely to decidenot to proceed with this proposal for the present, in order that itmight be considered again later in connection with other proposals affecting national insurance. He would refer to this matter again at the Cabinefs next meeting.The Cabinet(3) Approved the proposals in Annex IV to C. (52) 8, subject tothe reservation made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Suspension of The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in Part II of the depreciation Confidential Annex to his memorandum (C. (52) 8) he had recom-Allowances. mended that income tax depreciation allowances on newly-purchasedplant and machinery should be suspended for three years, on the linesrecently followed by the Canadian Government. He was reluctant to take this step, but there seemed to be no other practicable way ofsecuring the necessary restriction of home investment in plant and machinery. He Was advised that a further tightening of credit wouldbe unwise at present.In discussion this proposal was criticised on the grounds that it.did not discriminate between essential and less essential investment,and that it would hinder desirable long-term industrial re-equipment.The need to raise the level of exports by easing the burden on theengineering industry was not questioned, but it was felt that everyeffort should be made to devise an alternative method of securingthis result, possibly by imposing a tax on certain types of plant and machinery.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in view of hiscolleagues&apos; reluctance to accept this measure he would re-examine the,possibility of devising some alternative remedy.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to re-examine theproposal made in Part II of the Confidential Annex toC. (52) 8.(5) Agreed to resume consideration of this proposal at their next meeting.Purchase Tax. The President of the Board of Trade supported the proposal made in Part I of the Confidential Annex to C. (52) 8 to revise thepurchase tax system in accordance with the recommendations madein the report of the. Douglas Committee. This would give urgently needed help to our textile exports and would put an end to a long-standing breach of our international trading obligations.The Cabinet (6) Approved the proposal in Part I of the Confidential annex to C. (52) 8.The Minister of Health said that legislation would be requiredin respect of a number of the proposals in Annex IV to C. (52) 8.This would be covered mainly by a Miscellaneous Bill for which theMinistry of Health would be responsible. In view of the secrecy ofsome of the provisions of the Bill, he suggested that it should not bereferred to the Legislation Committee, but should be submitted tothe Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers for approval of the drafting.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that the Bill required in connection with the proposals in Annex IV to C. (52) 8 should not be referred to theLegislation Committee.Parliament. The Cabinet were informed of the proposed terms of the motion on the economic situation. They agreed that it should be movedon 30th January and debated on that and the following day, and thatthe Opposition should be informed through the appropriate channels of this change in the Parliamentary programme.service estimates,1952-53.works services.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (52) 9) reporting on hisexamination of the possibility of making a further reduction in thetotal provision of  129-05 million for the works services of the service departments.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he did not recommend a reduction in any of the individual items in the Estimatesbut, in view of the likelihood that actual expenditure would fall.short of estimates, he recommended that a cut of  4 million should be madein the total provision for works services.The Service Ministers accepted this proposed adjustment on theunderstanding that present plans would not be revised to take accountof it and that, in the event of its proving possible to carry out the full programme for which the present estimates provided, they might asklater in the year for supplementary provision to be made.In discussion it was suggested that some approach might be madeto the United States Government to reopen the question of payment for work undertaken in the United Kingdom for the United states air Force. This was, however, the subject of an existing agreementproviding for the expenditure to be borne in equal shares by theUnited Kingdom and United States Governments, and the desira-bility of seeking an amendment of this agreement at the present time should be further considered.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Service Estimates should be amended toreduce the total provision for works services in 1952-53to  125-05 million; and invited the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to arrange with the Service ministers for the allocation of the reduction of  4 million whichthis involved.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider further with theSecretary of State for Air the desirability of reopeningwith the United States Government the question of pay-ment for works services undertaken in the UnitedKingdom for the United States Air Force.Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 4thConclusionsMinute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 11) on the attitude which we might adopt in theevent of negotiations with an Egyptian Government, on the claim ofthe King of Egypt to the title of King of the Sudan.The Foreign Secretary said that he had now obtained the viewsof His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo, and those of the Governor-General of the Sudan, on the suggestions outlined in C. (52) 11. Theformer considered that a settlement on these lines would not be likelyto satisfy the Egyptian Government, while the latter felt that it couldnot be reconciled with the undertakings given by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the status of the Sudan, and that it would lead to serious disturbances there. In these circumstances he proposed toexamine the matter again before asking his colleagues to consider itfurther.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Afghanistan. 5.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he hadreceived a communication from the Government of Afghanistanwhich suggested that the latter intended to take further steps, possiblythrough aggressive action, with the object of securing the autonomyof the so-called &quot; Pukthunistan,&quot; which included an area of Pakistanterritory with a population of 7 million. The Afghanistan Govern-ment clearly desired to take advantage of the conflict between Indiaand Pakistan over Kashmir.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.6. The Commonwealth Secretary said that he felt that theGovernment of India should now be informed without delay of thearrangements which had been agreed for the issue of a warningC.C. (51) 20th statement if an armistice were concluded in Korea without effectiveConclusions, arrangements for supervising compliance with its conditions. he Minute 4.) &apos; understood that the United States Government at present proposed to notify the Indian Government forty-eight hours in advance of theissue of the statement. Now that the existence of these arrangementswas becoming public knowledge, it was important to secure UnitedStates consent for an immediate communication to the indian government.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to seek the consent of the UnitedKorea.(previous reference:
States Government to an immediate communication to theGovernment of India, acquainting them with the arrange-ments which had been agreed for the issue of a warningstatement by the Governments which maintained contin-gents with the United Nations forces in Korea.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1952.
