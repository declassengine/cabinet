35CC. 49 (52)Allied I.   The Cabinet were informed of the course of the discussionsCommand which the Chiefs of Staff had been holding with Admiral Fechteler,in the the United States Chief of Naval Operations, regarding the nature ofMediterranean, the Allied Naval Command to be established in the Mediterranean.Admiral Fechteier accepted the need for an Allied Naval Com-mander-in-Chief who would be responsible for all naval operations in the Mediterranean (including operations by carrier-borne aircraft)but he considered that this officer should be responsible to AdmiralCarney, the Commander-in-Chief of the southern sector of theSupreme Allied Command in Europe. He was concerned solely withthe command structure under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa-tion, and was unwilling to take into account the needs of the middle east, since it was outside the area of N.A.T.O. The British Chiefs ofStaff had strongly resisted this proposal, which would put the linesof communication to the Middle East under the control of an officerconcerned primarily with support for the land battle in Europe. Intheir view it should be the duty of the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean to support both the campaign in europe and any campaign in the Middle East; and on that account he shouldbe responsible directly to the Standing Group, who alone cquldreconcile the needs of these two theatres.The Minister of Defence said that, although he had not taken part in these discussions, he had taken a separate opportunity to impress upon Admiral Fechteler the need to find a solution whichwould be acceptable to British public opinion. The Royal Navy hadcontrolled the Mediterranean for many years past; and the british people would not readily agree that an American Admiral shouldcontrol the waterway to the East which contained the British bases and garrisons of Gibraltar, Malta, Tripoli and Cyprus, especially ata time when 70,000 British troops were actively engaged in the suez canal Zone.The Foreign Secretary said that he was disturbed at theseindications that the United States military authorities regarded theMediterranean only as a support area for the land battle in europe and that they were also reluctant to contemplate support for any british military activities which were not directly under N.A.T.O.command.The Prime Minister said that this question must be consideredagainst the background of the concession already made over theNaval Command in the Atlantic. He was quite unprepared to acceptthe views which had been put forward by Admiral Fechteler in these discussions; and he would, if necessary, address a personal com-munication on this subject to President Truman. Meanwhile, he asked that a written report on the conversations should be submitted for the information of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence to circulate to the cabinet a report on the discussions which the Chiefs of Staff had held with Admiral Fechteler regarding the Allied Command inthe Mediterranean.Malaya. 2.   The Cabinet had before them .a memorandum by the First(Previous        Lord of the Admiralty (C. (52) 142) reporting the results of the reference:      enquiries made into the publication in the Daily Worker of a photo-C.C. (52) 47th   graph showing a Royal Marine Commando holding the severed headConclusions,     of a Malayan shot during a.jungle Patrol.&apos; It had been ascertainedMinute 3.) &apos;     that this was a genuine photograph taken in April 1951; and therewas no question of instituting proceedings against the newspaper inrespect of its publication.   The Cabinet were also informed thatBritish troops in Malaya were at present authorised to decapitate42376-1 &quot; 2
bandits who had been killed and to bring their heads back for pur-poses of identification, if it was not practicable to bring back the body or a photograph of it. The High Commissioner in Malaya had strongly urged that this authority should not be withdrawn, since hethought it militarily important that the Police should be enabled to identify as many as possible of the bandits killed in these operations.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthis practice of decapitating bandits for purposes of identificationshould be allowed to continue. Their general view was that thepolitical odium which it involved outweighed any military advantagegained; and they agreed that British troops in Malaya should be instructed to discontinue this practice.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for the High Com-missioner in Malaya to cause instructions to be given toBritish troops in Malaya that bandits killed in operations,should not in future be decapitated for purposes of identification, even when other methods of ensuring theiridentification were not practicable.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement about this incident, in reply to a Parliamentary Question in theHouse of Commons, and to announce in that statement the decision recorded in Conclusion (1) above.Broadmoor. 3.   The Minister of Health said that he had received from theSecurity Board of Control a full report on the circumstances in which a patientPrecautions. had recently escaped from Broadmoor. He was satisfied that thesecurity precautions taken at Broadmoor were no less effective thanthey had been when the institution was under the control of the HomeOffice. He recognised, however, that this escape and the publicity which it had attracted had given rise to widespread public anxiety;and it might well be that this could best be allayed by an early promise of an independent enquiry. In discussion there was general agreementwith this view.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Health to announce in the Houseof Commons that afternoon his intention to arrange for afurther independent enquiry to be held into the security precautions at Broadmoor.Cabinet.Functions ofCo-ordinatingMinisters,  jReform of theHouse of Lords.4. The Cabinet took note with approval of the terms of astatement which the Prime Minister was to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the co-ordinating functions exercised by the Lord President and the Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and Power.5. The Cabinet took note, with approval, of the reply whichthe Lord Privy Seal proposed to give later in the day to a question by Viscount Samuel asking for a statement of the intentions of her majesty&apos;s Government in relation to the reform of the House ofLords.Purchase Tax. 6.  The Cabinet resumed their examination of the suggestions(Previous made in a memorandum by the Chancellor Of the Exchequer (C (52)Reference: 135) regarding the pressure in the House of Commons for concessionsCC. (52) 48th relating to purchase tax on textile goods. Since the CabinefsConclusions, previous discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had consulted a minute 7.) number of his colleagues, who had agreed that the proposals which
Excess ProfitsLevy.(previous reference:CC. (52) 48thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 134 and C. (52) 148) proposingmodifications which he had it in mind to make in the Excess ProfitsLevy in the light of current Parliamentary criticism.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion he had conferred with certain of his colleagues,who had accepted a number of his proposals, namely those to intro-duce an alternative standard based on capital employed; to increasethe minimum standard to  5,000; to increase the allowance on profitsploughed back into the business and on new capital from 10 per cent,to 12 per cent, (with increases in the additional allowances given onmetal mines and oil wells); and to give an additional allowance of4 per cent, on borrowed money. In addition he had considered (i) The argument for including 1950 in the standard. He hadcdncluded that he could not do this, but proposed instead that thetrader should be given the option of basing his standard on any twoof the three years 1947, 1948 and 1949; and that the overridingmaximum of the tax should be reduced from 18 per cent, to15 per cent. For companies operating in Malaya and the Far East,however, the standard would be based exceptionally on 1949 and 1950.(ii) The desirability of exempting altogether all companies operating overseas. It seemed to him that this concession would beunjust to companies operating at home and to those operating overseasthrough subsidiaries. He therefore proposed to examine further thepossibility of extending to oil and certain other minerals the outputallowance proposed for metal mines. He would also considerreducing the overriding maximum to 10 per cent, for companies operating overseas.(iii) The proposal to give relief to avoid the &quot; double taxation &quot;of investment income. He would accept a concession on this point for investment companies.The total cost of all these concessions would be  56 million, whichwould reduce the net yield of the levy, allowing for the concessionsmade on profits tax, to  44 million. This yield would be indefensiblylow. The rate of profits tax on distributed profits should thereforebe fixed at 22\ per cent, instead of 17^ per cent. The net yield ofthe levy would then become  76 million.Discussion turned mainly on the effect of the tax on british companies operating overseas, particularly in commonwealth countries. The Commonwealth Secretary and The Colonial Secre-tary, while recognising that the Chancellors proposals went a long&apos;way towards meeting the difficulties of those companies, were appre-hensive that in spite of them the tax would provide a powerfulincentive to companies to move their control overseas. In the caseof extractive and productive industries in particular, Commonwealthopinion might be that an undue share of the profits of such enterprisesconducted in their territories was being taken for the United kingdom excequer, to the detriment of further investment in those territoriesby United Kingdom companies. It might be desirable, therefore, atleast to consider extending to other forms &quot;of production concessionssimilar to those which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had in mind for some mining and extractive industries. The position of &quot; pioneer &quot;he had in mind represented the best means of dealing with this situation. He had to take into account the importance of avoiding any change in the incidence of purchase tax on textiles which would bring into question the whole structure and general level of thepurchase tax.The Cabinet Approved the proposals relating to purchase tax made bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer in C. (52) 135.
RoaJ and Rai]Transport.White Paper onTransportPolicy.(previous reference:CC. (52) 48thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Chancellorof the Exchequer had suggested that, as the proposals in the draft white Paper on Transport Policy might be substantially modifiedbefore they passed into law, the concluding paragraph of the Papermight indicate that it was intended rather as a basis for public dis-cussion than as a statement of Government decisions. The Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, on the otherhand, was reluctant to accept this suggestion: he feared that aconcluding paragraph on those lines would be taken as a sign ofirresolution and would cause delay.The Prime Minister said that, while the Government should beready to profit by public discussion and to adjust their policy in thelight of informed criticism, he thought it would be unwise to invitecritical comment from the outset.The Cabinet Agreed that the White Paper on Transport Policy should be presented in the form approved by them on 1st May.Road 9.   The Cabinet had before, them a memorandum by the LordPassenger President (C. (52) 140) suggesting amended terms of reference for theServices. proposed Departmental Committee on the operation of the RoadLicensing of     Traffic Act, 1930.Passenger prime Minister said that he doubted whether it would beVehicles.        wise to appoint a Departmental Committee to review the workingOPrevious        of this Act. While it might be able to tender useful advice, it would reference:      not, however constituted, strengthen the hands of the government cc (52) 48th   in putting forward amending legislation.   He would prefer that conclusions,    further study should be given to the licensing decisions now comingMinute 5.)       before the Minister of Transport on appeal, with a view to devisingacceptable principles which might govern the determination of a largeproportion of those appeals and might limit the area of study whichit was necessary to refer for further enquiry.The Cabinet Agreed to consider at a later meeting the proposal to set upa Departmental Committee to review the operation of theRoad Traffic Act, 1930.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,.6th May, 1952.companies, which were entitled to special concessions in relation toColonial taxation, would require examination to ensure that the excess profits levy did not operate so as to offset those concessions.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals relating to excess profitslevy made in C. (52) 134 as modified by C. (52) 148.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider thepoints made in discussion, in relation particularly to the taxation of British companies operating in the Common-wealth ; and to submit his proposals for final approval by the Cabinet.
