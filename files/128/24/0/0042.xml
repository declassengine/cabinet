Rail Transport.        1.   The Lord Chancellor said that, as requested by the CabinetAlterations in   at their meeting earlier in the day, he had examined with the MinisterRailway Fares, of Transport and the Law Officers the best means of imposing some(Previous        delay in the operation of that part of the new Transport ChargesReference:      Scheme under which railway fares outside London were to beC.C.

Commission as required by statute, to issue a formal direction to theCommission not to operate that part of the scheme until it had been-  referred to the Central Transport Consultative Committee and theirreport had been received and considered by the Minister.   TheMinister had power to issue such a direction on a matter which appeared to him to affect the national interest. The terms of referenceto the Consultative Committee would be drawn in such a way as notto bind them to recommendations which were consistent with theTransport Commission^ duty to meet their expenses out of theirrevenue.  The Minister would consult the Commission and issue hisdirection on 15th April.Discussion turned on the question whether the direction shouldimpose a general standstill or should be limited to preventing any increase of sub-normal and sub-standard fares by an amount greaterthan the increases to be made in other fares. In view of the greatcomplication of the Charges Scheme, the Cabinet felt that the best course would be to defer all the increases which would otherwiseoperate on 1st May.It was recognised that the announcement of this direction would provoke criticism in London, where both rail and bus fares hadalready been increased under a scheme which had been approved bythe Central Transport Consultative Committee. It would not,however, be possible to make a reduction now in London fares.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport to direct the transport commission, under Section 4 of the Transport Act, 1947,not to operate so much of the scheme sanctioned by theTransport Tribunal by the Order dated 17th February, 1952,as has not yet come into force, until the matter had been referred to the Central Transport Consultative Committeeand their report had been received and considered by him.british broadcasting corporation.Renewal of the charter.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (52) 109) covering the draft of a White Paper announcing the Government^ proposals regarding the renewal of the Charter ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation.In a preliminary discussion some doubts were expressed aboutthe extent of the support which would be forthcoming in parliament for a proposal to end the B.B.C.&apos;s monopoly in respect of television.There were some indications that opposition to the principle ofsponsored programmes was growing; and it must be expected thatthis opinion Would be more strongly expressed if a positive proposalto allow sponsored programmes were presented to Parliament.Though a large majority of Government supporters in the House ofCommons wished to break the existing monopoly, it was by no means certain that their views were shared by a similar proportion of conservative voters throughout the countrv.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.
Copco Steel and       3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the!Engineering     President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the DuchyCompany,       of Lancaster (C. (52) 120) regarding the supply of steel&apos; windowDetroit. sections by a United Kingdom firm to the Copco Steel and EngineeringCompany of Detroit. This company had ordered 14,000 tons ofsections from the United Kingdom firm, who, after supplying the first4,000 tons which they had guaranteed to deliver, had been compelledto inform the American company that further deliveries would be suspended until additional supplies of steel were available. It had now been represented that failure to fulfil the remainder of this ordermight prejudice our chances of obtaining further economic assistancefrom the United States.The Foreign Secretary said that there was some risk that thecontinued suspension of these deliveries to the American companymight prejudice our prospects of obtaining the further economic aidwhich we were expecting to receive from the United States. he agreed, however, that &quot;the Government should, not on this count bringany pressure to bear on the United Kingdom firm to resume deliveries to the American company under, this order.The Cabinet Agreed that no action should be taken, to secure the earlyresumption of deliveries of steel window sections to theCopco Steel and Engineering Company of Detroit.Economic 4   The Cabinet took note of a memorandum by the ChancellorSituation.       of the Exchequer (C.
