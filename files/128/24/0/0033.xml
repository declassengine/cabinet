Employment.^ :J Textile andClothingIndustries.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the increasing unemployment in the textile and clothing industries. It was estimatedthat about 10 per cent, of the labour force of these industries waseither unemployed or working less than full time. In many of theareas affected these workers could not yet be absorbed into defence production.In discussion it was suggested that further orders should be placedin these areas for clothing for the Armed Forces and the Civil defence services. The Cabinet agreed that this possibility should be urgentlyexamined. They recognised, however, that only a limited relief couldbe obtained by these means, and that it would be necessary to&apos;consider other measures which would have more lasting and more widespread effects. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider these, in consultation with the Minister of Labour and the Presidentof the Board of Trade.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Home Secretaryto consider urgently what further orders could be placed for clothing for the Armed Forces and the Civil defence services with a view to relieving the unemployment in the textile and clothing industries.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider, with the other Ministers concerned, what further measures could be taken to alleviate this situation.Moscow 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that his attention had been drawnEconomic to a news report stating that Mr. G. B. Drayson, a ConservativeConference. Member of Parliament, had accepted an invitation to attend theforthcoming economic conference in Moscow. He had apparentlysaid that his main purpose in attending it would be to promote theexport of textile goods from this country to the Soviet Union. Neitherthe Labour Party nor the Trades Union Congress was proposing tosend delegates to this conference, and it was most undesirable that a conservative Member of Parliament should attend it.The Cabinet endorsed this view and asked the Chief Whip tomake further efforts to dissuade Mr. Drayson from attending theconference.Foreign Affairs. 3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Opposition, were nolonger anxious that a Foreign Affairs debate should be held in theHouse of Commons in the near future. This deprived him of anopportunity, which he would have been glad to take, of making apublic statement on foreign affairs; and he had been considering whether he should instead make a non-political broadcast on Sunday,29th March. The despatch of the reply to the Soviet note on germany (see Minute 6 below) could be made the occasion for thisbroadcast.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be useful for the Foreign Secretary to make a broadcast statement onforeign affairs in the near future. Some doubts were, however,expressed about the expediency of making such a statement on aSunday. It was a long-standing tradition of the Conservative Party&apos; to avoid political activities on Sundays; and some Ministers felt thatcertain sections of public opinion would prefer that this convention should apply to Ministerial broadcasts on political subjects unless theywere of special urgency. Other Ministers considered that, while itwould be mistaken for the Conservative Party to hold political meet-ings on Sundays, a non-controversial broadcast on foreign affairs wason a different footing and was unlikely to offend public feeling.42125-1 &quot; B 2
Road and rail transport.(previous reference:CC. (51) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by theLord President (C. (52) 83) reporting the conclusions of the Committeewhich had been considering the reorganisation of road and rail transport, and (ii) a draft announcement of the Governmenfs intentionto amend the Transport Act, 1947, which was handed round by theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power.The Committee had drawn up a plan for returning road haulage to private enterprise; for recouping the possible loss to theState by a levy on road haulage; for meeting the probable continuingloss to the railway system either by an extension of this levy or by direct Exchequer assistance; and for the ultimate abolition of the25-mile limit on the operations of &quot; A &quot; licensees. Their detailedsuggestions were summarised in paragraph 18 of C. (52) 83.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) There was much feeling among Government supporters thatno further time should be lost in redeeming the pledges given beforethe Election about the future of road haulage, and some consideredthat legislation for this purpose should take priority over the Ironand Steel Bill. Although legislation could not be introduced forsome time, it might be desirable to make an early announcementof the Governmenfs intentions on the lines of the draft prepared bythe Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power.(b) It was suggested that this draft announcement was perhapstoo detailed and might be found subsequently to tie the Governmenfshands unduly. An alternative possibility might be simply to announce that the undertaking of the Road Haulage Executive would be offered for sale in suitable units by open tender carrying the right to operate at once free of any mileage limit. But so limited an announcementmight provoke criticism that the Government proposed merely to deprive the Transport Commission of their most remunerative under-taking, while leaving untouched the problem of the solvency andreorganisation of the railways.(c) The Minister of State for Economic Affairs explained, on thelines of paragraph 11 of C. (52) 83, his objection to the use of a levy on road transport to meet continuing deficiences arising from theoperation of the railways. Although it was natural to suggest thatthe whole transport system should be made self-supporting in thisway, the proposal made by the Committee would remove the mainincentive to railway efficiency; and the more efficient road haulageand the more inefficient the railways became, the greater would bethe subsidy to be paid by the efficient to the inefficient. And as time went on it would become more and more difficult for thosewho had to assess the amount of the levy to determine what railwaylosses were attributable to transfer of traffic to the roads resultingfrom this legislation and what losses were due to other causes.(d) Although at first sight.it might seem inequitable to maintain25-mile limit for the most of the period during which the under-taking of the Road Haulage Executive was being transferred to private enterprise, it was necessary to do this if that undertaking wasto yield a reasonable price. AncLthe injustice was less than might appear, since many of those subject to the limit were and always hadbeen short-distance hauliers. A more liberal attitude towardsapplications to exceed the limit by particular businesses or on particular occasions would greatly diminish the objections to themaintenance of the limit for this interim period.The Foreign Secretary said that he would not wish to be com-mitted to making a wholly non-controversial statement; and he Wundertook to consider, in the light of the views expressed in the cabinet&apos;s discussion, whether he should give his broadcast on thefollowing Sunday or on a weekday.
17.3CC. 33 (52)(e) The number of instances in which the present operation ofthe 25-mile limit was giving rise to hardship was not large. But theTransport Commission should be given the earliest possible indica-tion of the Governmenfs general intentions regarding the amendmentof the Transport Act, 1947, and in particular regarding the 25-mile limit. When that was done, the Commission might be asked to refrain from any action which would tend to hinder the carrying into effectof the Governmenfs intentions; and in particular to refrain from anyfurther tightening of its administration of the mileage limit. If neces-sary the Commission might be given a direction to this effect.(/) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt some doubts about the proposals before the Cabinet, not only because of the diffi-culty explained by the Minister of State for Economic Affairs, but more generally because they might not succeed in solving the problemof the railways. It appeared to him that the proposals went further than the pre-Election pledges given by members of the present Gov-ernment, and he would welcome an opportunity of examining themfurther with the Ministers concerned. He felt that some consultationwith the British Transport Commission should be undertaken beforethe Cabinet reached any decision of principle in the matter.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President to arrange for a study of theproposals in C. (52) 83 to be made by a group of Ministersconsisting of the members of the Road and Rail transport committee, together with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Labourand the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and toreport to the Cabinet on the results of this study and onthe form which any announcement of the governments intentions should take.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to secure, if possible, an informal understanding with the British Transport Corn-mission to refrain from any action which would tend tohinder the carrying into effect of the governments intentions in relation to road haulage, particularly inrelation to the administration of the 25-mile limit; and,if such an understanding could not be reached, to raisewith the Cabinet the question of issuing a formal direction to that effect to the Commission.5. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent disorders in Triestereflected the unsatisfactory situation which had arisen from the state-ment, made three years ago on behalf of the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, the United States and France, that both Zone Aand Zone B should eventually pass under Italian sovereignty. this statement had been made at the time of the Italian elections with aview to preventing the election of a Communist Government; and,although it might have helped to secure that immediate objective, ithad produced a state of continuing deadlock between the italians and the Yugoslavs. At the Lisbon meeting of the North atlantic council he had suggested that the three Western Powers shouldtogether seek a means of breaking this deadlock, and conversationsfor this purpose had already begun in Washington. The recentdisorders made it even more urgent to find a solution. He himself was now inclined to the view that the best course would be for theUnited Kingdom and the United States to withdraw their occupationforces from Trieste, and leave the Italians in occupation of Zone Aand the Yugoslavs in Zone B. Under this arrangement italy would retain the city and the port, but Yugoslavia wouldhave port facilities at Pola. The Italians and Yugoslavs could beleft to agree upon an ethnographical frontier, which could readily be adjusted by small transfers of population. This solution would havethe advantage of enabling us to withdraw about 5,000 troops and
reduce our overseas expenditure. It would involve the risk of leavingItaly and Yugoslavia confronting one another, without supervision,along a common frontier. On the other hand, Anglo-Italian relationswould deteriorate seriously if some early solution were not found.The Minister of Defence said that in his view the suggestion madeby the Foreign Secretary would produce the most equitable result.Every precaution should, however, be taken to ensure that our with-drawal was not immediately followed by an outbreak of hostilities between Italians and Yugoslavs.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to explore the possibilityof securing the agreement of the United States and french governments to the termination of the Allied occupationof Trieste on the basis which he had suggested.Germany.Soviet Proposalfor Discussionof Peace Treaty.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, the United States and France had now reached agreement on the terms of the reply to be sent to the Soviet note of10th March proposing the conclusion of a Peace Treaty withGermany. The Chancellor of the German Federal Republic was alsoin agreement with the terms of the proposed reply. The foreign secretary handed to the Cabinet copies of the reply, which was being dispatched at once and would be published on the following day.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the terms of the reply to this note from the Soviet Government.bechuanaland protectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference:C.C.(52)31stConclusions,minute .)7. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that,together with his predecessor, he had seen Seretse Khama and his wifeon the preceding day in accordance with the arrangements of whichthe Cabinet had been informed on 18th March. His impression wasthat, while Seretse had expected to be excluded permanently from the chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe, he had been surprised bythe offer of a post under the Government of Jamaica and wished togive it careful consideration. He would be giving his answer on thefollowing day. If he agreed to abdicate, a statement would be issued on 27th March on the lines of Appendix &quot; A &quot; to C. (52) 81, though this draft would be amended to meet any reasonable wishes whichSeretse might express. If he declined to abdicate, an alternative&apos;state-ment would be made on the lines of Appendix &quot; B &quot; to C. (52) 81.The Commonwealth Secretary proposed to delete paragraph 5 of that draft in order to avoid direct reference to European opinion in SouthAfrica; and he would amend paragraphs in order to reduce theprominence given to opinion outside the High Commission Terri-tories. He would also consider whether the statement, if it had to bemade, could be shortened and made less critical of Seretse, in par-ticular, by amendment of the opening words of paragraph 8.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.National Health 8. The Minister of Health informed the Cabinet that arbitrationService. proceedings, arranged by the previous Government, to settle the remuneration remuneration of general practitioners in the National Health Serviceof Doctors. had now been concluded and he must inform Parliament of the resultsforthwith. The Spens Committee, which had made the original pro-posals on the level of remuneration of doctors in the National health service, had framed recommendations, accepted by the late Govern-ment, in terms of the value of money in 1939.   The purpose of the
present arbitration, which had been conducted by Mr. Justice Danck-werts, had been to assess the adjustments which should be made inthe remuneration recommended by the Spens Committee to take account of changes in circumstances since 1939. The award seemedto be based on a total rejection of the case put forward on behalf ofthe Government and involved complete compensation for the riseover the pre-war cost of living. The additional cost in the current year would be  10 millions and, as the award was effective from1948-49 onwards, a supplementary estimate for some  40 milionswould be necessary to meet the total payments to be made under it upto the end of 3952-53. This would much more than counterbalancethe reductions which the Government proposed to make in the costof the National Health Service; and it was to be feared that the awardmight have repercussions on the remuneration of other classes.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Health.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th March, 1952.
