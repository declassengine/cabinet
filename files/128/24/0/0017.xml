JfTheCoronation.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Corona-tion was likely to be held in the spring of 1953- It was understoodthat the Governments of Australia and New Zealand would probablyprefer that the queen should postpone her visit to those countriesuntil after her Coronation. The Royal Visit to Australia and NewZealand might therefore be made in the autumn of 1953.parliamentary in theHouse ofCommons.2. The Cabinet discussed the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons When Parliament resumed on 19th February. they agreed that Supplementary Estimates should be taken Oh 21st february-ary, that the foreign affairs debate should be resumed on26th February, and that a defence debate should be held on28th February. The Second Reading of the National Health service bill would be postponed until after the Budget.legislative programme.1951-52Session.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (C. (52) 35) calling attention to the adjustments which wouldhave to be made in the Legislative Programme as a result of the adjournment of Parliament, in consequence of The King&apos;s death, andthe decision to introduce the Budget in March.In a preliminary discussion the Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to the urgency of the Housing Bill, the Housing (Scotland) Bill, the herring Industry Bill, the Foreign Visiting Forces Bill and the GenevaConventions Bilk It was suggested that the last two of these mightbe introduced in the House of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to consider the Parliamentary handling of the Ironand Steel Bill When the Bill was ready for submission to.   them.(2)  Agreed to resume their discussion of the remainder of theLegislative Programme at a future meeting.Egypt andthe Sudan.(previous references:C.C. (52) 4thConclusions,Minute 5 and conclusions minute 3.)Defence.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 32) recommending the resumption of negotiationswith Egypt on defence questions and on the Sudan.The Foreign Secretary said that, if We could reach an agreementwith the Egyptian Government involving their participation in theMiddle East Command and the grant of full facilities to allied forcesin time of war or Of threat of war in the Canal Zone, we might be ableto arrange, not only to retain in Egypt the technicians needed for themaintenance of the base, but also to maintain indefinitely a smallcombatant force in the Canal Zone. It might be necessary, however,to contemplate basing the major part of our forces elsewhere in theMiddle East, perhaps at Gaza or in Jordan. He sought authority to embark on the first three stages of the negotiations Set out in Annex Ito C. (52) 32^ involving agreement to resume discussions,, the formula-tion of an agreed agenda and the issue of a joint communique.In the discussion the following points were made: -(a) The British base in the Canal Zone Was the largest militarybase in the world and included costly accommodation, maintenancefacilities and stores. A substantial transfer of the base to anotherpart of the Middle East would be extremely costly, and The Chan-cellor of the Exchequer asked that he should be kept in touch withthis aspect of the negotiations. No accommodation or facilities atpresent existed in Gaza, where there were large numbers of Arab42121-1 b 2
refugees who would have to be moved before we could transfer forces there. We should not commit ourselves to maintaining the canal zone base by the use of civilian staff only, since civilians would not accept present living conditions in the Zone.(b) The Prime Minister saw serious objection to the suggestionthat we should contemplate the removal of the British mobile land forces from the Canal Zone within a period of one year. recent experience had demonstrated our power to maintain our position inEgypt, and he did not think we should relinquish it until our forces were replaced by adequate allied forces under a Middle East Com-mand. He therefore suggested that we should make no immediateoffer of withdrawal, but should keep this in reserve as a possible means of bringing pressure to bear on our Allies to induce them to share with us the responsibility of defending the international water-way. Even if satisfactory plans could be made for Four-Powerdefence of the area with Egyptian co-operation, it would probably be impracticable for us to leave the Zone within a year.In discussion it was pointed out that paragraph 2(d) of C. (52) 32did not contemplate that we should withdraw our troops from the canal Zone unless a prior settlement satisfactory to. us had beenreached on all the other outstanding questions relating to the defenceof the Middle East.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that, not only were we committed to the re-opening of discussions with the Egyptian Government, butwe had at the present time a more favourable opportunity to resume negotiations than any that was likely to occur again. The present government in Egypt might, if we delayed, be replaced by one much less well-disposed to us.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to authorise Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Egypt, if this became necessary, to embark on Stages I and II of the negotiations outlined in Annex Ito C. (52)32. ,(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the light of their discussion,to reconsider the wording of the draft communique set outin Stage III of that Annex; and agreed to resume on18th February their discussion of the communique and ofthe remaining proposals in C. (52) 32.The Sudan. In Annex II to C. (52) 32 were set out two alternative suggestionsregarding the attitude which we should adopt to Egyptian claimsconcerning the Sudan. Under the first proposal we should hold thatthe all-Sudanese Parliament which was to be elected should decide thequestion of King Farouk&apos;s nominal sovereignty; that the elections forthe Parliament should be observed by an International Commission;and that the Egyptian Government should send a representative to theSudan to discuss these proposals. The second alternative involvedrecognition of the Egyptian Crown as a symbolic link&apos; between egypt and the Sudan, although there was to be no interference by Egypt inthe steps being taken towards Sudanese self-Governrrient or in thefreedom of the Sudanese to settle their own future.In discussion it was suggested that the International Commission,proposed in the first of these alternatives, to observe the conduct ofSudanese elections should consist of representatives only of Egypt,the United Kingdom and the Sudanese. Wider representation mightcreate an embarrassing precedent in relation to the Colonies..     The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that in further negotiations with the egyptian government the attitude of the United Kingdom Govern-. ment towards the Sudanese question should be that suggested in the first paragraph of Annex II to C. (52) 32.

89C.C.War Criminals.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 18thConclusions,Minute 3.)Germany. 5.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda bythe Foreign Secretary:  C. (52) 31 on the German Contractual Settlement;C. (52) 23 on the Political Situation in the German federal republic;C. (52) 36 on the German Financial Contribution to Defence.The first of these memoranda set out in detail the present stateof the negotiations for the replacement of the occupation arrangementsby a contractual settlement between the three Occupying Powers andthe German Federal Republic. The Foreign Secretary wished par-ticularly to draw the attention of his colleagues to three matters onwhich questions of special difficulty arose, viz., the custody of war criminals, the German financial contribution to defence and the limitations to be maintained on German arms production.In their previous discussion on 19th December the Cabinet had contemplated that responsibility for the custody of war criminals heldin the three Western Zones of Germany would be transferred to theGerman Federal Government and that a tribunal of three judges, oneAllied, one German and one neutral, would be charged with theexercise of powers, of clemency. It was now found that the UnitedStates and French Governments would prefer the establishment of a tribunal with advisory powers only and consisting of representativesof the Allied Government concerned and of the German government without the addition of a neutral. The German Government were,however, known to prefer the British proposal and it seemed likely that if we stood firm the United States and French governments would accept our plan.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their support for the handing over to Germancustody of war criminals in the three Allied Zones and forthe establishment of tribunals of three members con-sisting of one Allied, one German and one neutral judge to exercise the power of clemency.The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that the Govern-ments concerned had provisionally agreed at the Rome meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council that a financial contribution to defenceamounting to 13 milliard Reichsmarks a year should be sought fromthe German Federal Government. As he had informed the Cabineton 12th February, the United States Government seemed willing toaccept a much lower figure. He had now been informed that theNorth Atlantic Temporary Council Committee would recommend a contribution of 11 - 25 milliard Reichsmarks as representing a burden on Germany comparable with that to be borne by the North atlantic treaty Powers. In agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequerhe proposed to endeavour in further negotiation to reach a settlement on this figure. If this could be obtained, it seemed likely that theGermans would be unable for some time to spend more than a part oftheir contribution on their own direct defence effort and that weshould therefore continue to obtain assistance for a time towards thecost of maintaining our forces in Germany.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to press for settlement of theGerman financial contribution to defence at the levelrecommended by the Temporary Council Committee.Security The Foreign Secretary said that the European Defence Corn-Safeguards, munity Agreement would prescribe the nature and amount of the arms production to be undertaken by Germany. It would remainnecessary, however, to reach agreement on atomic energy develop-ment and on the production of civil aircraft.   As regards the formerGermanDefenceContribution.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 16thConclusions,Minute 4.)
european defence community.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 21stConclusions,Minute 2.)national registration.he thought it likely that the Gentian Government would introduce!legislation to bar atomic energy work in their territory. It had hitherto been agreed between the Occupying Powers that the pro-duction of civil aircraft, which would create capacity suitable for theproduction of military aircraft, should be prohibited in Germany. TheUnited States Government, seeing difficulty in providing from theirown manufacture the civil aircraft needed by Germany, seemed nowto be willing to relax this ban. It was, however, desirable that weshould insist ort its maintenance as a military safeguard. We mightbe able to sell civil aircraft to the Germans from our own production.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should endeavour in further negotiation to maintain the ban on the productionof civil aircraft in Germany.6. The Foreign Secretary said that the next few weeks wOUld bea critical time in the establishment of the European Defence Corn-munity. The Governments who were to be members Of theCommunity, and in particular the French, would be greatly assisted by a public indication, possibly in the form of a declaration fatherthan of a formal agreement, that the United Kingdom and UnitedStates Governments would oppose any flagrant breach of the Treatyby Which the Community was to be established on the part of any oneof its members. The Foreign Secretary proposed to ascertain with more precision the wishes of the French Government and wouldthereafter refer the matter to the Cabinet again.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement; and approved in principle the suggestion that the UnitedKingdom Government might make a declaration of support for the European Defence Community on the lines indicated by him.7. The Minister of Health informed the Cabinet that, subject tocertain legal points which required further examination, he hoped tobe able to announce in the coming week the abolition of national registration and of identity cards.The Cabinet Took note Of this statement by the Minister of Health.Steel Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 14thConclusions,Minute 4.)Prices in the united kingdom.8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C. (52) 30) covering a minute from the Minister of Supply proposingan immediate increase in steel prices in the United Kingdom.       ;In the Cabinefs discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some preliminary consideration had already been given tothis proposal at meetings Which the Prime Minister had held withsome of his colleagues. Great difficulty had been found in securingfirm figures by which the need for the proposed increases in prices could be measured. Thus, no precise figures seemed to be availablefor the profits made by the steel industry in 1951. And a variety ofdifferent estimates had been given of the margin by which the cost ofsteel imported from the United States would exceed that of British-made steel. At the Cabinefs meeting new estimates were given ofthe average increase per ton represented by the proposed new prices.Though this was stated in C. (52) 30 to be about  4 a ton, the Ministerof Supply gave the Cabinet a figure of  4 5s. And the estimate ofthe average price needed to provide full compensation for the
increased costs, which in C. (52) 30 was put at about  5 a ton, wasgiven at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting as  5 15.?. a ton. The Minister ofSupply said that he had found great difficulty in obtaining precisefigures from the Iron and Steel Corporation.The Cabinet thought it unsatisfactory that Ministers should beasked to settle the prices of the product of a nationalised industry with-out having before them proper information about its costs and profits.There was special difficulty in dealing with a question of this kindon the basis of estimates of the marginal difference between theproduction costs of one year and another: it would have been more satisfactory if Ministers could have been given absolute figures for1951 which they could have compared with the estimates for 1952.It was agreed that any future application for an increase in steel prices should be supported by fuller and more reliable figures of costs and profits.(h) In the earlier discussions Ministers had provisionally agreedthat the increased cost of importing steel and steel-making materials should be covered by increased prices, but that some part of theincreased cost of home production should be borne by the steelindustry out of its profits. The Agreement made with the Iron andSteel Corporation, as described in C. (52) 30, seemed to imply thatthe increased cost of the additional 500,000 tons of United Statessteel allocated as a result of the Prime Ministers visit to Washingtonwould be borne out of the profits of the industry; and it was thereestimated that, if the whole of this additional supply was ha factimported, the industry would have to carry a cost of  14 millionout of its profits. An agreement expressed in these terms seemedto be open to two objections. First, the steel industry, who wouldbe responsible for buying the additional steel which had been allocated,might have an insufficient incentive to do so under an arrangement which meant that every additional ton which they bought would diminish their profits. Secondly, this arrangement would do nothing to check, the current tendency of producers to assume that increased costs could be passed on automatically to the consumer in the formof increased prices.In reply to the first point, The Minister of Supply said that steel prices in the United States varied from one plant, to another, and thearrangement described in C. (52) 30 would at least help to ensurethat the additional supplies were bought from the plants whose prices were lowest. On the second point, he said that, since the increased prices had been calculated, the estimate of the increased home production costs had risen by  5 million; and this amount wouldhave to be met from the profits of the industry.(c) Tt thus appeared that, of the estimated increased costs in1952,  19 million would be borne out of the profits of the industry.According to the figures presented by the Minister of Supply, 1.4 million of this represented increased import costs and  5 millionincreased costs of home production. The Chancellor of the exchequer said that, according to his information,  11 million representedincreased import costs and  8 million increased costs of home production. This discrepancy confirmed the Cabinet in the view thatit would be undesirable, in any public statement, to attempt to divide the total increase in costs between imports and home production.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that some further increase in prices might have to be authorised later in the year inorder to provide the industry with the necessary funds to pay for imports of steel and steel-making materials. The Minister of Supplythought that it should be possible to arrange for the funds necessaryfor this purpose to be provided out of the profits of the industry.(e) The Minister of Housing and Local Government asked that,before the new schedule of prices was announced, further considera-tion should be given to the possibility of a price incentive for themanufacture of the steel rods and high tensile wire which was used
for building in reinforced concrete. These types of steel wenurgently needed in order to secure economies in the use of steel for^building purposes, and at present prices insufficient quantities were produced. The Minister of Supply said that he was alreadyexamining this, as a result of a recommendation from the BuildingCommittee, and would consult further with the Minister of housing and Local Government before the price schedule was announced.(/) At an earlier stage, the Iron and Steel Corporation had been unwilling to support the proposed price increases. Now that theyhad accepted the need for these increases, and had agreed that thenew schedule of prices could be announced as carrying their concurrence, it was unlikely that there would be any great political difficulty in justifying the increases.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposed increases in steel prices in the United Kingdom.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Paymaster-General, together withthe Minister of Supply, to settle what figures should be quoted in, or in connection with, the public announcementof this decision.(3) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (2) above, the new prices should be announced within the next few days.Export Prices. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on steel export prices by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade and the Minister of Supply (C. (52) 27), and a memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 37) on the long-termimportance of maintaining the position of the United Kingdom as a major exporter of steel. These memoranda had been submitted in response to a request by the Prime Minister for information bearing on the question whether British steel was being exported at pricesbelow those charged by many of our competitors.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had gone carefullyinto this question, at the Prime Ministers request, and he was fullysatisfied that current transactions in the export of steel were a netadvantage to the national economy. Thus, it had been estimatedthat  800-worth of oil was produced for every ton of steel exportedby the oil companies. Some of the steel went immediately intodevelopment work; the benefit of this to our balance of paymentswas of the order of  2,000 per ton of steel exported.As regards the destination of steel exports, it was pointed outin discussion that steel exports were an indispensable bargainingfactor in securing our essential needs of scarce materials. It was true that we were not at present selling steel in some overseas markets where we could secure even higher prices for our steel than we were now obtaining. But we were not in a position to chooseour markets: we had to sell our steel to the countries from whichwe needed to obtain the food and materials essential to maintain our economy. And some of those countries would increase the pricesof the commodities which they were selling to us if we attempted to charge more for the steel which we exported to them.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of C. (52) 27 and 37; and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Minister of Supply, to keepthis matter under review so as to ensure that no opportunity was lost of securing higher export prices forBritish steel.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th February, 1952.
