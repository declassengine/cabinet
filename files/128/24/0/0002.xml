CommonwealthFinanceMinisters&apos;Meeting.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 3) explaining the objectives ofthe United Kingdom Government in the Meeting of commonwealth finance Ministers which was to open inXondon on 15th January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the prime purpose of theConference was to create confidence in the future of the sterling area and to convince the member Governments that it was to their advantage to remain in it. We must show them that between us wecould overcome our short-term difficulties and could plan in the longterm to restore the strength of sterling and ultimately to achieve con-vertibility. The short-term remedies for the present crisis wouldhave to include measures to restrict imports into the sterling area andto combat internal inflation in the member countries. It would bedesirable that the Finance Ministers should be given privately some general indication of the counter-inflationary measures contemplated by the United Kingdom Government. But we must also showwillingness to co-operate in long-term measures of economic develop-ment.throughout the sterling area, and to adopt policies which wouldinvolve risks. Some of the visiting Ministers would be anxious todiscuss such matters as non-discrimination in trade, and the UnitedKingdom Ministers concerned might usefully meet together, beforethe opening of the Conference, to consider the attitude which theyshould adopt.Discussion turned mainly on the interrelated questions of con-vertibility and non-discrimination. It was suggested that, while no steps could be taken in present circumstances towards greater con-vertibility of sterling, the ultimate aim should be to achieve totalconvertibility based, not on fixed rates of exchange, but on flexible and variable exchanges. Such a system would render unnecessaryany trade discrimination through the methods at present employed.On the other hand, the counter-inflationary measures likely to bedecided upon throughout the sterling area might not be sufficientlyquickly effective to reverse the present drain on the reserves of the sterling area. If that were to prove to be so, we might have to ask the sterling-area countries to embark for a time on new and more drastic measures of discrimination. It should, therefore, be the aim off United Kingdom Ministers in the forthcoming talks toavoid any commitments on non-discrimination and to treat non-discrimination as secondary to currency convertibility which, thoughit might not be practicable for a long time, should be the prior aim.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (52) 3).(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the forth-coming Conference of Commonwealth Finance ministers to indicate privately to those Ministers the nature of the counter-inflationary measures contemplated by the UnitedKingdom Government.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult with thePresident of the Board of Trade and with representativesof the Commonwealth Secretary and of the colonial secretary on the attitude to be adopted by UnitedKingdom Ministers in the course of the Conference.Tin and Steel 2.

Egypt- 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatSterling the Egyptians had asked for release of the  10 million which, underBalances.        the Sterling Releases Agreement, were to be made available to them(Previous        &quot; m the year 1952.&quot;  This release had not been made and the reference:       Egyptians had been informed by the Bank of England that theC.C. (51) 22nd   Treasury, to whom the matter had been referred, had replied that theConclusions,     bank would be advised when the release might be made.   the minute 3.)       Egyptians had not asked for release of the additional sum of  5 million to which they were entitled under the Agreement.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer had confirmed that we were in a position at short notice to impose restrictions of any desired degree of severityon the uses which the Egyptians might make of their sterlingresources.   There was no evidence of any attempt by them to carryout any unusual transactions.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, SWA,10th January, 1952.Trade with 3.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that a telegramChina. had been received from the Foreign Secretary (Washington telegramNo. 59) asking for comments on a memorandum handed to him bythe United States Secretary of State which contended that the UnitedKingdom was continuing to give substantial assistance to communist china through trade in strategic and other materials from british sources or carried in British ships. It was true that, although we hadstopped the supply to China of strategic materials from british sources, we had not cut off all trade in non-strategic materials and aninsignificant quantity of strategic materials from other sources was still being carried to China in British ships. The Economic PolicyCommittee had decided that we should not impose control of british shipping carrying goods from non-British sources to China unlessother nations imposed similar controls. A factual reply to theForeign Secretary&apos;s telegram had been prepared in the ForeignOffice which contained an adequate answer to the United Statescriticisms. Of the British ships which had recently visited Chineseports a very small proportion were ocean-going ships and nearly all of these had gone to China in ballast.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no change should be made for the present in theUnited Kingdom&apos;s controls over trade with China.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the telegram fromthe Foreign Secretary to be answered on the lines whichhe had indicated to the Cabinet.
