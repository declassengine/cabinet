141CC. 29 (52)The Cabinet.NationalService.Call-upof skilled workers.(previous reference:CC. (52) 10thConclusions,Minute 5.)East-west trade.Exports of rubber toRussia.1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, with his approval, Lord Ismay had undertaken to accept appointment as secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Council. The cabinet would, he knew, share his regret at losing Lord Ismay&apos;s services as amember of the Government; but they would wish him success in theimportant office which he was now to assume.The Marquess of Salisbury would become Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations and would in addition continue to act as leader of the House of Lords. In this latter capacity he would havethe assistance of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, whofor this purpose would in future attend more regularly the meetingsof the Cabinet.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power(C. (52) 67) proposing, after consultation with the Ministers concerned,that a limited scheme should be introduced for deferring the call-upof skilled ex-apprentices employed on certain types of armament pro-duction. The scheme was of a much more limited character than thatwhich had previously been before the Cabinet, since it was confined to men employed on certain designated projects of the highest importance and to apprentices who had acquired a high degree ofskill in a few selected occupations. These projects and occupationswere set out in the Appendix to C. (52) 67. No man would be compelled to accept deferment; and the Services, notwithstanding thescheme, would be empowered to take any of these ex-apprenticeswhom they required as tradesmen and whose skill they could fullyuse. If the scheme were adopted only about 750 men would beaffected in any year, and this would not involve so serious an encroach-ment on the principle of universal service as to provoke irresistibledemands for its extension.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Supply asked that the scheme should beextended to include certain additional trades, particularly electriciansand aero-engine fitters. If these were included, the total numberinvolved would be raised from 750 a year to slightly over 1,000 a year.(b) Some doubt had been felt about the inclusion of work onH.M.S. Victorious in the list of designated projects. It was, however,agreed that this project should remain in the list on the understandingthat the Admiralty would be able to resist demands for the extensionof these facilities to private shipyards.(c) The call-up of these men would be deferred for a period oftwo years, at the end of which time their position would be recon-sidered. They could not be given any assurance that they would notultimately be called up for national service, but most of them were likely to accept deferment without any such assurance.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to put into operation the schemeof deferment of skilled ex-apprentices proposed in C. (52) 67;and to add to the list of selected occupations within thescheme the additional trades of which the Minister of supply had sent him particulars.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 71) reviewing the arrangementsfor the control of exports of rubber from sterling sources to Russia.The President of the Board of Trade said that both the SovietGovernment and the United States Government were aware that itwas the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to limit these exports42124-1b 2
Germany. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that his colleagues would haveSoviet Proposal read in the newspapers that morning the text of the note which the for Discussion   Soviet Government had sent to the Governments of the Unitedof Peace Treaty. Kingdom, the United States and France proposing an early meetingof the Four Powers to discuss the terms of a Peace Treaty for germany.   The proposals put forward in this note represented anto a maximum of 80,000 tons a year. He thought that this limit should in any event be reaffirmed. Exports last year had, however, onlyreached a level of 56,000 tons and, with the knowledge andacquiescence of the United States Government we had allowed a quantity of 18,000 tons, which had been licensed, but had not been shipped, in 1951, to be shipped in the current quarter. This stillleft an amount of 6,000 tons due from last year. In the currentquarter 50,000 tons had already been exported: this was made upof the 18,000 tons licensed in 1951, 26,000 tons licensed in the currentquarter and 6,000 tons for which licenses had been issued to count against the second quarter of 1952. The Russians had already boughtand arranged shipment for a further 9,000 tons not so far licensed.Since the shipping to move this quantity had already arrived or was due to arrive shortly, it might be desirable that further licenses tothis amount should be issued now against next quarter.- This could hardly be refused at the beginning of April and this proposal would therefore only anticipate it by some three weeks. To refuse might provoke a serious dispute with the Russians with a resultant risk toour imports of coarse grains, which were essential to our economy.Of the contract for 1 million tons of coarse grains, about 350,000 tons would be outstanding at the end of this month.In discussion the following points were, made:  (a) Shipments in the current quarter (at 50,000 tons) were already very heavy in relation to the annual limit on rubber exports to Russia.The release of a further 9,000 tons at the present time would be diffi-cult to defend against possible United States criticism, even thoughthe total included 18,000 tons which counted against last year&apos;s limit.(^Difficulties with the United States Government over thisquestion would make it harder for us to persuade them to adopta more helpful policy in relation to their own requirements of rubberfrom Malaya.(c) In spite of the weakness of our bargaining position, we shouldbe well advised to spread shipments of rubber more evenly over trieyear and to hold up deliveries for bargaining purposes against latershipments of coarse grains.After further discussion the Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade (i) to refrain fromlicensing the export of the 9,000 tons of rubber alreadybought by the Soviet Government until the beginning ofthe second quarter of the year; and (ii) to inform theRussians that this 9,000 tons, together with the 6,000 tons for which licences against the second quarter had alreadybeen issued, represented the total quantity which couldbe licensed for export in that quarter; and (iii) to deferfor consideration later in the year, in the light of coarse-grain shipments from Russia, the question of issuingfurther licences against the annual limit of 80,000 tons for1952 and against the balance of 6,000 tons by which thetotal licences issued for 1951 fell below the 80,000-tonlimit.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to inform both the UnitedStates and Soviet Governments that we should in no circumstances issue licences for exports of rubber toRussia at a rate exceeding 80,000 tons per year.
important advance on any offer which the Soviet Government had previously made regarding the future status of Germany. They haddoubtless been prompted by the progress achieved at the Lisbonmeeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council towards the establish-ment of a European Defence Community which would enable theGerman Federal Republic to make her contribution towards thedefence of Western Europe. They were clearly designed to placatepublic opinion in Germany and at the same time to arouse misgivingsin France, and thus to jeopardise the chances of a satisfactory under-standing between France and Western Germany. The note wastherefore an astute manoeuvre by the Soviet Government; but itmight reflect a sincere desire on their part to make a further efforttowards the achievement of a united Germany. Preliminary informa-tion from Bonn indicated that the German Chancellor had not beendeceived by this specious appeal to the German desire for the unification-tion of Germany. This strengthened the Foreign Secretary&apos;s convic-tion that the wise course for the Western Powers was to go forward with the discussions now proceeding with a view to bringing western germany into the European Defence Community and placing the irrelations with the German Federal Republic on a contractual basis.When these negotiations were even nearer to completion, the SovietGovernment might come forward with a more satisfactory offer. the test of their sincerity would be their willingness to agree to the holding of free elections, under independent supervision, throughoutGermany; and it was perhaps significant that there was no mention of this in their present proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that later in the month the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and France and the Chancellor ofthe German Republic would all be in Paris on Council of Europebusiness. He proposed to suggest to the United States Governmentthat they should send to Paris at that time a representative who coulddiscuss with the others concerned the reply to be returned to theSoviet note.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s appreciation of the significance of this Soviet note and with his proposals for handling it.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Travel 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in pursuance of an agree-Restrictions on ment reached at the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic CouncilDiplomatic and with the concurrence of the Home Secretary, he had notified theRepresentatives Soviet Ambassador and the Roumanian and Bulgarian Ministers inof Soviet and London that (with the exception of the Bulgarian Minister or ChargeSatellite d&apos;Affaires), neither they nor the members of their staffs would inGovernments, future be allowed to travel more than twenty-five miles fromHyde Park Corner without notifying the Foreign Office forty-eight hours in advance. These restrictions had been imposed by way of retaliation for the similar restrictions to which British diplomatic representatives were subjected in the Soviet Union, Roumania and bulgaria. The exception in favour of the Bulgarian Minister or charge d Affaires had been made because the British Minister in Sofiawas exempt from the corresponding restrictions imposed in Bulgaria.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the restrictions which had been imposed upon the movements of Soviet, Roumanian andBulgarian diplomatic representatives in London.
6. The Lord President said that he was anxious that the Ministerof Food should be authorised to spend  12 million on meat importsfrom South America and to arrange for the best practical bargain tobe made on prices with the producers, who were mainly in Uruguay.He thought that, in view of the food subsidy changes which theChancellor of the Exchequer had announced in the Budget, it might now be possible for these imports to be secured through privatetraders.The Cabinet Agreed to discuss this proposal at an early meeting on thebasis of a memorandum to be circulated by the Minister ofFood.7. The Cabinet had before them three memoranda by theForeign Secretary (C. (52) 63, 69 and 70) on the negotiations with egypt on defence and the Sudan. The Foreign Secretary proposedthat H.M. Ambassador at Cairo should be instructed, on lines set out in detail in paragraph 7 of C. (52) 63, to open discussions with the Egyptian Government. He should also be authorised toarrange at an appropriate stage the issue of a joint public statement with the Egyptian Government on the lines of a redraft of Annex IIto C. (52) 69, which the Foreign Secretary circulated at the meeting.Discussion turned mainly on the terms of paragraph (2) of this proposed joint statement. It was feared that the public reference tothe evacuation of British forces was insufficiently linked with theagreement of the Egyptian Government to participate in a collective defence organisation of the Middle East, and committed us further than was wise towards a Government which was by no meansstrongly based. It would therefore be preferable that this paragraph should be amended so as to read: &quot; Therefore Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom accept the principle of the progressivewithdrawal of British combatant troops from Egyptian soil upon thefooting that the Royal Egyptian Government agree to participatefully with the Governments of other interested Powers in a collective defence organisation for the Middle East in accordance with the charter of the United Nations.&quot;It was also agreed that paragraph (5) of the draft joint statement should be amended so as to read: &quot; Both Governments recognise the rights of the Sudanese people to self-determination.&quot;H.M. Ambassador might be authorised, when opening thenegotiations, to inform the Egyptian Government that as soon as talkswere effectively in progress Her Majesty&apos;s Government would, as anentirely separate matter, consider withdrawing some of the reinforce-ments which they had recently sent to Egypt. The Minister ofDefence undertook to examine this question with the Chiefs of staff and to communicate to the Foreign Secretary a form of words whichcould be used by H.M. Ambassador.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary (i) to instruct H.M. ambassador in Cairo on the lines of paragraph 7 of C. (52) 63; (ii) toinform H.M. Ambassador in Cairo of the terms of thejoint statement, amended in the light of their discussion,which they would be willing to issue with the egyptian government at. the appropriate stage.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to continue for thetime being to withhold the sum of  10 million which was due to be made available to the Egyptians under the sterling Releases Agreement in the year 1952.
Council of 8.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignEurope. Secretary (C. (52) 40) and by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C. (52) 56) on the future of the Council of Europe.The Foreign Secretary suggested that we should propose theremodelling of the organisation of the Council of Europe so that itcould perform some useful functions in relation to the Schuman Plan,the European Defence Community and any future organisations of similar structure and membership. He thought that the suggestion made by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in C. (52) 56for the creation of a European Federation on the lines of theCommonwealth was unlikely to meet the wishes of the european nations, many of which wished to go much further in the directionof federation. He feared, too, that the linking of European currenciesindividually or collectively to sterling, which the Minister contem-plated, might weaken the cohesion of the sterling area and of theCommonwealth.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that hethought it premature to make any decision as to the future organisa-tion of the Council of Europe at the present time.If the Schuman Plan and the European Defence Communitycame into being, he agreed that their constitutional bodies should betaken under the guidance of the Council of Europe; but in such away as would allow of discussion, not only among the Ministers and parliamentary delegates of countries which were members, but alsoamong representatives of countries which were not members of thefederalist organisations.He adhered to his view that &quot; our aim should be to subordinatethe Continental Federation to the Council of Europe rather than to subordinate the Council to the Continental Federation.&quot;The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question on thefollowing day.Cabinet Office, SWA,13th March, 1952.
