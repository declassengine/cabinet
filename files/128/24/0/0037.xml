17CC. 37 (52)Farm price review.(previous reference:CC. (52) 36thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that the minister or Agriculture had received a letter from the farmers&apos; representativessuggesting that the figure of  52J million, which had been put tothem in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 3rd April, should beregarded as a net figure (viz., that it should not include the  2  milliongiven in the 1951 review as an addition to livestock prices for thatyear only), and suggesting that certain other conditions should beadded. Preliminary calculations which had been made by officials of the Departments concerned indicated that, if the suggestions madein this letter were accepted, an additional  4 million would have tobe paid over and above the figure to which the Minister of Agriculturehad been authorised to go in an attempt to secure an agreed settle-ment. There were indications that, even at that figure, the farmers would not be willing to abate their demand for increased milk prices.The farmers&apos; representatives were to seek further instructions fromtheir Council at a meeting to be held on 8th April; and negotiations would not be resumed until after that meeting.It. was the general view of the Cabinet that the Minister ofAgriculture should not, in reply to this letter, make any advance onthe offer which he had already made in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 3rd April. It would, however, be convenient if he couldcirculate for the information of the Cabinet a note of the develop-ments which had taken place since that date. If, in the light of that,the Cabinet wished to give the Minister any further guidance, this could be conveyed to him before the negotiations were resumed in thefollowing week.Unemployment. 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the textile and President of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 94) summarising for theirClothing information the main suggestions which had been made for alleviatingIndustries.       the unemployment in the clothing arid textile industries.(Previous jn a preliminary discussion the following points were made:  Reference \CC. (52) 33rd (a) Direct help could be given by placing Government orders,Conclusions, e-8-&apos; ^or reserve stocks of clothing for the Armed Forces and CivilMinute 1.) &apos;    Defence Services.   So far as practicable, these should be placed inthe areas where no alternative work was available for unemployedtextile workers.(b) It had previously been suggested that the position would be eased if textile manufacturers were enabled to buy more dollar cotton.There would now, however, be little advantage in this, as the priceof dollar cotton was now only very little less than that of other types.(c) Little relief could be afforded by adjustments of purchase tax. Temporary suspension of purchase tax would be disturbing totrade and would not be welcomed by the retailers. Any concessionsmade would have to be permanent; and, as a large part of Lancashire&apos;output was already free of purchase tax, only 30 per cent, of theindustry would benefit from any concession made. There would,however, be advantage in removing some of the anomalies whichwould result from the operation of the &quot; D &quot; scheme.The Cabinet agreed that, despite the difficulties a determined effort must be made to. relieve the unemployment in the textile and clothing industries. They were informed that the various possibilitieshad been fully examined by officials of the Departments concerned,and that a report would be available for their consideration early inthe following week.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their. meeting on 8th April.42126-1 B 2
National 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterAssistance.      of National Insurance (C. (52) 96) seeking authority to approve pro-(Previous        visional proposals made to him by the National Assistance Board for reference:      increased national assistance scales. . The main proposals were thatCC. (52) 27th   the existing rates of 50s. for a married couple and 30s. for a singleConclusions,    householder should be raised to 595. and 355. respectively.&apos; It would minute 3.)       be some months before the new rates could be brought into effect and on this account, and in order to avoid frequent changes, theBoard had been obliged to take into account, not only the increasein the cost of living which had already occurred, but also the prospectof further changes in the coming months.   In particular, accounthad been taken of the increases in food prices which would follow from the decisions announced in the Budget.    The Minister hadsatisfied himself that the proposals were reasonable.It was suggested that the Board&apos;s anticipation of future rises inthe cost of living should be given as little prominence as possible,since it might otherwise result in demands that these should similarly be  taken into account in wage negotiations. It would hardly bepossible, however, to depart from the normal practice of the national assistance Board in this matter, which was to take account not merely of the actual cost of living but of current trends in it.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to approve the provisional proposals for increased scales of national assistance made to him by the National Assistance Board.National 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of insurance. National Insurance (C. (52) 95) setting out the steps which he pro-previous posed to take to give effect to the proposals relating to nationalReference: insurance outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his BudgetCC (52) 27th speech, and seeking agreement in principle to the launching of an conclusions, enquiry into the State&apos;s financial provision for old people.Minute 3.) &apos; The Cabinet approved the proposals in the memorandum for.  the early announcement of the new rates of insurance benefits and.allowances and the introduction of legislation to bring them intoeffect.Discussion turned on the expediency of holding a general enquiry into the State&apos;s financial provision for old people. The Minister ofNational Insurance said that it would not be possible to pursue fur-ther at the present time his proposal for a compulsory increase in theminimum age of eligibility for national insurance pensions. Hethought, however, that it would be desirable to initiate a generalenquiry into the problem of the future growth in the burden of super-annuation payments, and he proposed to link this with an enquirycontemplated by the Home Affairs Committee into systems of occupa-tional pensions.The general body of opinion in the Cabinet was against initiatingany such general enquiry at the present time. It would in any event be undesirable to aim at increasing the minimum age of eligibility for national insurance pensions or to allow it to be thought that this possibility was being contemplated. Even if such an increase were to prove acceptable to the trade unions, it would be widely misunder-stood and would involve a modification in the contractual rights ofinsured persons. There was no reason, however, why further con-sideration should not be given to the improvement of existing induce-.    ments to the voluntary deferment of retirement.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of National Insurance (i) to introduce legislation, and to take the necessary administrative steps,to enable the rates of family allowances and insurance
benefits to be adjusted by the amounts and at the timesindicated in C. (52) 95; and (ii) to make an announcementaccordingly in the House of Commons in terms to be approved by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.Agreed that no further steps should be taken at present to initiate a general enquiry into the State&apos;s financial pro-vision for old people.european defence community.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 35thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 92) proposing that the United Kingdom Govern-ment should offer two separate guarantees of support for the Euro-pean Defence Community. .The Foreign Secretary explained that the first of these proposals was designed to give effect to the decision of principle which theCabinet had taken on 14th February.. A formal statement would beissued, on the lines indicated in Annex &quot; A &quot; to C. (52) 92, in whichthe Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States woulddeclare their interest in the European Defence Community, reaffirmtheir resolve to maintain armed forces in Europe, and declare that,if the integrity and unity of the European Defence Community werethreatened from any quarter, they would regard this as a matter ofthe gravest concern to them calling for consultation under Article iv of the North Atlantic Treaty.The second proposal was that the United Kingdom Governmentshould enter into formal treaty arrangements with the european defence Community, by which each would be obliged to give military assistance to the other, if either were the object of an armed attack in Europe. This obligation, which was defined in Annex &quot; B &quot; toC. (52) 92, would be limited in time to the period of validity of theNorth Atlantic Treaty. The purpose of so limiting it was to ensurethat the United Kingdom would not be left to honour this onerousobligation alone after the period during which, under the north atlantic Treaty, they could count on United States support fn doing so. .,The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Foreign secretary in C. (52) 92; and authorised him to communicate themto the Governments of the United States, France and othermembers of the European Defence Community with the explanation set out in paragraph 7 of that memorandum.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments of the course which theForeign Secretary proposed to take.Egypt andthe Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 35thConclusions,Minute 10.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s memorandum (C. (52) 98) on the formula to be used as a basis for resuming negotiations with the Egyptian Government.The Foreign Secretary said that since the Cabinefs previous dis-cussion on 1st April the prospects of securing a resumption of thenegotiations had not improved. He saw only two possible means of preventing the deadlock from continuing. One Was to summon toLondon, for discussions, both Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo andthe Governor-General of the Sudan. The other was for him to gohimself to Cairo and Khartoum for consultations.The Prime Minister said that, of these alternatives, he would greatly prefer the first. For himself, however, he was not persuadedthat we had much to gain by pressing for the resumption of negotia-tions on the basis suggested.   In his view the first need was to
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th April, 1952.demonstrate to the Egyptian Government and people that we werJnot to be turned out of the Canal Zone by force or by threats. Theshow of force which we had recently made had produced good results;and he believed that still further advantages might be secured by making it clear that we were not in any hurry to abandon our rights under the existing Treaty. Our second objective should be to con-vince the United States Government that effective international arrangements would have to be made for safeguarding the security ofthe Suez Canal after the expiration of the present Treaty. It shouldbe made clear to the Americans that we were not prepared to go oncarrying this burden alone, and that they would have to take their share in fulfilling this international obligation. In this lay the best hope of persuading Egypt to join in an international organisation which would serve, not merely to protect the Canal, but to safeguard the security of the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary&apos; said that it was his aim to guide thenegotiations along lines which would draw the Egyptian Governmentinto accepting a commitment to enter into international arrangementsfor the defence of the Middle East and, at the appropriate stage, to seek to enlarge the discussions by associating with them the Govern-. ments of the United States. France and Turkey. It was, however,clear that the Egyptian Government would not enter at the outsetinto multilateral negotiations with the four Powers; and it was forthis reason that he proposed to start the discussions on a bilateralbasis. The formula set out in C. (52) 98 was designed solely for thepurpose of getting the negotiations started. The Cabinet should,however, understand that no agreement would be concluded unlessthe Egyptians could be persuaded in the discussions to accept some sort of share in an international organisation for the defence of theMiddle East.After further discussion the Prime Minister indicated that hewould be prepared to agree that an attempt should be made to resume the negotiations with the Egyptian Government on the basisof the formula set out in paragraph 1 of C. (52) 98, if the foreign secretary would withdraw his suggestion for a Unilateral declarationof our aims in the terms set out in paragraph 2 of that memorandum.The Foreign Secretary said that it had been his objective, in putting forward the suggestion in paragraph 2, to make plain our intention that Egypt should associate herself with an international organisation for the defence of the Middle East. He was, however, content to with-draw that suggestion, if the Prime Minister so desired.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to seek to reopen nego-tiations with the Egyptian Government on the basis of theformula set out in paragraph 1 of C. (52) 98, on the under-standings (i) that no unilateral declaration by the UnitedKingdom Government would be made in the terms ofparagraph 2 of C. (52) 98, and (ii) that we should, ifnecessary, be ready to accept an Egyptian statemen tregarding the Sudan on the lines indicated in paragraph 3of C. (52) 98.
