(52) 18thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum (C. (52) 43) covering draft instructions toHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo on the resumption of negotiationswith Egypt.The Prime Minister said that he had been considering what changes could be made in the draft despatch set out in Annex b of C. (52) 43 in order to meet the points which he had raised in the cabinets discussion earlier in the day. He now suggested that sub-paragraphs (l)-(4) of paragraph 8 of the draft should be recast asfollows:  &quot; (1) If agreement can be reached upon the establishmentof an Allied Middle East Command, with Egypt&apos;s participationas a founder member therein, only such British land forces would remain in Egypt as were considered by the Supreme allied commander, Middle East, in agreement with the Egyptianmilitary authorities, to be necessary to sustain the Egyptian land forces available for the defence of Egypt and the maintenanceof the international waterway of the Suez Canal.(2) Her Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the oppor-tunity of withdrawing other forces which the emergency hascompelled them to move to the Canal Zone.(3) The Egyptian armed forces will assume the task ofproviding for the security from land and air attack, and forthe local safeguarding, of the Allied military base and the suez canal. In this they will be aided by such forces as the AlliedMiddle East Command may consider necessary. The important military base installations on the Suez Canal will pass under theAllied Middle East Command, of which Egypt will be a foundermember, provided that all stores and munitions, includingmachine tools, which have been provided at British expense willremain British property to be disposed of as circumstances may require in the common interest, Great Britain being creditedwith any contribution made at her expense.(4) The United Kingdom will retain in Egypt such technical and administrative personnel as are required to maintain at astate of operational readiness British military equipment heldin the Allied military base.(5) The overall direction of the air defence will be vested inthe Allied Middle East Command, operating through an allied air Defence Organisation. This shall be stationed in Egypttogether with any necessary personnel, including troops for their defence, which may be considered by the Supreme allied commander, Middle East, in agreement with the Egyptianmilitary authorities, to be necessary to supplement the Egyptianair forces and ground protection forces available.&quot;He also suggested that sub-paragraph (9) of paragraph 8, and thewhole of paragraph 9, should be deleted.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he was content with the framework of the rearrangement proposed by the Prime Minister,he felt bound to warn the Cabinet that, if the negotiations were to succeed, it would be necessary to make certain further concessions to the Egyptians which had been included in his original draft despatch. In order to reach an agreement, he thought we shouldhave to give a definite undertaking that, once an Allied Middle east command was established, we would withdraw from Egypt, within
Egypt andthe Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 18thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum (C. (52) 43) covering draft instructions&apos; toHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo on the resumption of negotiationswith Egypt.The Prime Minister said that he had been considering what changes could be made in the draft despatch set out in Annex b of C.

a specified period, all British land forces which were not requiredby the Allied Commander. He also thought that we should have togive an assurance that British military technicians at the base in the canal Zone would be progressively replaced by British civilians or byEgyptians, and a similar assurance that British air forces would eventually be replaced by Egyptians, as the latter became fullyefficient. He therefore suggested the following amendments of thePrime Minister^ revised text of this part of the despatch:  (i) In the new sub-paragraph (1), after &quot;therein&quot; delete thewords &quot; only such British land forces would remain inEgypt as were &quot; and insert: &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill progressively withdraw from Egypt, within a limited period to be determined, all British land forces save thosewhich are.&quot;(ii) In the new sub-paragraph (3), delete the words &quot; In this theywill be aided by such forces as the Allied Middle east command may consider necessary.&quot;(iii) At the end of the new sub-paragraph (4), add the following sentence: &quot; These personnel will so far as possible bereplaced by British civilian technicians and wherever practicable by Egyptian personnel trained in the handling of British stores and equipment.&quot;(iv) In the new sub-paragraph (5), for the second sentencesubstitute the following: &quot; The Egyptian Governmentwill permit the stationing in Egypt of such Allied air forces and ground protection forces as may be considered by theSupreme Allied Commander, Middle East, in agreementwith the Egyptian military authorities, to be necessaryto supplement the Egyptian air forces available. TheseAllied forces will be replaced by Egyptian units and personnel progressively as sufficient of the latter can be trained and equipped to the requisite standard.&quot;In the discussion which followed the Foreign Secretary made itclear that it was not his intention that Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Cairo should offer all these concessions at the outset of his negotia-tions. The purpose of this part of the draft despatch was to let the ambassador know, for his guidance, how far the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to go in order to reach an agreementwith the Egyptian Government. The Foreign Secretary thought it important that we should lose no time in reopening negotiations assoon as the Egyptians were ready to do so; for the present Govern-ment in Egypt were not in a strong political position and, if they fell,they were likely to be succeeded by Ministers who would be lessdisposed to reach a friendly agreement with us. Although he believed that the concessions which he had indicated would have tobe made in the end, if an agreement was to be reached, he was contentthat Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should restrict himself in his openingconversations to proposing an agenda for the talks and the issue of ajoint communique in the terms already approved by the Cabinet.He could then report the results of this initial conversation beforegoing further.The Cabinet agreed that the Foreign Secretary should send toHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo a despatch in the terms of thedraft in Annex B of C. (52) 43, subject to the amendments proposedby. the Prime Minister. In this he should make it clear that paragraph 8 of the despatch represented the kind of agreement whichwe should like to make, and at which he should aim in his laterdiscussions with the Egyptian Government. The Foreign secretary should say, however, that the Cabinet recognised that some further concessions might have to be made to the Egyptians and would beprepared, if necessary, to make the concessions indicated in the amendments shown in paragraphs (i)-(iv) above. These, however,were being mentioned to the Ambassador at this stage for hisguidance only, and they should not be communicated to the Egyptian
Government without further authority from the Cabinet. The/r-NAmbassador should open the discussions by proposing an agendav^/for the talks (as set out in paragraph 6 of the draft despatch) and theissue of a joint communique in the terms approved by the cabinet at their, meeting earlier in the day. $e should report the results ofthis preliminary conversation and await further instructions before proceeding with his discussions.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Cairo ha the sejise indicated above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th February, 1952.
