11 CC. 36 (52)1, The Prime Minister said that the Government were exposed to damaging criticism by the decision to withdraw the road passenger services operated by Northern Roadways, Limited, from edinburgh and Glasgow to Birmingham, London and Scarborough. This action was inevitably represented as depriving the travelling public, in theinterests of the railways and the nationalised road passenger services,of facilities offered by private enterprise; and it could be made to appear to be wholly inconsistent with the Governmenfs pledges to restore road transport to private enterprise. He would have. thoughtthat a matter of this kind would have been submitted to the cabinet before a final decision was taken.The Minister of Transport said that this company had obtained a licence to operate these services during the previous summer. Anappeal against the grant of the licence had been lodged on behalf ofthe railways and certain road passenger undertakings, not allnationalised, which operated services over the same routes. the appeal had been heard in November 1951 by an inspector whom hehad appointed for the purpose in accordance with the provisions ofthe Road Traffic Act, 1930; and the inspector had recommended thatthe licence be withdrawn. This recommendation had been consistent with the policy applied for the past twenty years in administering the provisions of the.Road Traffic Act, 1930, and the Minister had accepted it. The public outcry was largely due to the fact, of whichhe had not been aware when he took his decision, that the company had been accepting forward bookings while the appeal was proceedingand would now be obliged to disappoint large numbers of people whowere expecting to travel by these services during the summer. Hewas taking steps to ascertain whether in these circumstances the licensing authority would be willing to allow a longer period of gracethan was usual before the services were wholly withdrawn.In discussion it was pointed out that these provisions of the road traffic Act, 1930, had been designed to protect the railways andthe established road passenger services from unrestricted competition,and had been administered with this aim by successive Ministers ofTransport over the past twenty years. The Minister, who dischargeda semi-judicial function in determining these appeals, could not in an individual case disregard the purposes of the Act and the principles on which it had been administered. If the Government now wishedto adopt a wholly different attitude towards this question, they must do so as part of a considered change of policy, which would probablyinvolve fresh legislation.The Cabinet recognised that the public criticism provoked by thisdecision made it even more important that the Government should publish at an early date their proposals for dealing with the problemof road and rail transport. They were reminded that the schemeevolved by the Cabinet Committee which had been studying this problem did not at present extend to long-distance road passenger services; and they agreed that the Committee should forthwithconsider whether these services should not be brought within their scheme.The Cabinet also agreed that no time should be lost in offering a public justification of the decision to suspend the services operated by Northern Roadways, Limited. A statement might be made in answer to a Private Notice Question in the House of Commons onthe following day; and a similar statement might be made in replyto an unstarred Question in the House-of Lords on 7th April.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to take such steps as were open to him to bring to the notice of the licensing authority the special circumstances which might be held to justify an exceptionally long period of grace before full effect wasgiven to the decision requiring the withdrawal of the road passenger services operated by Northern Roadways,Limited.Road and rail transport.(previous reference:CC. (52) 34thConclusions,Minute 7.)NorthernRoadwaysLimited.
(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for statements &apos;justifying this decision to be made at the earliest possible moment in both Houses of Parliament.(3) Asked the Committee on Road and Rail Transport to con-sider forthwith whether their proposals for regulatingcompetition between road and rail transport could notbe extended to cover long-distance road passenger services.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week.House ofCommons.British 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordBroadcasting President (C. (52) 99) recommending on behalf of the Committee onCorporation. the British Broadcasting Corporation (i) that the monopoly of the renewal of the Corporation in television should in due course be ended, and (ii) thatCharter. the appointment of Governors of the Corporation should be entrusted(Previous t0 a Committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the reference: Opposition, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chief JusticeC.C. (52) 24th   an^ tne President of the Court of Session.Conclusions, The Lord President reminded the Cabinet that a large majorityMinute 3.) of the Government^ supporters in the House of Commons were opposed to the continuance of the Corporation^ monopoly. He had ascertained, however, that they would be satisfied by a firm assurance that the licensing authority would in due course issue at least onelicence to private enterprise for the establishment of a television service financed by sponsoring. The Corporation would retain its existing monopoly in sound-broadcasting, and it would be free tomaintain and develop the present television service. The sponsoredtelevision service would be subject to some form of public controland would not be started until the Corporation had been able todevelop an adequate national television service and to improve itssound-broadcasting service in those parts of the United Kingdom inwhich reception was at present unsatisfactory.If the Cabinet approved the proposals of principle outlined inC. (52) 99, a draft White Paper would be submitted for their con-sideration covering these proposals and the various other matters tobe determined before a new Charter and Licence were issued.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was likely that the importance of television would in timeoutweigh that of sound-broadcasting. A decision to permit sponsoredtelevision programmes, although it would leave the revenues and powers of the B.B.C. unchanged, would affect the whole future of broadcasting in this country.(b) It might be preferable, if Parliamentary opinion could bebrought to accept it, to refrain from making mandatory the issue ofa television licence to private enterprise, and thus to leave the matteropen for examination when sponsored television became a practicalpossibility.(c) If it were practicable to defer the grant of a new charter and Licence for a further six months, public opinion on the matter might develop more fully.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Committee on the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion to prepare for their examination a draft White paper on broadcasting policy based on the proposals outlinedinC. (52) 99.(2) Agreed to consider these proposals, together with the othermatters to be covered by the White Paper, when the draft was available.
c1Wame of theRoyal Family.(previous reference:CC. (52) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister said that after further discussion it hadbeen agreed that, instead of a formal Proclamation, Her Majesty-should make a declaration to the Privy Council to the effect that Sheand her children would bear the name of Windsor. He had now sub-mitted formal advice to Her Majesty in this sense. The terms of this declaration would be published in the Official Gazette.The Cabinet      &apos;Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Farm Price 5.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet that, after the irreview. discussion on 1st April, he and the other Ministers concerned had(Previous seen the representatives of the farmers on the preceding day.   a reference: useful discussion had taken place, and he thought that the farmers&apos;CC. (52) 35th representatives had been brought to a better understanding of theConclusions, Governmenfs position and of the need to avoid substantial increasesMinute 1.) in retail food prices.The Cabinet considered further the limits to which the Govern-ment negotiators should go in settling the addition to be made to annual farm incomes by the review. The farmers were now asking for an addition of  59 million, which they recognised as including some  13 million over and above the sum required to recoup themfor increases in costs since the last review. About half of this,however, arose from their claim that recoupment for increases in costs in previous price reviews had been inadequate. The cabinet were not disposed in any event to authorise a settlement which would include an element of this character.It was clear that any increase in farm incomes beyond a level ofabout  45 million would entail a corresponding increase in retail food prices. It had been found impracticable to adopt the suggestion madein the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion that, in order to avoid this,fertiliser subsidies might be treated as falling outside the total of thefood subsidies. Fertiliser subsidies had hitherto been treated as partof the food subsidies and a change in this respect would be regardedas an attempt to conceal a decision to increase the total of food subsidies laid down in the Budget.The Minister of Food again drew attention to the farmers&apos;demand for higher prices for milk and eggs. The prices suggested would compensate twice over the increases in production costs; and,if they were conceded, milk production in particular might increaseembarrassingly and might give rise to a further charge of perhaps 20 million in the milk subsidy. Food prices generally would then have to be raised by this amount in addition to the increases arisingdirectly from the present price review.After further discussion, the Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to try to reach asettlement with the farmers&apos; representatives on an additionto be made to annual farm incomes by the farm price review of not more than  52^ million gross; and whilesuggesting that, failing an agreed settlement, the additionto be imposed by the Government should not exceed 50 million gross, invited the. Minister to use his discretion in suggesting this alternative figure.(2) Invited the. Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theMinister of Food, to insist, in negotiating the prices of individual commodities, on w substantial reduction in theprices suggested by the farmers&apos; reoresentatives for milk and eggs.
Egypt.sterling balances.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 35thConclusions,Minute 10.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that egypt was now virtually without sterling reserves with which to meether current obligations. The Egyptians had declined the suggestion which we had made for an exchange of sterling against dollar balancesheld by them. Although they were making no threats, it was possiblethat, unless we helped them to meet their difficulties, they might be obliged to impose restrictions which would be damaging to our trade.The Cabinet had decided on 28th and 29th December to delay therelease of the  10 million due to be made available to the Egyptiansin 1952 under the Sterling Releases Agreement. If we were to honourthis Agreement, which was on balance favourable to us, we shouldhave to release this sum in the course of 1952. In view of the cessation of anti-British disorders in Egypt and the more co-operative attitudeof the present Egyptian Government, he thought on the whole andthe Foreign Secretary agreed that it would be best to release this sum forthwith.After discussion, the Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe release to Egypt of the sum of  10 million sterling, dueto be made available to them in 1952 under the SterlingReleases Agreement. .Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd April, 1952.
