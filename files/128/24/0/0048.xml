79CC. 48 (52)1. The Cabinet took note with approval of the terms of the reply which the President of the Board of Trade was proposing to give to two Questions which were to be put to him in the House of commons that afternoon by Mr. Julian Amery, M.P., and Mr. Nabarro, M.P.,regarding the Government^ policy in respect of the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade in relation to the system of imperial preference.Powers of 2.   The Lord Chancellor drew attention to the fact that, whileMinisters. the powers of a Secretary of State were exercisable by any Secretaryof State, powers specifically conferred by statute on a particularMinister could not legally be exercised, during the Ministers absence,by another Minister. It followed that, while the Minister of Trans-port was indisposed, no other Minister could on his behalf give formaldirections to the British Transport Commission or exercise any of theother personal jurisdiction conferred upon the Minister of transport by the Transport Acts.The Prime Minister said that some general provision might haveto be made enabling a Ministers powers to be exercised on his behalfduring times when he was incapacitated, by absence or illness, fromacting himself. Meanwhile, the present legal position should be made known to Ministers generally. He asked the Lord Chancellor tofurnish him with a memorandum on this point.tariff policy.Road and Rail 3. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, FuelTransport. and Power said that on 29th April he had seen the Chairman(Previous and Deputy Chairman of the British Transport Commission and had reference: given them an outline of the policy which the Government wereCC. (52) 47th proposing to follow in respect of road haulage and the reorganisationConclusions, of the railways. He had not shown them the text of the draft WhiteMinute 7.) . Paper. They had said that, once the Government had announcedWhite Paper on their intention to restore road haulage to private enterprise, it mightTransport be difficult to retain the existing staff of the Road Haulage Executive.Policy. They had also expressed the view that these proposals might stimulateincreased wages demands by the railwaymen&apos;s unions. They had not,however, shown any marked hostility towards the proposals, nor had they asked for an opportunity to offer comments or suggestions upon them.The Prime Minister suggested that the Chairman of the Corn-mission should now be given a copy of the draft White Paper in con-fidence, so that he might be able to study its terms in detail.In the discussion which followed the Cabinet re-affirmed their support of the scheme outlined in the draft White Paper including, inparticular, the proposed levy on road haulage undertakings. they also confirmed their decision that the White Paper should be presented to Parliament during the following week.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power to arrange for the White Paper on Trans-port Policy to be presented to Parliament on 8th May.Meals on The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel andTrains. Power said that the British Transport Commission were proposing toincrease the prices charged for meals served in railway restaurant cars.They represented that this was necessary in view of increased costs,especially of wages. They had asked whether Ministers wished togive them any guidance on this proposal before any public announce-ment was made. The Secretary of State said that he did not proposeto offer any advice to the Commission on this question: he regarded42258 . b 2
it as a matter of detailed day-to-day administration with which theGovernment should not concern themselves.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of this statement by the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Health asked whether, in his Statement on business that day, he should mention a definite date for the publi-cation of the White Paper on Broadcasting. The Cabinet were reminded that the Assistant Postmaster-General had indicated, inreply to a Question on the previous day, that the Government^ viewson this question would be made known in two weeks&apos; time. they considered that no more definite statement should be made at presentregarding the date of publication of the White Paper.Road Passenger 5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentServices. (C. (52) 136) reporting that the Committee on Road and Rail Trans-Licensing of port were unable to suggest any means of modifying the operation of passenger the Road Traffic Act, 1930, without a preliminary enquiry by anVehicles. independent body. They still considered that the licensing system(Previous set UP under the Act of 1930 was due for review, notably because ofReference: the nationalisation of the railways, because the British TransportC.C. (52) 41st Commission had acquired large interests in road-passenger transportConclusions, and because the gap between the costs of road and rail passengerMinute 3.)       travel was widening.   They recommended that this review shouldbe carried out by a Departmental Committee of independent persons appointed by the Minister of Transport.Discussion turned mainly on the terms of reference for such aCommittee which were suggested in paragraph 2 of C. (52) 136.While an examination of the operation of the Act of 1930 was a necessary part of the Government^ total policy towards transport andwould be promised in the forthcoming White Paper, which relatedprimarily to road haulage, it might be represented that it was incon-sistent with the proposals in that White Paper for assisting railwayfinances by a levy on road transport to direct the DepartmentalCommittee to enquire into &quot; the regulation of &quot; competition between road and rail. The 1930 Act had been designed to give protection tothe railways by limiting competition from the roads, whereas thepolicy of, the present Government was designed to protect railwayfinances in other ways. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe draft terms of reference were designed to direct the Committee^attention to the use of the licensing system as a means of eliminatinguneconomic and wasteful competition which would adversely affectthe efficiency of the passenger services available to the public. Itmight, however, suffice to direct the attention of the Committee to theneed for a review of the provisions of Section 72 of the Act of 1930,which set out the considerations which should govern the grant orrefusal of passenger service licences; ,The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Committee on road and Rail Transport to review, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, the draft terms of reference of theproposed Departmental Committee on the operation ofthe Road Traffic Act, 1930, and to submit a revised draft frr the Cabinefs approval at their next meeting.
81 C.C. 48 (52),C ..&apos; (2) Invited the Lord President and the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power to consult the Prime Minister on the selection of the members ofthe proposed Committee.Steel.Supplies fromthe UnitedStates.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment had undertaken to do their utmost to ensure that the strike inthe United States steel industry would not affect the supplies of steelwhich had been promised to the United Kingdom. There would beno immediate effect on current deliveries, and they expected to be ableto maintain all planned deliveries to us unless the strike should be along one, which they did not think likely.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Purchase Tax. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-previous cellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 135) reporting that there was con-Reference: tinuing pressure in the House of Commons for the removal of theC.C. (52) 38th purchase tax on textile goods, and that concurrently there was pressureConclusions, to raise the &quot; D &quot; levels for several secondary trades on the fringe of minute 2.) the textile industry. In addition there were two grievances relatingto retail stocks and to valuation, which he proposed to refer forimpartial examination by an independent Committee.The Cabinet were informed that unemployment and short-time working in the textile industries continued to be heavy. In spite,however, of the desire of some Government supporters to see thepurchase tax on textiles abolished, it was coming to be fairly widely recognised that such a measure would be unlikely to make a significant contribution towards the relief of unemployment in the industry.On the other hand it might well bring into question the whole of therest of the tax, which was expected to yield  340 million of revenuein the current year; and it might therefore lead to the under-miningof the whole structure of the Budget. The Chancellor of theExchequer therefore had it in mind to handle the problem on the lines set out in paragraph 4 of C. (52) 135.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider thematters raised in C. (52) 135 in consultation . with one ortwo other members of the Cabinet; and thereafter to raisethe matter if necessary at a later Cabinet meeting.Excess ProfitsLevy.0?previous reference:C.C. (51) 4thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 134) reporting the criticisms whichwere being levelled against the proposed excess profits levy and possible measures which might be adopted on account of them.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider witha number of his colleagues, including the commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary, the proposals inC. (52) 134 relating to the excess profits levy.
Cabinet Office, S.W.L1st May, 1952.aEgypt and 9.   The Foreign Secretary said that since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting^The Sudan. on 29th April he had reconsidered the formula which he was pro-(Previous posing to put to the Egyptian Government regarding the EgyptianReference: claim to sovereignty over the Sudan. He read to the Cabinet theCC.(52)47th revised formula which, subject to their views, Her Majesty&apos;conclusions, Ambassador in Cairo would be authorised to present to the EgyptianMinute 5.)       Government on his return to Egypt.The Cabinet approved this revised formula, subject to an amend-ment designed to make it clear that they adhered to the pledges whichthe United Kingdom Government had already given to the Sudanesepeople.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the egyptian government, through Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo,that in a joint statement issued as a prelude to ,the resump-tion of negotiations on defence and the Sudan he would beprepared to include a declaration on the Sudan in thefollowing terms:  &quot; The Egyptian Government having declared that HisMajesty King Farouk holds the title of King of Egypt andthe Sudan, Her Majesty&apos;s Government reaffirm that theywould accept either the unity of Egypt and the Sudan underthe Egyptian Crown or any other status for the Sudan,provided that it resulted from the exercise of the right ofthe Sudanese people freely to decide their future status, whichright is recognised and accepted by both Governments.Her Majesty&apos;s Government realise that, there aredifferences of opinion between the two Governments as tothe question of the King&apos;s title during the interim period before self-determination. They therefore also declare thatthey are ready to enter into immediate consultation with the sudanese in regard to this matter, in order to ascertain whether any solution is possible consistent with the pledgeswhich Her Majesty*s Government have given to the Sudanesepeople and to which they adhere.&quot;
