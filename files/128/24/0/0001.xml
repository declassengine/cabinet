Trade with 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C, (52) 1) onEastern the bearing of the Mutual Defence Assistance Control Act (BattleEurope. Act) on United Kingdom trade with Eastern Europe.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that the importance of trade with the Soviet countries forthe United Kingdom arose primarily from the supplies of timber andcoarse grains which we obtained from them. These supplies couldnot be obtained from any other source, save possibly from north america at substantial dollar cost. Because of these supplies and because of our unwillingness on general grounds to cut off all tradewith the Soviet countries, it was most important that the administra-tion of the Battle Act should not be allowed to interfere with ourcurrent exchanges with the Soviet countries. These were alreadysubject to severe restriction under arrangements made by the informalParis Group of countries. It was, moreover, an important principlethat our economic activities should not become subject to arbitrarydecisions taken by the United States Administration on the basisof legislation enacted by Congress. While the Battle Act provided an absolute bar on United States aid to countries exporting strategic materials to the Soviet countries, it gave a substantial discretion to thePresident to permit exports of other commodities when unusualcircumstances dictated that cessation of aid would be detrimental tothe security of the United States. But as the list of articles to beincluded in &quot; war potential &quot; did not form part of a Schedule to theAct, but only represented the Administration^ interpretation of the phrase, there was always a danger that at any moment a number ofarticles might be transferred from the &quot; qualified &quot; to the &quot; absolute &quot;embargo list.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that in consultationwith the other countries concerned we should resist any attempt bythe United States Administration to attach conditions to financial aid which would involve interference with existing arrangementsgoverning our exchanges with the Soviet countries. The commodities which we obtained from those countries were of fundamental importance to our economy. While the matter might arise in thecourse of the Prime Minister^ forthcoming discussions with thePresident, the Cabinet felt that, if possible, it would be preferable forthe United Kingdom Government to explain their attitude to the paris Group before any more direct approach was made to the UnitedStates Government. Our first aim should therefore be to obtain theagreement of all the Governments concerned, in discussions on the paris Group which were due to take place in the following week andin which the United States Government would be represented, thatthe United States Government should be asked to administer the battle Act in a manner consistent with the principles and procedureslaid down by the Paris Group. In particular we should seek to avoid a state of affairs in which at the instance of pressure groups theUnited States Administration might in future make arbitrary changesin the list of commodities which the Paris Group were willing topermit to be exported to the Soviet countries.Although discussions on the Paris Group might create theimpression that we were seeking to create a solid body of opinion between the other Governments concerned before explaining our views to the United States Government, this risk had better be faced in view of the fact that a number of the other Governments concerned were believed to be unduly ready to acquiesce in whatever applicationof the Battle Act might be proposed by the United States.Mention was made of the necessity for the United KingdomGovernment to consult the Governments of Canada and SouthernRhodesia at an early stage in the formulation of our views on thismatter.
oService 2.   The Minister of Health referred to the studies of the detailEstimates. of the Service Estimates which were being co-ordinated by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The Prime Minister had indicated to him his anxiety that good progress should be made withthese studies with careful regard both to the country&apos;s economic difficulties and to the importance of concentrating on hitting power in 1952.The Chancellor of the Exchequer -informed the Cabinet that considerable progress had already been made with these studies, andthat the main outstanding difficulty related to the provision to bemade for the works side of the Air programme. If necessary ameeting of Ministers would be held on 7th January in order to resolvethis and he would be in a position to report back to the Cabinetwithin a few days thereafter.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Messages to the 3. The Minister of Health informed the Cabinet that twoPrime Minister, messages had been received indicating that the Prime Minister wouldbe glad to have news of the progress of the domestic problems studied by the Cabinet at their meetings on 28th and 29th December and,in particular, of the progress made in the planning of food imports.The Cabinet briefly reviewed the existing state of these enquiries.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for messages to besent to the Prime Minister informing him of the position on steel allocation (Minute 4 below) and on the other domesticproblems discussed at the Cabinefs meetings on 28th and29th December.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed the policy at present being followed by UnitedKingdom Ministers in relation to the control and limita-tion of trade with the Soviet countries.(2) Subject to the views of the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary, gave provisional endorsement to the proposals made in the memorandum on United Kingdom policy on trade with Eastern Europe annexed to C. (52) 1; and inparticular agreed that in the forthcoming discussions withthe Paris Group the United Kingdom Government shouldcontinue to support the principles agreed by that group and, in consultation with the other member countries,should endeavour to persuade the United States Govern-ment to administer the Battle Act in a manner consistent with the principles and procedures already laid down bythe Paris Group.(3) Took note that early consultation on this matter would takeplace between the United Kingdom Government and theGovernments of Canada and Southern Rhodesia.(4) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for their provisional conclusions to be communicated to the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary, requesting their endorsement ofthe proposals before discussions took place on the paris group.
Steel.&apos; .4,,  The Minister of Supply informed the-Caibinet that the steelAllocation and  allocation scheme was giving rise to substantial public criticism. TheControl of       new system &quot;Was cutting; severely into -the supplies which manyDistribution.    industries wished to obtain, and the basis of allocation was necessarily(Previous-       somewhat out of date and unsatisfactory,since it had to be largelyReference:-     governed by the-standards previously in force under the system which.C. (51) 6th     came *tb- an end in the; middle of T950: ^ Initial allocations were,Conclusions,    however, made for :a period of two months only and it would be his minute 4.)       aim to&apos; issue allocations for a subsequent period as speedily as possible and to attempt in so doing to&quot; make good the inequities in the presentdistribution.   Where, however, he was satisfied that present alloca-tions were Unfair- there-was little scope for1 other immediate action,since there was little free margin of&apos;steel unallocated.  It might benecessary for a short time, particularly in the engineering industry, to sanction some small over-allocation.   He thought it most desirablethat;1 in order to forestall ill-founded criticism, an immediate Govern-ment&apos; statement should be made explaining the policy adopted andthe reasons for it. The using industries had asked for an allocationscheme to be introduced and the Government had a good case whichthey should make in public for the action which they had taken.Allocation was less arbitrary and less damaging to the using industriesthan was widely believed, and the administration of the scheme would improve after a short time.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labourandthe Minister of Supply, to arrange for the immediate issueof a statement on steel allocation explaining and defendingthe Governments policy.The Economic 5.

He proposed to seek the PrimeMinisters assent to these arrangements.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(2) Agreed that on the issue of his statement a private conference with City Editors would be preferable&quot; to a large press conference.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1/3rd January, 1952.
