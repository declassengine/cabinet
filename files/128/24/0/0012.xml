The Demise ofthe Crown.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 11thConclusions.)Form of theAccessionProclamation;1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C. (52) 22) covering alternative drafts of the Proclama-tion declaring the Accession of the new Sovereign. The first of these was in the traditional form. Its wording was not wholly in accord with present constitutional conditions in the Commonwealth. Thus,it referred to &quot; the Imperial Crown,&quot; which was an expression likelyto be associated with the Indian- Empire; it referred to &quot; Ireland &quot;and not to &quot; Northern Ireland&quot;; and it included references to&quot; British Dominions &quot; which would not be welcomed by some of theother members of the Commonwealth. Moreover, it was cast in a form in which it could not be signed by the representative of india which, though remaining a member of the Commonwealth, no longerowed allegiance to the Crown. The second draft was designed toavoid these difficulties.After discussion the Cabinet reached the conclusion that it wouldin any event be necessary to make some departures from the tradi-tional form of the Proclamation, for instance by omitting the word&quot; Imperial&quot; in the reference to the Crown, and by substituting&quot; Northern Ireland &quot; for &quot; Ireland.&quot; It would also be desirable toinclude some reference to the Sovereign^ position as &quot; Head of theCommonwealth.&quot; In these circumstances it seemed preferable thatthe Proclamation should follow the form of the second draft annexed to C. (52) 22, which was more consonant with the current constitutionalrelationships between the various parts of the Commonwealth.After further discussion the following draft was approved:  &quot; Whereas it hath pleased Almighty God to call to His Mercyour late Sovereign Lord King George the Sixth of Blessed andGlorious Memory by whose Decease the Crown is solely andrightfully come to the High and Mighty Princess ElizabethAlexandra Mary: We, therefore, the Lords Spiritual and Tem-poral of this Realm, being here assisted with these of His lateMajesty&apos;s Privy Council, with representatives of other membersof the Commonwealth, with other Principal Gentlemen of Quality,with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of London, do nowhereby with one Voice and Consent of Tongue and Heart pub-lish and proclaim that the High and Mighty Princess ElizabethAlexandra Mary is now, by the Death of our late Sovereign ofHappy Memory, become Queen Elizabeth the Second, by theGrace of God Queen of this Realm and of all Her other Realmsand Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of theFaith, to whom Her lieges do acknowledge all Faith and constantObedience, with hearty and humble Affection; beseeching God,by whom Kings and Queens do reign, to bless the Royal PrincessElizabeth the Second with long and happy Years to reign overus.&quot;The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to arrange that the Proclamationof the Accession of the new Sovereign should be made in theform set out above.The Demise of        2.   The Cabinet discussed suggestions for the meetings of Parlia-the Crown. ment and other arrangements during the period before the Funeral(Previous of His late MaJesty-Reference: The Prime Minister said that the new Sovereign was returningC.C. (52) 11th to this country by air and was expected to arrive on the following conclusions.) afternoon. The Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister, accompaniedParliamentary&apos; by several of his Ministerial colleagues and by the Leaders of the two and Other Opposition Parties in the House of Commons, should meet Her on arrangements. Her arrival at London Airport.
It was proposed that the second part of the Accession council should be held on 8th February. On that day flags would not be flown at half-mast.In discussion it was suggested that the body of His late Majestymight be brought on 11th February from Sandringham to WestminsterHall, where it might lie in state until 15th February, and the Funeralmight take place on that day. In that event it would be appropriate that the Addresses should be moved in both Houses of Parliament on11th or 12th February. Parliament should not resume their normalbusiness until 19th February.The Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, togetherwith the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health, the Minister ofLabour and the President of the Board of Trade to consider to what extent places of work should be closed on the day of the Funeral ofHis late Majesty, both in London and in other parts of the country.Cabinet6thOffice, SWA,February, 1952.
