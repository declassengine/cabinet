Germany. 1 -   The Foreign Secretary said that, in their further noteSoviet Proposal proposing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the Sovietfor Discussion   Government had professed willingness that the holding of elections of Peace Treaty, throughout Germany should be supervised, not by a United Nations(Previous        commission, but by a commission representing the Governments ofReference:      the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and France.C.C. (52) 33rd   He recognised that this might be no more than a manoeuvre to preventConclusions,    the conclusion of the agreements which were now being made with minute 6.)       Western Germany, viz., the guarantees to the European defence community and the contractual arrangements which the occupying powers were making with the German Federal Republic; but the offer was an advance on anything which the Soviet Government had previously put forward, and he thought it would be unwise to rejectit out of hand.   He therefore wished to hasten the conclusion ofthose two agreements and to answer the Soviet note in terms which left the door open for further discussion.The Prime Minister said that he was in full agreement with thecourse which the Foreign Secretary was proposing to follow.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the statement made by theForeign Secretary.Egypt. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Government(Previous        had instructed their Ambassador in London, Amr Pasha, to comeReference:       to this country for personal conversations with him about the resump-C.C. (52) 40th   tion of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations.   At a preliminary meetingConclusions,    held that afternoon Amr Pasha had agreed that it would be helpfulMinute 1.)       if Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo and the Governor-Generalof the Sudan were recalled to London for consultation; and thiswas being done.   The talks in London were likely to continue forseveral days.   Internal developments in Egypt seemed likely tostrengthen the political position of the Egyptian Government; andto that extent the prospect of a resumption of the negotiations seemed. slightly more favourable.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Tunisia. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that two nationalist leaders fromAdmission of    Tunisia, who were believed to be in Egypt, had applied for permissionNationalist      to come to this country.   The Foreign Office expected that, if theyLeaders to       came here, they would engage in propaganda and other activitiesthe United       designed to advance the nationalist cause; and we should give offenceKingdom.       to the French Government if we appeared to have facilitated such activities.   The Home Office on the other hand had no evidencethat either of these men was personally undesirable, and were anxiousto avoid any action inconsistent with England&apos;s traditional policy of offering asylum to political refugees.In discussion it was pointed out that, if these men had alreadyfound their way to Egypt, they could not claim asylum, here on the. ground that their lives were in danger.   Moreover, people who foundpolitical asylum here were not at liberty to use this country as a basefrom which to continue their political activities in their country of. origin.  The Foreign Office believed that one of the two men hadcollaborated with the Germans during the war, and they were seeking.    evidence of this.   It would be reasonable to withhold permission forthese men to come to this country at least until those enquiries hadbeen completed.
Rail Transport.        4.   The Prime Minister said that on the previous day he hadAlterations in   discussed with the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Railway Fares. Fuel and Power, the Minister of Transport arid the Chancellor of the(Previous        Duchy of Lancaster the lines along which a solution of the problemReference:      of railway fares should be sought.   The direction which the CabinetCC. (52) 42nd   had authorised on 10th April was in the nature of a stand-stillConclusions,    measure; and it was clear that, while that was in operation, some moreMinute 1.)       lasting remedy must be found.   From his discussions it had appeared that the right course was to seek some easement in the so-calledsub-normal fares and the concession rates.   It had also appeared that some corresponding adjustments would have to be made in thenew fares which had already been brought into operation in theLondon area.   He had authorised the three Ministers with whom he had conferred to explain the Governmenfs intentions, along theselines, at a Press conference that afternoon.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that at this Press conference he had made it clear thatthe Government intended to secure adjustments in rail and bus faresalready in operation in London, in conformity.with the adjustmentswhich would be made in railway fares outside London after the reference of the latter to the Central Transport Consultative Com-mittee. Within the next week or two the Government should suggest to the Consultative Committee the basis on which they should examine the scheme of fares outside London. It was possible, bow-ever, that the Committee might endorse that scheme, as they hadupheld the recent increases applied in London. The Governmentwould then have to try to persuade the British Transport Commissionto modify the proposed rail fares outside London and to introducecorresponding modifications in the fares &quot;already in operation inLondon. Discussions with the Commission might be opened whilethe question of rail fares outside London was still before the consultative Committee. There was some prospect that an acceptable agreement might be reached with the Transport Corn-mission; but, failing that, the Government would have to consider making further use of their powers Of direction to secure that the increases ultimately applied both in London and elsewhere under thescheme sanctioned by the Transport Tribunal were limited in sucha way as not to bear harshly On particular classes of traveller. TheTransport Commission had power, either by agreement with theGovernment or by reason of its being so directed, to impose increasessmaller than the full amounts authorised by the Transport Tribunal.The Priind Minister said that it Would be helpful if the Govern-menfs proposed White Paper ori transport policy were published&quot; before the increases in passenger fares were finally determined.Although the White Paper was hot directly concerned with passenger fares, it had an immediate bearing upon the financial position of the.railways and would make known the general background of policy on which the Government were working:It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Home Secretary, 1while maintaining the traditional policy of affording asylum to political refugees, would be justified in withholding permission forthese two men to visit this country so long as there was any element of doubt either about their personal character or i on the questionwhether they might engage in this country in political activities likelyto cause further disorders in Tunisia or serious political embarrass-ment to the French Government.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in dealing with this application,to be guided by the views expressed in the cabinets discussion.
53 CC. (52) 43The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped that the increases to be made in rail fares would be finally determined and applied without avoidable delay. Although it had been right to step in and prevent the unreasonable increases which would otherwise have taken place outside London on 1st May, the railways wouldhave a serious financial deficit if fares were not adjusted soon to reflect increases in costs.The Cabinet-Took note of the measures now proposed for securingmodification of the increases in passenger fares authorised by the Transport Tribunal on 17th February.parliamentary in theHouse ofCommons.(previous reference:CC. (52) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he recognised that the remaining stages of the Finance Bill would haveto be subject to a time-table, he thought that, as there had been no opportunity for prior discussion with the Opposition and forattempting to agree upon a time-table with them, it would be unwise to combine in one motion early in the following week compulsorytime-tables for both the National Health Service Bill and theFinance Bill.The Chief Whip said that the Minister of Health now accepted this view. He also proposed to allow time for the Opposition to tableamendments to the motion detailing the time-table for the national health Service Bill. Against this background the Opposition couldbe invited to co-operate in arranging an agreed time-table for theFinance Bill; but if, as seemed likely, agreement were not reached, a motion applying a compulsory time-table could be tabled at the endof the first week of the new sittings.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to try to secure agreement with the Opposition on a time-table for theremaining stages of the Finance Bill; but to make it clearthat, failing agreement, the Government would introduce. a motion applying a compulsory time-table to that Bill.(2) Agreed that the motion applying a compulsory time-table tothe remaining stages of the National Health Service Billshould be handed in separately on 21st April and movedon 23rd April.the coronation.(previous reference:CC. (52) 39thConclusions,Minute 6.)The Date.Scale of theCoronationCeremony.6. The Prime Minister said that in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 8th April he had advised The Queen to select a date forthe Coronation between 29th May and 6th June, 1953. Her Majestyhad decided that the Coronation should be held on Tuesday,2nd June, 1953.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation would take placeon 2nd June, 1953.The Prime Minister said that the Coronation Committee of the privy Council, when appointed, would probably need some guidancefrom the Government regarding the scale of the arrangements to bemade for celebrating the Coronation. He proposed that a smallMinisterial Committee should be appointed to consider this in detail and to make recommendations to the Cabinet. It would be convenient that this Committee should be composed of Ministers whowould be members of the Coronation Committee.  The Chancellor
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th April, 1952.of the Exchequer should be a member of the Ministerial Committee;. but, while he was occupied with business arising from the Finance. Bill, he might be represented at its meetings by another TreasuryMinister.The Cabinet -(2) Appointed a Committee consisting of the Lord Privy Seal(Chairman), the Home Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Works to consider andreport to the Cabinet what guidance should be given onthe scale of the arrangements to be made for celebratingHer Majesty&apos;s Coronation.
