House ofCommons.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 5thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered the programme of parliamentary business for the following week in the light of (a) the general expecta-tion that within a few days of his return the Prime Minister wouldgive some account to the House of Commons of his North Americantalks and (b) a desire which the Opposition had indicated that thereshould be an interval of at least 24 hours between the statement bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer on the economic situation and theopening of the two-day debate thereon. The Cabinet felt that itwould be desirable and perhaps advantageous to meet the wish ofthe Opposition for this interval. They considered that the most appropriate time-table would be for the statement by the Chan-cellor to be made immediately after Questions on 29th January,and for this to be followed without debate by the other businesspreviously arranged for that day. The Prime Minister might thenmake a statement on the North American talks after Questions on30th January, and this might be followed immediately by the open-ing of the two-day debate on the economic situation. Any general debate on foreign affairs might be deferred until the following week.The Cabinet- -(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to communicate this proposed programme of Parliamentary business to the&apos; PrimeMinister.(2) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should makea non-Party Ministerial broadcast on the economic&quot;situation on the evening of 29th January.2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 10) on. the balance ofpayments situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in order to achieve the objective of balancing sterling-area payments in the second halfof 1952 it would be necessary for the United Kingdom to secure atotal reduction of  150 millions in expenditure on imports. The cutsin imports of tobacco and raw materials listed in paragraph 23 ofhis memorandum might yield about  72 millions, and the reductionof quotas on &quot; deliberalised &quot; imports, together with the cut in the tourist ration, a further  20 millions. He had re-examined the pos-sibility of economies in overseas military expenditure, and expectedto be able to find a saving of  10^ millions out of the total of 400 millions mentioned in paragraph 32 of his memorandum. Ifthe savings on coal and rubber discussed at the Cabinet&apos;s last meeting were obtained, and if, as he believed, tobacco purchases could bereduced by a further  6 millions, a sum between  30 and  35 millions would remain to be found from cuts in food imports:He had discussed this question with those of his colleagues whowere directly concerned. They were prepared to agree to the savingsproposed in paragraph 29 of his paper in respect of wheat, sugar,oils and fats, and bacon, though some difficulty might be encountered in discontinuing the Polish bacon contract. They had also suggested a cut of  2 millions in imports of linseed oil, making a total of 35 millions. No reduction would be made in the imports of meator coarse grains.. His colleagues were not at present willing, however,to agree to any reduction in food rations. He. himself did not feelthat it would be admissible to make these drastic cuts in importswithout at the same time including some measure which would bring home to the public immediately the gravity of the situation. If allthe savings were made at the expense of the stockpiles, this wouldbecome public knowledge, and confidence would be shaken both athome and abroad Unless we gave clear evidence that we wereprepared not to live entirely on the future, but to make some
immediate sacrifice. For this reason he did not feel able to announceto the public all these heavy cuts in imports unless he could at thesame time announce that consequent reductions would be made inthe consumption of one or two rationed food-stuffs. If his colleagues were not able to accept any decrease in rations, he would have toabandon the proposal to cut imports of sugar and fats and to look for corresponding savings elsewhere.Reduced In discussion, the balance of opinion in the Cabinet appearedimports of food, adverse to further reduction in rations. While substantial food stocks were an essential strategic reserve without which we shouldbe Unable to wage war if it came, the Cabinet had mainly in mind,in their examination of this question, the effect on standards of nutrition and on the productive energy of the people which they had considered in their previous discussion, as well as the fact that theeffects of the heavy cuts in imports of unrationed foods which theyhad approved before Christmas had not yet been felt by the public.Moreover, it would be difficult to defend further reductions in the rations unless it was plain that everything which the public might deem possible was being done to restrict expenditure on less essential imports such as tobacco, petrol and films.Reduced - The Cabinet then considered again the proposals in paragraph 23imports of of C. (52) 10. They were informed that purchases of tobacco couldraw materials, be reduced to secure a total saving of  22 millions, and that an approach, which appeared to offer good prospects of success, hadbeen made to the United States Government suggesting the purchase by them of 25,000 tons of rubber from our stockpile: this would yield  8 millions.. Steps had already been taken towards cancellingimports of coal costing dollars either for purchase or for freight,and a saving of  2^ millions could be expected from this. Whileit Would not be desirable to discontinue entirely the import of soft-wood, it might be reduced to produce a saving of about  6 millions(in place of the  8 millions shown in paragraph 23 of C. (52) 10).The President of the Board of Trade said that the tourist rationcould be reduced to  35 within the accepted level of &quot; deliberalisation,&quot;but a reduction to  25 would be likely to provoke retaliation, notonly against our own tourist trade but also against our general exportsto-European countries. It was suggested that if a reduction to  35was made an appropriate means might be found to secure some reduction in imports of wines.There appeared to be no means of securing an immediatereduction in dollar expenditure on films without breaking a firm commitment, and in any event it was virtually impossible at anytime to secure such a reduction unless cinema attendances could bereduced. It was, however, agreed that notice should be given forth-with of the Government^ intention to reconsider the film agreement in October, 1952, the earliest permissible date.It was the general view of the Cabinet that every effort shouldbe made to find means of reducing to the utmost expenditure on imports of tobacco from outside the sterling area. While the tobaccorevenue was of great importance, drastic measures affecting tobaccoconsumption would serve to impress the public with the gravity ofthe situation without leading to any deterioration in health or vitality.Cuts in purchases would produce a strong reaction in the UnitedStates, but this might on balance be advantageous in showing our determination to overcome our economic difficulties. It was pointedout that greater use could be made of available tobacco from withinthe sterling area,Reintroduction of petrol rationing would be of psychologicalvalue, but the saving on foreign exchange would be small. Con-sumption could also be checked by increasing the price, though themain burden of this would fall On commercial and public transport.Tourism.Films.Tobacco.Petrol.In further discussion it was suggested that a saving of  5- - millionscould be made by cancelling a contract for the purchase of textiles
Cabinet Office, S.WA,24th January, 1952.for military use from Japan, and it was agreed that this point shouldbe examined.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be necessary to reachfinal decisions on these difficult problems before the end of the week.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of C. (52) 10 at a meetingon the following day.
