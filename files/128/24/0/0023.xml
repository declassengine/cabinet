Ecoaomfc 1.  The Cabinet held a.discussion on the current economic situa-Affon. tion. No. conclusions were reached, and the Cabinet agreed to resume their consideration of this question at a meeting on the following day.Royal - 2:  The. announcement of Lord Waverley&apos;s appointment asCommission Chairman of the Royal Commission oh Income Tax had beenoa Income Tax. strongly criticised by the leaders of the Opposition in the House 6f(Previous Commons on the ground, that he would not be regarded as capableReference: of discharging these duties with political impartiality, by reason ofC.C (51) 2ist the strong political views which&apos; he had expressed on financial, fiscalConclusions, and social questions.  A Motion to.this effect had been tabled for minute 1.) discussion in the House of Commons on 3rd March.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Lord Waverley had represented to him that, as his impartiality had been, impugned, he did not think it would be appropriate for him to undertake the Chair-manship of this Commission and he would prefer to resign theappointment if he were the subject of personal criticisms in theforthcoming debate.In. discussion there was general agreement that, in the circum-; Stances which had now arisen, it would be preferable that LordWayerley should not preside over this Commission. Indeed, therewas much to be said for bringing the Commission^ proceedings to anend as quickly as possible; and it might be possible to arrange for the deputy Chairman to do. this! If, however, Lord Waverley was to.resign, it was preferable that he should do so&apos; before the Motion wasdebated in the House of Commons on 3rd March. An effective reply should, however, be made to the unwarranted criticisms which hadbeen levelled against him by members of the Opposition, and theGovernment should uphold his integrity and high record of publicr   &apos; - service.  The Prime Minister said that he wpuld be glad to take anopportunity of doing this when informing Parliament of the alterna-tive arrangements now proposed for completing the work of theRoyal Commission.The Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to see LordWaverley and seek his co-operation in the course which the Govern-ment proposed to follow.Cabinet Office, SWA,29th February, 1952.
