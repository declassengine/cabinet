This had provoked a demand that the relevant docu-. merits should belaid before Parliament; and some Members of theOpposition had assumed that the Prime Minister had derived.his information from the Cabinet papers of the previous Administration. ,The Prime Minister said that his statement had in fact been based on\   Foreign Office telegrams and despatches, which for this purpose werein. quite a different category from Cabinet papers.

The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Lord President (in his capacity as Chairman of the Conservative Party) todiscuss the matter on the earliest possible occasion with, Government supporters in the House of Commons, andin particular to explain to them the case for -continuing the broadcasting monopoly for the time being.(2) Agreed to-resume their consideration of the question when these discussions had taken place.by a. number of agencies was-advocated in some- quarters on the. grounds that the present monopoly gives the (Corporation an excess-sive, if not dangerous,.power over public thought and ideas; that itleads to complacency and rigidity; that the Corporation&apos; has becomeunwieldy and has too great a power as a monopolist over its employees;-and finally that it might be susceptible to manipulation for politicalaims by. an extremist Government...It might be desirable thatsponsored broadcasting should, if introduced, be carried out by localtransmitters serving small areas.The Cabinet Committee which had examined the problem had come to the conclusion that the balance of these arguments lay infavour of continuing the present arrangements for a further period.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would not in any event be practicable for new agencies toestablish broadcasting stations within the next five years; for. thecapital equipment required could not be made available, nor would the development of very high frequency broadcasting have been,carried to the point at which, sufficient new wave-lengths would beavailable. /Even at the end of triis period, other essential demandsmight be-such that fewer wave-lengths would be available for thispurpose than was now/being assumed; and the development ofnumerous broadcasting. stations in this country might not provepracticable until a much later period, when ultra high frequenciesmight be in use.. ..(6) In view of these practical difficulties it might not be necessary at the present time to take a decision of principle on the question ofthe monopoly. If a decision were deferred on this basis and the monopoly were renewed for five years, agitation on the subject would begin afresh after only two or three years. The monopoly might,however, be renewed for a period of seven years, instead of the tenyears which was the normal duration of a B.B.C. Charter.(c) The monopoly did not rest on any statutory provision or onthe Charter, but on the administrative decision taken by successivePostmasters-General to. issue only one broadcasting licence.; while this, decision could hardly be reversed without discussion in Parlia-ment, it remained within the discretion of the Government and nolegislative action would be required if at any time the Governmentshould decide to abandon the monopoly. It was important thatthis should be generally understood.(d) The matter was urgent, not only because the Charter andlicence of the Corporation, having been temporarily renewed at theend of 1951, would expire on 30th June next and the Governmentwould be expected well in advance of that date to declare their policyin a White Paper which would have to be debated in Parliament, butalso because opinion appeared to be crystallising among Government,supporters in the House of Commons in favour of breaking the monopoly. There were signs that the case for its retention, whichthe Cabinet Committee thought the more powerful, was going bydefault.

(52) 51) setting out the arguments for and againstmaintaining the monopoly enjoyed by the British broadcasting corporation. In favour of continuing the present system were theabsence of any sign of public demand for a change; the lack ofevidence that any alternative system would enable present programmestandards to be maintained, much less improved; and the risk thatfinancially powerful bodies, if allowed to sponsor broadcasts, mightdisseminate undesirable propaganda and ill-balanced views on public affairs.   On the other hand commercially-sponsored broadcasting1.

SecurityProcedure.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (52) 48) reporting the views of a Cabinet Committeewhich had examined proposals made to the Prime Minister forcnanges in the security procedure applied to civil servants engaged on work of a very secret character.The Home Secretary said that the essence of the plan, whichthe Cabinet Committee had endorsed, was to supplement by a new procedure the normal checking by the Security Service against itsrecords of the names of civil servants employed on secret work. Thenew procedure would be applied to a limited range of posts, num--bering about 14,000, which involved access to the most vital secrets.It would be of a positive and open character, the civil servants con-cerned being called upon to declare whether they had any Communistassociations, and personal referees being asked the same question.The procedure had been discussed with representatives of the staff,who had raised a number of minor points, on some of which it wouldbe possible to meet their wishes. These were set out in the annex to C. (52) 48.The Cabinet discussed the question of Ministerial responsibilityfor this procedure. They decided to make no change in the existing practice, by which -the employing Minister was responsible to Parlia-ment for the action taken in individual cases and Treasury Ministers(normally the Financial Secretary) were responsible for any general questions. The Home Secretary would, however, be available for consultation on any substantial issues of policy that might arise, andparticularly on any matter affecting the Security Service.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the arrangements recorded in C. (52) 48 for improving security checks on civil servants engaged in work involving access to vital secrets.(2) Agreed that the points raised by staff representatives shouldbe handled as proposed in the Annex to C. (52) 48.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21th February, 1952.
