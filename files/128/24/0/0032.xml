Parliament. The Cabinet were informed of the business, to be taken in theBusiness in the  House of Commons in the following week.House ofCommons.National health service Bill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 30thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Minister of Health said that he and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland proposed, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of theExchequer, that three concessions should be made, at a cost to theExchequer of about  1  million, to meet criticisms expressed againstthe proposals in the National Health Service Bill. These were--(i) that free dental treatment should be available, not merely to persons of school age, but to all persons up to the age of 21; (ii) that for allpatients dental examination should be free and charges should bemade only for treatment; and (iii) that no charge should be made forthe provision of hearing aids. These changes would be made byGoverment amendments moved on the Committee stage of the Bill;but, subject to the views of the Cabinet, he proposed to announcethem in moving the second reading of the Bill on 27th March.-The Cabinet agreed that the Minister should retain the initiativeby announcing these changes at the outset of the debate on the secondreading of the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Approved the concessions which the Minister of Health pro-posed to make on the National Health Service Bill, and authorised him to announce them in moving the secondreading of the Bill on 27th March.(2) Authorised the Minister of Health to arrange for the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland to be informed at once, in con-fidence, of the concessions which he was proposing tomake.Iron and SteelIndustry.Draft Iron andSteel Bill.3. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (C. (52) 80) submitting a draft Bill prepared by the steel Committee to return the iron and steel industry to privateenterprise.(Previous The Minister of Supply described the main provisions of the Bill.Reference: These included transfer of the ownership of the industry to a realises-C.C.

Substantial use might have to be made of the lattermethod, which would reduce the capital which private enterprisewould have to find. The powers of price control exercised by the newSteel Board would be subject to safeguards enabling the Minister to intervene if necessary. And the provisions relating to control ofdevelopment in the industry included a power enabling the Ministerto undertake development required in the national interest whichprivate firms might be unwilling to undertake. Since the report ofthe Steel Committee had been prepared, the Committee had decidedto recommend reversion to an earlier plan for defining what parts ofthe industry should be covered by the new Board. The activities whichwere immediately to come under the supervision of the Board wouldbe set out in a Third Schedule on the lines of the present draft but afurther schedule would be added covering marginal activities whichmight, during a limited period, be brought under the supervision ofthe Board by Ministerial Order requiring affirmative resolutions in both Houses of Parliament.42124-4 B 2
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he accepted thedraft Bill, he did so with some reluctance because it had been foundnecessary to place the main responsibility for the Realisation and management Agency on the Treasury. He thought that, as it had notbeen found practicable to include provisions guaranteeing investorsagainst further nationalisation, disposal of the industry to privateenterprise would be slow. The Treasury might therefore find them-selves for a long time the de facto owners of a large part of theindustry and unable to dissociate themselves from its dividend policyand from the provision of finance for its development. He realised that the Agency would be expected to devote its attention primarily to the disposal of the industry and to leave the individual companies to run their affairs with the minimum of interference; but, despite this, the responsibilities assigned to the Treasury were potentiallyembarrassing. ...&apos;The Cabinet, while recognising that it would not be practicable,in the face of Opposition threats of further nationalisation, to dispose of more than a part of the industry quickly at a fair value, consideredthat confidence might improve subsequently, when it was seen thatthe Bill provided much of the public control of the industry whichresponsible Opposition opinion thought desirable. Some of the largebusinesses which had owned enterprises now nationalised might be willing to re-acquire them at once; but the main operation ofrealisation would take time. The recasting of the capital structure ofsome of the companies might be found desirable in order to attractnew classes of investor.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the draft Iron and Steel Bill attached toC. (52) 80.(2) Invited members of the Cabinet to convey to the Minister ofHealth, in his capacity as Chairman of the Steel Com-mittee, any comments or suggestions which they might wish to make on the Bill.(3) Invited the Steel Committee to take account of suchcomments and suggestions, and to submit a further reportto the Cabinet in two weeks&apos; time.Economic 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that situation.       the drain on the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area had not(Previous        slackened.  The announcement of the figures for the first quarter ofReference:      1952 would, however, be less likely to shake public confidence byCC. (52) 5th    reason of the extent to which the gravity of the position had been conclusions,    disclosed in the Budget statement.  The Budget itself had created a minute 1.) &apos;    favourable impression on foreign opinion and had helped, so far asbudgetary measures could help, to strengthen public confidence in sterling. The general pattern of trade should become more favourableby reason of the action which the Government had taken; and other sterling area countries were now fully alive to the dangers of thesituation, as was shown by the drastic action announced by theAustralian Government.   If it had been possible to introduce inSeptember measures comparable to those which the Government hadprogressively applied since assuming office, the crisis might have been averted; but, as things now stood, it might still become necessary totake further and more drastic action during the summer.In discussion it was pointed out that one of the dangers of thecurrent situation was that a general trade recession might be produced by the restrictionist measures which sterling-area countries were forcedto take in order to avert insolvency. It was the more importanttherefore that the United States should follow during the coming months a liberal policy in purchases from the sterling area. While the sterling area reserves remained low, any slackening of demand in
157jamFarm price review.(previous reference:C.C.(51) 11thConclusions,Minute 5.)the United States was followed by a financial crisis in the sterling area; and it would be most advantageous if the United States Govern-ment could be persuaded to concert their purchasing policies with usin order to avoid these fluctuations in demand. It would be helpful if at an appropriate stage the Chancellor of the Exchequer could press this suggestion upon the United States Government.In further discussion The Prime Minister said that he was considering whether he should make, towards the end of the month, ashort broadcast on the general situation.The Cabinet Took note of the statement made by the Chancellor of theExchequer and of the points raised in the discussion.5. The Minister of Agriculture informed the Cabinet of thepresent state of the negotiations with farmers&apos; representatives on farm prices. He was conducting these negotiations in consultation withthe other Ministers responsible for agriculture and with the lord president, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food.All these Ministers were agreed that on merits the addition to be madeto gross annual farm incomes by the review should amount to 42^ million, though they contemplated that this figure might beincreased in negotiation to  45 million. But at present the farmers&apos;representatives, who were under strong pressure from their con-stituents, were pressing for an addition of  60 million or even more.It might therefore prove necessary to settle farm prices on this occasion without the agreement of the farmers&apos; representatives. Thisshould be avoided if possible, more particularly because the farmers&apos;co-operation in measures to increase farming efficiency would not besecured unless there had been an agreed price settlement. TheMinister felt that he should do everything in his power to restore the confidence of the farmers which, rightly or not, had been shakenby the farm price review of 195.1. But the farmers were asking for price adjustments which, though they were designed in particular to increase meat production, were not in his view justifiable. he proposed to continue the negotiations in consultation with those ofhis colleagues who were concerned and would report further to theCabinet as necessary.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister&apos; of Agriculture.FoodProduction.Pigs.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 20thConclusions,Minute 7.)Potatoes.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, The Ministerof Agriculture said that the pig population in this country had now been raised to a level approximately equal to that of the years immediately preceding the war. If adequate supplies of coarse grains continuedto be imported, it should be possible to raise the annual home pro-duction of pig meat to about 600,000 tons in 1955-56.The Minister said that there was a risk that a smaller acreagewould be sown to potatoes this spring. There was at present asubstantial glut of potatoes from last year&apos;s crop, and farmers had no assurance of being able to secure the labour required to lift a heavycrop in the autumn. These two considerations, coupled with the high cost of sowing potatoes, might have the result that a smaller acreagewould be sown. The Prime Minister said that no opportunity shouldbe lost of encouraging the growing of potatoes, not only by farmers,but by smallholders. He also suggested that vigorous steps should betaken, by publicity and otherwise, to ensure that full use was made ofthe abundant supplies of potatoes which were currently available.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th March, 1952.Meat Supplies.(previous reference:CC. (52) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thjflfeChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food (C. (52) 77Wexamining alternative lines of policy in relation to the purchase of meat from South America.The Minister of Food said that some- 300,000 tons of meat might become available in South America in the twelve months ending inJune 1953. Though estimates of price were speculative, this mightbe obtainable at  175 a ton, which was 30 per cent, above the average price prescribed in existing agreements. He wished, therefore, to beauthorised to enter into commitments to spend up to  50 million on meat from South America in this period. If these supplies weresecured, the level of the meat ration could be raised in the first halfof 1953 by 4d. or 5d. a week above the general level of the first halfof 1952. He believed this to be necessary in order to sustain the pro-ductive power and morale of the people. Argentina&apos;s need for essential sterling exports might induce them to provide us with these supplies at the level of prices which he had in mind. It was, however,necessary to enter into early negotiations, since otherwise Argentinamight dispose of her meat elsewhere and turn to other suppliersfor her own essential requirements.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the other hand, thought itwould be most imprudent at the present time, in an acute balance ofpayments crisis, to enter into long-term commitments involving soheavy an increase in our overseas expenditure. In his view we shouldnot commit ourselves at present to expenditure on South Americanmeat at a greater rate in the twelve months ending June 1953 than thatof the  25 million authorised for the calendar year 1952. The matter might be considered again later in the year, when the balance ofpayments might have improved.The Cabinet shared the anxiety of the Minister of Food toimprove meat supplies. They were, however, reluctant, in view ofthe grave state of the balance of payments and the difficulty whichthey had experienced in making substantial reductions in importsgenerally, to make so large an immediate addition to our overseas expenditure as was involved in his proposal. Nevertheless, there was good hope that savings of foreign exchange, which might amount tothe equivalent of  5 million, might be made in the programme of oilpurchases for the Navy; and it was also possible that economiesamounting to  1 million or  1^ million could be made in the cost ofsteel to be used to provide buildings for the Services. These economieswere under examination by the Minister of Defence, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, and decisions on them might beexpected to be reached very shortly. The Chancellor of the exchequer said that he was willing that, if savings were made in this way, theyshould be added to the sum of  25 million which he proposed to make available for the purchase of South American meat.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Food to enter into commitments for the purchase of meat from South America in the twelvemonths ending June 1953 at a cost not exceeding 25 million; but to add to this limit savings (expected to amount to some  6 million) which the Minister of Defencemight secure in expenditure on oil for the Navy and on steel for Service building.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to raise with them at a later date the question of further purchases of South American meat.
