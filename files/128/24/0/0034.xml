179C.C. 34 (52)Bechuanaland 1.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that, with his predecessor,Protectorate.- he had again seen Seretse Khama on the previous day. Seretse hadChieftainship declined to abdicate and had rejected the offer of employment inof the Jamaica. While he was willing to renounce the Chieftainship of the bamangwato Bamangwato, he was unwilling to surrender his right to concernTribe. himself with the political affairs of the Tribe.    Though every(Previous persuasion had been brought to bear upon him in the course of a veryReference: long interview, his decision had remained unshaken. Meanwhile, theC.C. (52) 33rd purport of these discussions had become known to the Leaders of theConclusions, Opposition Parties. It was known that the Labour Party would be minute 7.) strongly critical of the line which the Government had taken. the leader of the Liberal Party had suggested, late on the previous evening, a Compromise which he believed Seretse might accept. Thiswas that Seretse should renounce the Chieftainship on condition thatthe government of the Tribe was permanently entrusted to a Councilof State appointed by the United Kingdom Government; that neitherSeretse nor Tshekedi should be members of this Council, but that both should be invited to advise the Government on the choice of its members; and that Seretse should at no future time return to the bamangwato Reserve unless he were invited to do so by the Counciland the Government were satisfied that this was in accord with thewishes of the Tribe. The choice now before the Cabinet was between(i) proceeding forthwith, in accordance with the original policy approved by the Cabinet on 18th March, to announce their finaldecision that Seretse could never be recognised as Chief of the Tribeand must be permanently excluded from the Reserve, and (ii) makinga further last-minute attempt to secure his voluntary abdication by making the compromise offer suggested by the Leader of the liberal party.In favour of offering this compromise it was pointed out that, ifit were offered and rejected, the Liberals would be less likely to votewith the Labour Opposition against the Government^ policy. If,however, Seretse accepted it, African opinion in the Reserve wouldbe greatly confused; for the Tribe would have been told, at Kgotlaswhich were being held that afternoon, that Seretse was being excludedin order that they might choose another Chief, and later they wouldhave to be told that they were to be ruled indefinitely by a Councilof State. On the merits there were strong arguments against adopting. the compromise proposal. The Bamangwato were accustomed to the personal leadership of a Chieftain, and the conception of government by a Council of State would be quite foreign to them. This plan was also likely to be unacceptable to Tshekedi. And the SouthAfrican Government would regard it as a surrender to Seretse andmight well be provoked thereby to press their claim for the cession of the High Commission Territories.It was the general view of Ministers that, despite the representa-tions made on behalf of the Labour and Liberal Parties, the cabinet should persist in the policy which they had approved on 18th Marchand confirmed on 25th March.The Cabinet - Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange forsimultaneous statements to be made that afternoon, in both.Houses of Parliament, announcing (on the lines of the draft in Appendix B to C. (52) 81, as amended in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion on 25th March) the Governments finaldecision that Seretse Khama could never be recognised as chief of the Bamangwato and must be permanently excludedfrom the Reserve.
Parliament &apos;  2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week.House of Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter Recess onCommons. 10th April and would reassemble on Monday, 21st April.Government 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lordinformation Privy Seal (C. (52) 82) embodying the conclusions of the CommitteeServices. on Government Information Services regarding the future of the(Previous Central Office of Information. They also had before them memo-Reference: randa by the Postmaster-General (C. (52) 86) and the Minister ofC.C. (52) 27th Works (C. (52) 88) dissenting, so far as concerned their Departments,Conclusions, from the conclusion that Departments should not maintain separateMinute 2.) staffs to undertake information work of a kind which could be carriedout by the Central Office of Information.The Lord Privy Seal said that his Committee had been satisfiedthat, on grounds of economy, the balance of advantage lay on the sideof handling through a central agency all Government information work other than the day-to-day dealings with the Press. they therefore recommended that the Central Office of Information shouldbe continued, and that the Treasury should consider in detail what information work which was now being done separately in Depart -ments could with advantage be transferred to the Central Office.They also recommended that the Treasury should re-examine theadministrative structure of the Central Office and the arrangements(        for maintaining Ministerial control over its work.The Committee had felt obliged to draw attention to the fact thata centralised information agency might, in the hands of an extremistGovernment, prove a powerful and dangerous weapon of propaganda.In measuring this risk, however, it must be borne in mind that, if theexisting division of responsibilities were maintained, the centralagency would have no responsibility for day-to-day dealings with thePress or for determining publicity policy; both these responsibilities would continue to rest with Departmental Ministers.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Postmaster-General said that in this matter his Depart-ment was in a special position since it operated a trading service. Itwas at once more economical and more efficient that its publicity should be handled by specialised staff familiar with Post Officeproblems. He urged very strongly that this arrangement shouldcontinue. Indeed, he would have been able to make still further economies if he had been free to carry out through his own staff someof the services for which he was now obliged to rely on the central office of Information.(b) The Minister of Works said that he also was satisfied thatthe publicity work done by his Department would be done lessefficiently and less cheaply if it were handled by the Central Office ofInformation. This work was, however, being carried out for thebenefit of the building and civil engineering industries; and it was his aim to persuade those industries to take over this responsibility and do the bulk of the work themselves.(c) The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,while it might be more economical to handle this work through a central agency, he was not persuaded that this arrangement would always make for efficiency; Though most of the work might be donecentrally, there would always be particular projects which the Depart-ments were better equipped to handle themselves. He hoped that hewould be allowed a discretion to deal with some of this work through his Departmental staff.(d) The Prime Minister said that, before final decisions were taken, he would wish to have a report showing the numbers of staff employed, and the expenditure incurred, on information work-bothin the Central Office of Information and in the Departments.
CC. 34 (52)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for a more detailed examination to be made of the extent to which information work now carried out by separate staffs in theDepartments could be centralised in the Central Office ofInformation, and to discuss such transfers of work withthe Departmental Ministers concerned.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit a reportshowing the numbers of staff engaged, and the expenditure incurred, on information work, both in the Central Officeof Information and in the Departments.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later date, when the results of the enquiries to be made underConclusions (1) and (2) above were available.Overseas 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignBroadcasting. Secretary (C. (52) 89) recommending that the Grant-in-Aid to theMeasures to external services of the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.)Counter Soviet should be increased by  50,000 in the year 1952-53, in order to financeJamming. measures to counter the jamming of the Corporation^ services to. Finland and to the Soviet satellites.The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that the Grant-in-Aid for the external services of the B.B.C. had been fixed for 1952-53at the same figure as in the preceding year; and that this meant that,in order to meet rising costs, substantial cuts had already had to bemade in the services provided. The Corporation had now to finda further sum of  80,000 in order to counter Soviet jamming. Of this sum  30,000 could be found from the Corporation^ allocation to civil Defence, which could not be spent in full. But the balance of 50,000 could only be found either by an increase in the Grant-in-Aidor by cuts in other services. If we did not take measures to counterjamming we should have to abandon our services wherever Soviet orsatellite jamming was extended; and our broadcasting policy wouldthen be determined, not by us, but by the degree of jamming under-taken by the Soviet Government and their agents.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that themeasures to counter jamming were essential. He understood, how-ever, that the actual expenditure of the B.B.C. on overseas broad-casting in the current year would be below their Grant-in-Aid. Hewould like therefore to have an opportunity of considering whetherthe sum of  50,000 required to finance counter-measures to jammingcould not be found by savings in other directions which would renderan increase in the Grant-in-Aid unnecessary.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the British Broadcasting Corporation should beasked to undertake the counter-jamming measures con-templated by them at a cost in 1952-53 of  80,000.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to examine the possibility that this sum mightbe found by other savings on the Corporation^ externalservices.Farm Price 5.   The Minister of Agriculture reported to the Cabinet the pro-\       Review. gress of the negotiations on farm prices.   After the Cabinefs previous.0       (Previous discussion there had been a period of deadlock during which the reference: farmers&apos; leaders had been under instructions to insist upon priceCC. (52) 32nd increases totalling  66 million.   The Government were thus presentedConclusions, with an ultimatum.  In the last twenty-four hours, however, this dead-MtMutoS.) lock had been broken and the farmers&apos; leaders were now ready to
resume effective negotiations. All the Ministers concerned had agreed that an addition of  42^ million would be sufficient wholly to offset increases in costs. This would not, however, contain any element providing an incentive to greater production and a settlement with the farmers at that level would not be possible. The Ministerof Agriculture therefore suggested that he should be authorised toreach a settlement, if he could, at a figure between  45 million and 50 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was reluctant to seethe figure advanced beyond  45 million which was the most whichcould be financed without increasing the maximum level of food sub-subsidies laid down in the Budget or increasing certain food prices. Inview, however, of the importance of reaching an agreed settlement, hewas prepared to authorise the Minister to go to a maximum of 50 million gross, i.e., to a net figure of  47J million after deduction of the  2  million given in the 1951 review as an addition to livestockprices for that year only. This would mean that certain food prices would have to be increased.The Minister of Food hoped that any farm price adjustmentscarrying the total beyond  45 million would not include increases for milk and eggs, which involved heavy subsidy charges.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Agriculture, if thereby he could reach an agreed settlement, to advance the addition to bemade to gross annual farm incomes by the present farm price review to a level not exceeding  50 million gross.Civil Aviation. 6. The Minister of Transport said that Scottish Airlines(Previous Limited, an independent Scottish company based on Prestwick and reference: operating two small passenger services within the United Kingdom,CC. (52) 30th had reported that they would be obliged for financial reasons to conclusions. discontinue their services and go out of business unless they were minute 6.) allowed to undertake a new service between London and Jersey.Scottish Airlines The Air Transport Advisory Council had recommended that the firmLimited. should not be allowed to operate this service; and the Minister sharedthis view, particularly as the Channel Islands were themselves anxiousto regain their right to operate a service to the mainland. He there-fore proposed to refuse this application; but he had thought it rightto mention the matter to the Cabinet since Scottish Airlines Limitedwas a subsidiary of the only Scottish company engaged in the aircraftbusiness and had been associated with the development of PrestwickAirport, in which Scottish public opinion was keenly interested.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he did not dissent from the conclusion reached by the Minister of Transport, he hoped that the decision could be presented in such a way as to forestallpublic criticism.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Transport should reject the.application of Scottish Airlines Limited for permission to operate a passenger air service between London and Jersey.
183CC. 34 (52)7. The Lord President informed the Cabinet that after their discussion on 25th March the Minister of Transport had informed theChairman of the British Transport Commission that it would be helpful if the Commission could arrange for a standstill in the appli-cation of the 25-mile limit to private road hauliers, and he had beenable to reach a satisfactory understanding with the Chairman on this issue. The Cabinet Committee on Road and Rail Transport,together with the other Ministers whom the Cabinet had invited theLord President to take into consultation, had agreed that in thesecircumstances no immediate announcement need be made regardingthe Governmenfs intentions in relation to road haulage. Theywould, however, report later to the Cabinet on the best method ofmaking such an announcement. It might be advisable to embody itin a White Paper.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Lord President.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27*7* March, 1952.Roal and rail Transport.(previous reference:CC.
