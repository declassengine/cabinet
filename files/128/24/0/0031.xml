H*cal 1.   The Prime Minister raised the question whether membersGovernment of the Government should not take an active part in the forthcomingElections.       municipal elections in London.In discussion it was pointed out that, traditionally, members ofthe Cabinet did not normally speak in by-elections, and that Ministersabove the rank of Parliamentary Secretary did not normally speakin local government elections. If the Government made any sub-stantial departure from this practice at the forthcoming Londonelections, they would be expected later in the year to give similarsupport to Conservative candidates in the local government elections in other parts of the country and there would be great practical difficulty in doing this at a time when Parliament was sitting.The Prime Minister felt, however, that the present circumstance were somewhat exceptional; and the Cabinet agreed that the HomeSecretary should speak in the London elections in his capacity as president of the London Municipal Society. They also agreed thata number of junior Ministers should speak in these elections. they invited the Chief Whip to make arrangements accordingly.East-west trade.Exports of rubber toRussia.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 79) pointing out that, while theCabinet had agreed on 12th March that licences in the second quarterof 1952 for the export of rubber to Russia should be limited to15,000 tons, both the Soviet and United States Governments had previously been informed that the limit on licences in the second quarter of the year would be 20,000 tons, representing one-quarterof the annual limit of 80,000 tons.The President of the Board of Trade said that the russians were meticulous in keeping their word in commercial matters and itwould be unfortunate if they were put in a position to suggest thatthey could not place equal reliance upon official communications from Departments of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. They had alreadyshipped 80 per cent, of the coarse grains covered by our currentagreement with them.The Cabinet considered that, as the United States Governmenthad been kept informed of the course of our shipments of rubberto Russia and of the proposed limit of 20,000 tons for licences inthe second quarter of 1952, it would be reasonable to allow licensingup to that level. This would mean, however, that shipments in thefirst half of 1952 would total 64,000 tons; and there was also some risk that non-sterling supplies this year might exceed the 1951 totalof 10,000 tons. The Cabinet therefore reconsidered their earlierview that the balance by which sterling shipments in 1951 had fallenshort of 80,000 tons might be added to the figure of 80,000 tons for1952. They decided that this should remain open for the time being.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to allow licensing of rubber exports to Russia for the second quarter of 1952up to a limit of 20,000 tons, inclusive of the 6,000 tonsalready licensed against that quarter; but to enter into nofurther commitments for the present and to submit to themlater in the year the question of further shipments and inparticular the question whether the annual limit of80,000 tons should be exceeded in 1952 by any part of thebalance by which shipments in 1951 had fallen short ofthat limit.42124.....3 b 2
Egypt.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 29thConclusions,Minute 7.)MotorisedGendarmerie.3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeigrSecretary (C. (52) 78) inviting their approval of a suggestion that the&quot;Egyptian Government, should obtain from the United States armoured cars and other vehicles for the equipment of a special force ofmotorised gendarmerie.The Foreign Secretary said that this force would be under thecontrol of King Farouk and, although there was a risk that it mightbe used against us in any further disorders, this did not seem likely.The United States Government had consulted us and, if we gave ourassent, we should thereby secure the goodwill of the Egyptian Govern-ment and especially of the King. There was much to be said for supporting attempts by the Egyptians to maintain law and order intheir country.The Minister of Defence said that even if this force were used against us the military danger would not be great. Our best hope ofsecuring a satisfactory settlement with Egypt lay in supporting king farouk, and the United States Government might misunderstand any objections which we raised to the proposal. He therefore thoughtthat we should assent to it.The Cabinet Approved the proposal described in C. (52) 78 and authorised the Foreign Secretary to take the action specifiedin paragraph 7 of that memorandum.bechuanaland protectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 18thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 76) on the future of Seretse Khama.The Commonwealth Secretary reminded the Cabinet that theyhad already decided their policy towards Tshekedi Khama and themeasures by which they would aim to secure the ultimate nomination of Rasebolai as Chief of the Bamangwato. They should now takea decision about the future of Seretse Khama. It had been the policyof the late Government that the question whether Seretse could berecognised as Chief of the Tribe should remain open for a period offive years. The Commonwealth Secretary was satisfied, however,that it would never at any time be expedient to allow Seretse toassume the Chieftainship. This would not be in the interests of the tribe, and it would outrage opinion in South Africa and SouthernRhodesia. To delay decision for another three years would causecontinuing criticism of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and unrest in theReserve. The best solution would be Seretse&apos;s abdication, whichmight be secured by the offer of suitable employment elsewhere. TheGovernor of Jamaica thought it would be possible to offer him such employment, but had pot yet been authorised to consult his ExecutiveCouncil. If the Executive Council proved willing that the offer shouldbe made, the Commonwealth Secretary proposed to see Seretse on24th March, and. seek to persuade him to abdicate in the interestsof his people and to accept the offer of the Jamaican post. If he agreed to abdicate, a Government statement would be made on thelines of the draft set out in Appendix A to C. (52) 76: if he should refuse to do so a different statement (Appendix B to C. (52) 76)would be made, indicating that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that their predecessors&apos; refusal to recognise Seretse as Chiefmust be confirmed and made permanent and final, and that he hadbeen offered a Government post in Jamaica which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were urging him to accept.If the Executive Council of Jamaica proved unwilling to offerthis appointment, the Commonwealth Secretary would make noapproach to Seretse until some alternative offer could be made.
In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) There was general agreement that, if a suitable appointmentcould be offered to Seretse, it was desirable that an immediate decisionon the lines proposed should be taken and announced; but it was thought inexpedient that in any public statement the decision shouldffl be based in part on South African opinion.  It would be preferable,if Seretse refused to abdicate, to base the decision on the fact that hispermanent exclusion from the Chieftainship was necessary for thefuture well-being of the Bamangwato Tribe.(b) It had been suggested that, when the offer of alternative employment and the suggestion of abdication was made to Seretse,he should be given only twenty-four hours in which to make his decision. The Cabinet thought it preferable to allow him ratherlonger, e.g., forty-eight hours.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to ascertain finally whether an offer of Government employment in Jamaica could bemade to Seretse Khama.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, if the answer fromJamaica was affirmative, to proceed as proposed inC. (52) 76; and, after giving Seretse forty-eight hours or so in which to reply, to issue a public statement on thelines either of Appendix A or of Appendix B to C. (52) 76in the light of that reply.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to reconsider the actualwording of these alternative draft statements and to circulate amended drafts to the Cabinet.mRoyal Style 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Chan-and Titles. cellor (C. (52) 55) embodying the report of a Ministerial Committeewhich the Prime Minister had appointed to consider whether anychange should be proposed in the form of the Royal Style and Titles.The Committee had concluded that some change ought to be made before Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation; that the only practicable meansof meeting the views of other Commonwealth Governments was toadopt a form of Title which would permit an element of local varia-tion, so that each Commonwealth country could use for its own pur-poses a Title in which it was itself mentioned by name while the otherparts of the Commonwealth were described in a generic phrase; andthat consultations should now be opened with other commonwealth governments with a view to securing their agreement to the forms of title listed in the Appendix to C. (52) 55 and the adoption of a com-mon plan for introducing corresponding, and preferably simultaneous,legislation on this subject in the various Commonwealth capitals.In discussion of this report the following points were raised:  (a) If any change was to be made in the form of the Title, it seemed inevitable that it should be along the general lines recom-mended in C. (52) 55. It was true that the use of different Titles indifferent parts of the Commonwealth would tend to emphasise theseparateness of the Queen&apos;s sovereignty over the various independent countries of the Commonwealth, which had the consequence that itwould be constitutionally possible for some members of the Common-wealth to remain neutral in a war in which others were engaged.The Cabinet recognised, however, that this was in accord with thecurrent constitutional relations between the members of the Common-wealth.
(b) The suggestion was made that, in the forms of Title set outin the Appendix to C. (52) 55, the words &apos;; beyond the Seas &quot; might beinserted after &quot; Territories.&quot; It was pointed out that in the new formof Title these words would be less appropriate than they had been inthe old.  The suggestion might, however, be considered.(c) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe Ambassador of the Irish Republic had recently represented to him that, if any change was made in the form of the Title, explicit referenceto Northern Ireland might be avoided by describing this country as&quot; the United Kingdom.&quot; This, the Ambassador thought, would help to create an atmosphere in which the unity of Ireland could more easily be attained. This suggestion did not commend itself to theCabinet.(d) It was suggested that on this complicated question the neces-sary consultation with other Commonwealth Governments might be conducted more conveniently by means of meetings with Common-wealth representatives in London rather than by telegram.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations set out in paragraph 9 of thereport (C. (52) 55) of the Ministerial Committee on theForm of the Royal Style and Titles.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to initiate consultations with other commonwealth governments with a view to securing their agreement toa change in the form of the Royal Style and Titles on thelines recommended in the report.Persia. 6.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest(Previous developments in the discussions about the future of the Persian oilReference: industry.

This might well weakenConclusions, the political position of the Persian Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister said that he was concerned lest theCharges. present Government should be held responsible for the recent(Previous        increases in bus fares and railway fares in the London area.

With this minute 1.)       in view he had suggested to the Minister of Transport that he should add, to his reply to a Parliamentary Question by Air CommodoreHarvey, M.P., about the withdrawal of special fares for shift workers,a paragraph in the following terms:  &quot; All these rules were made and all those who are enforcingthem were appointed by the late Government and they are adefinite feature in the nationalisation policy. We are considering how and when changes can be made which will secure thatworkmen working on a night shift can again obtain workmen&apos;stravel tickets.&quot;In discussion it was pointed out that nothing should be said on behalf of the Government which would reflect upon the impartial-tiality of the Transport Tribunal, which was a judicial body enjoyingthe powers, rights and privileges of the High Court. Moreover, itwould not be right to imply that the appointment of this Tribunalwas one of the features of the nationalisation policy adopted by the
161CC. 31 (52)late Government, for similar functions had been exercised for sometime previously by the Railway Rates Tribunal set up under theRailways Act, 1921. For the reasons indicated in the paper by theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power(subsequently circulated as C. (52) 84), it was important that a clear distinction should be made in this matter between the position of theBritish Transport Commission and that of the Transport Tribunal.Air Commodore Harvey had now withdrawn his Question; but,if it were reinstated, it would be inexpedient to make any statement in reply which might imply that the special concessions for shiftworkers might be restored. The system of workmen&apos;s fares which had previously been in force in the London area had been full ofanomalies; and there was much to be said for the view that the with-drawal of shift workers&apos; tickets was in principle a sound reform.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to continue to take everysuitable opportunity of impressing it upon public opinionthat the responsibility for the recent increase in passenger transport fares did not rest with the present Government.(2) Agreed that, if Air Commodore Harvey, M.P., should againput down his Question about the withdrawal of shiftworkers&apos; tickets, the answer should include a sentence inthe following terms: &quot; All the relevant statutory pro-visions and all the functions exercised by the british transport Commission result from legislation introduced by the late Government and are a definite feature in the nationalisation policy.&quot;Services. 8. The Postmaster-General informed the Cabinet that he had agreed that, as part of the Civil Service staff economies for whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had called, he would refrain fromadding 1,800 staff in postal grades which were needed to handlenormal increases in business. As a result he found it necessary,because overtime in the postal services had already reached an uneconomic level, to make certain cuts in postal services, for whichhe had obtained the approval of the Home Affairs Committee. Thesecuts were as follows:  (i) Deliveries in urban areas starting at or after 1 - 30 p.m. on saturday afternoons to be suspended; Saturday afternooncollections to be restricted to a final clearance fromselected boxes at 5-30-6-30 p.m.(ii) Regional Directors to have discretion to extend the finishingtime of the first delivery from 9 a.m. to 9-15 a.m. ininner London and from 9 15 a.m. to 9-30 a.m. in othertowns, where this was necessary to avoid increases in staff.(iii) Rural deliveries and collections after  1-1 - 30 p.m. onSaturdays to be suspended. .(iv) Regional Directors to have discretion to suspend the seconddelivery in rural areas throughout the week where localman-power was not available: and to suspend improve-ments in facilities which needed additional man-power.These measures would not seriously affect the main framework ofthe postal services and most of them would cause no serious incon-venience. The Saturday afternoon deliveries in towns were, forexample, of little present value to business interests. But two of themeasures, viz., the lengthening of the period of the first morningletter-delivery and the discretion to Regional Directors to suspend thesecond rural delivery would be criticised. If he could have discretion.to. increase his staff by 400 or 500, in place of the 1,800 previously proposed, he could avoid making these two changes.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this staff economy!formed part of the programme by which he was hoping to decreasethe size of the Civil Service by 10,000 before the end of June. Hewas reluctant, therefore, to abandon any part of it. He did not,however, wish to oppose the suggestion now made by the Postmaster-General if it were favoured by his colleagues.The general view of the Cabinet was that the two economies towhich the Postmaster-General had drawn particular attention shouldnot be made and that the postal staff should accordingly be increasedby between 400 and 500. It would not then be necessary to make anygeneral announcement of the other minor changes in services whichthe Postmaster-General contemplated.The Cabinet-Invited the Postmaster-General to proceed with his proposedeconomies in the postal services, other than the lengtheningof the period of the first morning letter-delivery and thediscretionary suspension of the second rural delivery; andto increase the postal staff as necessary up to a limit of 500.Economic 9.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed thatSurvey. an Economic Survey should be presented to Parliament in April.This would be more of a factual document than some of the Surveyswhich had been published by the late Government. He would like todiscuss the terms of the draft Survey with some of his colleagues and proposed for that purpose to circulate it to the Economic PolicyCommittee.The Prime Minister agreed that this draft should be consideredby the Economic Policy Committee in the first instance. If necessary,it could thereafter be submitted to the Cabinet for final approval.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit the draftEconomic Survey to the Economic Policy Committee.Cabinet Office, SWA,18th March, 1952.
