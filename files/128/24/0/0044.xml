Road and rail transport.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 41stConclusions,Minute 3.)Discussion then turned on the proposed levy on road transport.It was suggested that paragraphs 15 and 16 of the proof should be redrafted to bring out more clearly the dual purpose of the levy. some doubt was expressed about the expediency of mentioning any specificfigure for the initial amount of the levy. It might well prove possible and desirable to raise the amount substantially above the figure of 3 million proposed in the draft, and the Government might find their hands tied by the mention of even an initial figure. On the other hand,it was desirable to reassure road hauliers, who in the.absence of any indication to the contrary might be apprehensive that the levy wouldbe large; and, when the White Paper came to be debated in the Houseof. Commons, the Government would clearly be expected to make some statement, however provisional, about the amount of the levy.There was general agreement that, if a figure was to be mentionedin the White Paper, it should be  4 million rather than  3 million.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary andother Ministers, to consider further the drafting of thepassage in the White Paper relating to the levy on road transport.The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(C. (52) 128) covering a proof of the draft White Paper on transport policy.The Cabinet considered the draft in detail, and paragraphs 1-13were approved subject to drafting amendments.The Cabinet then turned to the question whether paragraph 14of the draft, which related to the adjustment of railway charges, was consistent with the line which the Government had taken in the recentcontroversy over passenger fares. The Prime Minister said that hecould not accept the view that the Transport Commission should be free, with the approval of the Transport Tribunal, to adjust railway rates without any possibility of intervention by the Government orby Parliament; and he did not consider that the railways should be obliged to recover from revenue ah their costs, including a return on the capital invested in them. If all forms of transport were to be developed to the fullest extent, it would probably be impracticable for the railways to cover their, outgoings by increasing charges, whichwould only divert traffic increasingly from them.In discussion it was pointed out that the object of the proposalsdescribed in this paragraph was to free the railways from the presentrigid system of charges, so as to enable them to compete more effectively with other forms of transport. This could be brought out more clearly by a change in the wording of the paragraph; and wordsshould also be added to make it clear that the Transport commission would remain subject to the overriding power of the Minister ofTransport to give such directions in this matter as the national interestmight require.   .The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that paragraph 14 of the draft White Paper annexed to C. (52) 128 should be amended so as to read: &quot;TheCommission will be given greater latitude to vary their charges schemes so as to improve the ability of the rail-ways to compete with other forms of transport. Withinprescribed limits they will be free to raise or lower their charges with subsequent approval by the transport tribunal and subject to -the overriding powers of theMinister.&quot; -
57CC. 44 (52)The Cabinet next discussed whether the Government should present the White Paper before the forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons on passenger fares. The balance of opinion in theCabinet was in favour of. doing this if it were practicable.- The Cabinet-(3) Agreed to complete their examination of the draft white paper on Transport Policy at a meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, SWA;22nd April, 1952.
