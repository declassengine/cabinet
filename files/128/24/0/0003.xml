(52) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)2.   The Cabinet had before them C. (52) 4. A note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering- a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lan-caster setting out the results of his examination of theService Estimates for the forthcoming year.C. (52) 5. The text of a message sent by the Ministry ofDefence to the Prime Minister in Ottawa commenting on C. (52) 4.Telegram No. 47 from the United Kingdom High commissioner in Canada.-The text of a message from the PrimeMinister to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterstating his intention that increases in some items of theEstimates should be met by savings on other items, and indicating that he would be sending a further messageabout what appeared to be the disproportionate increasein man-power for the Air Force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet that the savings in the Service Estimates for the coming year which the PrimeMinister had had. in mind before Christmas totalled  250 million.He had, however, asked the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterto examine the Estimates in detail, with regard, not only to thecountry&apos;s economic difficulties, but also to the importance of con-concentrating on hitting power in 1952. The Chancellor of the exchequer had recognised that it would be found necessary to restore some ofthe cuts previously made, but he had hoped that a saving of not lessthan  200 million might.be made in the total of the original Estimates.The proposals now made by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterdid not quite attain this objective, the proposed saving being 196-7 million. Having regard, however, to the fact that, were it not for the rise in prices over the level of September 195.1, the savingwould have been  217 million, and to a sum of  9 million in thepresent Estimates which would return to the Exchequer as tax onaviation fuel, he thought that the present proposals were such thathe could commend them to his colleagues for endorsement. Theonly stipulations which he felt it necessary to make, and which theService Ministers were ready to accept, were that the demand on the metal-using industries should not exceed the level accepted by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and that the Secretary ofState for Air should satisfy himself that the large works programmeprovided for his Department was in fact practicable.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Of the increase of.  55 - 3. million in the, total provision con-templated by the Prime Minister, increases in prices accounted for asubstantial proportion. Much of the rest arose from the need toavoid cancellation of contracts. The  9 million repayable as taxrevenue was also a part of this, total. It would be well to send tothe Prime Minister a fuller explanation of the manner in which the increases had come about.
(b) The Cabinet were disturbed at the total size of the works programme, amounting to nearly  130 million, of which  76 million were provided for the Air Ministry. They were informed that alarge programme of air-field construction and extension was madenecessary by the weight and size of modern aircraft- by the shortendurance of jet fighters, and by the need for longer training of pilots. We were doing as much training as possible abroad andthe Secretary of State for Air was anxious to reduce to a minimum the demands for agricultural land. But the Cabinet felt that, in viewof the size of the total works programme, they must ask for it tobe reviewed afresh - to ensure that it contained no excessive pre-cautionary margins and that the Service authorities had taken full account of the research and development work which was beingcarried out in civil building to ensure all practicable economies.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the pro-vision made for works services overseas, e.g., for airfields and married quarters, and asked that special enquiry should be made to ensurethat these were essential and could in fact be carried out in theforthcoming year.(d) The Minister of Labour drew attention to the proposal inparagraph 10 of the Memorandum annexed to C. (52) 4 for areduction of the age of call-up for National Service from eighteen years and three months to eighteen years. This proposal, which didnot require legislation, had been reported to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet (1) Gave general approval to Service Estimates for the year1952-53 at the totals recommended in the memorandum annexed to C. (52) 4, but invited the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster-(i) to examine again, in consultation with the ministers concerned, the possibility of reducing the totalprovision of  129-05 million for works services,with particular regard to the possibility of reducingprecautionary margins and to the expenditure pro-posed on works services overseas, on storage facilities and on maintenance;(ii) in consultation with the Lord President and theMinister of Housing and Local Government, toensure that continuing arrangements were made forthe results of research into economies in methods of construction and the reduction of excessive safetymargins in civil engineering to be made availableto the Service authorities.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister,of Health, to arrange for the despatch of a message to the Prime Minister informing him of the cabinet&apos;s discussion and explaining the reasons for the increases proposed over the total provision contemplated by him.(3) Authorised the Minister of Labour to reduce the age of call-upfor National Service from eighteen years and three months to eighteen years.Malaya. 3.   The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that with theOPrevious agreement of the Prime Minister he was submitting to His MajestyReference: the name of General Sir Gerald Templar as High Commissioner force.C.

In addition to the normal civil responsi-Conclusions, bilities of this office, General Templar would direct all military and minute 1.) police operations in the Federation.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.
Meat,   . 4.   The Minister of. Food informed the Cabinet that promised(Previous        shipments of meat from the Argentine, Uruguay and Australia were reference :      falling seriously behind schedule.  As a result stocks had fallen to aC,C. (5i)3rd    level at which the Is. 5d. ration could not be maintained.  It was conclusions,    necessary therefore to reduce the ration from the end of JanuaryMinute6.)       to Is. 2d. worth of meat per week; but it would be possible, as aresult of improvement in the supplies of imported and home-producedbacon, to increase the bacon ration at the same time from 3 oz. perweek to 4 oz.  At its new level the meat ration would still repre-. sent (after taking account of price increases) a 50 per cent, increasein the ration which was in force a year ago. The public had already\ been warned that maintenance of the present ration depended onthe arrival of imports according to schedule.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Food should announce in a fewdays&apos; time a reduction to be made at the end of Januaryfrom Is. 5d. to Is. 2d. worth of meat per week and anincrease in the bacon ration from 3 oz. to 4 oz. per week.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for the PrimeMinister to be informed forthwith of these proposed changes.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th January, 1952.
