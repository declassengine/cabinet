The Minister of Health said that he had it in mind that theindependent enquiry into Broadmoor should be entrusted to a small body consisting, possibly, of two senior Members of Parliament witha lawyer in the Chair and a medical assessor. He also proposed thattheir duties should be limited to reviewing the adequacy of thesecurity precautions now in force at Broadmoor.The Cabinet approved these proposals, and invited the Ministerof Health to proceed with the appointment of the committee ofenquiry.Germany. 2.   The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the ForeignContractual Secretary (C. (52) 144 and 150) on the progress of the negotiationsSettlement. for a contractual settlement between the three Occupying Powers(Previous        anc* ^e German Federal Government.Reference: The Foreign Secretary said that during the last few days publicCC. (52) 43rd opinion in Germany had tended to turn against the conclusion of theConclusions, settlement. This was due, not so much to the latest Soviet moveMinute 1.) in the diplomatic exchanges about the possibility of a peace treaty,but rather to a growing recognition by the Germans that the settle-ment would have some immediate practical disadvantages for them.Thus, rearmament would involve them in heavy expenditure: thecost even of their limited contribution to the European defence community was likely to equal Hitler&apos;s military expenditure in 1938.German industrialists also recognised that this military expenditure would limit their power to compete in world markets. This meant that there was now likely to be some further delay before the settle-ment could be concluded. It might also mean that some further concessions might have to be offered in order to make the settlementmore attractive to German opinion. For example, the Americansmight have to be urged to relax the provisions about the decartelisa-tion of German industry; or the French might have to be pressed to agree to some concessions on reparations. The Cabinet mighthave to be asked to consider some such proposals during the courseof the next few weeks.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report on the progressof the negotiations for a contractual settlement with theGerman Federal Government.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 151) reporting a proposed modification of theproposal previously approved by the Cabinet for transferring to theGerman Federal Government responsibility for the custody of war criminals in the three Allied Zones.The Foreign Secretary explained that the Federal Governmenthad now come to the conclusion that they would have no power under their law to enforce the continued custody of these war criminals. The Occupying Powers had therefore no alternative butto retain the responsibility for their custody for the time being; Thenecessary amendments were being made in the draft Contract on war Criminals and in the Convention on General Relations. Nochange was proposed in the arrangements, previously approved bythe Cabinet, for the exercise of clemency towards these prisoners.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (52) 151, under which the occupying Powers would for the time being retain respon-sibility for the custody of war criminals in the three AlliedZones of Germany.Germany.War Criminals.(previous reference:CC.

Germany. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignDefence Secretary (C. (52) 141) reporting that after a date not later than JuneContribution. 1953 the local costs of British forces stationed in Germany would cease(Previous &apos;0 ^e met t^le Germans. These costs were estimated at aboutReference:  130 million a year in foreign currency. The immediate actionC.C. (52) 19th proposed by the Foreign Secretary was to send a message to theConclusions, United States Secretary of State warning him of the serious effect of minute 1.) &apos;     our having to bear these costs, and asking for his support in insisting on the maintenance of a German contribution adequate to cover ourcosts until June 1953.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised the gravity of thesituation disclosed in the memorandum. He was preparing for theCabinet a paper reviewing our economic and financial prospects andour capacity to carry out the obligations which we had undertaken.This would show that our overseas military commitments in Germany,the Middle East and the Far East were ten times greater than theyhad been before the war, when we had the help of the Indian Armyin meeting them. While he believed that the situation could be held for the next six months, the long-term outlook was very grave. Hethought that the burden of occupation costs in Germany should betaken into account in a comprehensive review of our military commitments.Discussion then turned upon the measure of the local costs of theBritish forces in Germany. It was suggested that, when the time came for us to assume the burden of these costs, it ought to be possibleto reduce the total below the estimated figure of  130 million. it seemed likely that the Germans had been placing an inflated valueon some of the services which they supplied to the OccupationForces. And there was surely some scope for further economy by theWar Office. On any basis, the present cost per man in Germanyseemed surprisingly high. Against this, it was pointed out that present costs included capital expenditure on married quarters andother requirements which would have been largely completed beforethe summer of 1953. Amenities for troops stationed abroad couldnot be cut below a certain point without serious effects uponrecruiting.The Prime Minister said that great care must be taken to avoid any public statement which might imply that we were likely to breakour pledges to N.A.T.O. by reducing our forces in Germany. Thiswould have the gravest possible effects on the whole structure of western defence and would shock public opinion in the United States.At the same time, it was essential that the minimum figure for the localcosts of the British forces in Germany should be firmly established,and that all unnecessary expenditure should be eliminated. A smaltCommittee should be appointed to examine these costs and to indicatemeans by which they might be reduced, say, to  70 million a year.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send a communication to the United States Government on the lines of the draft in Annex A of C. (52) 141.(2) Appointed a Committee (consisting of the Minister ofDefence, the Paymaster-General, the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and representatives of the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer) to examine in consultation with the Service Ministers the estimatedlocal costs of the British forces in Germany after June 1953and to report to the Cabinet on the implications of reducing them to a figure of  70 million a year.
93CC, 50 (52)^british broadcasting corporation.Renewal ofthe Charter.(previous reference:CC. (52) 47thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(C. (52) 143) covering a further redraft of the proposed White paper on Broadcasting.The Lord President said that paragraphs 6 to 10 and paragraph 18of the White Paper had been redrafted, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, in order to indicate that Parliament was not nowbeing asked to take a decision of principle in favour of sponsoredtelevision. The new draft stated merely that the Government didnot propose to ask Parliament to commit themselves to the continua-tion of the exclusive broadcasting rights of the B.B.C. and would leave the question of the licensing of private broadcasting of televisionto be determined by Parliament when the establishment of privatestations became practicable. This change would be unwelcome tosome Government supporters; but, in view of the probable criticisms of those who wished to maintain the Corporation^ monopoly, it seemed unlikely that Government supporters would actually vote against it. Paragraph 37 of the White Paper had also beenredrafted for a different purpose, viz., to exclude the obligation on thepart of the Corporation to consult the Government on wages andkindred matters.In discussion it was agreed that paragraph 7 of the draft white paper should be amended (i) by deleting the second sentence, whichmight be read to indicate that the question of licensing private broad-casting might be deferred for as long as the ten-year life of the newCharter; and (ii) by making it explicit that the Governmenfs intentionnot to ask Parliament to commit themselves to the continuation of the exclusive privilege of the Corporation related to television and not to sound broadcasting.Opinion in the Cabinet favoured the changes made in the white paper; but the Cabinet felt that before they reached a final conclusionit would be well that there should be further consultation with Govern-ment supporters who had shown interest in the problem.The Prime Minister said that he would wish the Home Secretaryto present the Governmenfs proposals in debate in the House ofCommons.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President, in association with the HomeSecretary and the Postmaster-General, to consult further with Government supporters on the policy towards broad-casting embodied in the draft White Paper annexed toC. (52) 143.(2) Agreed to reach a final decision in the light of these con-consultations on 13th May, with a view to the issue of theWhite Paper within a few days thereafter.Legislative 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterProgramme. of Health (C. (52) 139) suggesting a legislative programme designed(Previous to provide for the passage of the Transport Bill in the current session;Reference: and a memorandum by the Minister of Supply (C. (52) 149) drawingCC. (52) 46th attention to the consequences of postponing the Steel Bill until theConclusions,     next session.Minute 4.) jne Minister of Health said that the only practicable programmeTransport Bill, which would enable the Transport Bill to be passed in the current session was that set out under Alternative B of C. (52) 139. But that programme involved extending the Parliamentary sittings tooth  August in the summer and resuming sittings on 7th October. Ifthe programme were to be completed and the new session were tobe opened in the early days of February the bare minimum of time required for the Transport Bill could only be provided by reducing
Iron and steel bill.(Pthe summer recess to two months. Even so the House of Lords wouldhave barely time to examine the Bill, and it might be necessary toprovide more time in that House by taking the Lords&apos; amendments in the Commons after the Christmas recess and before prorogationearly in February.The Lord Privy Seal said that in his view it would be necessaryto ease the pressure on the House of Lords in this way.Attention was drawn to the disadvantages of resuming theautumn sittings before the Conservative Party Conference, whichwould open on 9th October, more especially if it should prove neces-sary for the time-table Motion on the Transport Bill to be discussed in the. House of Commons on that day, with the prospect of a veryprolonged sitting. It was therefore proposed that the autumn pro-gramme suggested in Alternative B in C. (52) 139 should be deferredthroughout for one week. If this were done, Parliament wouldreassemble on 13th or 14th October and it might be necessary notonly for the Lords&apos; Amendments on the Transport Bill to be deferred until after Christmas, but for themnal stages (i.e., Third Reading and perhaps Report Stage) of the Bill in that House to be postponed until after the Christmas recess. The House of Lords might sit inJanuary 1953 while the House of Commons remained in recess; thiswas a procedure for which a precedent existed. But in any event,deferment of the autumn resumption until 13th or 14th October might make it impracticable, without unreasonably shortening the Christmasbreak, to conclude the session in time for a new session to be opened in the first few days of February. The practicability of opening thenew session as late as 10th February, 1953, should therefore be examined.The Cabinet- (1) Gave.general approval to the legislative programme set outin Alternative B in C. (52) 139; but invited the Ministerof Health to examine the practicability of deferring theautumn resumption there proposed by one week and con-sequentially, in the light of their discussion, of opening the1953 session &quot;on or about 10th February.In the light of this conclusion, the Cabinet considered thepossibility of enacting the Iron and Steel Bill, for which the pro-gramme in C. (52) 139 made no provision. The Minister of Supplypointed out that its postponement to next session would involve serious consequences. The industry was virtually without leadership,since knowledge of the Government^ policy had deprived the Ironand Steel Corporation of its standing and authority, while the Ironand Steel Federation did not represent the present ownership of theindustry and was aware that many of its functions would ultimately be taken over by the proposed Iron and Steel Board. The result wasto throw on to the Government the responsibility for decisions which ought to be taken by the industry itself. It was moreover desirablethat the return of the industry to private enterprise should be com-pleted as long as possible before a further General Election.It was pointed out on the other hand that, whatever the time-table for the enactment of this Bill, a proportion of the industry was likely to remain in public ownership when the next General Electiontook place; and that the early enactment of the Bill would not ensurethat the ownership of the industry did not become an Election issue.It seemed, moreover, that unless the Bill could be examined by theHouse of Commons in Standing Committee, there was no possibilityof its being enacted in the current session. The risks offending a highly controversial measure to a Standing Committee, unless special arrangements could be made for the replacement of Committeemembers who might fall ill, were thought to be too great to be faced.It might be practicable to move the Second Reading of the Bill in the
95CC. 50 (52)House of Commons while the Transport Bill was being examined in the House of Lords; but little advantage would result from thisunless the Bill could be carried over into the next session. Therewas no precedent for carrying over a public Bill; and, indeed, therewas only one real precedent for any carry-over and that involved ahybrid Bill, to which special considerations applied.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to consider further, at a later meeting, the time-table for the introduction and enactment of the Iron and steel bill.Industrial 7.   The Minister of Labour drew attention to the risk of a break-Disputes,        down in the newspaper trade.   A dispute had arisen in DundeeThe Newspaper between certain trade unions and the firm of D. C. Thomson &amp; Co.,Industry.        Ltd., because of the insistence of that firm on employing only workers who would undertake that they were not, and would not become,members of a trade union.  The dispute was causing embarrassment to other firms in the newspaper trade, mainly because of the pressure which was being put upon them to withdraw services fromD. C. Thomson &amp; Co., Ltd.; and it was liable to spread.  While thex attitude of the firm was inconsistent with international conventionsgoverning the freedom of workers to form trade unions, the Govern-ment had no power to enforce a change in that attitude. The minister might, however, appoint a Court of Enquiry into the origins andcauses of the dispute; and the report of such an enquiry might havethe effect of mobilising opinion against the firm.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour;and invited him to keep them informed of the situation.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th May, 1952.
