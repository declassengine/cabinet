Fweign Affairs.       1.   the Foreign Secretary said that, on the previous day he had,(previous       w&apos;th the Prime Ministers concurrence, arranged for the Leader of the reference:      Opposition and Mr. Herbert Morrison, M.P., to see a selection of theC.C.(52)22nd   Foreign Office telegrams on which the Prime Minister had based his conclusions.   &quot; statements, in the Foreign Affairs debate on 26th February, regardingMinute ll)      the attitude of the previous Government towards retaliatory bombingagainst Chinese bases.   He had now learned that.another.member ofthe late Government had been given access, in his old Department, toa wider selection of documents bearing on this question.  In a matterof this kind independent action by a number of different Departmentsmight have embarrassing consequences; and he suggested that departments might now be instructed that &apos; former. ministers should not .be given access to documents&apos; of this kind without prior reference to the Secretary of the Cabinet who would, as required, consult the Prime Minister or other Ministers concerned.The Cabinet endorsed this suggestion, and took note that thePrime Minister would arrange for directions to be given accordingly.The Prime Minister said that there seemed to be some confusionin the press about the extent to which a Government in office hadaccess to the papers of an earlier Administration. There was a clear&apos; distinction between Cabinet papers, which were not made availableto members of a succeeding Administration of a different politicalcomplexion, and the executive documents, e.g., telegrams anddespatches, which must be available to Ministers in office for thepurpose of ensuring continuity in the conduct of public business. Hewas arranging for some guidance to be given to the press oh thisquestion; and in this he would take the opportunity of making it plain that his statements in the recent Foreign Affairs debate had been based on the facts contained in Foreign Office telegrams.RoyalCommissionon Income Tax.(previous reference:CC.

He was still con-sidering what arrangements could be made for completing the workof the Commission.british broadcasting corporation.Renewal ofthe Charter.(previous reference:CC. (52) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.) -economic affairs.(previous reference:CC. (52) 23rdConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that he and the Lord President hadon the previous evening attended a meeting of the 1922 Committeeand had stated the case in favour of maintaining the monopolyenjoyed by the British Broadcasting Corporation. They had stressed the argument that this was not an appropriate time at which to end the monopoly, and had thrown out the suggestion that the Chartermight be renewed for something less than the normal period of tenyears. They had found at the meeting a very strong body of opinion in favour of ending the monopoly, and there was little sign that theirarguments had influenced those who were present. At the end of themeeting, however, it had been agreed that further informal discussions should be held between the two Ministers and a smail delegationappointed by the Government supporters who were, specially interested in this question.The Cabinet took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.4. The Cabinet continued their discussion on the current economic situation, they agreed to conclude this discussion at afurther meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, SWA,: 29th February, 1952.
