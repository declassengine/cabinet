35CC. 40 (52)Egypt. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary (C. (52) 122) reporting that the Egyptian Foreign minister reference: had accepted a revised formula, in the terms set out in the memo-CC. (52) 37th randum, as a basis for resumed negotiations with the EgyptianConclusions,     Government.minute 6.) jne foreign Secretary said that the first paragraph of this formula was in the terms which had already been approved by theCabinet. The second paragraph was somewhat different from theearlier draft; but it implied that in the negotiations we should putforward our point of view regarding the defence of the Canal Zone,and it would thus enable us to press our view of the arrangements which should be made for the defence of the Middle East generally.The third paragraph, regarding the Sudan, represented a marked improvement; for it involved the Egyptian Government in full recog-nition of the right of the Sudanese people freely to decide their future status. If the revised formula were accepted, it would not be made public at this stage, though an agreed statement would doubtless beissued to the effect that negotiations were being resumed.The Cabinefs discussion turned on the wording of the second part of paragraph (ii) of the formula. The Prime Minister felt thatthe references to the arming of Egyptian forces, &quot; in order that Egyptmight fulfil her determined intention to defend &quot; the Canal Zone, were open to objections similar to those advanced in the Cabinefs dis-cussion on 4th April against the proposed unilateral declaration bythe United Kingdom, which had been similarly worded. It seemedto him that we ought not at the outset of negotiations, of which thepurpose was to achieve five-Power arrangements for the defence ofthe Middle East as a whole, to appear to accept the suggestion that egypt was to assume sole responsibility for the defence of the canal zone.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that this paragraph of theformula did not go beyond recognising the right of the two Govern-ments to discuss their respective points of view. He welcomed the reference to the arming of Egyptian forces, since the Egyptian army had always been the most co-operative element in the country and itwould be wise to invite their continued support. The paragraphmight, however, be amended by deleting the words &quot; in order that egypt may fulfil her determined intention to defend this area.&quot;The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to approve the text of theformula for resumption of negotiations with Egypt as set outin C. (52) 122, subject to the deletion of the words following&quot; Egyptian forces &quot; in paragraph (ii).Nationalised 2.   The Cabinet took note, with approval, of the terms of theindustries. reply which the Prime Minister proposed to make to a Question,which was to be put to him in the House of Commons that afternoonby Mr. Grimond, M.P., asking what progress he had made in hisinvestigations into the nationalised industries.China. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignClosure of       Secretary (C. (52) 107) reporting that the major -British firms operatingBritish Firms,   in China had decided to close down their operations in that countryand submitting the draft of a note to be presented to the ChineseGovernment by Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking.The Foreign Secretary said that these firms had now come tothe conclusion that, in view of the increasing restrictions placed on them by the Chinese Government and the arbitrary and unjust treat-ment of their representatives, they had no choice but to cut their losses and leave China. He could not question this conclusion; but42126-4 b 2
2cbThe Katyn 4.   The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the ForeignMassacre. Secretary (C. (52) 1.16 and 124) regarding a proposal that a Committeeof the House of Representatives of the United States Congress should carry out in Europe investigations into the Katyn Massacre.The Foreign Secretary said that this Congressional Committee had made the unusual suggestion that they should be allowed to carry outformal investigations and to take evidence in London. It was inappropriate-priate that such a body should purport to conduct a judicial enquiry on British soil. Even if the Committee contented themselves withtaking evidence privately from voluntary witnesses, it would not be proper for such evidence to be taken on oath; there would be nosanction against false evidence; and no privilege in respect of theEnglish law of defamation would attach to the proceedings. the taking of evidence in London, whether in public or in private, might give rise to public demonstrations and to attempted breaches of thepeace. He proposed to invite the attention of the Committee of Con-gress, through the United States Ambassador, to these difficulties andto suggest that they should adopt an alternative course of action which:-. they seemed to have in mind, viz., that they should take evidence inthe territory of the Federal German Republic, in which event private persons resident in the United Kingdom might attend to give evidenceif they chose to do so.The Cabinet endorsed these views, and discussion turned on thedraft of a note designed to bring them to the attention of the UnitedStates Ambassador, which was annexed to C. (52) 124. As the Com-mittee of Enquiry was independent of the United States Administra--tion, it was recognised that the views of Her Majesty&apos;s government might have to be conveyed to them in writing. But it was likely thatthe note would ultimately be brought to the notice of Congress; and,although it was desirable that the legal position should be stated inplain terms, the draft might with advantage be shortened and amended to avoid the suggestion, which might be read into paragraph 3 (iv) ofthe draft, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had doubts of their ability to prevent public disorder in this country.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to address a communica-tion to the United States Ambassador on the lines of thedraft note annexed to C. (52) 124; but invited him, in thelight of their discussion, to reconsider the detailed terms ofthe draft in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and theHome Secretary.Meat from 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterCanada. of Food (C. (52) 123) reporting that he had been asked whether wecould assist the Canadian Government in disposing of surpluses of beef and pork which they would have in 1952 in consequence of anthe withdrawal of these firms from China would involve the loss ofBritish property worth some  125 million and would be a serious blow to our world trading interests. Moreover, it was possible that seniorrepresentatives of these firms might be held as hostages in Chinauntil all Chinese demands on their firms had been met. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment must do everything possible to help the firms and hewould discuss with the Economic&apos; Policy Committee what further action might be taken to this end.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the decision of these British firms to close down their operations in China.(2) Approved the text of the draft note to the Chinese Govern-ment annexed to C. (52) 107.
Tea.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 39thConclusions,Minute 9.)&apos;6. The Cabinet approved the terms of a statement to be madelater in the day by the Minister of Food announcing the measuresrelating to tea rationing and tea prices which they had approved onthe previous day.War Pensions. 7.   The Cabinet approved the draft of a statement, which was&apos;to be made in the House of Commons that afternoon by the Ministerof Pensions, announcing details of the improvements in war pensionsrates which had been foreshadowed by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his Budget Statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th April, 1952.embargo on imports of meat, cattle and pigs into the United States,imposed because of foot-and-mouth disease in the Prairie provinces ofCanada. It was suggested that New Zealand and Australian meatintended for this country should be shipped to the United States andthat we should take the Canadian meat in replacement. The meatwould come to us from Eastern Canada, where there was no foot-and-mouth disease, and the Minister of Agriculture was satisfied that noobjection need be raised on veterinary grounds.The details of the scheme had not been worked out, and theGovernments of Australia and New Zealand had not been consulted.But it was clear that the suggestion would have some advantages forus. We should gain some dollars, and the Canadian beef was of betterquality than that from the Southern Dominions. On the other hand there was some risk that Australia and New Zealand might, as a resultof this operation, establish a market in the United States to the detriment of our long-term supplies, though in view of the lowerquality of their meat this was not a serious danger. We should haveto take great care, in view of the great efforts which Australia andNew Zealand had made to increase shipments to us, to avoid creatingany impression in Australia and New Zealand that their meat was notimportant to us.The Cabinet were disposed to accept the Canadian suggestion.Opportunities seldom arose for giving economic assistance to canada and we should seize this one if on further examination it was foundto be practicable.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Food to examine sympathetically, inconsultation with Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the transaction in meat described in C. (52) 123.
