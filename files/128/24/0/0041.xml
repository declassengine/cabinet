2tf41CC. 41 (52)Parliament. 1.   The Minister of Health said that it was now clear that theBusiness in the Labour Opposition in the House of Commons intended deliberatelyHpuseof to obstruct the conduct of Government business. He thereforeCommons. proposed that, immediately after the Easter Recess, a motion shouldbe brought forward applying a compulsory time-table to theCommittee and Report Stages of the National Health Service bill and the Finance Bill. There was a precedent for applying such a motion to more than one Bill; and, although he found this proceduredistasteful, he thought it was justified by the tactics adopted by theLabour Opposition. He also thought it justifiable that the Govern-ment should themselves determine the timetable, instead of appointing a Business Committee to do this in accordance with thenew procedure introduced by the previous Government; for thepresent Government, when in opposition, had criticised the introducTtion of that new procedure, and in present circumstances there wasno prospect that an early and satisfactory agreement on a time-tablewould be reached between the two Parties in a Business Committee.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals made by the Minister pf Health. The Chancellor of the exchequer said that he would have liked to have been able to make a publicoffer to try to reach agreement with the Labour Opposition on atime-table for the remaining stages of the Finance Bill. It waspointed out, however, that the time-table, if it was to be effective,must be fairly detailed and the details would have to be set out in the motion. If, as was desired, the motion had to be discussed on thesecond day after Parliament reassembled, there would be no opportunity to make a public offer to discuss the details with theOpposition. Nor was it thought likely that such an offer would beaccepted, even if it were made. In these circumstances the Chancellorof the Exchequer could only make a private offer of informalconsultation with Opposition Leaders before the details of thetime-table were announced.In further discussion the suggestion was made that, in presentingto the public the need for these special measures, it should be made clear that the Opposition were seeking tp obstruct Government actionwhich was urgently required to enable the country to avert a crisis in our balance of payments. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited to take special steps to explain this to the Press.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Minister ofHealth for applying a compulsory time-table to theremaining stages of the National Health Service Bill andthe Finance Bill.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should settle at anearly date their plans for the remainder of the current session. Itwas desirable that both a Transport Bill and an Iron and Steel BUIshould be passed in the first session of the present Parliament. Ifthe Transport BiU could not be prepared in time, Parliament shouldenact in this first session the Iron and Steel Bill and a stand-stillmeasure for Transport. He himself deplored the recent practice of continuing a session after the Summer Recess and opening the new session in the autumn with only a few days&apos; interval between the endof one session and the beginning of the next. He would prefer tocontinue the current session until the middle of December, thusgiving an opportunity for the enactment of both the major Bills towhich he had referred, and to open the new session in February.He did not desire to embark on a heavy legislative programme in theyear of Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a small ministerial committee to review the arrangements for completing
Government business, in both. Houses, during the current session; and to prepare, for consideration by the Cabinet,programmes on the alternative hypotheses of passingbefore the end of the session either (i) an Iron and steel bill and a Transport Bill; or (ii) an Iron and Steel bill and any stand-still measure which might be required for transport.Iron and SteelIndustry.Draft Iron andSteel Bill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (C. (52) 108) covering a revised draft of the Ironand Steel Bill.The Minister of Health recalled that on 20th March the cabinet had approved this Bill in principle and had invited Ministers to convey to him any comments or suggestions which they might wish to make on its terms.   The draft annexed to C. (52) 108 took account of the-comments received.In discussion the point was made that this Bill should not beintroduced far in advance of the date on which its Second Readingwas to be debated in the House of Commons. The Cabinet neednot therefore finally authorise its introduction until they had considered what arrangements were to be made for completingGovernment business during the remainder of the current session(see Minute 1 above).The Cabinet Took note of the revised draft of the Iron and Steel Billannexed to C. (52) 108.3.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda bythe Lord President:  C. (52) 110: seeking approval for the policy in relation to road haulage worked out by the Road and Rail transport committee and other Ministers, and for the issue of a white paper explaining that policy in the terms of the draft annexed to the memorandum; andC. (52) 121: recommending, on behalf of the same group of Ministers, that there should be an independent enquiry intothe working of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, and that in themeantime there should be no formal standstill in theadministration of that Act.Road Haulage The Lord President said that since the Cabinefs discussion on and Railway - 3rd April the Road and Rail Transport Committee, together withReorganisation, the other Ministers who had been assisting in its work, had reviewed the policy set out in his earlier memorandum (C. (52) 83) and had reached a unanimous recommendation in favour of that policy, savethat they did not now propose to impose a levy on long-distance road passenger transport. There was now no difference of opinion in theCommittee over the proposal to impose a levy on road goodstransport. It would take some little time to prepare a Bill to giveeffect to the whole of the proposals, which included the disposal to private enterprise of the road haulage undertaking of the british transport Commission, the abolition of the 25-mile limit, theimposition of a levy on road haulage to assist the railways and there organisation of the rail services of the Commission. His committee thought it desirable, therefore, that a full statement of the Govern-ment s policy should be made in a White Paper, which should no.doubt form the subject of an early debate in the House of Commons.Road and rail transport.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)
43CC. 41 (52)O The Cabinet-(1) Approved the policy for road haulage and for reorganisation of the railways set out in C. (52) 110.(2) Approved in principle the draft White Paper annexed toC. (52) 110.(3) Agreed to examine the draft in detail at their first meetingafter the Recess, with a view to its issue in the second weekafter the reassembly of Parliament.The Lord President said that the Committee on Road and rail transport had examined the problems which had recently arisen inthe operation of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, including the possibilityof some interim standstill arrangements pending amendment of theAct. The Act had been designed to regulate competition between road and raik and until recent times had not been the object of much criticism. In view of recent difficulties, however, it seemed desirablethat an independent enquiry should be held into the working of theAct. Evidence should be taken from all the interests which might beaffected by any change in the law, and the most important questionwhich would arise would be the extent to which the railways shouldcontinue to be protected against competition from road passenger services. But the Act did not only protect the railways; it provided a necessary regulation of competition between road transport under-takings, the abolition of which would not only expose existingoperators to cut-throat competition but would also result in the suspension of public services on the less remunerative routes. TheMinisters who had examined the matter were unanimously of opinionthat it would not be practicable to amend the operation of the licensing system or to impose any standstill until new principles hadbeen worked out to govern the issue of licences.The Cabinet felt that to continue the existing administration ofthe Act of 1930 during the period of some months which would berequired for an independent enquiry would give rise to justifiable and damaging criticism in individual cases. Further examination of theproblem might show that this could not be avoided; but it would bedesirable for Ministers to have time to study the matter further andto attempt to formulate new principles to govern the issue of licences and competition between rail and road which could be brought intooperation more speedily.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Committee on Rail and Road Transport toconsider the possibility of modifying, the operation of theRoad Traffic Act, 1930, more speedily than would bepossible under the procedure suggested in C. (52) 121.Rail Transport.       4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the alterations in   Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and PowerRailway Fares, and the Minister of Transport (C. (52) 125) reporting on the adjust-ments in railway fares which were to come into operation on 1st Mayunder the Charges Scheme recently confirmed by the transport tribunal.The Cabinet felt that the details of this scheme would be severely criticised, and they asked whether some arrangement could not bemade to defer the introduction of the scheme until its effects couldbe more fully examined.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theMinister of Transport and the Attorney-General, to considerwhether the introduction of the Charges Scheme could be deferred and to report to them later in the day.Road PassengerLicensing.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th April, 1952.
