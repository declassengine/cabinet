parm Price 1.   The Cabinet were informed that the negotiations on farmReview. prices were not making satisfactory progress.   An addition of  46i(Previous        million had so far been offered on behalf of the Government, and reference:      the farmers had reduced their demand from  66 million to  61 million.C.C. (52) 34th   This was too large a gap to be bridged by negotiation; and the far-Conclusions,    mers were also insisting that the downward trend in production couldMinute 5.)       not be reversed without a substantial addition to farm incomes overand above what was necessary for recoupment of increased costs.They were pressing, in particular, for additions to milk and egg pricesnearly double the increase in costs of production.  It was clear thatthere was no prospect of reaching an agreement at the figure whichthe Cabinet had previously approved.  To settle prices without theagreement of the farmers would be a serious matter for both the far-mers and the Government, especially as it would render impracticableany effective drive for increased farming efficiency.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was arguable that it would be worth while incurringincreased internal sterling expenditure if home food production couldthereby be increased and corresponding savings made in expenditureon foreign exchange. On that basis a total addition of  54 million gross might be justified.(b) The increases in milk and egg prices should in any event beless than those proposed by the farmers, so that meat productionmight be made relatively more attractive.(c) It would be possible to reduce the direct additions to farm prices by deferring an adjustment which was due to add  14 million to the cost of feedingstuffs to farmers, but this would be no more thana paper transaction and would not avoid the need to increase food prices. Although this might help the smaller farmer, it would on balance be undesirable to hold down the price of feedingstuffs artifici-ally in this way.(d) It was suggested that, if farm incomes were increased abovethe level which the Cabinet had previously contemplated, no corres-ponding increases should be made in retail food prices. But such increases could only be avoided, if the cost of food subsidies were notto rise beyond the figure laid down in the Budget, by some arrange-ment which would assist farm incomes from a source not reckoned as part of the food subsidies. It might be possible to do this by treat-ing the fertiliser subsidy as falling outside the total of the food sub-subsidies, justifying this course by the analogy of the old time subsidy,which had been regarded as a capital investment increasing the long-term fertility of the land.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Ministers responsible for Agriculture and food to discuss the position with the farmers&apos; representatives on the following day.(2) Agreed to resume their Consideration of the matter at their next meeting.2. The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had put onthe Order Paper no less than 59 new Clauses for the Army and AirForce Annual Bill. This suggested that they intended to embark on measures to obstruct the passage of Government business throughthe House of Commons.The Prime Minister suggested that the Government should beready to introduce guillotine procedure if necessary. He suggestedthat the Minister of Health should examine the precedents for this and the variants of it which had been used in the past.42125-3 B 2Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.
Tangier. 3.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that He^Majesty&apos;s Consul-General in Tangier had asked that British forces from Gibraltar should be made available to assist in maintainingorder there. The recent rioting appeared to have been suppressed,but it was possible that disorder might be renewed. We were partiesto the Convention which had set up the International Zone of Tan-gier and there were some 1,600 British subjects resident in the Zone.We might therefore find ourselves obliged to accept some responsi-bility for maintaining order and protecting British subjects. Never-theless, the Foreign Secretary had informed the Consul-General thathe would be most reluctant to agree to the use of British forces inTangier. He hoped that it would not prove necessary for him to doso, but he might have to reconsider the matter if the situation becameworse.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Counsellors of 4.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he proposed toState. advise the Queen that the Regency Act, 1937, should be amended so(Previous as to1 include Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, among the per-Reference: sons qualified for appointment as Counsellors of State.   He had .C. (51) 16th ascertained informally that this change would be acceptable to HerConclusions, Majesty.Minute 4.) The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Eritrea. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (52) 91) proposing that additional powers shouldbe conferred on the Chief Administrator of Eritrea for the suppression of brigands known as shifta. Their activities had recently beenrenewed, and it was important that they should be brought to an endbefore the date, in September 1952, when Eritrea was to be federatedwith Ethiopia in accordance with a resolution of the United Nations.If order had not been restored by then, federation would not be practicable and we should be unable to rid ourselves of our responsi-bilities in this area. The Foreign Secretary therefore recommendedthat the powers of the Chief Administrator should be extended toenable him (i) to destroy temporary shelters outside villages wheneverhe was satisfied that they had been or were being used for unlawfulpurposes; and (ii) to make it an offence to withhold information andto extend the traditional system of collective fines to such offences.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to confer on the ChiefAdministrator of Eritrea the additional powers proposed inC. (52) 91.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 93) outlining the instructions which he proposed togive to his representative at the forthcoming discussions in Washing-ton with representatives of the United States and French Governmentsregarding the scale of the economic assistance to be given to Yugo-slavia in 1952-53.The Foreign Secretary said that the three courses open to us were set out in paragraph 7 of his memorandum. He himself favoured the compromise course of offering a United Kingdom contribution of 4 million or, if necessary,  4^.million. He proposed that, if such afurther loan were made, we should press the Yugoslavs to facilitateYugoslavia.Economic Aid.
5CC. 35 (52)the delivery of goods, e.g.,. maize, which we wished to obtain from them. If agreement could not be reached on this basis he would report again to the Cabinet before the tripartite negotiations werebroken off.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he concurred in theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposal.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal made in paragraph 11 of C. (52) 93.european defence community.(previous reference:CC. (52) 18thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 92) on the relationship of the United Kingdom withthe European Defence Community.The Minister of Defence said that, before the Cabinet took final decisions on the proposals in this memorandum, he would like to havean opportunity of discussing their military implications with theChiefs of Staff.The Cabinet Agreed to defer their considerationuntil their meeting on 3rd April.of this memorandum&quot; World PeaceMovement.&quot;Attendance of foreigners at meetings heldin the UnitedKingdom.8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (52) 85) outlining the principles which he proposed toapply in regulating the admission to the United Kingdom of foreignerswishing to attend meetings held in this country under the auspices ofthe so-called &quot; World Peace Movement.&quot;The Home Secretary said that the policy outlined in this memo-randum had been worked out in consultation with the foreign secretary. He proposed to refuse admission to all foreigners,regardless of their individual merits, who were coming here to attend meetings which had as their primary aim the furtherance of the&quot; World Peace Movement&quot; or could otherwise be regarded asinstruments of Soviet policy. He did not, however, propose to exclude foreign Communists or fellow-travellers wishing to attend meetings organised by genuinely British institutions, including theBritish Communist Party, unless the applicant was individuallyobjectionable.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The following points were, however, raised:  (a) Some doubts were expressed about the description of theBritish Communist Party as a &quot; recognised political Party.&quot; It wasthe general view that a more acceptable description would be a&quot; tolerated political Party.&quot;(b) The question was raised whether, under the policy outlined inC. (52) 85, an unlimited number of foreign Communists would beadmitted to this country for the purpose of attending a meetingorganised by the British Communist Party. The Home Secretaryexplained that, if a relatively small number of foreign Communistssought permission to enter this country for the purpose of attendingsuch a meeting, their presence would not alter the essentially Britishcharacter of the meeting and, unless they were personally objection-able, he would be ready to admit them for this purpose. If, however,the number of foreigners seeking permission to attend a particularmeeting was so large that the meeting would assume the character ofan international gathering, he would.then have to consider, in con-sultation with the Foreign Secretary, whether the foreign visitors
should be prevented from attending the meeting in accordance witfthe principle laid down in the first part of his memorandum.The Cabinet-Approved the policy outlined in C. (52) 85, subject to thepoints noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.Atomic Energy. 9. The Home Secretary said that two London newspapers hadSecurity of that morning published a report that secret papers from the AtomicDocuments. Energy Establishment at Harwell had been picked up in a NorthLondon street on the previous, evening. He had ascertained thatthere was no truth in this report, which was an All-Fools&apos; Day hoax.He proposed to make a statement to that effect in answer to a private notice Question in the House of Commons that afternoon.Egypt and theSudan.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 29thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 98) reporting the stage which had been reached in the attempt to resume negotiations with the Egyptian Governmenton defence and the Sudan.The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian elections had been postponed and the Government had come some way to meet theconditions which we had prescribed for the resumption of negotia-tions. There were now some indications that the Egyptians were anxious to find a basis for a settlement, and H.M. ambassador had suggested that me might return to London for consultations.The Foreign Secretary did not wish him to return unless there wasa reasonable prospect that negotiations would be opened in thenear future. The memorandum which had been circulated to theCabinet set out a formula which, subject to some doubt about the concluding phrase in paragraph 1, the Egyptians were now preparedto accept as a basis for the resumption of negotiations.The Cabinefs discussion turned largely on the proposal, inparagraph 2 of C. (52) 98, that this formula should be accompaniedby a statement, which we should place on record either in a letteror in the minutes of the first meeting, that it was our understandingthat, as regards defence, the negotiations would be resumed on thebasis that &quot; the Egyptian Government were now prepared to acceptthe military consequences involved in their determined intention todefend the Canal Zone and thus to play their part in the defence of theMiddle East.&quot; The Minister of Defence thought that the wording ofthis paragraph was not sufficiently precise to commit the Egyptiansto full participation in an Allied Middle East Command. the egyptians might take it to mean that, if they undertook themselvesto defend the Canal Zone, this would relieve them of all responsibilityfor playing any further part in an Allied scheme for the defence ofthe Middle East. He therefore proposed that a further sentence should be added to make it clear that this commitment would involveactive association with their Allies in the defence of the Middle Eastand the provision of the necessary facilities in Egypt. The foreign secretary said that he was prepared to delete the word &quot; thus &quot;from the formula in paragraph 2 of C. (52) 98: this would go some little way to meet the view put forward by the Minister ofDefence: but he had grave doubts whether the Egyptians would be willing to accept the additional words which the Minister had suggested. The Prime Minister said that he would himself prefer that no statement on the lines of this paragraph should be placedon record at the outset of the negotiations; but the Foreign Secretaryexplained that the purpose of doing so was to draw the Egyptiansinto some form of commitment to associate themselves with a middle east Command on the lines of the Four-Power proposals.
7CC. 35 (52)In further discussion the Prime Minister expressed his reluctance to accept any agreement which involved withdrawing British troops from Egypt until the security of the Suez Canal and the British basewas assured by the establishment of an international system backed by sufficient force. The Foreign Secretary, on the other hand, saidthat under the Four-Power proposals for an Allied Middle east command, which was the only international system which had sofar been suggested, none of the other Powers concerned would stationforces on Egyptian territory in time of peace; and he was satisfiedthat no Egyptian Government would conclude an agreement which provided for land forces of the United Kingdom or any other foreign power to be stationed in Egypt in peace. The Allied Middle east command was no more than a command structure which, in peace,would be backed in the main by Egyptian land forces and British airforces and base technicians; but this, in his view, would afford asubstantial safeguard, since the Egyptians were most unlikely toencroach upon base installations which were maintained under thecontrol of an Allied Command.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on economic groundsit was undesirable to risk any open breach with the Egyptian Govern-ment at the present time. Egypt&apos;s financial position was now soprecarious that it wOuld shortly become necessary -to make some new arrangement to make further sterling resources available to her.The Cabinet Agreed to-resume their discussion of C. (52) 98 at their next meeting on 3rd April.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st April, 1952.
