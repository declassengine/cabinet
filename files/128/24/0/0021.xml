Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.british broadcasting corporation.Renewal ofthe Charter.(previous reference:C.C.(51)9thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to.be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.In the debate on Foreign Affairs on 26th February, the Govern-ment spokesmen would be the Prime Minister, the Minister of housing and Local Government and the Minister of State.The Cabinet agreed that the Defence Debate, on 28th February,should be taken on a motion inviting the House to approve theDefence White Paper.2. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet Committee whichhad been considering the terms of a new Charter for the british broadcasting Corporation were disposed to recommend that thebalance of argument lay in favour of maintaining the Corporation^monopoly, at any rate for the period of the new Charter. Meanwhile,however, it was becoming clear that among Government supporters inthe House of Commons there was a substantial body of opinion infavour of ending the Corporation^ monopoly. The Cabinet might therefore wish to take an early opportunity of reviewing the position.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate a memorandum onthe question of maintaining the monopoly enjoyed by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation, and agreed to consider this at a meeting on 27th February.industrial building.John DeereProject at East Kilbride.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 16thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 29) relatingto the John Deere project. They also had before them a note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (C. (52) 38) covering a copy of a minuteto the Prime Minister from the President of the Board of Trade givingexamples of important investment projects which were in jeopardybecause of the shortage of steel for building.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it was now thoughtthat the quantity of steel needed for building the factory, which had previously been put at 2,000 tons, might be reduced to 1,450 tons.The firm said that they had already spent the equivalent of  200,000 in dollars on preparations for the project and had now to decide whether to spend a further sum equivalent to  100,000. Abandonment of the project would be strongly challenged in Scotland, where there wasa widespread feeling that Scottish industry was receiving an inadequate share of rearmament orders.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was reluctantlycompelled to maintain his view that no firm starting-date should begiven for the erection of this factory. In authorising industrial investment projects he was limited to a total figure of  24 million andby the steel allocation which could be made available for thoseprojects. As a result he had had to refuse to sanction many importantprojects, some of which were of importance to whole sectors ofindustry; and at the present time the total of projects for whichauthority had been given was such that, if the John Deere scheme were to go forward, he would be obliged to stop progress on someother works where building had actually started. He could not justifygiving a starting-date to the John Deere project while refusing consent to more important schemes; and other North American firms who desired to undertake similar developments would be critical of anyspecial treatment accorded to this firm.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Prime Minister thought it important to avoid unduerigidity in the application of investment controls. In view of thesmall amount of steel involved, the extent of our commitment to; the firm, the depth of Scottish feeling on the question, and the importance.
of attracting United States investment to the United Kingdom, he had hoped that a special exception might be made in this case, perhaps byexceeding by a small margin the total amount of the steel allocated to investment.(b) It was pointed out that steel had already been allocated to a level exceeding by 5 per cent, the supplies expected to be available;and that some of the other claimants for steel, including competitorsof the John Deere Company, would be able to use any further steelmade available to them for the immediate manufacture of goods forexport.(c) The present project only represented a partial United Statesinvestment, since the factory was to be built by the United KingdomGovernment and leased to the American company. The President ofthe Board of Trade said that if the company could be persuaded to finance the building of the factory themselves, he would withdraw hisobjection to finding the steel required for it.The Cabinet  -(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to endeavour toarrange for the John Deere Plow Company to finance thebuilding of the factory; and, if he was able to do so, togrant an early startihg-date for its erection.(2) Agreed to consider the matter further if the John DeereCompany were unwilling to enter into an arrangement ofthis kind.Cabinet Office, SWA,list February, 1952.
