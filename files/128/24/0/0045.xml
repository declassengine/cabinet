Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 37thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and the Minister of Food (C. (52) 129) reporting that agreement had been reached with the farmers&apos; representatives on a schedule of subsidies and prices, subject to one outstanding point.The Minister of Agriculture said that this point, arose from a genuine misunderstanding about the price to be charged for beet pulpresold to farmers for feeding to cattle. It was part of the general settlement with the farmers&apos; representatives that the prices of feeding-stuffs generally should be held at their present levels until March 1953.The farmers&apos; leaders had thought that this stabilisation would includethe price of beet pulp, although specific warning had previously beengiven to the farmers that this price was to be raised from  17 12s. 6d.per ton to  19 16s. per ton for the 1952-53 season. This point hadnot been in his mind when he had discussed the settlement with hiscolleagues and their attention had therefore not been drawn to it.But Sir James Turner, who had led the negotiations for the farmers,had assumed, and had informed his Council, that the decision to stabilise the prices of feedings-stuffs generally included stabilisation of the price of beet pulp; and the Government were likely to becharged with a breach of faith if the previous price were not main-tained for the coming season.The Minister of Food said that he and the Minister of Agricultureagreed that on the merits there was no reason for continuing to sellbeet pulp at the old price; even the new proposed price would be relatively favourable. The amount at stake ( 600,000) was relatively small. But the price settlement as a whole would involve substantial increases in retail food prices and he himself considered that it wouldbe undesirable to include in the settlement any feature which couldnot be justified on its merits. Withdrawal of the proposed increasein the price of beet pulp would lay the Government open to damagingcriticism of unduly favourable treatment of the farmers, which mightreflect on the settlement as a whole.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned mainly on the extent to whichthe general, agreement to maintain current prices of feeding-stuffsshould be regarded as an agreement to maintain the price previouslyin force or as permitting an increase which, although not actuallymade, had been notified in contract invitations sent out to the farmersby the British Sugar Corporation. The Cabinet felt that, while thematter was arguable, it was understandable that an expectation shouldhave arisen that the old price would be continued. The general settle-ment which had been reached subject to this point included a promiseon the part of the farmers&apos; representatives to put the whole weightof their organisations behind a drive for increased production, particu-larly of meat, and for improved efficiency. It was of great importance that this co-operation should be secured; and the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that it would be inexpedient to place this injeopardy, or to cause further delay in announcing the farm priceagreement, by proceeding further with the proposal to adjust beetpulp prices for the coming season.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of food to arrange for the price of beet pulp to be maintained at 17 12s. 6d. per ton until March 1953.Education.Age limit for GejaeralCertificateExamination.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Education (C. (42) 127) proposing amendment of the regulations which now prevented candidates under sixteen years of age from taking the examination for the General Certificate of Education.The Minister of Education recalled that this restriction had been widely criticised, and that during the General Election the Conserva-tive Party had undertaken to review it if returned to office.

Road and rail transport.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 44thConclusions.)Draft white paper onTransportPolicy.J5.The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C. (52) 131) covering a revised proof of the draft White Paper on transport Policy.The Cabinet first considered whether the White Paper should be presented in advance of the debate on transport questions which wasto be held in the House of Commons on 28th April. The mainargument in favour of that course, as the Cabinet had recognised intheir discussion on the previous day, was that the publication of theWhite Paper would divert attention from the recent controversiesover passenger fares and would direct the debate to the more general problem of competition between road and rail transport. On theother hand, there were risks in publishing these far-reaching proposalswithout prior consultation with the British Transport Commission;and the Government might be embarrassed if their proposals werecriticised, directly or indirectly, by the Commission. The point wasalso made that the White Paper tended to emphasise the difficultieswhich the railways had in competing effectively with road transport;and it was inconvenient that the Government should have to invitepublic attention to this at a time when there was already controversyabout the level of railway fares. Finally, the House of Commonsmight well object to being asked to discuss the important problems raised by the White Paper within so short a time after its publication.In the light of this further discussion the Cabinet agreed thatthe balance of advantage lay in favour of postponing the publicationof the White Paper until after the forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Transport to consult the British Transport Commission, in confidence, on theproposals outlined in the draft White Paper annexed toC. (52) 131, and to report to them as soon as possiblethe.results of those consultations.Passenger In view of the decision recorded above, the debate in the HouseFares. of Commons on 28th April would centre on increased passenger fares.The Cabinet proceeded to consider what line the Government spokes-men should take in the debate.Secondary School Examinations Council had now recommended that,while the general principle of an age-limit of sixteen should beretained, Heads of schools should be given a discretion to enter pupilsunder that age for the examination if they were convinced that theywere up to the standard required and that it was educationally soundfor them to sit the examination. The Minister proposed to accept this recommendation and to amend the Regulations accordingly.In discussion there was general agreement that, in announcingthis change, the Minister should place the main emphasis upon herdecision to remove the excessive rigidity of the existing regulations and upon the discretion which Heads of schools would have in future to enter younger pupils for the examination if they thought itjustifiable to do so.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (52) 127; and invited theMinister of Education, in announcing her decision, to stress the discretion which would in future be entrusted to Headsof schools.
63CC. 45 (52)In discussion it was suggested that the Government should state their determination (i) to prevent the introduction of disproportionateincreases, outside the London area, in season tickets, workmen&apos;s fares and concession rates for special classes of passenger; and (ii) to findmeans of affording corresponding relief in respect of the increasedfares which had already been brought into operation within theLondon area. In discussion of this suggestion the following points were made:  (a) The cost of removing these anomalies was estimated at 2^ million a year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recognised that some concessions must be made, but he had hopedthat these might be limited to changes costing not more than  .1 million a year. This was a figure which might fall within the margin of errorof the Commission^ calculations of their future revenue and. expendi-ture. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that the concessions could not be determined by reference only to a globalsum; policy must be related rather to the nature of the chargesimposed, and the public would recognise the justice of a plan fordispensing with disproportionate increases in the so-called sub-standard fares.(b) This plan had the further advantage that it was in the adjust-ment of these sub-standard fares and of bus stages in the london area that the Transport Commission had exercised a discretion, within limits prescribed by the Transport Tribunal. It was clearly within thepower of the Minister of Transport to give directions to the Commis-sion on matters in respect of which they had exercised a discretion.It would, however, be more difficult for the Government to intervenefor the purpose of modifying arrangements flowing directly fromdecisions of the Transport Tribunal.(c) It would not be easy to apply to the fares already in operationwithin the London area the principle of avoiding any disproportionateincreases in fares for workmen and other special classes of passenger.In London this was greatly complicated by the inter-relation of busand railway fares. It was unlikely that a solution of the Londonproblem could be reached without the full co-operation of theTransport Commission. The Cabinet agreed, however, that the prin-ciple of avoiding disproportionate increases in the so-called sub-standard fares must be applied within the London area as well asoutside it, and that, if the Transport Commission were reluctant toapply this principle in London, the Government must be prepared in the last resort to give them formal directions to do so.(d) There was general agreement that the forthcoming debate inthe House of Commons should be held on the basis of a government motion. This might take the form of inviting the House to approve the action taken by the Minister of Transport to suspend the intro-duction outside the London area of new railway charges which wouldhave increased disproportionately the cost of season tickets, work-men&apos;s fares, and concessionary rates for special classes of passenger;to uphold the decision that these disproportionate increases shouldnot be applied to railway charges outside the London area; and toagree that means should be sought of applying the same principle,as far as practicable, to the rail and bus fares already introducedwithin the London area.The Cabinet -(2) Agreed that the Government spokesmen in the debate inthe House of Commons on 28th April should put forward a policy on the general lines indicated above; and invited the Minister of Health to consider, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, whether the Government motion on which the debate would be held could follow thegeneral lines indicated in paragraph (d) above.
BcchuanalandProtectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference:CC. (52) 34thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that hithad received the deputation from the Bamangwato Tribe. In thecourse of a long interview they had raised no new point. They hadslurred over the happenings at the first kgotla, which they said hadnot rejected Seretse, though it had rejected his wife, and they had stressed the importance of the later kgotla, which had favoured theacceptance of both. They had complained that the previous Govern-ment had paid insufficient attention to this second kgotla, and theyhad pressed their opposition to the decision of the present Govern-ment to make permanent the exclusion of Seretse from the Chieftain-ship. The deputation had little claim to be regarded as representativeof the Tribe. Nothing that they had said would justify reconsideration of the Cabinefs previous decisions. The Commonwealth secretary would therefore receive them again, would answer the points of detailwhich they had made and would inform them that the Governmentcould not modify their previous conclusions. Both Houses of Parlia-ment should then be informed that the deputation had been received and that a reply in this sense had been given to their representations.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Common-wealth Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th April 1952.
