last-west trade.Exports to china and theSoviet Union.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The President of the Board of Trade said that publicity hadbeen given to a message sent.by Lord Boyd Orr, who was attending the Economic Conference in Moscow, suggesting that arrangements could be made for a substantial export of textiles from this countryto China if experts were at once sent out to negotiate with Chineserepresentatives in Moscow. The President proposed to reply that theUnited Kingdom were ready to develop trade with China in these and other commodities, and that the necessary arrangements couldbe made through British merchants in Hong Kong and Shanghai.Alternatively, if the Chinese so desired, the United Kingdom Govern-ment would be ready to discuss through their representative in Pekingwhat other arrangements could be made. He proposed in the samereply to deal with suggestions that further trade might be developedwith the Soviet Union.The text of the proposed reply was read to the Cabinet,alterations were suggested and approved.SomeThe Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a reply to be sentto Lord Boyd Orr, through Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in moscow, in the terms approved by the Cabinet.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Easter Recess.national insurance.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinefs decisions of 4thApril regarding the rates of family allowances and insurance benefitswere to be announced by the Minister of National Insurance in theHouse of Commons that afternoon. The draft of the proposed announcement was read to the Cabinet. If the point were raised inSupplementary Questions, the Minister would make it clear that theGovernment had no intention of increasing the minimum age of eligi-bility for retirement pensions.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the terms of the announcementregarding the increased rates of family allowances and insurance benefits.Kashmir. 4.   The Commonwealth Secretary reported to the Cabinet the(Previous        developments in the Kashmir dispute which had taken place sinceReference:      they had last discussed it on 25th January.

Since then no substantial change had taken place. Dr. Graham, the United NationsRepresentative, had visited India and Pakistan but had recentlyreturned without having obtained any agreement on the numbers oftroops to be. maintained in Kashmir by the two Governments.  his departure had provoked some outburst of feeling in Pakistan, but thesituation there was now more quiet, though the Government might still find it difficult to control extremist opinion. Both the Common-wealth Secretary and the United States Government were agreed that42126-3 B 2
28 Jtlevery effort should continue to be made to bring the two parties&quot;&quot;together and to avoid reference of the dispute to the Security Council.There were some signs of a lessening of rigidity on both sides and itwas unfortunate that Dr. Graham had transferred his activities to new York, where he was holding discussions with the representa-tives of India and Pakistan at the United Nations.  We should have        ^to allow him to handle the matter in his own way, but should con-        wtinue to aim at securing a resumption of negotiations between theparties without the submission of any report to the Security council at this stage. Such a report would be likely to exacerbate feelings in both India and Pakistan.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.Meeting of 5.   The Home Secretary said that about fourteen foreigners were british likely to seek admission to this country for the purpose of attendingCommunist the 22nd National Congress of the British Communist Party.

This presented him with Some administrativeConclusions,    difficulty; for. four who needed visas and had already applied for minute 8.) &apos;    them were not personally objectionable, and he found it difficult tosee what criterion he could apply in admitting only two or three ofthe remainder who, needing no visas, would arrive without furtherwarning in this country.  The general policy which he had been fol-lowing had met with fairly widespread support; but public criticismwas likely to be aroused if, without any logical basis of discrimina-tion, about half of the foreigners seeking to attend a meeting of thiskind were turned back on arrival in this country.In discussion there was some support for the Foreign Secretary&apos;view that it was unnecessary to allow as many as fourteen foreigndelegates to attend this meeting. There was likely to be some public criticism if any of them was refused admission, and this was not likelyto be much greater if as many as half a dozen were excluded. TheHome Secretary said that he would find it easier to defend a decision that not more than one foreign delegate from any particular country should be admitted. This would mean that about nine foreign dele-gates would be admitted for the meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to do his utmost to ensure that not more than about nine foreign delegates were admitted to this country for the purpose of attending the forthcomingCongress of the British Communist Party.the coronation.(previous reference:CC. (52) 20thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Date.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (52) 102) reviewing the main considerations to be takeninto account in determining the date of the Coronation. These seemedto point to the conclusion that Her Majesty should be advised to choose a date in the period between 29th May and 6th June.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some people might think it unpropitious to hold the coronation on a Friday.(h) Wednesday, 3rd June, being Derby Day, would be aninappropriate choice.
29CC. 39 (52)(c) Thursday, 28th May, had been excluded since the previousMonday would be Whit-Monday, and two Bank Holidays in a singleweek would involve an excessive interruption of work. It was argued that this might be preferable to having one Bank Holiday in each oftwo successive weeks; but it was the general view of the Cabinet thatthe interruption of work would be greater if there were a second bank holiday in Whit-week.(d) If the Coronation were held on Monday, 1st June, much pre-paratory work and travelling would have to be undertaken on the immediately preceding Sunday, and this might cause offence to some sections of public opinion.The Prime Minister, summing up, said that the various considera-tions raised in C. (52) 102 and in the Cabinefs discussion seemed topoint towards Tuesday, 2nd June, as being the most suitable day forthe Coronation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to advise the Queen to select a date for the Coronation between 29th May and 6th June,1953, and to bring to Her notice the main considerations which had been advanced in the Cabinefs discussion.Appointment . The Prime Minister said that the Queen envisaged the appoint-of Coronation ment of a Coronation Commission, which would be representativeCommission. of all Commonwealth Governments and would consider those aspectsof the Coronation arrangements which were of common concern tothem all. Her Majesty had invited all Her Governments, if this pro-posal commended itself to them, to tender advice accordingly andnominate their representatives on the Commission. The Queen pro-posed to appoint the Duke of Edinburgh as Chairman of the Commis-sion; and the Vice-Chairman would be the Duke of Norfolk who,as Earl Marshal, would be responsible for making the detailed arrangements for the Coronation.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to advise the Queen,on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, that such a Commis-sion should be appointed. He was considering whom he should nominate to represent the United Kingdom on the Commission.The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.National 7.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, with the memorial Queen&apos;s approval, he was convening a meeting to consider what stepsto King should be taken towards establishing a suitable National MemorialGeorge VI to His late Majesty King George VI.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.CivU List. 8.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (52) 104) covering a memorandum outlining the sub-mission which he would propose to make to the Select Committeewhich would shortly have to be appointed to consider the Civil Listfor the new reign.The Cabinet expressed general approval of the proposals outlined in this memorandum. They recognised, however, that some of these might occasion critical comment from some quarters of the Hous,eof Commons; and, with that in view, they thought it expedient that
200Tea.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Food (C. (52) 118) recommending that the tea subsidy should ceaseon 15th June and that the tea ration should be increased from 2 oz.to 2Jr oz. in August as a step towards the ending of tea rationing later in the year.The Minister of Food said that, if this policy were announced atonce and the production and purchase of .tea were thereby stimulated,there would be ample supplies of tea to warrant this increase in the ration in August. It would probably be possible to abolish tearationing some months later, but a final decision on this Would be best deferred until the size of the 1952 crop was known. The increasein the ration would cost  7 million this year, and  10 million in afull year, in overseas payments; but this expenditure would be whollyin sterling. The abolition of the subsidy, which had already been announced, would add Sd. a pound to the retail price of tea. Butadjustments in blends and in the relative prices of the dearer andcheaper teas would make it possible for merchants to sell teas of sound quality at only 4d. a pound more than the current price.The Cabinet felt that, even if it was not practicable to bringthe increased ration into effect concurrently with the change in prices,these two measures should be announced at the same time.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (52) 118 for increasing the tea ration and adjusting retail tea prices in preparation for the ending of tea rationing.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to prepare the draft of anannouncement of these measures, in consultation with theLord President and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, and to submit this for the Prime ministers approval later in the day.Raw Cotton. 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum. by the importing and  President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the DuchyMarketing.      of Lancaster (C. (52) 101) recommending that the Government should accept recommendations made by the Cotton Import Committee forrelaxations of the present centralised arrangements for the purchasingand marketing of raw cotton by the Raw Cotton Commission.The President of the Board of Trade said that the recommenda-tions of the Cotton Import Committee had the support of all the interested parties, including the Cotton Board, the Raw cotton commission, the trade unions and representatives of all parts of thecotton industry. In view of the continued need for restrictions onforeign exchange, it was not yet possible completely to decentralisethe buying of raw cotton and to re-establish the Liverpool CottonExchange.   The recommendations made by the Committee would,there should be some confidential consultation with the Leaders ofthe Labour Party before any steps were taken for the appointmentof the Select Committee.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in C. (52) 104for the Civil List for the new reign.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss these pro-posals, in confidence, with the Leaders of the LabourParty and to report their views to the Cabinet before any steps were taken towards the appointment of the SelectCommittee.
31CC. 39 (52)however, end the monopoly of the Raw Cotton Commission by allowing spinners, if they so wished, to buy their own cotton in wholeor in part. They would be given all facilities, including allowances offoreign exchange, to enable them to do this, and the Raw cotton commission would offer them facilities for covering their purchases.The proposals could be carried through, initially at any rate, by administrative action, though amending legislation might be desirablelater if substantial use were made of these relaxations.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrange for state-ments to be made in both Houses of Parliament, immediatelyafter the Easter Recess, announcing the Governmenfsacceptance of the recommendations made in the report ofthe Cotton Import Committee, which should be laid&quot; beforeParliament simultaneously with the making of these statements.11. The Minister of Labour drew attention to the positionreached in the negotiations over the wage dispute in the Malta dock-yards. Labour representatives who had been negotiating in london on behalf of the Maltese dockyard workers had broken off the discus-sions and were about to return to Malta. A wage settlement had beenreached and the question remaining in dispute was the extent towhich retrospective payments should be made under it. The labour representatives seemed to have had some ground for hoping thatretrospective payments would be made to the extent of  14 per man and, although they were asking for more, they were likely to accept an offer of this amount. The Admiralty were understood to beoffering  4 per man. If the disagreement could not be resolved,extremist elements would probably obtain the leadership of Malteselabour and serious unrest might follow. He would, therefore, be glad to discuss with the other Ministers concerned, before the departure ofthe Maltese representatives, the possibility of some accommodationbeing reached.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to consider with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Colonial Secretary and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty what immediate measuresmight be taken with a view to settling the wage dispute inthe Malta dockyards.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th April, 1952.Malta.DockyardLabour.)
