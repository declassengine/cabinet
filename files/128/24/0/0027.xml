131CC. 27 (52)Transport 1.   The Prime Minister said that strong feelings had beenCharges. expressed in the House of Commons on the previous day about the(Previous        increases in bus fares and railway fares in the London area.   He had reference:      therefore suggested to the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofCC. (52) 26th   Transport, Fuel and Power and the Minister of Transport that he conclusions,    should issue without delay an announcement on the lines discussed by minute 3.)       the Cabinet on the previous day, making it clear that the Governmenthad no responsibility for these increases.   The terms of the proposed announcement were read to the Cabinet.   It included the statement that the Minister of Transport proposed to make a reference to the. Central Transport Consultative Committee on the alteration of farestages.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the immediate issueof an announcement on the increase in passenger transportfares, in the terms of the draft which had been read to theCabinet.Government 2.   The Prime Minister said that he had received a deputationInformation from the 1922 Committee regarding the work of the government services. Information Services.   A note of their representations would be sentto the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee whichwas considering this matter.The Lord Privy Seal said that his Committee would shortly be,   submitting a further report to the Cabinet on the future of the central office of Information.National 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterInsurance. of National Insurance (C. (52) 60) proposing that immediately afterRates of . the Budget he should open discussions with representatives of bothBenefit. sides of industry in order to ascertain their attitude towards a proposalfor raising the statutory age of eligibility for National insurance pensions to 67 for men and 62 for women.The Minister of National Insurance reminded the Cabinet that under the system already in force people who remained at workbeyond the minimum retiring age earned the right to draw a largerpension when they ultimately retired. It might in any event prove possible to increase the rates of National Insurance benefit, includingunemployment and sickness payments as well as pensions, beyond theexisting rates, which were in general based on a standard of 26.y. fora single person. But the raising of the statutory age of retirementwould, in combination with some adjustment in contributions, makeit possible, without adding materially to the burden on the Exchequer,to raise the rates of benefit still further and to bring them nearer tothe subsistence rates paid by the Assistance Board. If he could thusrestore the 1946 purchasing power of National Insurance benefits, he might be able to reverse the existing tendency, which he deplored, for large numbers of beneficiaries of the National Insurance Fund to goto the Assistance Board for suplementation of their insurance benefits.The change would also reduce the burden of pension payments infuture years and increase the size of the working population. Hewould proposed to couple any change with transitional provisionsenabling those reaching the present age of retirement in the next fewyears to retire on pensions somewhat below the new levels whichwould be payable to those retiring at the new ages; and it might evenprove desirable to extend the period during which an option of thiskind could be exercised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the reference whichhe would make in his Budget speech to National Insurance benefits,he would be able to prepare the way for the approach to industry42123-3 b 2
defence programme.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 25thConclusions,Minute 2.)Steel.4. The. Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (C. (52) 64) reporting the results of his enquiry into thepossibility of easing the balance of payments problem either by making military equipment available for sale to dollar countries orby setting free, in the metal-using industries, productive capacity which could be used for the manufacture of exports.The Minister of Defence said that the suggestions made in his memorandum represented the full extent of the savings which couldbe made without substantial modification of our defence effort.In the course of an examination of these suggestions, which were summarised in the Appendix to C. (52) 64, the following points were raised:  (a) It was proposed to save 6,000 tons of steel and  2 - 5 million in foreign exchange by curtailing the provision of heavy bridgingequipment. This would mean that less than 1,000 tons of steel wouldbe used this year for the production of ten sets of heavy bridgingequipment which was required for use with the heaviest types of tank.(b) 10,000 tons of steel and  4 million in foreign exchange couldbe saved by postponing the manufacture of jerricans.(c) 60,000 tons of steel had been allocated for the constructionof huts and storage for Service purposes. While much military equipment must be kept under cover, the Cabinet hoped that onre-examination it would prove possible to save a substantial part ofwhich the Minister of National Insurance had in mind. He would discuss the actual wording with the Minister.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) In view of the increasing proportion of the elderly in the. population as a whole, it was desirable that people should be provided with further inducements to work until a later age. An improvementin the existing increments added to the pensions of those retiring later than the statutory ages was an alternative course which should befurther examined if the suggestion made by the Minister of national insurance met with resistance.(b) An increase in pension rates which might be coupled with anincrease in statutory retirement ages would doubtless have for practical reasons to be extended to unemployment and sickness benefit. Increments added to the pensions of individuals whovoluntarily remained at work would not have this repercussion.(c) While it was desirable that the suggestion made by theMinister of National Insurance should be further explored, and inparticular that the advice and assistance of industrial and tradeunion representatives should be sought on it, a number ofMinisters thought that it would encounter strong opposition. Notonly might there be criticism that contractual obligations towards thecontributors were being modified, but a compulsory increase in theage of retirement might be regarded as a retrograde step.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to proceed,immediately after the Budget, with discussions with bothsides of industry on the possibility of increasing thestatutory ages of eligibility for National insurance pensions and of making consequential adjustments in rates of benefit.(2) Invited the Minister of National Insurance to keep thePrime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour informed of his progress in thismatter.
this steel. Alternative methods of construction and the use of other materials in place of steel should be fully examined. The CabinetCommittee on economy in the use of building materials, with whichthe Service authorities were already in contact, might be able tohelp to achieve this.The Cabinet-CD Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for an urgent examination of the possibility of securing savings in theallocation of steel for the construction of huts and storagefor Service purposes.(d) It was proposed that 200 Swift aircraft should be offered tothe United States Government, and it was hoped that if this offer was accepted an immediate payment of  3 million in dollars wouldbe made by them on account. It was important that such an offer should not interfere with the urgent re-equipment of the Royal AirForce with modern aircraft. It was in fact not intended to makeany deliveries to the United States Government until our own ordersfor Swifts had been completed; and there were good prospects that,if bought by the United States Government, these additional Swiftswould be allocated by them to the Royal Air Force.(e) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster suggested that, asthe United States Government were about to ask Congress for large additional appropriations for military aid, it might be possible by ahigh-level approach to induce them to purchase aircraft such asCanberras and Venoms which we were committed to contribute toforces under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe. If this could be arranged, a substantial payment, possiblyamounting to.as much as  30 million in dollars, might be obtained.Such aircraft would most probably be allocated in the first instance to the Royal Air Force, since the Continental Air Forces would notbe capable of flying them for some time to come.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of Supply toexamine the suggestion made by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; and to report to the Prime Ministerhow this suggestion could best be put to the United StatesGovernment.(/) The Admiralty&apos;s reserves of oil, which would meet require-ments in the first six months of war. were to have been increased in1952 by 800,000 tons. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that,in view of the financial situation, he was willing that this programme should be reduced to 500,000 tons. In discussion it was pointed outthat if the programme were reduced to 400,000 tons a saving of 5 million would be secured, partly on the direct cost of the oil andpartly by release of tanker capacity which could be used commercially.The dollar cost of this oil was, however, to have been met from thegrant of $300 million due to be made to us under the Mutual SecurityAct; and care should be taken to ensure that the funds not used for purchase of oil were made available for other military purposes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to keep this in mind.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the Admiralty programme for increasing their reserves of fuel oil in the financial year 1952-53 shouldbe reduced from 800,000 to 400,000 tons.(4) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (3) above, endorsed the pro-posals made in C. (52) 64 and invited the ministers concerned to reduce orders and to negotiate sales of equipment accordingly.
investment programme,(previous reference:C.C. (52) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)Flour.Purchase tax and Utility.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C, (52) 66) proposing that, in order to discourageinvestment, the income-tax depreciation allowances on newly-purchased plant and machinery should be suspended for three years.In discussion it was argued, in favour of this proposal, that itwould be preferable to the introduction of administrative arrange-ments for licensing the purchase of new machinery. On the otherhand, it would be thought to be somewhat inconsistent with the concessions which were to be made under the Excess Profits Levy.And it would be represented as an enforced loan exacted from industry at a time when most firms were short of money.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if, as appeared, thisscheme did not commend itself to the Cabinet, he would be content to rely on the proposed increase in the Bank rate, which would initself operate to discourage investment in new plant and machinery.The Cabinet Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should not proceed with the scheme, outlined in C. (52) 66, for suspend-ing for a period the income-tax depreciation allowances onnewly-purchased plant and machinery.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that abnormally largequantities of flour were being bought from the mills, evidently in anticipation of price changes following the Budget. The Ministryof Food desired on this account to make an order on 9th Marchimposing a temporary restriction on deliveries from the mills. he himself feared that, if such an order were made so near to the dateof his Budget statement, it would give rise to public comment andto undesirable speculation about the content of the Budget.The Minister of Food said that, in view of the Chancellor^statement, he would not press this suggestion.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (52) 57) on the future of the utility schemes.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in consequenceof the changes in the purchase tax which were to be made in theBudget, there would be no advantage in retaining the utility schemesfor textiles, clothes, bedding and footwear. He was, however,anxious to. preserve, as far as possible, such safeguards as were pro-vided by the present utility specifications. After consultation withthe industries concerned he proposed to meet this point by developing the use of standards under the authority of the British standards institution combined, wherever possible, with the registration ofcertification marks which would enable the consumer to know whichgoods complied with the prescribed standards. He had circulated,with his memorandum, a draft of his proposed statement explaining the new system.In discussion there was general support for the proposal putforward by the President of the Board of Trade. The following suggestions were, however, made:  (a) There would be advantage in continuing the term &quot; utility,&quot;which had established itself in the public mind. The new systemmight be described as &quot; the British Standards Utility &quot; scheme.(b) The announcement of the new system should be made, notin a formal statement, but in a speech by the President of the Boardof Trade during the Budget debate..  The Cabinet-Approved the proposals put forward in C. (52) 57, subject tothe two points noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.
industrial building.^john DeereProject at East Kilbride.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 61) on the proposal of theJohn Deere Plow Company to erect a factory at East Kilbride. Thisreported that the firm had declined to finance the building of thefactory, and had ordered their manager in Scotland to enter into nofurther commitments. The firm had, however, furnished an estimateof the amount of dollars they expected to bring into this country inthe period 1952-56, if they were allowed to go forward with theirproject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this project would stand in a new light if the firm could establish their claim that theywould bring in to this country in the next five years the amount of dollars set out in the Appendix to C. (52) 61. He suggested that this estimate should be examined at a meeting with representatives of the firm and the Bank of England.It was the general view of the Cabinet that this project shouldbe allowed to go forward if the firm were able to establish theestimate which they had given of their probable dollar earnings overthe next five years. If, after the proposed meeting between repre-sentatives of the firm and the Bank of England, any doubts still remained on this point the matter could be discussed further by theEconomic Policy Committee.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for ameeting of representatives of the John Deere PlowCompany, the Bank of England, the Treasury, the Boardof Trade and the Scottish Office to consider the firm&apos;estimates of their probable dollar earnings during theperiod 1952-56.(2) Agreed that, if as a result of this meeting it was established that the firm&apos;s dollar earnings were likely to be of theorder indicated in the Appendix to C. (52) 61, the Presidentof the Board of Trade might grant an early starting-date for the erection of this factory.Cabinet Office, SWA,1th March, 1952
