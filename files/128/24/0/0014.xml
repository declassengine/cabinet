The Foreign Secretary said that two of the scandinavian countries, of whose Fleets the late King had been an Admiral, wouldlike to send naval contingents to the Funeral. It would not, however,be in accordance with precedent to invite any foreign Powers to sendcontingents from their armed forces to the Funeral; and, if any foreign countries sent Service contingents, many others would wishto be similarly represented but would not find it practicable to arrangethis in the time available. It seemed desirable therefore to followprecedent on this point.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to advise the Earl Marshalthat no Service contingents from foreign countries shouldtake part in the Funeral ceremonies of His late Majesty.Steel Prices. 4.
