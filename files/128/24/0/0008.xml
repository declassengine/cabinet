Egypt. 1.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latestPrevious developments in the Egyptian situation. As the Cabinet had been reference: informed on 25th January, the two parts of Operation Rodeo had .C. (52) 7th been put at forty-eight hours&apos; notice on account of the dangers arisingConclusions, from the operation to disarm the Auxiliary Police in Ismailia. he Minute l.) had, however, been informed on 26th January that the british military authorities were of the opinion that the attitude of theEgyptian Army made it necessary to consider afresh the nature ofthese operations and the circumstances in which they should be launched. When plans had been made for British forces to move to Cairo for the protection of British and other residents there, it hadbeen assumed that the Egyptian Army would not be hostile. In thelast few days, however, fanaticism had grown in Egypt and it was probable that the Egyptian Army would fight if Operation Rodeowere launched. In view of the disposition of Egyptian forces, this change made our position in the Canal Zone, if we had to launchoperations against Cairo, one of some anxiety. It would, moreover,take longer for British forces to reach Cairo than had been expected,and during that period British residents would be in acute danger,more particularly as the Egyptian forces now maintaining order in cairo might move out to resist our advance, leaving disorder in thecity uncontrolled. As regards the operation in Alexandria, the commanders-in-Chief were now of the opinion that this, if carriedout, should be changed in nature and should become an evacuationunder military supervision of British residents there. When this hadbeen completed we should leave Alexandria, the main forcesemployed being used to reinforce our position in the Canal Zone and.. * .    - to facilitate possible operations against Cairo.Fortunately it had not been necessary during the past week-end to decide whether in the changed circumstances to carry out either ofthe two parts of Operation Rodeo. For the time being the egyptian army had restored order in Cairo. Steps had been taken throughUnited States channels to make it plain to the King of Egypt that ifthe Egyptians severed relations with us or ordered a large-scaleexpulsion of British subjects and particularly in the latter event we should have no option but to impose severe economic sanctions.In the meantime the King had changed his Government and it wasnot known what the attitude of the new Government would be.They might be willing to negotiate or they might continue with theproposals to sever relations, and to expel British subjects, known tohave been before the previous Cabinet. But the Foreign secretary had sent a message to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo (ForeignOffice telegram No. 209) which the Cabinet saw and.endorsed. this telegram authorised the Ambassador to reaffirm our readiness toundertake discussions on the basis of the Four-Power proposals (ifthe Egyptian Government called a halt to terrorist activities andrefrained from further anti-British measures) and to work towardsarrangements which, within the framework of the Four-Power pro-posals, would lead to the gradual assumption of responsibility by theEgyptian armed forces for the defence of the Canal Zone.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that, if further military activities had to be undertaken in Egypt, there would almost certainly be a demand for further troops from this country.We had no further troops which could be sent, since the whole of the, strategic reserve normally retained in the United Kingdom hadalready been despatched to Egypt. Our lack of such a reserve might encourage disturbances in other parts of the world to which we shouldbe unable to despatch forces. The Chief of the Imperial General Stafffelt that this was a position which could not be accepted; in his view,the only solution was to embody Territorial infantry divisions,. possibly in rotation, in order to have some strategic reserve availablein this country.
&quot;HOoBalance oiPayments.Food Supplies.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered again, in the light of a minuteaddressed to the Minister of Defence on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff,the decisions which they had taken on 25th January relating to food imports. The Chiefs of Staff had represented that the proposal toreduce the strategic reserve of wheat was militarily unacceptable inview of the likelihood that in the early months of a war it would beimpossible to maintain imports at even the essential minimum level.In view of the overriding importance of the whole of themeasures designed to remedy the deficit of the sterling area with thenon-sterling world, of the fact that the Cabinet had been informed in their previous discussions of the strategic aspects of some of those measures, of their earlier decision not to proceed with the proposedcuts in imports of sugar and fats, and of their understanding that even after the proposed reduction wheat and flour stocks would stand at10J weeks&apos; consumption,The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their earlier decision that imports of wheat and flour should be reduced in the year 1952 to produce a saving of  7 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that in preparing his Parliamentary statement on the economic situation hehad become more than ever impressed with the disadvantage, par-ticularly in view of public expectations, of making a statement which,apart from the reduction in the ration of foreign exchange for tourists,involved no changes which would have an immediate and obviousimpact on the daily lives of the people. Although he would refer to the large reductions in food imports which the Government had made before Christmas and which the public were only now beginning to feel, he would have preferred that at any rate one other step shouldbe taken to bring home the gravity of the situation.The Cabinet understood that, although the Minister of Food was unwilling to alter the sugar ration, the sweets ration might in any eventhave to be reduced in the near future. If so, it would be better totake the decision at once and to announce the change as part of thegeneral statement on the economic situation to be made by theChancellor of the Exchequer.After withdrawing to Consult the Minister of Food by telephone,The Lord President informed the Cabinet that the Minister of Foodagreed with this suggestion.The Cabinet-   ;   &apos;    &apos;    :   &apos;(2) Agreed that the sweets ration should be reduced at the firstconvenient date to 4 pz. per week, and that this change- should be announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-    in Parliament on the following day. -Malaya. 3   The Colonial Secretary reminded the Cabinet that in hisZZZL - EnUm- (S i5  59) ***** recommended the appointment inC c fSvVrd Makya5 a Tuha?

Malaya, he had informed the Acting Governor that, if necessary, hisreserve powers should be used to give effect to it. The Commissioner-General for South-East Asia was reluctant to see reserve powersbrought into use and the Colonial Secretary had accordingly decidedthat they should not be used without confirmation from him. Butit was his intention to give that confirmation if it proved necessary.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary.Cabinet Office, SWA,28th January, 1952.
