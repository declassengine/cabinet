J secret. Tfie Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there actions of other Governments, apart from that of Sweden, to theannouncement of the Proposals for a Settlement with the Rhodesianregime had so far been relatively restrained. The more prominentof the African leaders had forborne to comment; while the member states of the Organisation of African Unity were, perhapsfortunately, committed to support of the policy of no independencebefore African majority rule, which was now generally recognised as unrealistic. But there had been some rather sharp criticism at the; V  -i&apos; i! K!l    * Previously circulated dfi a Confidential Annex.:&apos;V &apos; -I -&apos;&apos; fl : secret-11     I B*secret. The Cabinet noted that the Report of the Select Committeeon the Civil List was to be published at 4.00 p.m. that day.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons the following week. It was proposed that theHouse should adjourn for Christmas on Wednesday, 22 December,and resume on Monday, 17 January, 1972.I: The Cabinet tendered their warm congratulations to the foreign and . Commonwealth Secretary, the Attorney General and theParliamentary Secretary, Treasury, for their successful conduct ofthe debate in the House of Commons on Rhodesia on the previous day.v.The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped to arrange for the Houseof Lords to adjourn on 16 December and to resume on 18 January,1972. The Cabinet considered certain aspects of forthcomingbusiness in the Upper House.*The Lord Privy Seal said that the Lords were to take theCommittee Stage of the Museums and Galleries Bill on 6 December.There was considerable opposition to its provisions; and a closevote must be expected.In discussion it was suggested that the controversy which theMuseums, and Galleries Bill had provoked inevitably raised doubtswhether it was advisable to proceed with it in view of the relativelysmall1 financial saving which it would produce. On the other hand the principle of charging for admission to museums and gallerieswas clearly defensible and should not lightly be abandoned. Itmight be advisable that the matter should be reconsidered before theCommittee; Stage was reached in the Upper House.!&apos;    The (Cabinet V Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, to discuss with the Paymaster General&apos;, the question whether the Museums and Galleries Billshould be proceeded with; and to report the outcome to the- &apos; r\     Cabinet.
United Nations; and there might well be a movement to stationUriiteil Nations observers in Rhodesia during the forthcoming test of Acceptability. This should be firmly rejected; but further efforts should be made to select for appointment to the Commission whichwas to conduct the Test of Acceptability individuals whoseindependence and integrity would command wide respect. It wouldbe primarily the responsibility of the Chairman and his deputies to evaluate the evidence, a number of more junior commissioners being required to assist in its collection.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that jt was essential that the membership of theCommission should command respect and that, now that a majorityhad clearly emerged in Parliament in favour of the Proposals for aSettlement, the Commissioners should be instructed to make it clearthat the Government of the United Kingdom commended them tothe.people of Rhodesia. ,&apos;The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.AffairsThe GulfPrevious .Reference: directions (71) 58thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET3&apos;. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theUnion of Arab Emirates would formally come into being that day.This involved the termination of our special relationship with the rulers of the Trucial States in the Gulf and its replacement by anew.Consultative treaty. This, in turn, would make possible thetransfer of the Trucial Oman Scouts to the Union and themaintenance of adequate provision for a British military presence in !fhe&apos; area. The arrangements worked out with the Shah of iran and the Ruler of Sharjah for the island of Abu Musa had been satisfactorily implemented; but, unhappily, the Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah had not been prepared to accept parallel arrangements forthe Tunbs islands under his jurisdiction. In the event, Iraniantroops had occupied both the Tunbs; and it was now known thatone Arab and three Iranians had been killed in the ensuing clash.All subjects of the Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah had subsequently left the Tunbs, with the result that Iran was now in effective control ofthem. The reaction of the Iraqi Government had been sharp; her majesty&apos;s Ambassador had been asked to close the Embassy and toleave- the country. The Government of Kuwait had also condemnedus, but without, so far, taking any specific action against our interests. The Governments of the other Arab States in the Gulfand elsewhere seemed to be taking the affair more calmly.Nevertheless there had been some rioting in Ras al-Khaimah and inSharjah; and it must be recognised that there could be furtherdisturbances in the next few days. It ought to be within the capacityof the Trucial Oman Scouts to contain these. Our own troops should not intervene; and plans for their withdrawal could beallowed to stand. In general, there were reasonable hopes forstability in the Gulf area, an outcome for which our emissary, sir william Luce, deserved warm congratulations.
India/PakistanPreviousReference:CM (71) 58thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the latest reports indicated that the Indian Government were now moving uplarger forces in support of the guerillas in East Pakistan and it mustbe accepted that the early disintegration of Pakistan was now a real possibility. It was thought to have been the objective of theGovernment of India for some time to detach the East Wing of pakistan and to instal there some regime over which they could hope to exercise a measure of control. It was by no means certain,however j that an independent Government in East Bengal wouldnot be dominated by elements of a more extreme character than theIndian authorities would find palatable. Meanwhile, PresidentYahya Khan of Pakistan was now faced with the alternatives of allowing East Pakistan to secede or of going to war with India inan attempt to retain it. He had sent to the United Nations an urgent request for observers to be stationed on the borders of pakistan and India; and this would now be considered by theSecurity Council. It was just possible that the outbreak of warcould be prevented by United Nations intervention; but more probably a peace-keeping operation would prove too difficult forthe United Nations, particularly since the Indian Government wouldbe sure to resist it and could count on the support of the soviet union. The extent to which China would support Pakistan in thesecircumstances was unpredictable. No Resolution had yet been tabled in the Security Council; and our attitude would have to bedetermined in the light of its text and of the situation at the timeof its presentation.The Cabinet , ,, Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-f&amp;r-JI- fjV wealth Secretary.IndustrialAffairsCurrent PayNegotiationsCONFIDENTIAL4. The Secretary of State for Employment said that theagreement by the unions representing local authority manual workers to recommend to their members acceptance of pay increasesamounting in total to 7f per cent on the wage bill was a cause forsome satisfaction. The negotiations had been well managed, not least by Mr. Griffiths, the Secretary of the Local AuthoritiesConditions of Service Advisory Board. Other recent pay settlementsincluded increases of 1\ per cent for the Atomic Energy authority manual workers, of 7 per cent for the municipal busmen, and of1\ per cent for the British Airports Authority industrial and non-industrial staff. Comparison with the level of settlements in these industries a year ago indicated that significant progress was nowbeing made towards the Governmenfs objective of reducing pay increases in the public sector to an acceptable level. Moreover,there were encouraging signs that the Press was now taking the viewthat the Governmenfs policy of de-escalation was succeeding. Therewere reports that the ballot conducted by the National Union ofl^inewprkersi (NUM) in relation to their negotiations had resultedin a 59 per cent majority in favour of strike action; and this, under
the revised rules agreed by the NUM&apos;s 1971 Annual Conference,j would indicate sufficient support for a strike to oblige the union&apos; executive to instruct its members accordingly. The supportappeared, however, to have been concentrated in the traditionally! ii^iliiant areas; and any strike, therefore, might not prove in theevent to be on a national basis. Coal stocks were in any case high.Steps were being taken to prepare for a possible strike by electriciansin the National Health Service. Although the strike of Rolls-Royceworkers at Filton, which had now been made official, hadinterrupted production of engines for the Concorde aircraft, it was difficult to envisage any action which he might properly take inthis case, in view of the weakness of the employers in granting twoincreases which, with the offer now made, involved a total increaseof&apos; 14 per cent during the current year. There were insufficientgrounds on which to seek to compel the unions to hold a ballot;and the most helpful action would be for those with any influence to encourage the workers to bring pressure on their union representatives to reach an early settlement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the recent pay settlements, on which those concerned with the negotiations were to be congratulated, were an^encouraging indication that significant progress was being made inthe Governmenfs policy of wage de-escalation.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing; ^ ^        up of their Discussion ssion.JIPI; secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof: State for Trade and Industry (CP (71) 144) on the concorde project. They also had before them a note by the Head of theCentral Policy Review Staff (CPRS) (CP (71) 140), covering amemorandum setting out the views of the CPRS on the project; anda note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP (71) (145), to which was appended a factual assessment of the project prepared by the CPRSand officials of the Departments concerned.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theMinister for Aerospace was to meet the French Minister ofTransport, M. Chamant, on 7 December in order to discuss the price at which Concorde should be offered to airlines. Our attitude tothis question depended on whether we intended to continue withthe project. We had previously envisaged that the fundamentalreview planned for February 1972, would enable the Cabinet toconsider it in all its aspects and so to decide whether a case couldbe made for unilateral withdrawal. Even by that time, however,some of the relevant information would still not be available.Moreover, it was now evident that, although there was still no; economic case for continuing with  the project, the FrenchHi SECRETConcorde &apos;Previous,References&apos;CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute 9andCM (71) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4
Government were determined to proceed. Unilateral withdrawal would therefore do serious harm to our relations with the FrenchGovernment whose support was essential before the ratification ofour membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.)could become effective and would be hardly less important thereafter.It would also have very damaging consequences for employment andfor the morale of industry and the general public; and our credibilityas a collaborative partner, together with our chances of closer association with the European aerospace industry, would also be jeopardised. Thus, while we need not rule out the possibility thatat some future date the French themselves might be prepared toconsider cancellation of the project by agreement, it was no longerrealistic for us to contemplate unilateral withdrawal. In thesecircumstances it would be more advantageous to give the projectUnreserved support henceforward, in order that we might have more chance to influence key decisions and to benefit fromfavourable publicity. The bilateral review with the FrenchGovernment, however, should still be held in February, since therewere several outstanding policy issues to be settled.The immediate decision, to be taken at the meeting on 7December with M. Chamant, concerned the selling price. our attitude hitherto, which had been conditioned by a desire not to prejudice our legal position in the event of withdrawal, had beenthat there should be a &quot; floor price &quot;, including full costs and charges,below which manufacturers should not go without the approval ofthe two Governments; and that the Governments should also approve the key contractual terms. The French Government, on the otherhand, considered that these matters should be settled by the manufacturers. It was not realistic to expect that airlines wouldbe prepared to pay the latest assessment of the &quot;floor price&quot;; andhe proposed, therefore, that we should accept the manufacturers&apos;latest proposals, under which the unit selling price for initial orders of the aircraft (up to a maximum of 18) from the British overseas airways &apos; Corporation (BOAC), Air France and Pan AmericanAirways1&apos;should be $31-2 million at July, 1971 conditions, andi Government approval would be sought for the price for subsequentorders. Although these proposals involved a risk of loss, there didnot.seem to be any practical alternative. The French government might feel -that the figure was still too high; but, since they had previously maintained that the matter should be left to the manufacturers, it seemed reasonable to expect that they wouldacquiesce/;;, As regards the other key contractual conditions, he considered that it would be imprudent to give the manufacturersfull discretion and that it would be desirable to leave the way open for the introduction of a model contract, to which the manufacturers would be required to adhere within certain tolerances. He proposed,therefore, that at the meeting on 7 December the Minister forAerospace should inform M. Chamant that we approved the manufacturers&apos; proposals on the price but should maintain the line that the Governments should also approve the other key contractualconditions. &apos;i
In discussion there was general agreement that it was no longerrealistic to contemplate unilateral withdrawal from the project andthat there would therefore be advantage in the Governmentscommitting themselves wholeheartedly and publicly to it.   the timing and presentation of this change of attitude, however, would need careful consideration.   The negotiations with the Frenchi &apos; Government on 7 December would be liable to be difficult and itj   would therefore be premature to make any specific statement about our change of attitude either before or during that meeting, althoughM. Chamant would inevitably realise that our view had changed.&apos;   , &apos;   After the meeting the Governments commitment to the projectmight most appropriately be expressed by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry, who would be the natural representative of theGovernment to make the first flight in the aircraft. consideration should also be given to the possibility of obtaining some offset fromthe French Government in other contexts in return for our change: , &apos;   of attitude, although it was possible that the balance of advantagemight be found to lie in not seeking any specific concession.In further discussion there was general agreement that therewas no longer any real prospect of establishing a price which wouldrecover all costs and charges. In these circumstances the fixing ofthe selling price must be a matter of judgment; but it would be undesirable to allow it to fall below the figure of $31-2 million atJuly 1971 conditions, as now proposed by the manufacturers. Itwould be undesirable to give the manufacturers full discretion tosettle the other key contractual terms; and we should maintain ourposition on this point at the meeting on 7 December.In further discussion the following points were made (a) In any statement about the Concorde project it was important not to imply that we accepted any commitment to developing a &quot;stretched&quot; version of the aircraft.j (b) It would be desirable to limit as far as possible the operatingsubsidy which BOAC would be likely to demand before agreeing topurchase the aircraft. Although it might prove difficult to dispute:,!;;! the view that a mixed fleet of Concordes and Boeing 747s would beless profitable than a fleet based on a single type of aircraft, thelbssj of profitability need not necessarily be attributed solely toConcorde.j (c) Good progress had been made in surmounting the remainingtechnical difficulties in the development of Concorde, although someuncertainties still remained about the acceptability of its noiselevel.;: (d) We had not yet prohibited supersonic flight over populatedland areas, partly because the French Government had asked us to delay this action but also because it might be disadvantageous to&quot;regulations on the point at a time when the United State authorities were still considering their own attitude to supersonic flight.Nevertheless, there was considerable pressure from government supporters for the British regulations to be made at an early date.
(e) Several subsidiary issues had been raised in the memorandabefore the, Cabinet in connection with the ways in which we might give effect to our change of attitude towards the project. these would require further consideration by the Departments concerned.(/) The extent to which Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. were failing to devote sufficient effort to projects other than the RB-211 engine wasa matter pf:urgent concern. This was however being examined asa separate ii^sue.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that there was now no realistic prospect of unilateral withdrawal from the Concorde project and agreed that weshould seek a suitable opportunity to express our wholeheartedsupport for; it, although this support should not extend to any commitment to the development of a &quot; stretched &quot; version of theaircraft.&quot; the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should consider further with the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasteriand the Minister of Agriculture whether there would be advantage in frying to obtain some offsetting concession from the FrenchGovernment;. The Cabinet also agreed that at the meeting withM. Chamant on 7 December the Minister for Aerospace should support the proposals by the manufacturers about the selling priceof the aircraft, but should maintain our stipulation that the otherkey contractual conditions should be subject to approval by the twoGovernments. The timing of the issue of regulations concerningsupersonic; flight over land and the other subsidiary issues raised in the memoranda before the Cabinet should be examined by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry in consultation with theother Ministers concerned and the CPRS.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their&apos;   .&apos;      discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry and the Minister for&apos;&apos;     Aerospace to proceed accordingly.TheEuropeanSpaceResearchOrganisation^ProgrammePreviousReference:CM (71) 57thConclusions,Minute 2:    ;     i confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal&apos; (CP (71) 143) about the outcome of the meeting of the Councilof European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) on 23-24November.&apos;) ,The Lord Privy Seal said that at the meeting of the ESROCouncil only France, Germany and Italy had declared their firmsupport for the telecommunications satellite project. Even if weassumed the concurrence of Italy and Sweden, who were in factstill undecided, the number of participants would fall short of theminimum of eight which had been stipulated by the Cabinet.Depending on the position adopted by Italy two possibilities were open to us. If the Italian Government decided to participate in the
project, we should be able, given Italian support, to block thedevelopment stage of the telecommunications project in 1975, if itstill appeared uneconomic at that juncture; and in thesecircumstances we should be prepared to go forward with Italy. If,however, the Italian Government decided not to participate, weshould be unable to muster a blocking vote in 1975 if France,Germany and Belgium were determined to proceed to thedevelopment phase of the project. It had been reported that theFrench and German Governments had jointly approached the ItalianGovernment in order to persuade them to accept the ESROprogramme; and we had been asked to associate ourselves with these;  representations.j &apos; -The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the United Kingdom should take part with France, Germany and Belgium in the ESRO programme providedthat Italy was also prepared to participate. It would be appropriate for us to use our influence to persuade the Italian Government inthis direction, either in company with other ESRO countries or bya separate diplomatic approach. Steps should be taken to ascertainItalian intentions; and the Italian Government should be informed- that we were willing to go forward with them. If, however, Italyfinally decided not to participate in the ESRO programme, a new situation would arise, which would need to be considered by theCabinet.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord Privy Seal, inconsultation with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, to proceed accordingly.Top salaries review BodyReport on the pay of ministers and Membersof ParliamentPrevious! ;uv; \]Reference:CM (71) 60thConclusions,Minute 1. ..CONFIDENTIAL*7. The Cabinet considered further whether the increases in the salaries of Cabinet Ministers should be staged.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that opinion in the Cabinet remained divided. Some Ministers believedthat public opinion would expect some act of self-denial on their part, following the example of senior public servants a year ago,while others believed that staging would be regarded as no morethan a useless gesture and that the only safe course was to give fulland immediate effect to the Report of the Top Salaries Review body in,this as in all other important respects. It was generally agreedthat on balance the latter view should prevail. The increases for cabinet Ministers should therefore not be staged; and the review body&apos;s recommendations on Ministerial salaries should be giveneffect from 1 April, 1972.* Previously circulated in a Confidential Annex.

The Prime Minister said that, after consultation with the affairs Ministers principally concerned, he had set up a task force, underthe leadership of Sir William Armstrong, to report on the objectives,measures and executive machinery for a new initiative to moderniseour economic structure and to equip British industry to meet the challenge of entry into Europe. The terms of reference includedstudy of any necessary modifications of present regional policies.The task force would consult all the Departments affected; but it\^ab important that its existence should be regarded as highlyconfidential for the time being.&apos;i    :j::;The Cabinet &apos;,,   &apos;..
