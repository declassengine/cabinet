CM 25 (71)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week. It was proposed thatthe House should rise for the Whitsun adjournment on Friday,28 May, and resume on Tuesday, 8 June.The Cabinet were informed of progress on the industrial relations Bill in the House of Lords. The Prime Ministeremphasised the importance of completing all stages of the Bill in both Houses in good time before the Summer Recess.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council and the lord privy Seal, in consultation with the Chief Whips in bothHouses, to consider how the remaining stages of theIndustrial Relations Bill might be so conducted as to ensurethat the Bill would be enacted as expeditiously as possible and in any case not later than the Summer Recess.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that reports from Brussels, where the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster hadbeen discussing with Ministers of the member countries of theEuropean Economic Communities our application for membership of the Communities, indicated that some progress had been made.Agreement had been reached on agricultural transition arrangements and, subject to consultation with the Commonwealth countries concerned, on sugar. The French Government, who had clearlybeen mollified by our agreement to apply Community procedures to agriculture as soon as possible, had made a helpful new move on sugar, the effect of which was that the Commonwealth sugar agreement would remain intact until 1974 and that thereafter theexpanded Community would be committed to arrangements whichwould safeguard the interests of developing commonwealth countries.In discussion it was agreed that this compromise on sugarprobably represented the best outcome which we could expect; thatit would be appropriate to explain its significance to the West indian and other Governments concerned; but that it would be equallyirnporfant to ensure that domestic United Kingdom interests alsounderstood and accepted the position. The agreement on agricultural transitional arrangements would similarly needparticularly careful presentation to British growers of apples andpears, who would be protected against too rapid an increase in-secret
competition from Community producers by the introduction ofa diminishing fixed levy.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.SECRETRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (71) 20thConclusions,Minute 4*3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, incommenting on the proposals put to the Rhodesian representativesby Lord Goodman in April, Mr. Smith, the leader of the regime in salisbury, had indicated that he might be willing to consider making provision for constitutional progress beyond the attainment of mereparity between African and non-African representation. AlthoughMr. Smith would no doubt seek to attach difficult conditions to any concession of this kind, the possibility of making some progress towards a settlement seemed to justify our asking Lord Goodmanto return to Salisbury for further discussions with the Rhodesianauthorities; and appropriate arrangements for this purpose were nowbeing made.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.ImmigrationPolicyPreviousReference:CM (71) 1stConclusions,Minute 3The PatrialProvisionsin theImmigrationBillCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP (71) 58) dealing with three aspects of the Governmenfsimmigration policy on which decisions were required.The Home Secretary said that during the Commons committee stage of the Bill an amendment had been carried which had theeffect of removing the provision, approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 5 January, whereby Commonwealth citizens with UnitedKingdom-born grandparents would not be subject to immigration control. Even the other &quot; patrial concession &quot;, under which childrenwith United Kingdom-born mothers would be exempt from such control, had been accepted only by virtue of the casting vote of theChairman of the Committee.  To try to restore the grandparental* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
CONFIDENTIALconcession at the Report Stage would be likely to encounter serious political opposition and might put at risk the concession relatingto the children of mothers born in the United Kingdom. He had therefore concluded, with some reluctance, that we should not seek to restore the grandparental concession.In discussion, it was generally agreed that, although noconclusive arguments had been raised against the grandparentalconcession, its reinstatement in the Bill was hardly feasible. Itsomission, however, would be liable to provoke considerableresentment in Australia and New Zealand; and it might thereforebe desirable to consider the possibility of concluding bilateralarrangements with those countries, whereby those of their citizenswhose grandparents had been born in the United Kingdom would,by administrative action, be treated as if they were exempt fromimmigration control. It was argued on the other hand that it wouldin fact be impossible to give effect to such arrangements, whichwould in any event be open to the charge of deliberatediscrimination.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet reluctantly accepted that we should not seek to restore the grandparental concession at the Report Stage of the immigration Bill. The Home Secretary should discuss with theMinisters most closely concerned the feasibility of achieving by administrative measures the aims which the rejection of thegrandparental concession had frustrated.The Cabinet-1.   Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion., The Secretary of State for Employment said that, despite the increase in domestic unemployment, there had been a significant increase in the employment of aliens in recent years, especially inthe hotel and catering industry. The changes proposed in CP (71) 58were designed to reverse this trend by confining work permits forsemi-skilled and unskilled male aliens to individuals who were seeking seasonal jobs in the hotel and catering industries andimposing a quota on applications to fill unskilled male seasonalvacancies in these industries. His proposals would not significantlyaffect alien female labour; unemployment was in any casepredominantly a male problem.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theproposal, if announced at the present juncture, might embarrass our negotiators in the present discussions on our entry into the european economic Community (e.c.). The present e.c. rules provided forunrestricted entry for workers from other e.c. countries; and to
announce that we were introducing measures which ran counter to Ithe e.c. obligations which we said we were ready to assume might 1well create difficulties. iIn discussion it was emphasised that the continued expansion of !the hotel and catering industry was of great benefit to our balanceof payments. Despite the continued expansion of domestic training \facilities for the more skilled jobs in the industry, it still needed jaliens, especially for seasonal work; and measures which restrictedits sources of recruitment would therefore affect its prospects jadversely. So long, however, as alien labour, prepared to accept low jwage rates and inferior standards of living, was available, the hotel \industry would have no incentive to rectify the anomalous situation \under which we imported foreign labour while paying social security ijbenefits to our own unemployed. Even after allowance had been :made for the seasonal nature of much of the work and for the fact jthat it was not always available in areas with the highest unemploy- jment rates, there remained a strong case for drawing on our own 1unemployed, some of whom, at least, were mobile and were as well jsuited to the work as were the unskilled alien labour which we fimported. The particular problem of the hotel and catering industry Jexemplified a trend, which would tend to become more marked as Imanufacturing industry shed its surplus manpower, for a larger Ipercentage of the nation &apos;s employment to be found in the service 1industries; and it would become increasingly difficult to accept a 1situation in which the unemployed continued to receive unemploy- iment or social security benefit on the grounds that their specialised industrial skills entitled them to confine their search for alternative Iemployment to particular localities or sectors of industry in which 1demand for labour was continuing to shrink. The rules regulating fpayment of unemployment and social security benefit ought not to be so operated as to encourage a situation in which a flow of aliens was needed to meet an artificially induced shortage of unspecialised 1labour. IjjjjThe Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, said-1that the Cabinet were generally in favour of the restrictions on Jemployment of aliens advocated in the Home Secretary&apos;s paper. 1They recognised, however, that no steps which required an 1announcement could be taken at the present time, in view of 1the possible adverse effects on the course of the e.c. negotiations. 1They would also wish to reconsider the question of any announce-1ment of a change of policy when the state of the e.c. negotiations!was clearer and in any case before the Summer Recess. There was]clearly a need for a full study of the hotel and catering industry and,in particular, of its tendency to rely unduly on alien labour.  This:study should take into account all the factors, including those I mentioned in discussion, which contributed to the anomaly under J
which widespread unemployment and an increasing intake of alienlabour co-existed.The Cabinet 2. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.3. Invited the Home Secretary to resubmit proposals for anannouncement of new restrictions on the employment of aliens in due course, on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.4. Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Social Services, to put inhand a study of the hotel and catering industry, and themeans whereby its tendency to rely increasingly on alienlabour could be reversed; and to report the outcome tothe Cabinet in due course.The Home Secretary said that discussions with the Governmentsof Kenya and Uganda had resulted in an understanding on the basisapproved by the Cabinet on 26 November. In return for an increase from 1,500 to 3,000 in the number of UKPH heads of householdadmitted to this country the two Governments would informallyundertake not to prosecute UKPHs waiting in the queue for admission to the United Kingdom and also to readmit queue-jumpers. This measure, combined with a reduction in other commonwealth immigration, should command wide support.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals on UKPHs.An announcement covering the UKPHs and the intended reductionin levels of other Commonwealth immigration, but excluding any reference to aliens, should be made at some convenient date in thenear future. The terms and the timing of the announcement shouldbe agreed between the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and the Lord President.The Cabinet-5. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.6. Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the decision tobe announced and implemented accordingly.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13 May, 1971.
