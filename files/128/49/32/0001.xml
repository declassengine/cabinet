confidential. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGovernment in Iceland had been defeated in the General Election andthat their opponents had fought their successful campaign primarily on a policy of insisting upon a 50-mile fishing limit around the coastsof Iceland. It was probable, however, that the new Governmentwould be another coalition; this would not necessarily indicate a significant change of policy, apart from the matter of fishery limits.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the rulingParty in Malta had been defeated in a General Election. It was expected that a new Government would be formed by Mr. DomMintoff, whose policy was to remove North Atlantic treaty organisation installations from Malta and to demand higher payment for the defence facilities which we enjoyed there. In general thechange of Government might be expected to make for greater difficulties in our relations with Malta.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary recalled that theIndian Government had asked us to modify our policy on the import of textiles, arguing that it would be liable to disrupt the Indiantextile industry in areas where the economy was already weak. Wehad refused to change the policy but had offered an additional 10 million of development aid in exchange for an Indian waiver ofthe relevant provisions of the Anglo-Indian Agreement of 1939.Mr. Mishra, the Indian Minister of Foreign Trade, had publiclyrejected this offer and had threatened that, if India&apos;s request was not met, she would consider leaving the Commonwealth. This threat,however, need not be taken too seriously; and we should maintain our present attitude towards the matter.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theSecretary-General of. the United Nations, U Thant, had appealed tous, as to other Governments, for a further financial contribution tothe relief of destitution in East Pakistan. Moreover, the Indian AidConsortium was expected to ask for additional aid, to which it seemed right for us to contribute  5 million, to help the indian government to deal with Pakistani refugees who were now on their territory. It would be most desirable to respond to both appeals; andhe would be consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister for Overseas Development about the possibility of finding the money required within the ceiling of the aid programme. If this proved to be not possible, it might be necessary to ask for additional funds to be made available. If we could indicate quickly that weshould be prepared to make further substantial contributions toCONFIDENTIAL-2 \ a 2CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
relieve the impact of the disaster on a once and for all basis,the pressure of public opinion would be reduced; and it would therefore be desirable that an appropriate statement should be madein Parliament early in the following week.Meanwhile, a Motion had been put down and signed by anumber of Opposition Members calling for the recognitionof &quot; Bangla Desh &quot; as a sovereign State. There could be no questionof our taking action of this kind, since none of the attributesof Statehood were evident. Moreover, the Governments of India andthe Soviet Union had made it clear that they had no intention of recognising &quot; Bangla Desh &quot;.The Cabinet-Took  note of the  statements  by  the Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.EuropeanEconomicCommanitiesForthcomingNegotiationsPreviousReference:CM (71) 30thConclusions,Minute 1&apos;&quot;secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he hopedthat, at the forthcoming meeting with Ministers of the european economic Communities (e.c.) in Luxembourg on 21-22 June, itwould be possible to reach early agreement on arrangements for united Kingdom accession to the European Coal and steel community; on hill farming; and on interim arrangements for full consultation between the United Kingdom (and the other applicants for membership) and the Community on any prospective develop-ments in Community arrangements between our signature and ourratification of a Treaty of Accession. Given that these issues should \be dealt with relatively speedily, the main purpose of the meeting would be to seek an outline agreement on adaptation of the existingcommon fisheries policy; to establish the United kingdom contribution to the Community budget; and to define arrangementsfor New Zealand dairy products.As regards the common fisheries policy, he hoped to persuade the Community to endorse our stipulation that the present policy,required adaptation to take account of the interests of the applicants for membership and to secure an undertaking that they were readyto modify the policy in a satisfactory way. It was clear, however,-that it would not be possible to reach during June a detailedagreement on a future common fisheries policy which was acceptable&apos;to all members of the enlarged Community.As regards Community finance it seemed likely that we should?be able to agree with the Community a key of 19 per cent, whichcorresponded to our share of the gross national produce of the;enlarged Communities, for our transitional period; a contribution inthe fifth year approximating to this key; and perhaps two further
years of control over our contribution after the end of the first fiveyears-the so-called years of &quot;post-transitional correctives&quot;. the major issue in dispute, however, was the United kingdom contribution in the first year of membership. In the previousDecember we had proposed to the Community a contribution of3 per cent for the first year; but it was clear that we should have to advance considerably further than this. Proposals ranging from5-7 per cent on the part of the Italian Government to 11 \ per centon the part of the French Government had been tabled, althoughthe latter might be prepared to reduce their demand to 9 per cent.The figure finally agreed might be between 1\ per cent and 9 per cent.As regards New Zealand, French views of possible concessionarymeasures fell far short of any solution which would be regarded byNew Zealand as tolerable. The type of arrangement which we were at present trying to persuade both the French and the New zealand governments to accept was one which involved a gradual reductionin guaranteed access for New Zealand butter exports to the enlarged community, with the result that by the end of the five-yeartransitional period the guarantee would comprise about 85 per cent ofthe present level. For New Zealand cheese we were at presentseeking a general undertaking that steps would be taken to deal withany serious decline in New Zealand exports to the enlarged community rather than an assurance of guaranteed access for astated quantity. It might ultimately prove to be easier to securesatisfactory arrangements on both butter and cheese which remainedvalid for three years rather than five years, with provision for a review at the end of the period. But the critical requirement in any arrangements agreed for New Zealand was that the New zealand government should be prepared to accept them as tolerable.In discussion it was suggested that from the point of view ofParliamentary and domestic opinion it might be preferable to securethree, rather than two, years of &quot; post-transitional correctives &quot;. Asregards New Zealand, it would prove difficult to persuade the NewZealand Government that three years was an adequate period forspecial arrangements, particularly if these arrangements couldthereafter only be continued or altered by unanimous agreement of,    . all the members of the enlarged Community.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Parliamentary The Prime Minister outlined the terms of the statement whichStatement foe proposed to make that afternoon in the House of Commons aboutthe arrangements for Parliamentary consideration of Britishaccession to the European Communities.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported thatsignificant progress had been made in the most recent of thediscussions which our emissaries had conducted with officials of the rhodesian regime. He was accordingly arranging for the emissariesto visit Salisbury again in the following week.  It was too early tooutline the various stages which would have to be completed beforethe United Kingdom could become a member of the Communities.These would, of course, include the publication, as soon as possible after the major outstanding issues in the negotiations had been resolved, of a White Paper which would set out in detail thearrangements which had been agreed as well as the broaderconsiderations which had led successive Governments since 1961 to conclude that the United Kingdom should join the e.c. if satisfactoryterms of entry could be agreed. There were two main issues for decision by the Cabinet at this stage. First, on the assumption that&apos; the outcome of the final stages of the negotiations was acceptable, didMinisters agree that the White Paper should clearly commit theGovernment to a definite statement that the arrangements which hadbeen agreed for our entry were satisfactory? Second, did theyconsider that the substantive decision of principle whether britain should join the European Communities should be taken byParliament before the summer recess, or did they judge it preferable that the debate on the White Paper before the recess should bemerely expository and exploratory in character and that the substantive decision should be deferred for a subsequent debate inthe autumn?In discussion it was agreed that the White Paper should state theGovernments view that the arrangements which had been negotiated were satisfactory and that there should be an expositorydebate on the White Paper before the summer recess, followed bya second debate in the autumn, at the conclusion of which the house would be asked to take the substantive decision of principle whetherBritain should join the European Communities. If the Governmentwere asked whether there would be a free vote on the issue in theautumn, they should indicate that they would then be putting theirpolicy on this matter before the House and asking for its support.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would announce in the House of Commons that afternoon, on thebasis of their discussion, the Governments intentions asregards the arrangements for Parliamentary consideration ofBritish accession to the European Economic Communities.
predict a successful outcome of these exchanges, particularly sincethe crucial question of African advance beyond parity to majority rule had not yet been resolved. Nevertheless, it might be possiblefor the Cabinet to consider the outlines of an agreement within thenext two weeks or so; and it might then be necessary, for parliamentary and other reasons, to take prompt decisions. Mean-while, no more should be said in public than that contacts with the rhodesian regime were continuing in order to establish whether abasis for negotiations could be found.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment said that his department had been asked to conciliate in a dispute between theIndependent Television Companies and the Association ofCinematograph and Television Technicians (ACTT) about a centralpay claim. According to the Employers&apos; representatives the ACTTwere claiming a pay increase of 20 per cent, which, together with claims for the incorporation of a cost of living clause in theagreement, a reduced working week, longer holidays and otherimprovements, would involve a total increase of 50 per cent in the salary bill. The employers had offered a pay increase of 1\ per cent,with the possible incorporation of a cost of living clause; and theywere willing to discuss during the next year revised conditions ofemployment. Officials of his Department were that morning meetingrepresentatives of the ACTT; but unless the attitude of the latterproved to be different from that which the employers had represented, there was unlikely to be scope for conciliation. Therewas therefore some risk that independent television programmesmight be closed down at short notice; and he would keep hiscolleagues informed.-   The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.confidential. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that, as aresult of previous failures of bridges of the steel box girder type under construction, he had appointed in the previous December a technical committee under Dr. Merrison of Bristol University, which had now
produced a report recommending that stricter design rules should beapplied to bridges of this type.   The committee had proposedinterim rules for this purpose, which were to be published as soonas possible.  He had also been advised that the 42 bridges of this type already in use need not be closed.  It had been decided as a precaution to carry out certain physical loading tests on 2 bridges!about to be opened, as well as a check of the design calculations and!physical state of the 42 already in use. These tests would necessarily!take some weeks to complete.   When the consultants who haildesigned the two bridges to be physically load-tested were informed!of the nature of this test they had advised that the bridges might noilwithstand the stress involved because the existing regulations!governing the strength of the bridge design against shearing had not!been fully complied with.   This might constitute an admission of!?professional negligence on the part of the consultants in question;!Since he was advised that there was a slight risk of structural failure!if there were an abnormal concentration of traffic on a bridge of this!kind he had no option, pending the reappraisal of the design, but totrestrict traffic loading.   He had therefore ordered the immediate!closure of one lane on each carriageway of all such bridges on trunroads; and local highway authorities were being advised to applysimilar restrictions.The Press reception of this restriction had been as favourable as!could be expected and had recognised the considerations of publicjsafety involved. When the tests had been completed all possible steps!would be taken to minimise the adverse effect upon the reputation of British bridge design and construction, both at home and overseas!and to emphasise that the steel box girder technique was a soundmethod of construction.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was taking the]necessary steps in relation to bridges in Scotland.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for Scotland.Cabinet Office,17 June, 1971.
