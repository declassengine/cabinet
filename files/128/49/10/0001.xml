Postal ServicePreviousReference:CM (71) 9thConclusions,Minute 3CM (10) 71CONFIDENTIAL1.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that, following the publication of the Wilberforce Report, the Post Office board had entered into further negotiations with the Union of Post office workers (UPW). An offer by the Board to raise their previous payoffer of 8 per cent to 9 per cent in return for an undertaking fromthe UPW to accept a joint study of measures to improveproductivity for implementation by the beginning of July had been rejected by the union on the previous day.   The UPW weremaintaining that the minimum settlement which they could acceptwould be a pay increase of 13 per cent, combined with a shorteningof pay scales which might increase the cost by a further 1 per cent.Both parties had asked him to receive them in the course of thecoming afternoon.  The UPW were suggesting that an independentmediator should now be appointed with a mandate to carry out his task within three days.   This might suggest that they were nowanxious to settle the strike quickly. But the names so far mentionedas possible mediators were unlikely to be acceptable to the PostOffice; and such an appointment could well appear as an attempt tobring pressure on the Post Office Board to increase their offer stillfurther.  Nevertheless, the suggestion could not easily be dismissedout of hand and might be acceptable if an acceptable nominee couldbe found as the mediator and the UPW were prepared to commit themselves in advance to accept arbitration if mediation failed. Thealternative courses were no more attractive.  The gap between theUPWs declared unwillingness to accept less than an increase of13-14 per cent and the Post Office&apos;s offer of 9 per cent left littlescope for seeking to promote a settlement through the normaloperation of his Departments conciliation services; the appointmentof a court of inquiry immediately after the publication of theWilberforce Report would be inappropriate and would in anycase relieve the UPW of the immediate pressures on them tosecure a settlement; while a decision not to intervene at all onthe ground that the Government regarded the Post Office&apos;s offer as reasonable and were unwilling to bring further pressure to bear inorder to secure a settlement on any other basis would involve a significant departure from the neutral position which it was desirable for his Department to sustain.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that itmight&quot; be difficult to enlist popular support for a policy of completenon-intervention by the Government unless an attempt had first been made to explore with the parties the prospects of finding an acceptable mediator and of securing their agreement that he should132969-1
carry out his task in private and that, if he failed, arbitration would follow. If the UPW were unwilling to agree to such a proposition,however, they would be condemned by public opinion for their refusal of any reasonable approach to the problem.In discussion it was suggested that, in the light of the continuingrisk of industrial disputes in other industries, particularly the gas and water industries, it would be a mistake for the Government to refuseto make available the good offices of the Department of Employmentin further exploring the UPW&apos;s request for the appointment of amediator, since that would prejudice the Departments standing asa conciliator in future disputes. While the UPW might now be anxious to find means of ending the strike quickly, for theGovernment to stand aside and to let the strike run its course, orto become directly identified with the Post Office Board&apos;s offer would be liable to forfeit the support of public opinion. The UPWmight well be unwilling to commit themselves at this juncture, inreturn for the appointment of a mediator, to accept arbitration inthe event of his failure to find an acceptable basis for a settlement.Moreover, the chances of finding a mediator who was acceptable to both sides and whose name would not simply suggest that anattempt was to be made to strike a balance between the positionof the two parties seemed remote. Although the concept ofmediation was unwelcome, therefore, nothing would be lost bydemonstrating a willingness to explore it further and so to demonstrate to public opinion that the Government were exploringall possible avenues for ending the strike and the publicinconvenience which it was causing. In that event, however, itwould be right to exert pressure on the UPW to agree to animmediate resumption of work, although it might well be unwise to make this a formal condition of the appointment of a mediatoror arbitrator. If, as seemed probable, the UPW rejected mediationon the conditions suggested, the Government could revert to theircontention that the correct procedure was for the union to acceptarbitration, as provided in their agreements, or to arrange a ballotof their members about the acceptability of the Post Office&apos;s offer.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the importance of maintaining the integrity ofthe Department of Employments conciliation role; and they agreed that a refusal to explore further with the parties the conceptsof mediation and arbitration might leave the Governmentvulnerable to a request from the UPW for the appointment of acourt of inquiry, which it would be difficult to meet butembarrassing to have to refuse, particularly if the request was accompanied by an offer to resume work as soon as a court wasappointed.   In his meetings with the Post Office Board and the
confidential. The Secretary of State for Defence said that he hadcommissioned two studies on the economic and the technologicalprospects of the RB 211 engine which should be completed by thebeginning of the following week. Thereafter he hoped to bringthe issues before the Cabinet; and negotiations with Lockheed aboutlb* 2UPW that afternoon, therefore, the Secretary of State for employment should explore, without committing the Governmentto the appointment of a mediator, what prospects there might beof identifying an individual who would be acceptable in that role to both parties and to the Government and of securing anundertaking by the union in advance not only to return to workimmediately but also to accept arbitration of the dispute ifmediation failed. The Cabinet had some reservations, however,about the nature and scope of a mediators function in the dispute;and the Secretary of State should therefore consult his colleaguesagain if, contrary to expectation, it appeared that the UPW were ready to accept the proposed conditions.Like the electricity unions who had recently been condemnedby the Wilberforce Report for rejecting arbitration, the UPW had signed an agreement which provided for the settlement of disputesby that means; and, by continuing to refuse arbitration, they had placed themselves clearly in the wrong. This fact should be furtherimpressed on public opinion; and the Post Office Board might alsoemphasise more forcefully the serious effects of the continuance ofthe strike on the cost and viability of the postal service, which itmight be impossible to reinstate on the scale provided before thestrike. The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications should accordingly advise the Post Office Board that they should nowprepare plans for a rationalisation of postal services, which couldbe submitted to the Post Office Users National Council for their consideration, preferably by the time the strike ended, in order thatany reduction in services might be seen to be the direct consequences of the union&apos;s own action.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretaryof State for Employment to be guided accordingly inin his discussions with the Post Office Board and theUnion of Post Office Workers.(2) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications toarrange for the Post Office Board to prepare an earlyplan for the rationalisation of postal services.
the future of the contract could then begin, although it wouldprobably not be possible to complete them as rapidly as Lockheedsthemselves hoped. Meanwhile, he had been informed by the receiver that some suppliers and sub-contractors were refusing tosupply goods to Rolls-Royce until some arrangement was made inrespect of goods which had been supplied before the Receiversappointment; and other suppliers were taking the opportunity toraise their prices. He had asked the Attorney-General to advisehim in dealing with this situation.In discussion it was pointed out that the Rolls-Royce failure and,in particular, the belief in the United States that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had somehow contrived to evade their obligations,might adversely affect our export trade as a whole unless thesemisconceptions were rapidly and effectively countered. TheGovernment should therefore ensure that responsible opinion inthe United States understood the position correctly and, inparticular, appreciated that the provisions of the Companies Act,1948, had imposed severe limitations on the freedom of action ofboth the Government and the Board of Rolls-Royce. In any event the Government must not be drawn into a renegotiated contract for the RB 211 which would place the new company from the startunder an excessive burden.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for defence.OverseaAffairsArms for south AfricaPreviousReference:CM (71) 1stConclusions,Minute 4SECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at ameeting of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on8 February it had been agreed that, if the South african government wished to order helicopters for use with their frigates,they should now feel free to do so, since these helicopters wereamong the arms which we had been advised that we had a legal obligation, arising under the Simonstown Agreement, to supply.As regards the sale of further ships in which the South african government were known to be interested, it had been agreed thatthey should be asked to defer action for a time; and he would therefore propose to invite the South African Foreign Minister,Dr. Muller, to postpone for a few months the visit to the UnitedKingdom of a team of naval experts in connection with a possibleorder for ships.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
secret. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the oil companies had now reached agreement with the Gulf group ofsuppliers at Tehran; and this seemed to have removed for the timebeing the danger that oil supplies from the Gulf might beinterrupted. Moreover, it had been agreed to fix the differentialbetween the price of Mediterranean and Gulf crude at 21^ centsa barrel, a figure which was about one-third of that previouslydemanded by Libya.  It was by no means certain that the LibyanThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theoperations against the North Vietnamese on which he had reportedto Cabinet on 4 February had been somewhat delayed by bad weather. The weather had now cleared; and, although little firmnews about the progress of the operations was yet available, it seemed likely that the South Vietnamese troops would have little difficulty in assuming control of the areas where arms had beenstored by the Communists.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen important developments arising from the initiative of theSpecial Representative of the Secretary General of the united nations, Dr. Jarring, in sending notes to the Governments of israel and the United Arab Republic (UAR). In these messagesDr. Jarring had clearly identified the two points which lay at the heart of the dispute in that he had asked the Government of the uar to say clearly that they would make peace with Israel andhad invited the Government of Israel to give more precision totheir interpretation of the concept of &quot; withdrawal&quot;. News had just been received that the UAR had replied affirmatively, agreeinginter alia that peace meant a termination of the state of belligerencyand all its consequences. The Israeli Government were stillmaintaining that Dr. Jarring&apos;s latest initiative had exceeded histerms of reference. But now that the Government of the UAR hadbeen induced to agree to concentrate on the settlement of thedispute and not to set themselves up as the champion of the causeof all the Arabs, it might be easier for Dr. Jarring to secure Israelico-operation. This could mark the beginning of a more hopefulstage in the search for a settlement of the Arab/Israel dispute.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.
Government would accept this. But if, as a result of failure bythe oil companies and the Mediterranean suppliers to reach agreement on revised prices, the supply of oil from Libya was reduced, there were grounds for hoping that the Gulf States wouldbe prepared to increase their supplies. Even so, the currentshortage of tankers, for which there was no immediate remedy,would still result in some shortfall on our requirements. the ministerial Committee on Emergencies had considered this possibility on the previous day and had concluded that the rationing of oil, other than perhaps by administrative means, was unlikely tobe required, at least for some months. Contingency planning would nevertheless continue. The increases in the cost of oil which we now faced as a result of the agreement would have a severe impact on our balance of payments.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that theagreement which the Gulf producers had forced the oil companies to make was an unreasonable one, which could have serious consequences for us. We must be ready to implement plans forrationing if this became necessary; and further consideration shouldbe given urgently both to means of reducing the degree of oue independence on oil from the Middle East and North Africa and tothe possibility of increasing the pace of development of our own resources of power, including North Sea oil and natural gas and nuclear energy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for anearly study of means of further encouraging thedevelopment of indigenous resources of power and ofother methods of reducing our dependence on oil fromthe Middle East and North Africa.CONFIDENTIALAgriculturalInterim ImportLeviesPreviousReference:CM (70) 24thConclusions,Minute 25. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (71) 21) about negotiations with our overseas suppliers concerning our proposed interim import levyschemes for cereals, beef, lamb and dairy products other than butter and cheese.The Lord President of the Council said that our negotiations to introduce interim import levy schemes for beef, lamb and dairy products other than butter and cheese were going reasonably well.
However, we had run into considerable difficulties with the UnitedStates on cereals. At a meeting with senior American officials on8-9 February, the Americans had made counter proposals whichthe Ministerial Committee on Agricultural Policy (AG) had decidedwere not acceptable. Delay in introducing the cereals levy schemeswas liable to hold up the introduction of our other proposed levyschemes. Moreover, with cereals we were faced by a serious timingproblem. Our present minimum import prices (mips) for cereals,were operated under a Five Party Agreement with the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia and Argentina which, expired on 30 June.Thereafter, failing agreement with our suppliers, we would be unable to maintain even our existing arrangements, let aloneintroduce our proposed increased mips supported by general levies,unless we had in the meanwhile negotiated out of the cereals tariffbindings which we had granted under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (GATT) and which were in effect suspended forthe duration of the Five Party Agreement. Negotiating out of ourbindings would take at least 4 months. We also had agreements with minor cereals suppliers which would need to be renegotiatedto allow us to operate general levies and these were terminable only at 4 months&apos; notice. In the circumstances the majority of theAgricultural Policy Committee had concluded that we should forthwith set in hand the necessary procedures for withdrawing ourGATT cereals tariff bindings and giving notice to our minorsuppliers, and that this should be done before having further negotiations with the Americans or any of our other suppliers. Intaking this action we should make it clear that what we were doingwas necessary in order to put ourselves in a position to introduceour new arrangements on 1 July, but that we remained ready tocontinue negotiations with the Americans and our other suppliersfor a mutually acceptable agreement. If agreement could bereached, we would not complete the procedures to withdraw ourGATT bindings. It was felt that if we took such action the americans might be ready to reach agreement with us on acceptablenew cereals levy arrangements, but that if we did not there wasno prospect of bringing them to an acceptable agreement. On theother hand, the Minister for Trade considered that, bearing in mind the serious implications of seeking to withdraw our GATT bindings,we should first make a further effort to secure agreement with the americans. To this end he thought we should be prepared to restrict the increase in our mips to  4 per ton. We might also offer the Americans a general undertaking about our future domesticsupport policies. Since the matter had been considered by theAgricultural Policy Committee some evidence had emerged that an
acceptable agreement with the Americans might be possible withoutinstituting the procedures to unbind our tariffs, and if this was indeed the case he was sure that AG would feel that a further effort should be made with the Americans before going to GATT.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that, sinceAG&apos;s discussion, he had received an approach from the UnitedStates Embassy which suggested that agreement with the Americansmight be possible if we limited the increase in mips to  4 per tonin 1971, and to  6 per ton in 1972. It might also be necessary toprovide a general assurance about the objectives of our new arrangements. In return, the Americans might agree to ourintroducing general variable levies provided the understanding between us was terminable at 3 months&apos; notice. He was sure thatthe Americans&apos; latest approach was prompted by the fear that we might otherwise set about unbinding our tariffs. It was essentialto the success of any further negotiations that the Americans shouldhave no doubt that, failing agreement, we would take such action.Accordingly he hoped that the Cabinet would agree that he shouldexplore further the possibility of an agreement with the Americanson the lines he had indicated and that he should be authorised totell the Americans that, failing agreement by the end of the month,we would set in hand the procedures to unbind our cereals tariffs.In the light of American reactions he suggested that at the beginningof the following week the Prime Minister should send a message tothe President of the United States proposing a basis for agreement.In discussion the Minister of Agriculture^ proposals were generally approved. However, it was argued that, while we should approach the Americans on the basis that, failing early agreement,we would set about unbinding our cereals tariffs, furtherconsideration would need to be given to the serious implications ofunbinding these tariffs before we instituted such action. It waspointed out that, however urgently we set about unbinding thesetariffs, the Americans and our other suppliers might be able to delay the completion of the necessary procedures &quot;until after the end ofJune. It was also suggested that it would not be too serious if wewere unable to introduce our new cereals levy arrangements untilmid-August or the beginning of September, because market prices were expected to remain firm at least until then; and it would be preferable to continue negotiations with the Americans until mid-March if necessary and if a favourable outcome seemed possible,rather than set a rigid deadline of 1 March for the completion of negotiations. On the other hand it was noted that our overseas suppliers were unlikely to agree to the introduction of our otherproposed interim levy schemes until we were in a position tointroduce our new cereals levy arrangements; and it was pointed
Cabinet Office,16 February, 1971.out that delay in introducing our levy schemes would undermine the credibility of the Governmenfs declared policy of changing our system of agricultural support to one based on import levies andwould leave the Exchequer exposed to the risk of heavy deficiency round. In any event, a clear deadline for the completion of negotiations was essential (as well as a firm sanction) if the UnitedStates Government was to be persuaded to move.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it now seemed likely that agreement might be possible with the americans without the need to unbind our cereals tariffs;accordingly, a further approach should be made to the Americans,as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture. In reinforcing this approach the Minister of Agriculture had discretion to indicate tothe Americans, to the extent that he judged necessary, that failing agreement with them by the end of February the Government wouldhave no alternative to proceeding to unbind the United Kingdomtariffs on cereals. It might be helpful if the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary spoke on similar lines to the United states ambassador in London. In the light of American reactions, andin consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Minister ofAgriculture should arrange for a draft message to the President ofthe United States to be prepared for despatch at the beginning ofthe following week. If, in the event, an early acceptable agreementwith the Americans could not be reached, the Cabinet would wishto consider further, because of the serious implications of suchaction, whether to institute the procedures to unbind our tariffs.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, inconsultation with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, to proceed on the lines indicated in the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.
