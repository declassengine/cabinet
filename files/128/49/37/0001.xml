The SummerRecessPreviousReference:CM (71) 35thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that relationsbetween India and Pakistan were continuing to deteriorate. Bothsides appeared to be making moves in the Kashmir region whichwere heightening tension. The flow of refugees from East Pakistanwas continuing virtually unabated; and the efforts of the united nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Sadruddin, tohalt or reverse it had not so far yielded results. The proposal to station United Nations representatives in the main affected areas,which he had mentioned at the Cabinefs last discussion of thesubject on 30 June, had not been effectively followed up; and wewere now trying, subject to the agreement of the Governments ofIndia and Pakistan, to promote a Four-Power initiative by the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union, France and ourselves to give some impetusto the United Nations High Commissioners efforts. If we succeeded,however, significant additional expenditure would be inevitable.Falkland The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the recentIslands exchanges with the Argentine authorities on the question of improvingcommunications between the Argentine and the Falkland Islandshad been concluded successfully. It now seemed unlikely thatthere would be any adverse reaction from those sections of political opinion which were particularly sensitive to any move which mightbe interpreted as an attempt to coerce the islanders into a closerrelationship with the Argentine.SECRETOverseaAffairsPakistanPreviousReference:CM (71) 35thConclusions,Minute parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAffairs in the House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that since the Cabinet had last consideredthe Parliamentary business remaining to be transacted before the summer Recess it had become clear that adjournment on 30 July,as had been originally envisaged, would not leave the necessaryroom for manoeuvre, particularly in view of the time likely to be needed for the consideration of Lords&apos; amendments to the industrial relations Bill. He therefore proposed to inform the House ofCommons that afternoon that it would be necessary for the house to continue sitting in the first week of August, although, if it proved possible to recommend rising before the end of that week, he would do so.The Lord Privy Seal said that he intended to announce that afternoon that it was proposed that the House of Lords shouldrise not later than 5 August. He has yet to decide whether the debate on British accession to the European Economic Communitiesshould be held in the last week of July or the first week in August.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Lord President of theCouncil and the Lord Privy Seal.
Middle east previous reference:CM (71) 21stConclusions,Minute 5The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGovernment of the United States were maintaining their efforts to promote an interim settlement between the United Arab republic and Israel. The former might not now insist on stationing combattroops on the eastern side of the Suez Canal as a part of any suchsettlement; but they would probably seek to exact equivalentconcessions on the Israeli side.rhodesia previous reference:CM (71) 32ndConclusions, jMinute 4SECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that LordGbodman&apos;s mission had that morning returned from Rhodesia.Preliminary indications suggested that the result of their discussionwith the regime in Salisbury provided grounds for guarded optimism.He hoped to put proposals for future action to his colleagues earlyin the following week.MaltaPreviousReference:CM (71) 35thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET 1I4.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, smce 1assuming office as a result of the recent General Election in Malta, mr. Mintoff, the new Prime Minister of Malta, had despatched a number of peremptorily worded messages to us, apparently designed Ito buttress his claim that the Defence Agreement, under which we Istationed forces in Malta, was no longer valid and to demonstrate Jthat it lay in his power to create considerable difficulties for us if we Ifailed to comply with his demands.  These appeared to be directed Jto compelling us to pay more for fewer facilities in Malta and to 1denying facilities to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.   His flatest requirement was that all troop movements to the island should fbe suspended and that a British Minister should be despatched to 1Malta forthwith to negotiate new arrangements to replace the defence and Financial Agreements.   Following a meeting of theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee on the previous day it hadbeen decided to defer the move of a Royal Marine Commandocontingent to Malta; and the Prime Minister had despatched afirmly worded letter to Mr. Mintoff indicating that we would beprepared to send a Minister to Malta to discuss Maltese requirements,provided that these discussions took place in an orderly manner andthat Mr. Mintoff first elaborated his proposals in sufficient detail toenable us to appreciate their implications.   Mr. Mintoffs initialreactions to this letter were reported as being unresponsive.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.
EuropeanEconomicCommunitiesPreviousReference:CM (71) 36thConclusions5. The Prime Minister said that the White Paper on the UnitedKingdom and the European Economic Communities, which hadbeen published on the previous day, had had a satisfactory reception.A popular version was being made available free in Post Offices on12 July. It was important that in any public statements ministers should adhere very closely to the White Paper&apos;s presentation of the issues involved and should not allow themselves to be drawn intomaking any estimates or volunteering any forecasts which might beregarded as incompatible with those given in the White Paper.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime ministers statement.CONFIDENTIALIndustrialAffairsPay of LocalAuthorityAPTC GradesIndustrialCivil ServicePayPreviousReference:CM (71) 29thConclusions,Minute 96. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that at ameeting of the Local Authorities&apos; National Joint Council on theprevious day the unions had rejected an offer by the employers&apos;representatives in respect of a pay claim for the Administrative,Professional, Technical and Clerical grades which would amount toan increase of rather more than 7 per cent on the total salary bill.He would review the situation with the employers&apos; side before they resumed discussion with the unions on 23 July.The Lord Privy Seal said that at a further meeting with thetrade union side of the Joint Co-ordinating Committee forGovernment Industrial Establishments he had put forward anincreased offer in respect of the Industrial Civil Service in accordancewith the agreement reached in the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Pay Negotiations on 5 July. The new offer, which union representatives had agreed to consider, would add approximately8 per cent to the total wage bill.NEDC Meeting The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the meeting of the July National Economic Development Council (NEDC) on the previous day had encouraged him to entertain a cautious hope that the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) might be rather less unwilling to co-operate in the Governments efforts to improve the economic situation.He had nevertheless made it clear that dramatic results could not beexpected in the short-term. Some of the union leaders had been concerned to avoid any commitment to an incomes policy; and ithad been agreed that there should be no declaration of intent onthis subject. Discussions between the Confederation of BritishIndustry, the TUC and the Treasury would continue at official level,under the chairmanship of the National Economic Development: Office, in preparation for the next NEDC meeting early in August.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State forthe Environment, the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.
HousingFinancePreviousReferences:CM (70) 34thConclusions,Minute 9, and cm (71) 17thConclusions,Minute 77. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretaries ofState for the Environment and for Wales (CP (71) 78) and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP (71) 80), to which were annexed draft white Papers on the Reform of Housing Finance. They also had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP (71) 81)about the timing of publication of these White Papers.The Secretary of State for the Environment and The Minister for housing and Construction said that the proposals set out in the draft white Paper on the Reform of Housing Finance in England andWales were based on the decisions taken by the Cabinet at their meetings on 29 October, 1970, and 25 March, 1971.  The detailshad  subsequently   been  elaborated   in  association  with  therepresentatives of the local authorities.  The proposals wouldnot only result in a substantial saving in public expenditure; theywould also constitute a more just and positive housing policy,comprising the encouragement of owner occupation, the improvementof sound older houses and the accelerated clearance of slums.  TheGovernment were committed to making a statement on the matter in the near future; and only the publication of a White Paper would permit adequate exposition of the policy in its entirety.  It was already known that the Government proposed to move bothcontrolled and council house rents on to the basis of fair rents;and the Opposition had made great play in recent months with theapprehension of impending rent increases.  It would be greatly to the Governments advantage to make their intentions fully knownat the present juncture because it would then be seen that the rent increases would be limited, that the proposed system of rent rebatesand rent allowances would protect poorer tenants against hardshipand that the reshaping of the subsidies to local authorities wouldgive positive encouragement to the redevelopment of slum areas.On balance, therefore, public reaction to the White Paper shouldbe favourable.  A feature of the proposals was that local authoritiesshould be encouraged to raise the rents of their council housesfrom 1 October, 1971.   The White Paper should therefore bepublished as soon as possible; but publication even at the end ofJuly would be worth while.  Any further delay would not onlybe expensive in terms of the Exchequer savings which would be sacrificed; it would also be regarded as a breach of faith by thoselocal authorities who had been making plans to increase rents in anticipation of the publication of the Governments proposals.The Secretary of State for Wales said that he endorsed thesubstance of the proposals but had reservations about the timing of publication of the White Papers. Although these would enable theGovernment to present to full advantage such favourable featurbsas the rent rebate and allowance scheme and the increased subsidies for slum clearance, the result, on balance, would be to strengthen theposition of the Opposition in attacking the Governments economic ipolicies by reference to the increases in rents. Moreover, fewlocal authorities would be able in practice to complete the necessary arrangements in time to raise their rents with effect from 1 October.For these reasons it would be preferable to defer publication until ithe opening of the new Session.
i I !; I, SECRET 7- i . i1 jThe Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Scottishproposals were in general similar to those for England and Wales,although, with the approval of the Cabinet, a different basis wasbeing adopted for local authority rents and there were some differences of detail in the new subsidy system. The representativesof the local authorities had shown themselves co-operative duringthe consultations on the proposals; and he was confident that, ifthe White Paper were published promptly, there would be asubstantial response to the suggestion that rents should be raised from 1 October next.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the timing of publication of the White Papers. Publication in the near future of proposals to increase rents would be bound to prejudice to someextent the Government&apos;s attempts to reduce the rate of wageinflation, especially since the next few months were likely in anycase to witness an unusually rapid increase in food prices. Thissuggested that it might be better to defer publication until theautumn, by which time food prices might be expected to be morestable. This might involve deferring the first round of increases in the rents for council houses; but there would be offsetting savings in public expenditure due to the reduced cost of agricultural support.On the other hand, it could be argued to be a mistake to postponeaction until the autumn. It could not be assumed that conditions would be more favourable by then; and there was a serious risk that in the meantime the proposals would become known. TheGovernment would then be put on the defensive and would lose theopportunity to present their case to the best advantage. A decision could not be taken until the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy had carried further their consideration of the present stateof the economy; but it seemed that publication at the earliestpossible moment might prove to be the wisest course.The Cabinet then considered the draft White Papers annexed to cp (71) 78 and 80. There was a agreement on the importance ofmaking clear not merely the proposals themselves but also thepolitical and economic principles which lay behind them. Thedraft of the Scottish White Paper might be elaborated in this respect.Otherwise, there was general acceptance of the White Papers, subjectto certain points of drafting and presentation which the ministers concerned undertook to represent direct to the Secretaries of State.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of argument probably favoured publication of the white papers as soon as possible, if this were compatible with the outcome of the consideration currently being given by the Economic StrategyCommittee to the state of the economy. Preparations should therefore be pressed forward for publication during the following week, if this were confirmed; and those Ministers who had drafting or other points which they wished to raise should send them direct to the Secretaries of State concerned without delay.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing;   up of their discussion.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to reconsider hisdraft White Paper with a view to including a moreforceful presentation of the basic principles which hadprompted the proposals.(3) Invited the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for the environment and for Wales to make arrangements topermit publication of the White Papers during thefollowing week, should that course be adopted.Cabinet Office,8 July 1971.
