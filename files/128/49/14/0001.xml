CM 14 (71)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications (CP (71) 29), to which was appendeda draft White Paper on commercial radio.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that thedraft White Paper proposed the establishment of an IndependentBroadcasting Authority (IBA) to supervise a commercial radioservice consisting of a national programme and up to 60 local privateenterprise stations.   The proposed national programme wouldsupersede the Radio 1 service of the British Broadcasting Corporation(BBC); but the BBC would be allowed to keep the 20 local stationswhich had been approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 30 July,1970.   The pledge in the Conservative Party&apos;s Manifesto at theGeneral Election had been limited to the introduction of commercialradio at the local level; but at that time it had also been assumed thatthe BBC would not be providing local radio services. The additionof a national programme to the local commercial radio services should result in a better balance of competition between the BBC and commercial radio and should enable the latter to become effectivemore quickly. It should also facilitate a satisfactory agreement withthe Musicians&apos; Union on the use of recorded, material and should provide commercial radio with more adequate resources for theestablishment of a good central news service. It would, admittedly,be opposed by the BBC; and there would also be opposition from thePress, from some of the Governments supporters and from some ofthose interested in setting up local commercial stations.  When the ministerial Committee on Broadcasting had examined the draft white Paper, however, a majority had considered that the balanceof argument inclined in favour of introducing the proposed national programme in place of BBC Radio 1, while allowing the corporation to keep their 20 local stations.   Supervision of commercial radiocould be entrusted to the Independent Television Authority (ITA) asan alternative to setting up a new authority.  But there would thenbe a risk that the ITA would treat commercial radio as a secondaryconcern, whereas the creation of an IBA would ensure that it wasvigorously developed.  The majority of the Ministerial Committeehad considered that, if there was to be a national service, it shouldbe the responsibility of an Authority other than the ITA.  In viewof the uncertainty whether funds for the IBA could be obtainedfrom other sources without a Treasury guarantee, it should be financed from the National Loans Fund; and, if local commercialradio was to extend beyond the major conurbations, it would benecessary to introduce some element of cross-subsidisation between132977
the local stations, as had already been done in the case of commercialtelevision.In discussion there was some support for the view that, a national Iprogramme would strengthen the viability of commercial radio and Ithat the substitution of the national commercial programme for BBC &apos;)Radio 1 would improve the range of radio services. On the other jhand the Election pledge about commercial radio had been concernedwith the introduction of a local private enterprise radio service;and it was arguable that the introduction of a national commercial Iprogramme, operated by a new public authority, was different fromthe concept with which that pledge was concerned and, indeed, was iinconsistent with it. Moreover, it could not be confidently predicted ;that competition at national level would improve the quality of radio ;programmes. There was no strong feeling in the country that anational commercial programme should be introduced; and it would jarouse opposition from all the other communications media, including jthe BBC, the Press and local commercial radio. While the amountof additional advertising revenue absorbed by a national programme !would be small in relation to all advertising revenue the recent jnewspaper closures would inevitably lead the Press to form an 1exaggerated impression of the risk to their financial position. The Ieffect on Government relations with the communications media would be liable to be serious; and this might hinder the effective 1presentation of the Governments case on a wide range of national Iissues. In these circumstances it would be preferable to limit action Iat present to the steps which were immediately necessary in order Ito carry out the Election pledge. This need not necessarily rule out Jthe possibility of introducing a national commercial programme at 1some future time.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) If the existing BBC local stations were retained, it might be 1more difficult for local commercial radio to establish a footing in 1those areas where the Corporation was already operating. On the other hand the BBC local stations were not competing for advertising 1revenue; and to insist that they should now be withdrawn would 1arouse disproportionate opposition from the Corporation and public 1opinion. The draft White Paper, however, suggested that in the 1longer term the BBC might further extend their local radio services, 1While this could be defended on the grounds that a service financed 1through a national licence fee should not indefinitely be limited to 1particular groups in the community, it seemed preferable on balance ifnot to make any reference to the possibility now.(b) If an IB A were established, it was arguable that it should!not be financed from the National Loans Fund, since this would I
increase public expenditure and would be contrary to the principlethat independent radio ought, like other private commercialenterprises, to be self-supporting. In any case, however, the argument for an IBA was substantially weakened if there was to beno national commercial programme. The responsibility forsupervision could conveniently be assigned to the IT A, who could also provide the central news service for commercial radio.Independent Television News were believed to be unwilling toundertake this commitment, since they felt that their strength lay inconcentrating on television as a medium. But they would collaboratefully with the news service provided for commercial radio.(c) In the case of commercial television it had been foundnecessary for the ITA to charge at different rates for the services which they provided, depending on the capacity of the programmecompany to pay. A similar policy might be necessary if localcommercial radio was to be viable outside the major conurbations.On the other hand, if private enterprise was to be attracted to commercial radio, it was necessary that it should be allowed tomake profits. While the possibility of differential charges need notbe ruled out, no reference should be made to this point in the white paper. If the supervision of local commercial radio was left to theITA, it could anyway be assumed that the ITA would follow theirexisting practice in the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government proposals for commercial radioshould not include a national programme. Supervision of the localcommercial radio stations should be entrusted to the ITA, whowould provide the necessary central news service. The BBC shouldbe allowed to keep the 20 local radio stations whose establishmenthad already been approved; but there should be no reference in theWhite Paper to the possibility that their local radio services might befurther extended. There should also be no explicit reference to thepossibility of differential charges for the central services provided bythe ITA for the local commercial radio stations. The Minister of posts and Telecommunications, in consultation with the lord president, should now redraft the White Paper in the light of the cabinet&apos;s decisions on these points, with a view to publication beforethe Easter Recess, and should circulate the revised draft to theCabinet for their information.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.
supplementary benefit in trade DisputesPreviousReference:CM (71) 13thConclusions,Minute 4secret!2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bylthe Secretary of State for Social Services (CP (71) 28) about!supplementary benefit in trade disputes. They also had before them!a note by officials (CP (71) 30) describing the effects of the various!measures under consideration.In discussion of CP (71) 30 there was general agreement that the!existing basis on which capital savings were dealt with for purposes!of calculating the entitlement of strikers to supplementary benefit!should not be altered. As regards the taxation of supplementary!benefit paid during trade disputes, this could not be effected merely!by the removal of the present exemption; and fresh legislation!would therefore be needed. It was agreed that in these circumstances!the suggestion should not be pursued. Equally, the discrimination 1involved in deferring PAYE refunds to strikers alone was not!defensible, although current studies of the structure of PAYE mightfchange the position in due course. The Cabinet therefore faced afchoice between providing for the recovery of supplementary benefit!paid during a strike; reducing the &quot; disregard &quot; of a strikers personal!income in the computation of supplementary benefit payable to hislfamily during a strike; and adopting both these measures.The Secretary of State for Employment said that a provision!that supplementary benefit paid during a strike should be recovered!after the strike was in his view the measure most likely to redress the;!balance of advantage which strikers now derived from the social!security system and to secure the important objective of forcing the!trade unions not only to declare themselves unequivocally for orfagainst particular strikes but also to sustain from their own resources!those strikes which they decided to endorse. The Confederation offBritish Industries, while recognising the additional administrative!burden which would be imposed on employers, nevertheless favoured!a provision for recovery. If so, however, the resultant hardship tonthe lower paid should be mitigated by, for example, establishing aflevel of protected earnings and a maximum period of liability to!repay; and, if the principle of recovery was adopted, the &quot; disregard &quot;f(2) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, ihlconsultation with the Lord President, to revise the dratt:-,White Paper as indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, with a view to its publication before gthe Easter Recess. I
should not be reduced. A change in the system which resulted in a loan at existing levels of payment was more likely to be acceptable to moderate opinion than one involving the reduction of the amountof an outright grant, which would be the effect of reducing the&quot; disregard &quot;. Not only would a loan at existing levels deal more effectively with hardship during a strike; the need for a striker to sustain his family by means of a loan rather than a grant was initself a deterrent to strikes.In discussion it was recognised that any measure which subjectedstrikers to greater financial pressure might lead to accusations thatthe Government were determined to destroy the strike as an industrial weapon. Even so, the recovery of supplementary benefitwas likely to engender greater controversy than the reduction ofthe &quot; disregard &quot;. It would be represented as discrimination directedspecifically against strikers, despite the fact that, not every strike wasunjustified; whereas the primary purpose of the reduction of the&quot; disregard &quot; would be to correct an administrative practice whichthe previous Administration had acknowledged to be inconsistent with the intentions of the relevant legislation and had thereforethemselves intended to amend. A provision for recovery, particularly if combined with a reduction of the &quot; disregard &quot;, was likely to makeit even harder to secure the co-operation of the unions in themeasures which would be needed to give effect to the industrial relations Bill. The Governments industrial policy at present hadthe support of moderate opinion in the country and in the workshops;but excessively severe measures were likely to alienate it. Moreover,a reduction of the &quot; disregard &quot; need not necessarily be less effective than a provision for recovery of supplementary benefit in compellingunions to sustain strikes by the use of their own funds, since theymight well find it difficult to discriminate in the payment of strikepay between married strikers and their unmarried colleagues towhom supplementary benefit was not normally available, whilePA YE refunds already took up all or most of the &quot; disregard &quot; at itspresent level.On the other hand, although.the primary objective of reducing the&quot; disregard &quot; might be to correct an anomaly of administration, its effect would be to reduce the families of strikers to very straitenedcircumstances; and it would therefore be open to the criticism thatstrikers&apos; families would suffer hardship, which it was the properpurpose of the social security system to remedy. A provision for&quot; the recovery of supplementary benefit at its present level would be free from this criticism. If a decision were not taken now to make
such benefit paid during a strike recoverable, a convenient 1opportunity to do so might not recur. Moderate opinion in the!country condemned a system under which the Government were in \effect subsidising strikes; and a provision for recovery would icommand considerable support. Indeed, if the Social Security Bill \were limited to the recovery of supplementary benefit paid after a jjstrike and to the proposed reduction of the &quot; disregard &quot;, it might \prove difficult convincingly to resist a proposal from some of the jGovernmenfs supporters in the House of Commons that a provision jfor recovery should be added. The recovery of supplementary benefit \and the reduction of the &quot; disregard &quot; should, however, be conceived ias alternatives; and it was more important to succeed in redressingthe balance of industrial power in a way which would be both \effective and just than to remedy a deficiency in the administration ofsupplementary benefit.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was accepted that a combination of recovery of supplementary benefitpaid during a strike and reduction of the &quot; disregard &quot; would be liableto provoke resentment on a scale which would endanger public jsupport for the Governmenfs industrial policies. The recovery ofsupplementary benefit was open to the further criticism that it couldbe represented as imposing on a striker a burden of debt whichwould be unacceptable in the aftermath of a strike; and the prospectof this additional liability might itself become a factor in the negotiation of the terms on which a strike was finally settled. Thereduction of the &quot; disregard &quot; was admittedly based to some extent on the different considerations deriving from the need to rectify an administrative practice which was inconsistent with the purpose ofthe relevant legislation. Nevertheless, it would exercise some degreeof deterrent effect; and in these circumstances the Cabinet agreedthat it represented, on balance, the least disadvantageous course. TheSocial Security Bill should therefore provide for the recovery of \supplementary benefit paid after a strike and for the reduction of \the &quot; disregard &quot; to  1; it should not make provision for the recovery of supplementary benefit paid during a strike.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to consult,the Lord President of the Council about the timing of theintroduction of the Social Security Bill.Cabinet Office, \16 March, 1971. j1
