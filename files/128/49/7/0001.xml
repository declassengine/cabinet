EconomicAffairsRolls-RoycePreviousReference:CM (71) 6thConclusions,Minute 1CM 7 (71)SECRET*The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had decided thatthe possibility of acquiring the whole of Rolls-Royce as a goingconcern must be dismissed and that the right course for theGovernment was to make it clear, as soon as Rolls-Royceannounced their intention to apply for the appointment of aReceiver and Manager, that they were ready to acquire the assets of the company&apos;s aero engine and marine turbine divisions. TheCabinet had hoped, however, that it might be possible for Rolls-Royce to reach an acceptable arrangement with Lockheeds whichwould permit the RB 211 engine to be completed as a viable projectso avoiding a Receivership. Rolls-Royce had now had discussions with Lockheeds. The disclosure of their position had come as agreat shock to the President of Lockheeds (Mr. Haughton) who had asked for further time in which to consider his own company&apos;position. For the present, however, Mr. Haughton was quite unableto give the assurances which Rolls-Royce needed if they were tocontinue work on the RB 211 engine and to remain in business.Lockheeds had no resources from which to offer Rolls-Royceadditional financial assistance; and their bankers would require atleast 30 days to take stock of the new position, after which further discussions would be needed between Rolls-Royce, their bankersand the United Kingdom Government on the one hand andLockheeds, their bankers and the United States Government on theother hand before any solution might be evolved. Mr. Haughtonhad said that the United States Administration were unlikely to putany pressure on the American banks to provide further financial support to Lockheeds and that, even if such pressure were applied,the banks would be likely to resist it. Nor could the United states administration themselves help Lockheeds financially without an act of Congress. Meanwhile, Lockheeds had wholly reserved their position as regards claims on Rolls-Royce for damages for non-fulfilment of the RB 211 contract; and even if they later agreed toabandon their own claims, the airlines involved would haveseparate claims for damages which they must be expected to press.At the conclusion of the discussions between the representativesof the two companies, an agreed statement (a copy of which was circulated to the Cabinet and is attached to these minutes as annex 1) had been prepared, describing the situation as at 9.30 a.m.that day. This statement made it plain that a final decision that day by the Rolls-Royce Board to ask for the appointment of a Receiverwas inevitable unless the British Government undertook to provide* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.132950-2a 2
over  100 million for the company and Lockheeds were able to offerreasonable assurances that they would raise the purchase price ofthe engine, accept a delay in its delivery of up to 12 months andabandon all claims under the contract.He himself had subsequently received Mr. Haughton, who hadre-emphasised the need for further time if he were to meet any ofthese requirements. He had also acceded to a request by two ofthe Rolls-Royce Directors, Lord Beeching and Sir Maurice Laing,that they might discuss the position with him. They, too, had been concerned to emphasise the world-wide consequences of cancellingthe RB 211 and to add their own pleas for further time to be foundbefore a final decision was taken.Following his conversation two days earlier with Dr. Kissinger,the Special Assistant to the President of the United States, theUnited States Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Packard, had toldour Acting Ambassador in Washington that, while there was littlehelp which the United States Administration could provideimmediately, they would welcome a few days grace in which to explore the possibilities and hoped that action could meanwhile be postponed. It had been made clear to Mr. Packard that it was doubtful whether postponement would be possible in view of thelegal jeopardy to which the company would be exposed if theycontinued to trade knowing that they were insolvent. The Presidenthimself had now returned to Washington and had intimated a wishto speak to the Prime Minister later that afternoon. A meeting ofthe Ministerial Group that morning had decided that the Rolls-Royce Board should be informed of this further development, incase they should wish in consequence to withhold action to apply for a Receivership for a further 24 hours; and at a meeting earlierthat afternoon the Board had decided to do so. Rumours had now,however, reached the Press; and persistent inquiries about thesituation of Rolls-Royce were being made. It was likely therefore that the situation would become public knowledge within a matterof hours.If the Cabinet confirmed their previous decision that thepossibility of acquiring Rolls-Royce as a going concern should notbe contemplated, there were basically two possibilities on which aproposal to President Nixon, designed to preserve the RB 211engine project, might be founded. These alternative possibilitieswere indicated in a note which was circulated to the Cabinet and isattached to these minutes as Annex 2. In considering the second of these the Cabinet would recognise the difficulty of the inevitableinterruption of work on the project. This might be overcome,however, if it proved possible to negotiate with the Receiver termson which a minimal amount of work could be maintained for a
short period while discussions with Lockheeds took place. TheCabinet would note, however, that it would be as necessary underthe alternative course as under the first course for the United StatesGovernment to enable Lockheeds to give the assurances listed underthe first course.In discussion, there was a general agreement that it would be right to try to keep the RB 211 project in being for a limited period,in order to allow us to explore further with the United StatesGovernment and Lockheeds whether the latter could be put in aposition to offer a revised basis of contract which would enable the engine to be completed as a viable proposition. But the first of thealternative courses of action, although it might appear to offergreater certainty on this point, was open to serious objections. Itwould risk the Governments accepting a commitment to Rolls-Royce^ creditors in the event of a further failure; the Governmentwould have to pledge substantial additional funds to the completionof the project under the existing management at a time when theyhad inadequate information to justify this; it might involvecontinuing the work under an unsatisfactory contract; and it would leave with the Government the onus of possibly having to take adecision to abandon the project later, together with responsibilityfor the consequent redundancies, should it in the event prove impossible to obtain satisfactory terms to secure completion of the engine. The prospect that such terms could be negotiated was slightin any event; and it was certainly negligible within the limited time during which the Rolls-Royce Board could still avoid applying for- a Receivership. The alternative proposal, if amended as the PrimeMinister had suggested, was therefore preferable, the cost to theGovernment being of the order of  200 million. An essential pre-condition of the alternative course, however, was that the presentRB 211 contract should be ended, as in effect it would be (subjectto consequential claims for damages) by the Receivers disclaimingit, as he would certainly do as soon as he was appointed. Thereafter,the Receiver could perhaps be assumed to be willing to co-operate with the Government in keeping the RB 211 assets intact and workon the engine going for a limited further period, provided that theGovernment made the necessary funds available. If so, however,it would be essential that this should be 4one in a manner which did not place the Government in a position of assuming any of the liabilities which arose, under the existing contract or otherwise, fromthe insolvency of Rolls-Royce.In further discussion, it was the general view that there couldbe no question of the Governments seeking either to take over132950-2
Rolls-Royce as a going concern or to dissuade the Board of thecompany from applying for the appointment of a Receiver. Theproposal to be made to President Nixon should therefore be on thelines of the alternative course set out in Annex 2 to the minutes.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that, despite the very serious economiceffects of the insolvency of Rolls-Royce and the adverseconsequences for the company&apos;s creditors, the Government could contemplate no course of action which would prevent theappointment of a Receiver. The Cabinet accordingly reaffirmedtheir previous decision that, as soon as action to appoint the receiver was taken, the Government should indicate their intentionto acquire the assets of the aero engine and marine turbine divisions of Rolls-Royce and to introduce the necessary legislation for thispurpose. He would make it clear to President Nixon that Rolls-Royce&apos;s situation was rapidly becoming general knowledge andthat the Board of Directors were in no position further to delaytheir application for a Receivership. He would then advance thealternative proposal in Annex 2.After a short adjournment, the Prime Minister said that hehad spoken to President Nixon on the lines agreed by the Cabinet,indicating that, if Lockheeds could be put in a position to offersatisfactory terms for completing the RB 211 engine on the basisoutlined in our alternative proposal, it might be possible to negotiate a new contract with the successor company. We would explorewith the Receiver how the project could best be kept alive in the meanwhile, in order that this option need not be closed. ThePresident had said that the United States Administration wouldurgently examine the possibilities of meeting our essential requirements, including means of providing Lockheeds with additional finance. He had asked that in our public announcementwe should adopt as positive an attitude as possible about our intention to keep open the possibility .of completing the RB 211project under a new contract.In discussion it was agreed that the Government statement should now be revised accordingly. It must be made to parliament and could not precede the statement by Rolls-Royce. The Rolls-Royce Board, however, would only be able to take their owndecisions at a meeting later that evening and might feel that it would now be preferable to delay their announcement until the following morning. If so, the Government statement should be made at thenormal time on the following day.
Cabinet Office,4 February, 1971.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould arrange for President Nixon to be informed of the probabletiming of the Rolls-Royce and Government statements. Since thetwo statements were not now expected to be made simultaneously,the statement by Rolls-Royce should exclude any reference to theGovernments intention to acquire certain of the company&apos;s assets;and some amendment of the reference to the discontinuance of the rb 211 project and its effects would also be needed. The necessaryrevisions should now be discussed with the Rolls-Royce Board bySir Henry Benson, who should report the Board&apos;s final decisions and the proposed timing of their announcement later that evening.The Chancellor of the Exchequer should ensure that the Chairmanof the Stock Exchange was informed through the Governor of theBank of England.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their decision.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation Supply to make a parliamentary statement on the Governments decisions in the House of Commons on the following day.
REPORT BY SIR HENRY BENSON.   READ TO,AND ACCEPTED BY, BOTH THE ROLLS-ROYCE BOARDAND LOCKHEED REPRESENTATIVESPresent position 930 am., 3 February, 19711.   Receivership is inevitable today unless:  (a) The British Government will undertake to put up a largesum over  100 million; and(b) Lockheed give assurances that they will endeavour to achieve the following and have reasonable hope ofsuccess (i) To advance the price of the engine.(ii) To abandon all claims under the contract.(iii) To accept delay in delivery up to 12 months.2. Lockheed, due to absence of time, cannot give the aboveassurances without discussion with bankers, and others in the UnitedStates.3.   The risk of claims by the airlines remains.4.   Financial help by the American Administration is doubtfuland in any event would require an Act of Congress.annex I
Annex 2ROLLS-ROYCE LTD.Course 1Action needed by the American Government1.  Financial support to be given to Lockheed.2. Lockheed to agree to increase the present contract price ofthe engines materially.3.  Lockheeds and airlines to accept up to 12 months&apos; delay.4.  Lockheeds to abandon all claims under the contract.5.  The airlines to abandon all claims under the contract.Action to be taken by the British Government1. Government will provide Rolls with additional cash (insome way to be decided) of up to  100 million.2.   This will save the project and Rolls.3. The Government will not commit itself to anything furtheror give any guarantees that the engine will be a technical success.Alternative course1. A Receiver of Rolls is appointed on Thursday, 4 February,1971.2. The Receiver disclaims the 211 contract and, temporarily,work on it ceases. Employees engaged on it are discharged.3. The British Government buys the aero engine assets andcarries on the aero engine business forthwith.4. Lockheeds are provided with the finance required to enablethem to renegotiate the 211 contract with the new company(operated by the British Government) on appropriate terms as to price and delivery. These would in practice be similar to those setout under Course 1.5.  The new company re-engages the employees declaredredundant under 2 above.6. Note. The term which must elapse between 1 above and5 above (when work would restart) cannot in practice be less thanone month and might be longer. This would put back still further the delivery of the 211 and some of the impetus of the project would clearly be lost.
