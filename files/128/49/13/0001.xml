PakistanPreviousReference:CM (71) 12thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed that, in the light of the prospectof civil disorder in East Pakistan, preparations had been made for theevacuation of British subjects in so far as this might prove possible and desirable if the situation deteriorated further. A certain numberof women and children were in fact leaving that day; but, in view ofthe delicacy of the constitutional relations at issue between the Eastand West Wings of Pakistan, it would be advisable to avoid any public reference to action of this nature for the time being.reconstruction of NationalInsurancePreviousReference:CM (71) 9thConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary on the reconstruction of national insurance (CP (71) 26).They also had before them earlier memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (71) 12 and 13).The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the discussion bythe Cabinet at their meeting on 9 February, the Social services committee had reconsidered the proposals in CP (71) 12 and 13 forthe reconstruction of national insurance. In their earlier discussion the Cabinet had been concerned lest the proposal to fix the employers&apos;contribution under the basic scheme at 1\ per cent and the employees&apos;at 5i per cent might be liable to diminish the profitability of industryand, therefore, to retard investment and growth. The Committee,however, had considered that, although the extra contribution from employers would not be without effect on profits, in the longer term the burden would probably be passed on in price increases, leading to a cost-of-living increase of between \ and 1 per cent, or less if,as was possible, the joint contribution requirement were reduced.The Exchequer, for its part, could make no higher contribution ifcommitments on tax reform were to be honoured; and the proposed increase in the employees&apos; contribution could not be further raisedwithout the risk of promoting inflated wage claims. Since theemployers&apos; share of the total contribution to the Reserve Schemealso could not be reduced if it were to compare reasonably withoccupational scheme practice, the Committee had concluded that the contribution pattern was the best that could be achieved. If,however, it became possible to reduce the total contributionrequirement, the burden on the employers might also be eased,although the allocation of any saving would be for later consideration.The Committee had recognised that there were risks in theestablishment of a funded Reserve Scheme; but they had consideredthat the proposed safeguards would reduce the dangers of an undueconcentration of investment power and would present a sufficientlyformidable obstacle to future misuse. They had also concluded that,although the Reserve Scheme might lead to pressure for the fundingof public service schemes, it need not inevitably lead to their having to be so treated; and, although they had not thought it necessary todecide at this stage that no public service scheme should be funded,they had noted that the difficulties of funding were formidable.141771-7A2
Finally, the Gommittee, while agreeing that the manpower 1implications of the proposals in the short term were not negligible, Ihad been satisfied that they were an inevitable consequence of any Iacceptable new scheme, given the need to keep the present scheme in ]operation while the new one was being prepared.:...    ... ..   I.-.      - .:  .. .      - .-. -       ... .-The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that the jCabinet now agreed that the Secretary of State for Social Services )should consult in confidence the outside-bodies concerned andshould circulate a draft White Paper on the reconstruction of national finsurance forconsideration by the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing \up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to proceed 1with confidential discussions on the reconstruction of fnational insurance on the basis of the proposals in \CP (71) 13 and with the preparation of a draft white paper on the reconstruction of national insurance, for \circulation to the Cabinet in due course.1SECRET \Social Security       3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of 1Review 1971   state for Social Services (CP (71) 27), making proposals for changes \in the social security system.IThe Secretary of State for Social Services said that the Cabinet had already decided that the uprating of the main social security jbenefits in the current year should only compensate for the rise in \prices since the last uprating in 1969; but that selective improvements \should be introduced costing not more than  45 million a year. He Iwould be bringing his detailed proposals before the Cabinet at a later jstage, together with proposals for corresponding changes in the jsystem of contributions. Meanwhile, his present memorandumdealt with three issues: the scope and nature of the selective Iimprovements in benefits to be introduced at the same time as the Iuprating; possible changes in the earnings-related supplement to Ibenefits and the contribution limits; and the curtailment of the abuse 1v of unemployment benefit by some occupational pensioners.   The 1selective improvements, which had been approved by the Social IServices Committee were concentrated on the chronic sick and thevery old in accordance with the pledges given in the Conservative jParty Manifesto at the General Election. For the. chronic sick he I proposed to introduce an invalidity pension at the present basic 1sickness benefit rate, which would be supplemented by invalidity 1&quot;: * 7: ; allowances at varying rates toieompensate for the fact that those who J\- -    were: incapacitated;at an early age would have had little or no chance Jof acquiring savings or occupational pension rights. In addition, he j(proposed to extend to working wives of invalidity pensioners the more jgenerous earnings rules at present applying to retirement pensioners
and to increase the allowances paid in respect of dependent children.These improvements would absorb  21 million of the  45 millionavailable. For the very old he proposed to extend retirement pensions to all non-pensioners over 80 and at the same time to payan age addition of 25p per week to all retirement pensioners over that age, with corresponding provision for those drawingsupplementary benefit. He also proposed to relax the earnings rule,to increase the increments for deferred retirement and to make anumber of minor improvements, including some easements for war pensioners and an increase in the scale rates for adolescents insupplementary benefit households. As regards earnings-relatedsupplement to benefits, he had had further discussions with the chief secretary, Treasury, and would be bringing amended proposals beforethe Social Services Committee shortly. The problem of the abuse of unemployment benefit by some occupational pensioners had beenconsidered by the National Insurance Advisory Committee, who had made recommendations which, with some modifications, formed thebasis of regulations laid before Parliament by the previous administration. These, however, had been strongly criticised andhad not been approved when Parliament was dissolved. But theabuse was undoubted and was increasing; and occupational pensioners were continuing to register for employment without any intention of accepting a job simply in order to found a claim for bene-fit. His modified proposals retained the main features of the AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendations but also made a number of concessions. The previous Administration^ proposals had causedmuch resentment because occupational pensioners barred fromunemployment benefit would still have been required to pay a fullnational insurance contribution. He proposed to deal with this objection by providing that payment of any such contribution shouldbe voluntary, although those who did not contribute would receive a correspondingly lower retirement pension. He also proposed toraise to  30 a week the income limit at which the test of intention towork applied and to provide that there should be no reduction of benefits to pensioners with less than  18 a week. These modificationswould reduce the expected saving from  3 million a year to  million; but they should render the proposals generally acceptable.He proposed to publish a White Paper setting out his proposals shortly after the Budget Statement and to introduce the necessary Bill atthe end of April or early in May.In discussion there was general acceptance of the suggestedselective improvements. The proposals for restricting the entitlementof some occupational pensioners to unemployment benefit, however,were seen to involve an awkward conflict of principle, since theGovernment were pledged both to deal with abuses of the social security system and to maintain the payment of unemploymentbenefit as of right in return for contributions.In favour of taking the action proposed by the Secretary of Stateit was pointed out that the Government had already announced their intention to stop payment of benefits in respect of the waiting days;suspended workers would soon be losing their right to unemploymentbenefit: and legislation was envisaged to curtail benefits to strikers.-7B*
Moreover, an inquiry into abuses of the social security system would shortly be announced. If, against this background, the Governmentfailed to deal with the abuse of benefit by occupational pensioners,they would be accused of having one law for the rich and another forthe poor. By exempting occupational pensioners from the requirement to pay insurance contributions, they would remove oneof the main grounds of objection to the previous Administration^proposals; and, given the higher income limits now proposed, onlya few thousand pensioners would be directly affected. It would bea mistake to delay tackling the problem; the number of pensionersregistering for employment had trebled in the past two years andwould increase rapidly if no action was taken.On the other hand the proposals would be unpopular with manyof the Governments supporters, who would maintain that theyconstituted a violation of the contributory principle; and their inclusion in the forthcoming National Insurance Bill might evenimperil its passage. It would be argued that pensioners were beingsingled out for attack when the objective should be to deal withindividuals of working age who found it more profitable to rely on social security than to find a job. If taxation of social security benefits proved practicable, this might provide a better way of dealingwith the problem of the well-off pensioner; in the meantime it wouldbe a mistake to embark on provocative measures.In further discussion it was suggested that the Governmentwould be well advised not to announce the proposed inquiry intoabuses of the social security system until they had completed all the direct action proposed and had introduced the Social Security Bill.It was important to avoid a situation in which the proposals in theBill might begin to be publicly discussed before it had even been introduced.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the selective improvements proposed in CP (71) 27and noted that the Secretary of State for Social Services would bebringing before them shortly proposals for changing the contributionstructure. They were not wholly persuaded, however, of the wisdom of his proposals for restricting the right of some occupational pensioners to unemployment benefit; and, although they agreed thatpreparations should go forward on the assumption that theseproposals were acceptable, they would need to consider the matter further before the proposed White Paper was published or the relevant legislation was introduced.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved the selective improvements proposed in CP (71) 27.(3) Agreed to resume consideration of the eligibility of occupational pensioners for unemployment benefit at a future meeting.
SECRETementary 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (71) 28) about the payment of supple-mentary benefits in trade disputes.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that, when theCabinet had decided to reduce from  4 to  1 a week the &quot; disregard &quot;of a strikers personal income in the computation of supplementary benefit payable to his family during a strike and to make supple-mentary benefit paid immediately after a strike repayable, they had also decided to refrain for the time being from proceeding with theproposal to make supplementary benefit paid during a strike recover-able afterwards, although further consideration of this possibility inthe light of developments had not been excluded. During the postaldispute more than  2 million of supplementary benefit had been paidin respect of the families of strikers a sum far greater than had been paid out during all the industrial disputes in the previous year; andin these circumstances he had thought it right to bring the matter before the Cabinet again before a decision was taken to introduce theSocial Security Bill which embodied the Cabinets earlier decisions.But although, if supplementary benefit paid during a strike wereto be recovered, it would be possible to mitigate some of the hardshipinvolved in the repayments by limiting the requirement to repay tothose with relatively high earnings, there were powerful considera-tions against including a recovery provision in the Social Security Bill.First, it would affect not only strikers in the ordinary sense of theword but also those who were laid off through no fault of their ownas a result of a strike. Second, the payment of supplementary benefitwas a marginal consideration in strikes generally; and to enforce itsrepayment was not likely to have any substantial effect as a deterrent.Third, such a provision would tend to alienate moderate opinion,which at present supported the principles of the Industrial relations bill. Finally, it would require additional staff and would entail somedislocation of the normal work of the Department of Health and social Security. For these reasons a provision for recovery wouldbe liable to produce an adverse reaction without yielding any sub-stantial compensating advantage.The Secretary of State for Employment said that, althoughprovision for recovery would affect only long strikes, these weretending to increase in number; and the proposed provision should accordingly have a significant deterrent effect. The degree of hard-ship and bitterness which it would generate would depend on the precise terms of repayment. Given that the objective must be tocreate a deterrent to strikes without withholding necessary assistancefrom the families of strikers, this might be more effectively achieved by generous loans than by reducing the amount of cash grants. if so, however, the &quot; disregard &quot; should not be reduced, as had earlierbeen decided. It was important to seek to compel the trade unions to declare themselves unmistakably for or against a particular strike and, if they supported a strike, to sustain it from their own funds.But to reduce the &quot; disregard &quot; would make it pointless for the unions
to make strike pay in excess of  1 a week to families which coulddraw supplementary benefit, since they could not increase the totalcash resources available to a striker during a strike. The recovery ofbenefit would better serve the purpose of obliging the trade unions to declare themselves.IIn discussion there was general agreement that any proposal which 1had as its object the deterrence of strikes would be successful only if it commended itself to moderate opinion. Many industrial disputes Iwere fomented by militant elements; and the Governments purpose Ishould be to help moderate trade unions to withstand such pressure 1and to acquire greater influence in union decisions. It could be 1argued that provision for the recovery of supplementary benefit paid during a strike would secure this objective by providing moderate :\trade unionists with a convincing reason why a decision should not \be taken to strike except as a last resort and after full deliberation ofthe financial consequences of a strike for the members of the union. 1Moreover, the relief of hardship by means of a loan rather than an foutright grant could not be regarded as unreasonable in principle. 3Indeed, public opinion regarded the present situation as one in which ;the Government were in effect subsidising strikes by the payment of ]supplementary benefit to strikers&apos; families. On the other hand the \effect of a provision for recovery of benefit would be to alienatemoderate trade unionists and to drive them to make common cause with the more militant elements. It would be regarded as a harsh act 1by a Government determined to stop strikes at all costs. This would Ibe the more regrettable in that it could not be maintained that no jstrike was ever justified; but to require the recovery of supplementary ;benefit paid for the purpose of relieving hardship would give the jappearance that the Government were deliberately taking the side of 1employers against employees. The lingering bitterness involved inthe process of recovery after a strike might well tend to prolongstrikes; and it might even become a condition of a settlement that the employer should discharge the supplementary benefit debt.It was also questioned whether the conversion of supplementary \benefit paid for the families of strikers from an outright grant to a :loan would be the best deterrent to industrial action. The reduction Iin the cash payments actually made during a strike might be more )effective. Indeed, it might be possible to reduce the &quot; disregard &quot; jstill further or even to eliminate it entirely; and it was also for con- !sideration whether the present rule under which a relatively large :proportion of capital savings was disregarded should continue to japply in a strike.iIn further discussion, it was suggested that supplementary benefit \payments should be included in annual assessments for income tax purposes. It was argued against this course that the recovery of the tax on such payments would involve considerable practical difficulties, ithat it would not be as effective a deterrent as the recovery of benefit and that it might be held to be wrong in principle to levy tax on \payments which had been calculated to meet specific needs. It was Iargued on the other hand that it should be posssible to make altera- jtions in PA YE codes by a simple reference from the Supplementary
Benefit Commission and that it was unacceptable as a matter ofprinciple that one particular source of income should escape assess-ment for tax. The levying of income tax on supplementary benefitpayments when assessed as part of annual income could not be criticised as discriminatory or unreasonable; and, as a deterrent toill-considered strikes, it should evoke less bitterness and hardshipthan the recovery of supplementary benefits made by way of a loan.The consideration which was currently being given to the structure ofthe PAYE system might result in the elimination of immediate PA YErefunds; but only as a long-term consequence. Further thoughtmight be given to making special provision to defer the payment ofrefunds during a strike, if it were decided that supplementary benefit should be made recoverable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,although it was generally agreed that the objective must be to providea deterrent to strikes which would have the support of moderate opinion in the trade unions and would sustain their position againstmilitant elements, the Cabinet were not agreed on the relative effect for this purpose of the various proposals which they had considered.Further discussion would be assisted by a comprehensive statementof the various courses open to the Government in meeting the objectives which he had described, analysing and assessing the con-sequences of each of them.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion of supplementary benefit in trade disputes at an early meeting.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thepreparation of a statement of the courses open to theGovernment and their consequences.secret. The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in the situationin Northern Ireland; the conclusions reached were separately recorded and circulated only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately on the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.confidential. The Cabinet were informed that the Speaker had givenpermission for a Private Notice Question to be addressed that after-noon to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about theproposed merger between the Daily Mail and the Sketch newspapers.It was agreed that this was not a matter which engaged any Minis-terial responsibility and that the Question should be dealt withaccordingly.
AnnualReviewof theAgriculturalIndustry1971PreviousReference:CM (71) 11thConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL7. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that inthe course of the Farm Price Review the farmers&apos; unions had askedfor an award of at least  150 million. They had indicated that itwould assist them presentationally if the amount could be at least 141 million, although even at that figure they would not be ableformally to agree to the award. On the other hand the cabinet had agreed on 25 February that the total award should not exceed 138 million. An award at this figure should in fact be readilydefensible; and, despite the criticism which it would evoke from the farmers&apos; unions, he did not recommend a higher sum.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the total award should not exceed  138million, even though an extra  3 million might temper the farmers&apos;unions&apos; criticism. If anything, an award of  138 million was likely to appear generous to public opinion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing M.P of their discussion.CivaServiceManpowerPreviousReference :CM (70) 48thConclusions,Minute confidential!8. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the forecast!of Civil Service manpower for 1 April still exceeded the figure ofj500,000 which it had been agreed should be the upper limit as at thaidate. He asked all Ministers in charge of Departments to renew theifiefforts, in collaboration with the Lord Privy Seal, to effect the neceslsary further reduction during the next few weeks.CONFIDENTSCommittees 9.   The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that any majqfof Inquiry      Committee or Commission of Inquiry which was established hence-forward would be liable to take at least two years to discharge ifremit and that any resultant action might therefore be unlikely fproduce results until 1974. Before recommending the appointmelof such inquiries, therefore, Ministers should consider carefully thprobable timescale within which the action required to implemeiitheir recommendations would become effective.
