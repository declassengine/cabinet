1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet considered the timing of the exploratory debate onthe forthcoming White Paper on accession to the European EconomicCommunities (e.c.) and its implications for the business remainingto be transacted before the Recess.The Lord President said that the Opposition had informed theChief Whip that they had it in mind to hold a special Conference ofthe Labour Party on 24 July to consider the issue of accession to the eec, and had asked that the debate should be held in the week beginning 26 July (at the end of which week the House of Commonsmight ordinarily expect to rise for the Summer Recess). The debate could be held earlier only if the White Paper could be published on or about 5 July, as the House would expect adequate time to considerit. Little latitude remained in the Parliamentary programme during july, and, since allowance should be made both for considerationof the White Paper by the Cabinet and for unforeseen contingenciesaffecting Parliamentary business, it might turn out that the debate could not in any event be held earlier than in the week beginning 26July. But if it took place during that week, it would be necessary forthe House to sit during the following week to consider the Lord&apos;samendments to the Industrial Relations Bill, since on the present programme in the House of Lords they would not be ready in timefor earlier consideration by the Commons. He was not committed to an immediate reply to the Opposition, but they were entitled to reasonable time in which to alter their arrangements if theGovernment concluded that the debate on the e.c. must be heldearlier than in the week beginning 26 July. There was advantage in not deciding at this stage on a programme which involved sitting in the first week in August.The Prime Minister, summing up the Cabinet&apos;s discussion ofthese questions, said that while the Cabinet would need adequatetime to consider the content of the White Paper, it was desirable,in order to maintain the momentum of progress, for it to be published as soon as possible after 5 July; but the general view of the cabinet was that, while the options need not be closed at this stage, it wasunrealistic to suppose that there was any strong probability that the debate on accession could be held earlier than the week beginning26, July. If the Government^ timetable on the e.c. debate suited theOpposition, they might be prepared to see more rapid progress made
4 SECRET&apos; (-IP &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; :&apos;-&apos; with the remaining stages of the Industrial Relations Bill in the Houseof Lords, and thus enable the Lords&apos; amendments to be considered inthe Commons before the end of July.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of theCouncil and the Chief Whip to be guided accordingly in further discussions with the Opposition.SECRETOverseaAffairsMaltaPreviousReference:CM (71) 32ndConclusions,Minute 22. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the newPrime Minister of Malta, Mr. Dom Mintoff, whose party had been returned to power with a majority of only one, had already indicated that he intended to make far-reaching changes in Malta&apos;s external relations. The Governor-General had been provoked intoresignation; the resident North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationCommander, Admiral Birindelli, had been declared persona nongrata; a number of Maltese Ambassadors had been dismissed and anoffensively worded message had been received from Mr. Mintoffsaying that unless he was told by 7.00 p.m. that evening that a high-powered delegation would be sent at once to Malta to make ad hocarrangements pending revision of the Financial and DefenceAgreements, the Malta Government would draw its own conclusions.The Minister of State for Defence Procurement said that, as nowplanned, the replacement of the infantry battalion in Malta wouldtake place in July, the advance party of the Royal MarinesCommando Group which would replace it was due to arrive on the island on 28 June and the main body on 19 July, both with families. \In discussion it was pointed out that it was open to Mr. Mintoffto ask for changes in the Agreements to be negotiated; but by hisactions and by asking for ad hoc arrangements to be made forthwithhe had put himself in breach of the Agreements. Our position wouldbe unassailable in law so long as we indicated that we intended to adhere to the Agreements: if Mr. Mintoff wished to change them, he must make proposals. We had given Malta most favourable financial support; our military expenditure there amounted to some  17million per annum and about  13^ million was still available underthe Financial Assistance Agreement. These monies would be lost to Mr. Mintoff if he abrogated the Agreements; at the same time we should probably have to face the loss of about  9 million due indebt repayments to us.  The prime defence consideration was our
interest in ensuring that Malta&apos;s facilities were denied to theRussians; there was an obvious risk that if we were obliged towithdraw completely the Soviet Government would seek to replaceus, although Mr. Mintoff had said he did not wish this to happenand the considerable influence of the Church in Malta would nodoubt be used to oppose it. Our interests would best be served byreplying to Mr. Mintoffs message firmly but politely and not in sucha way as to force him to say that he had abrogated the Agreements;a further consideration was that our NATO allies, including the americans, would expect us to do what we could to protect their interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that a message should be sent to Mr. Mintoff saying that for our part we proposed to adhere to the Agreements we had signed with theprevious Malta Government. We understood that he wished forsome changes to be made and we had therefore instructed our HighCommissioner to return to London immediately in order that these might be discussed with him; we hoped that Mr. Mintoff would explain to Sir Duncan Watson before he left exactly what changeshe wished to propose; these proposals would have our urgent and serious attention. We should not for the time being offer to send out a Minister. There would be advantage in letting the Press knowhow we were handling the affair. The plans for the travel of the advance party, at least, of the Commando group should be allowedto stand, although it might become necessary to delay the arrival in malta of the main body; and plans should be made on a contingencybasis for a situation in which these troops had to be sent elsewhereand the remaining troops withdrawn from Malta, with correspondingarrangements for their families.The Cabinet-CD Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to send a message to Mr. Mintoff on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing up.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Defence Procurement toproceed as indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.136611-3B* 2
Expulsion ofDiplomaticStaff*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the;Cabinet of the circumstances in which he had asked for the;withdrawal of two members of the Soviet Mission in London who;were actively engaged in espionage; in retaliation the SovietGovernment had asked for the withdrawal of two members of thestaff of our Embassy in Moscow. These were the latest in a longseries of incidents of this kind; the Soviet Government were knownto maintain a very large number of intelligence officers in theirEmbassy and Trade Mission in London and the time was comingwhen some more drastic action might need to be taken against these people, who did us considerable harm. He had raised the question with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, some months ago,but without result. He was now consulting the Home Secretaryabout possible courses of action in London and would be reportingfurther to his colleagues on the matter. In recommending actionaccount would be taken of the need not to disturb Anglo-soviet relations too seriously at a time when there was a prospect of making progress on the conclusion of an agreement on Berlin.The Cabinet-Took note of the  statement  by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.EuropeanEconomicCommunitiesPreviousReference:CM (71) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3SECRET3. The Prime Minister said that he and his colleagues wishedto congratulate the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster mostwarmly on the results achieved at the decisive meeting in Luxembourgon 22-23 June.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, subject tosome minor problems remaining to be settled at Deputies&apos; level,satisfactory arrangements had now been negotiated for UnitedKingdom accession to the European Coal and Steel Community(ECSC). He had agreed that the United Kingdom should pay 57million units of account (approximately  24 million) in three equalannual instalments into the accrued reserve funds of the ECSC. the ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe had agreed thatthis sum was very reasonable substantially less than the sum whichthe Government had been advised by a British firm of accountantsthey could reasonably be asked to pay.   The money would be
deposited in the United Kingdom and most, if not all of it, wouldbe spent in this country. Agreement had also been reached that theUnited Kingdom would have the same representation in the institutions of the Community as Germany and France. The votingarrangements which we had accepted would provide the fourapplicant States with a sufficient number of votes between them to block any proposal which required a qualified majority.1 The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, continuing, said that new Zealand dairy products and the United Kingdom contributionto Community finance had been considered together. On NewZealand dairy products the first proposal from the Community wasa substantial improvement on anything which the FrenchGovernment had previously been prepared to offer but was unacceptable. He had then worked out with Mr. Marshall, the deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, counter proposals whichhad been put to the Six. The eventual settlement followed very closely these proposals. It provided guaranteed access in the fifthyear after United Kingdom entry for 80 per cent of New Zealandbutter quotas before entry and for 20 per cent of existing trade forcheese. The guarantee for butter and cheese in the fifth year wouldcorrespond to 71 per cent of the milk equivalent of New Zealand&apos;sbutter and cheese trade in the United Kingdom market before entry.Although the guarantee under these arrangements for cheese was verymuch less than for butter this was acceptable to the New zealand government which rightly expected to be able to continue to sellNew Zealand cheese in the United Kingdom in quantitiessubstantially in excess of the quantities guaranteed. There wouldbe a review of the position during the third year after UnitedKingdom entry in which the New Zealand situation would be studied in the light of criteria to which the New Zealand Government hadattached importance. In the light of this review the community would decide on suitable measures to ensure continuation after 1977of special arrangements for New Zealand butter and cheese. TheCommunity had made it clear that the detailed arrangements after1977 would, in accordance with normal Community practice, haveto be decided unanimously by all the members of the Community.However, the need for unanimity had not been referred to in the text of the New Zealand solution but would be recorded in theproces verbal of the conference. Mr. Marshall had expressed himself as satisfied with the above aspects of the agreement but objected tothe further proposal that the guaranteed price at which these saleswould be made after United Kingdom entry were to be based on average prices for New Zealand dairy produce in the UnitedKingdom market during the period 1969 to 1972.   It proved
impossible to secure any improvement on this latter point and, iindeed, on the basis of the present exceptionally high prices for jNew Zealand butter which were expected to continue for some time jit had been estimated that New Zealand export earnings in the \United Kingdom market in 1973 and in 1974 would be substantially iin excess of their earnings here in the year just ended. If a world ishortage of butter continued New Zealand could expect to export at \above the prices guaranteed by the enlarged Community; on the other hand if conditions of world surplus returned she was being 1offered a minimum guaranteed price, generous in relation to past 1experience, for guaranteed access for substantial quantities of butter 1and cheese. IJOn Community finance, the Chancellor of the Duchy of ILancaster had agreed to a United Kingdom contribution of 8-64 Iper cent of the Community budget in the first year of entry, rising 1to 18-92 per cent in the fifth year. Thereafter there would be two Jfurther years in which our financial contribution would continue 1to be limited before we were required to adopt the ressources propres 1system in full in the eighth year after entry. It would be recalled Jthat last December he had proposed to the Community that wefshould pay 3 per cent in the first year rising to 15 per cent in the Ififth. At that time the Commission were suggesting a first year 1contribution of 15 per cent rising to 25 per cent (or, as an alternative, 121-5 per cent in the first year rising more gradually). Our net!contribution, after allowing for expected receipts, could be expected 1to amount to approximately  100 million in the first year of Imembership rising to  200 million in the fifth year. This compared iwith the estimate he had given last December that 3 per cent rising Jto 15 per cent would cost us  30 million net rising to  180 million. 1The difference in the last year was small because the forecasts of the 1future size of the Community budget had been significantly reduced!in the light of more recent estimates, the disappearance of a large!part of the Community&apos;s agricultural surpluses and the maintenance!of farm prices almost unchanged for the last four years. The cost!of our contribution was small in relation to the resources which/iwould be generated if our rate of growth over the first five yearn Iof entry were to accelerate from, say, 3 to 3% per cent a year. Asmregards the interim period between United Kingdom signature ofma treaty of accession and membership, agreement had been reached!!on provisions for full consultation about any new Community rules Jor regulations under consideration. On hill farming, we had secured!!an understanding with the Community which would enable thel!Government to give an assurance that we would be able to continuesour present arrangements for assistance to hill farming, alwaysjl
assuming that the British Government wished to continue to providethis assistance in its present form. Unfortunately, it had not proved possible in the time available to reach an agreement on an amendment to the common fisheries policy. Accordingly it had beenagreed with the Community that negotiations about this would takeplace at a meeting between the Six and the four applicants together on 12 July. He hoped this would enable a satisfactory solution tobe found before the forthcoming White Paper was debated in theHouse of Commons. Meanwhile he would continue to make it clearthat the United Kingdom considered it necessary to modify thecommon fisheries policy so as to protect the British six-mile limit.In a brief discussion there was general agreement that theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had succeeded in negotiatingmost satisfactory terms. It was urged that the Government shouldcommend the arrangements as satisfactory and should not take a defensive line, for example, that we had done the best that could have been expected for New Zealand. Criticism could be expected of the lack of any special arrangements for Australia but in rebuttalattention should be drawn to the general safeguard clause in theagricultural transitional arrangements which would safeguardAustralia and other third country suppliers if these arrangementsled to or threatened serious disruption of their trade. As regardsCommunity finance, it would be important to consider carefully the presentation in the White Paper of our contribution in the first year or two of membership. The Government could make it clear thatthey had accepted the need to make a rather larger first yearcontribution than otherwise in order to secure satisfactory terms for new Zealand. In his Parliamentary statement that afternoon theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would be obliged to givefigures of the estimated cost of our contribution to Communityfinance but should explain that any overall economic assessmentincluding an assessment of other costs of entry must wait on thepublication of the forthcoming White Paper. We could defend theabsence of an agreement on fisheries policy by the fact that the final arrangements were dependent on the interests of the other threeapplicants for membership as well as of the United Kingdom; anattempt would accordingly be made to settle the problem at ameeting of the Ten on 12 July.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
PublicExpenditureEducation4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on public expenditure to 1975-76 (CP (71) 68 and73) and other memoranda dealing with expenditure on the health and personal services, legal advice and assistance; the educationalbuilding programmes for the years 1973-74 to 1975-76, and voluntarysocial service (CP (71) 69 to 72).The Prime Minister said that the Secretary of State for education and Science sought an early decision on the proposals in her memorandum CP (71) 71, to enable her to announce the sizeliof the primary schools improvements programme for 1973-74 at,the conference of the Association of Education Committees onj&apos; i 25 June. The Cabinet should therefore consider that memorandunjfirst. Since the Cabinet could not complete their consideration thaiday of the memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerJ(CP (71) 68) about public expenditure to 1975-76 discussion of ilshould be deferred to the following week.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that thel1971 Report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESCIrecorded that the agreed school building programme for England!in 1972-73 included starts of  40-1 million for the replacement andljimprovement of old schools, but that thereafter the replacement and ^improvement element was restricted to  11-3 million in each yearjjThe higher figure for the 1972-73 programme represented Jgredeployment of only  28 million out of the savings of  102 million.&apos;,&apos;:which had been realised from the education budget last year. Ndlincrease had been allowed for 1973-74 and subsequent years, although!the savings which had been achieved by increasing school meal&apos;1&apos;:charges and further education fees and curtailing the scope of free]school milk were of a continuing nature. The scale of the problemof replacing old primary schools was formidable, and to mainlainthe momentum and satisfy undertakings given at the time of the last;Election she considered that additional starts of  34 million should:be added for each of the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76. This would)generate expenditure of  96 million during the period covered by the&quot;1971 PESC survey.  The Secretaries of State for Scotland and fotjWales were seeking corresponding increases, costing  11-8 million an! 9 million respectively during the survey period.  To facilitate the;adoption of these proposals she was prepared to restrict the plannedgrowth of university education by at least 20,000 student places nj1976-77, with some accompanying reduction in postgraduate places&apos;;producing a total saving of  105 million during the survey period;This might however lead to additional demands on further education;
costing  10 million, and she also wished to improve standards forpolytechnics and colleges of further education, at a total (GreatBritain) cost of  22 - 8 million. In sum, she was asking the Cabinet toagree that the proposed savings of  105 million on universityexpenditure should be used first to provide starts of  45-2 million for primary school improvements in England in 1973-74,corresponding expenditure in Scotland and Wales, and the proposedadditional expenditure on further education; and that the balance ofthe savings should be augmented by  44-3 million to enable the same level of starts for primary school improvements to be sustained in1974-75 and 1975-76.In discussion, it was argued that when reductions had been madein public expenditure last year, it had been stressed that whilecharges would be increased, this would make possible improvements in social programmes such as hospitals and schools. The methodsthat had been adopted to achieve savings in the education budgetwere exposing the Government to considerable criticism, whichmight well be increased when an announcement was made about thelower take-up of school meals. Such criticism could only be satisfactorily answered by pointing to a substantial and continuingprogramme of improvement in primary schools. On the other hand,the purpose of the 1970 public expenditure decisions had been toobtain an overall reduction in public expenditure to enable taxationto be reduced: this purpose would be frustrated if all of the savingsrealised were made available to Departments to finance additional expenditure. Planned expenditure on education was still rising faster than public expenditure as a whole. The memorandum which hadbeen circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP (71) 68),which the Cabinet would be considering during the main discussion on public expenditure, suggested that in the light of the present economic prospects any additional public expenditure commitmentsaccepted now would need to be balanced by equivalent savings. Ifincreased expenditure was authorised of an amount higher than the savings at present proposed, the Chancellor would therefore wish to seek the co-operation of spending Ministers to find offsetting savings.In particular, the possibility of increasing the savings from university education should not be excluded, and the proposed additional expenditure on further education should also be further examined.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that in order to meet criticism of the decisionsannounced last year, it was necessary to be able to point to a continuing programme of primary school improvements to follow upthe start which had been made for 1972-73. The proposals of the
Secretary of State for Education and Science in CP (71) 71 would however involve a net addition to public expenditure, and the;&apos;Chancellor of the Exchequer had indicated that during the Cabinefssubsequent discussions he would wish to examine the possibility offoffsetting this by savings from within the whole field of public!expenditure, including the possibility of increasing the amount of the 1savings to be found from the universities, and a reconsideration of 1the proposed provision for further education. On this understanding, 1and having regard to the savings which the Secretary of State was Iprepared to make on university expenditure, the Cabinet could agree Ito the proposed increase in the primary school improvements 1programme, except that the additional funds mentioned in paragraph I10(b) of CP (71) 71 should be reduced from  44-3 million to  40 Jmillion.  The Secretary of State for Education and Science and the!Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales should agree with!the Chief Secretary, Treasury, revised figures for starts for the years.1973-74 to 1975-76, consistent with this modification of their proposals.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of theirJfdiscussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office,24 June, 1971.
