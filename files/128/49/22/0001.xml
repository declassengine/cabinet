SubjectVehicle and General Insurance Company
132985-3B*The Prime Minister said that when the Department of Tradeand Industry became aware in November 1970 that the contents of certain Departmental documents about the affairs of the Vehicleand General Insurance Company had become known withoutauthority to a third party, an immediate Departmental investigationhad been put in hand. This had failed to elucidate how theinformation came to be disclosed; and the matter had then beenreported to the police and subsequently to the Director of public prosecutions. As a result the Attorney-General had directed that further inquiries should be made; and these had now been carriedas far as was possible. The Attorney-General, having consideredall the information resulting from these investigations, had decided not to institute proceedings under Section 2 of the Official secrets act, 1911; and he proposed to announce his decision later that morning.A number of questions now arose. First, it might be askedwhether the Directors of the Company had acted improperly intheir management of the Company&apos;s affairs. This was already thesubject of;an inquiry initiated by the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry under the Companies Act, 1948; and this inquiry should clearly be allowed to follow its normal course. Second, itwould be desirable to review the relations between the Governmentand the Company over the period of time since the date whenthe Government first thought it necessary to concern themselvesclosely with the Company&apos;s affairs. An application had already beenmade to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in this context. Third, it was clearly necessary, in the light of the Attorney-GeneraFs decision, to inquire further into the circumstances in whichconfidential information about the affairs of the Company had been disclosed or obtained. Fourth, it must be established whether, inthe knowledge that it had been disclosed, the Department of Tradeand Industry were nevertheless right to continue to deal with theCompany&apos;s affairs without apparent reference to that fact. Finally,it was necessary to ensure that the measures in force for theprotection of confidential commercial information in the possessionof Departments were adequate; and steps were currently being takento review them.In consultation with the Ministers principally concerned, he had considered how these interrelated questions, apart from the first,would best be made the subject of authoritative inquiry. It hadbeen judged inappropriate to refer the disclosure of information to the! Security Commission, since the Commission^ function related to national security and not to the protection of commercialinformation.  To appoint a single judge to inquire into the issues
involved would be unlikely to carry conviction, not least because the judge would have no power to require the production of evidence.The appointment of a Select Committee of the House of commons would not be a satisfactory means of arriving at an authoritativejudgment, since the questions at issue would inevitably becomematters of Party debate.    Indeed, the Royal Commission onTribunals of Inquiry had recommended strongly against the appoint-ment of Parliamentary Select Committees for inquiries of this nature.It seemed, therefore, that the only appropriate course would be toappoint a Tribunal of Inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, with terms of reference which would include,first, the question whether, and if so by whom, the informationinvolved had been improperly disclosed or obtained and whether any use had been made of this information for private advantage;second, the question whether there had been any negligence ormisconduct by persons in the service of the Crown directly or indirectly responsible for the discharge, in relation to the companies concerned, of functions under the Insurance Companies Acts,1958-67; and, third, the question whether there was any evidencethat the interests of policyholders or shareholders of those companies had been adversely affected as a result of any impropriety,negligence or misconduct which might be found to have occurred.The Tribunal would not examine the conduct of the Directors of thecompany in relation to their management of its affairs, which would remain the subject of the inquiry under the Companies Act.Although an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,1921, had been generally accepted as precluding in practice theinstitution of criminal proceedings in relation to the matters withwhich it dealt, that was not the case in relation to an inquiry underthe Companies Act; and, if that inquiry indicated that offences hadbeen committed in relation to the Company&apos;s management of itsown affairs, it would be possible to institute the necessary criminal proceedings.1 The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he fullyconcurred in the course of action proposed by the^ Prime Minister.In discussion there was general agreement that the appointmentof a Parliamentary Select Committee would be an inappropriatemethod of dealing with the issues involved and that it would be rightto establish a Tribunal under the 1921 Act immediately. TheCabinet then considered the terms of a statement to be made by the-Prime Minister in the House of Commons that afternoon,announcing the Governments decision. The following main points were made:(a) It might help to counter any suggestion that the establish-ment of a Tribunal was itself an indication that something
.    Cabinet Office,I    27 April, 1971.CONFIDENTIALdiscreditable had necessarily occurred, if it were made plain thatthe Tribunal was being set up in the public interest and in defenceof honest administration.(b) If, as proposed, the Tribunal was to inquire whether therewas any evidence that the interests of policyholders or shareholdershad been adversely affected, the Government might be asked whatredress would be available to those concerned if such evidence were found. It was recognised, however, that no statement could be madeon this issue until the result of the Tribunals inquiry was known.(c) The Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry had recommended that the practice whereby the Attorney-Generalnormally appeared before the Tribunal to present the evidenceshould not continue. The Tribunal which had subsequentlyinquired into the Aberfan disaster, however, had requested the attorney-General of the Labour Government to assist them; andthe Attorney-General therefore proposed to ask the Tribunalwhether they wished him to appear.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a Tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 Act shouldbe appointed forthwith. He would announce this decision in theHouse of Commons that afternoon in the terms which the cabinet had generally approved in discussion. The Lord President and theLord Privy Seal should arrange for the necessary Resolutions underthe 1921 Act to be tabled that day, with a view to both Houses ofParliament being asked to approve them on the following day. Itwas usual for a Judge of the High Court to be appointed as chairmanof the Tribunal and to be assisted by two Queen&apos;s Counsel. TheLord Chancellor had been considering possible candidates; and itwould be desirable that a decision should be reached, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and himself, in time for it to be announced on the day following the passing of the Resolutions.- The Cabinet-Agreed that a Tribunal of Inquiry should be appointed under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, on thebasis indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
