secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theconstitutional deadlock between the East and West Wings of Pakistanpersisted. President Yahya Khan had flown to Dacca in an attemptto promote a compromise between the Central Government and theAwami League, who were in effective control of the East Wing. Itwas doubtful whether, if this attempt failed, the control of the CentralGovernment could be reasserted by deployment of the army. Some250 members of the British community in East Pakistan had now been evacuated; it was not proposed to attempt to withdraw any more forthe time being.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as a resultof the change of Government in Australia, Mr. Gorton had beenappointed Minister of Defence. He was known to have been critical of the concept of a forward defence policy for Australia; but we might hope that the arrangements to establish a Five-Power militarypresence in South-East Asia were sufficiently advanced to make it unlikely that his new appointment would disrupt them.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the cabinet of certain arrangements which would become necessary following the deployment in Germany of Buccaneer aircraft which, unlike their predecessors, would carry British nuclear weapons. We should be under an obligation to consult (but not to secure the agreement of) theFederal Government of Germany before taking a decision to use these weapons; and a &quot; hot line&quot;, permitting instant and securecommunication between London and Bonn, would be installed forthis purpose. No announcement about this precaution would bemade, however, until after the Prime Ministers meeting in thefollowing week with the Federal German Chancellor, Herr Brandt.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported theconclusion of a new offset agreement with the Federal GermanGovernment. They had agreed to make budgetary payments to usamounting to  12-5 million a year for five years from 1 April, 1971.In return, we had undertaken to pay our full contribution of 6-5 million a year to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationinfrastructure programme. From our point of view this arrangementrepresented a significant improvement on its predecessors.8b*1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet considered the tactics to be adopted by theGovernments spokesmen in dealing with the Industrial Relations Billin the House of Lords if the Bill was to be returned to the Houseof Commons in time to enable them to give proper consideration tothe Lords&apos; amendments.
rhodesia previous reference:CM (71) 5thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the courseof a further exchange of messages Mr. Ian Smith, the leader of the regime in Salisbury, had claimed that the 1969 Rhodesian Constitu-tion could be held to be consistent with our Five Principles. Thisgave us a possible opening for exploring further the possibility of finding a basis for a settlement of the Rhodesian problem; and it was proposed that emissaries from London and Salisbury should nowmeet for the purpose. It would be very desirable to try to keep this development strictly confidential, although it might not prove possibleto do so since there had already been Press speculation on the subject.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.Negotiationswith theEuropeanEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (71) 8thConclusions,Minute 3The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that at their meeting on 15 March the Council of the European Economic Com-munity (e.c.) had failed to reach agreement on a common negotiating position on the three major issues Commonwealth sugar, NewZealand dairy products, the United Kingdom contribution to community finance and in consequence no progress had been madeat the Ministerial meeting which he had with the Six on 16 March.The Six&apos;s failure to agree on a common negotiating position had been due to French intransigence. It was no bad thing that the french had isolated themselves in this way and could not blame their isolationon the United Kingdom. It was clear that the French government attached considerable importance to satisfactory arrangements beingmade for their agricultural exports to the United Kingdom duringthe transitional period: we should have to be prepared with a suitableoffer on this as part of, but not before, the settlement of the major issues in the negotiations. M. Schumann, the French ForeignMinister and present Chairman of the e.c. Council, had accepted on16 March that the Community would seek to make proposals to uson Community finance as soon as they could: this was a shift fromthe previous French position that the Community should make nocounter proposals on Community finance before we had improved onour original offer. He had obtained the agreement of the Six to additional Ministerial meetings in May with the objective of seeking to resolve all major outstanding issues in the course of that month.In the interval, the Prime Minister would be visiting the federal german Chancellor and he himself would be visiting The Hagueand Rome and he hoped that further bilateral exchanges could bearranged.In discussion it was suggested that those opposed to UnitedKingdom membership of the enlarged Community were nowconvinced that no acceptable terms for entry could be negotiated andthe morale of those in favour of entry had been correspondinglylowered. Unless early progress was made in the negotiations the battle for public opinion could be lost. On the other hand it wassuggested that the French Government were adopting an extremely
hard line now in the hope of extracting the maximum concessions from the United Kingdom. Despite the problems of morale andpublic opinion, the Government must not be rattled into makingunnecessary concessions.The Cabinet (2) Took note.secret. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thenegotiations between the Libyan Government and the oil companies were continuing and that the companies&apos; representatives were returning to Tripoli that day with a slightly improved offer. There was littleground for believing that it would be found more attractive by the libyan Government. It was perhaps significant, however, that therewere now rumours of possible differences of opinion between the four governments for whom they were acting.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.secret. The Cabinet discussed Northern Ireland; the conclusions reached were separately recorded and circulated only to The Queen,the Prime Minister and those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.secret. The Secretary of State for Defence said that the original proposals made to the Lockheed Corporation as a basis for continuingdevelopment and production of the RB 211 engine had been rejected by the Corporation. United Kingdom officials, together with repre-sentatives of Rolls-Royce, were leaving that day to resume discussions with the Corporation in order to ascertain whether agreement couldbe reached on new proposals. Our revised offer which had beenapproved by the Ministers directly concerned, meeting under thechairmanship of the Prime Minister, was as follows:(a) The United Kingdom would accept responsibility for all further costs involved in the development of the RB211 engine to42,000 lb. thrust.(b) The Lockheed Corporation would accept a price increase of 150,000 per engine over the price originally negotiated., (c) There would be no claims for delay in supplying the RB 211under the original contract with Rolls-Royce.8b*2
(d) There would be a firm warranty frOm the banks or the UnitedStates Administration for reimbursement of further moneycontributed to the development and production of the RB 211 engineby the Government after 3 February, 1971, if for financial reasons-but not by reason of technical failure the TriStar project were subsequently abandoned.If the Lockheed Corporation accepted these terms, there shouldbe no loss on production and the Government could expect to recoversome part of the launching cost from sales of spares. If a warrantyon the lines indicated at (d) above were not provided, however, theGovernment would be at risk to the extent of some  200 million.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the new proposals to be madeby Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the Lockheed corporation for development and production of the RB211 engine.confidential industrial 6.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that the totalAffairs registered unemployment shown by the March count was 754,000Unemployment and the increase since the February count on a seasonally adjustedbasis was 34,000. Identifiable redundancies were also higher thanat the same time in recent years; and there had been a fall in reportedvacancies. All these indications suggested that the level of unemploy-ment was still rising.Current Pay The Secretary of State for Employment said that the Ford MotorNegotiations    Company were standing firm on their offer of a pay increase of 14 perand Disputes   cent an(j ^qj-q were grounds for hoping that the strike might shortlybegin to crumble. A similar offer by Vauxhall&apos;s however, had been rejected by the workers; and, since the company&apos;s competitive position was too weak for them to face a strike, they were likely to make anincreased offer in due course. In the railway negotiations the three ?,unions were to meet on 19 March to consider their attitude to the :British Railways Board&apos;s offer of a 9 per cent increase. Meanwhile, however, it appeared that the Board might be allowing it to become jknown that the offer might later be raised to 10 per cent. Following 1the rejection by the teachers of an offer of a 9 per cent increase, fincorporating pay restructuring, the Chairman of the Burnham Com-1mittee had written to ask for arbitration and he had asked both sides fto nominate members.  It was still uncertain whether the teachers&apos;!representatives would be ready to accept arbitration.  Teachers in IScotland, who had had their pay scales restructured last year, had!accepted an increase of 8  per cent. The Post Office Board and the IUnion of Post Office Workers had each nominated a member to the 1&quot; Committee of Settlement &quot; which was to make recommendations for 1settling the dispute on the pay of postal workers. But agreement hadinot yet been reached on the appointment of the Chairman. 1The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the!Secretary of State for the Environment should establish whether the british Railways Board had allowed it to be suggested that they Iintended to raise their pay offer; and if so, he should make appropriate!representations to the Board. j
The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to take appropriate action with the British Railways Board asindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.SECRET7. The Secretary of State for Employment said it appeared that the call by the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers(AUEW) and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU)for a one-day strike that day in protest against the Industrial relations bill had won a general, if reluctant, response from the membership.Although a politically motivated strike of this kind might be open to action at law, it would be unwise for the Government to encouragelegal action, which could all too easily enable those against whom itwas directed to be represented as martyrs. Individual trade unionistswere not well placed to distinguish whether an official strike calledby their union was lawful or not; it was difficult for them to stand out against an official union instruction, even if they were out of sympathy with it; and to condemn them for obeying it would seem inconsistent with the Governments general aim of promoting greater self-discipline in industrial affairs.In discussion, while there was general agreement that theGovernment should not themselves either condemn participants inthe one-day strike or instigate legal action against them, concern was expressed about the action taken by some unions in fining members who disobeyed the call for a strike. If, as appeared probable, thestrike was itself unlawful, it would seem indefensible to allow suchaction to go unchallenged; and it was suggested that indirect means should, if possible, be found to encourage a non-striker who had beenfined to test the validity of the fine in the courts.In further discussion it was questioned whether the industrial relations Bill, by removing present rights of redress in tort, mighthave the effect of withdrawing a remedy against the unions who finedmembers for refusing to take part hi any future political strike.Concern was also expressed that the Union of Post Office workers had reserved its right to fine union members who had remained atwork during the recent postal strike, despite the understandingreached at the end of the strike that there should be no victimisation.The Cabinet were informed, however, that where, as in the case ofthe Post Office, there was no closed shop, the fact that a worker couldleave his union if he felt that he had been victimised constituted areasonable safeguard against unreasonable use by the unions of their powers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Employment should re-examine the provisionsof the Industrial Relations Bill in order to ensure that they would nothave the effect of making a politically motivated strike lawful andwould uphold the rights of union members who were fined for refusing to participate in such a strike to challenge the imposition ofthe fine in the courts. He should report the outcome to the Cabinet.
AgriculturalInterimImport LeviesPreviousReference:CM (71) 12thConclusions,Minute 7.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to re-examinethe effect of the Industrial Relations Bill on the status ofpolitically motivated strikes and on the rights of thosepenalised by the unions for refusing to participate in them,and to report the outcome to the Cabinet.confidential. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that,following intensive negotiation with the other Governments concerned and in particular with the United States Government, agreement had recently been reached on satisfactory terms for the introduction of interim levy schemes for imports of cereals, beef and veal, mutton and lamb and minor milk products. Discussion had still to becompleted with the Argentine Government; but these should not materially affect the position. He had accordingly informed theHouse of Commons on the previous day that import levy schemes would be introduced for these commodities on 1 July.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statementMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.by theAircraftIndustryConcordePreviousReference:CM (70) 19thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of aviation Supply (CP (71) 31), to which was attached a note by officials on the Concorde aircraft project.The Minister of Aviation Supply said that M. Chamant, theFrench Minister of Transport, would be visiting London on 29 Marchfor the review of the Concorde aircraft project which the cabinet had requested at their meeting on 17 September, 1970. The Mach 2tests had now taken place; but not all the information required for a fundamental review was yet available. We could be reasonablyconfident that a 20,000 lb. payload could-be achieved when theaircraft came into service; but the prospects of achieving the furthertarget payload of 25,000 lb. two years later were still uncertain. Thegreatest uncertainties related to the noise problem. The design aimfor the noise level of the aircraft had not yet been met; and there wasalso the risk that noise standards at United States airports mightbe made more severe. The commercial prospects were not yetappreciably clearer. For these reasons there remained no case for proceeding with Concorde on purely economic grounds. Evenif all existing expenditure was written off, the continuation of the project would on the most favourable assumptions result insubstantial losses. On the other hand, cancellation would be a seriousblow to the aircraft industry; and some 23,000 individuals would be
made redundant. There was no sign of any weakening of the Frenchcommitment to the project; and a unilateral withdrawal by ourselveswould be liable to sour our relations with the French Government ata time when these were of particular importance in connection withour application for membership of the European economic community (e.c.). Unless the French authorities were prepared toabandon the project, which seemed very unlikely, the choice beforeus was to withdraw unilaterally now or to seek a postponement of thefundamental review on the grounds that not all the relevant informa-tion was yet available. In present circumstances the latter appearedto be the only practicable course. If it was approved, he would propose to inform M. Chamant that we wished to postpone the review until firm advice was available on the payload and noise levelof the aircraft and there was a clearer picture of the commercial prospects. He would indicate that this pointed to a review aboutthe turn of the year but that we would discuss the precise timing withthe French Government in the autumn, when we should have a more precise estimate of progress in these respects. He would alsore-emphasise the British view that the manufacturers should not beallowed to quote a selling price below $33 million without theapproval of the two Governments; and, if M. Chamant was notprepared to accept this, he would reserve the British position.The Attorney-General said that the Anglo-French Memorandumof Understanding contained no provision for unilateral withdrawal.The exchange of correspondence between the British and french ministers concerned in 1968, however, had identified the completionof the Mach 2 tests as the point at which a decision was to be taken on the continuation of the project based on commercial prospects.If we were to withdraw unilaterally now, we should therefore do soin the circumstances best enabling us to defend our decision, ifnecessary, before the International Court; and the prospects could perhaps be assessed at 60/ 40 in our favour. Any decision to continuethe project beyond the forthcoming meeting, however, would be liable to result in a substantial erosion of our position. an unqualified decision to continue in the circumstances now prevailingwould imply that we could no longer rely on those circumstances as justifying a later withdrawal, which could then be based only on somefundamental change of circumstances. If, however, it could be reasonably maintained that the information was not yet available onwhich a fundamental review following the Mach 2 tests could bebased and that the moment for such a review had therefore not yet arrived, a postponement of the review would at least enable thearguments now available to us to be used at that subsequent point,although they would have been substantially weakened by the furtherpassage of time.In discussion it was pointed out that since the last review by theCabinet the total estimated cost of research and development had risen by  84 million, of which  38 million was attributable to higher prices and  46 million was an increase in real terms; and it was likely to rise still further. In addition to the  300 million which we
had already spent or committed, the discounted loss if we continued )with the project was unlikely to be less than  150 million and could jbe more than  200 million. The British Overseas Airways Corpora-tion (BOAC) claimed that the introduction of Concorde in their ;services would reduce their profitability, and it was likely that, before being willing to place orders for it, they would demand aiGovernment subsidy as well as making their orders conditional on jthe noise level of the aircraft being acceptable at airports.   The french Government were not supporting our view that the aircraft \should be offered at the figure of $33 million, which had been agreed jby British and French officials as covering the present estimated costs jof production.   The public expenditure forecasts for development jand production of Concorde now exceeded the provision in the public Iexpenditure White Paper (Cmnd. 4578); and the position would be fworse if future developments made it impossible to sell aircraft which we had manufactured.   The contingency reserve for public expenditure generally was already heavily overdrawn for 1970-71and 1971-72.   It could not be regarded as absolutely certain thatthe French would treat a withdrawal from Concorde as justifying a break in the e.c. negotiations; and the French Minister of Financehad in fact expressed the hope that, if we wished to terminate jointprojects, we would say so openly. On the other hand it was argued ithat a move from subsonic to supersonic transport represented atechnological breakthrough which made it difficult to form an accurate assessment of future demand and profitability. The French fGovernment appeared genuinely to believe that the commercial ,prospects were better than we supposed; and the estimates made byBOAC might be unduly pessimistic.  The prospects for the use ofairports in the United States would be affected by the decisions taken ion the proposed United States supersonic aircraft; and by the timeConcorde entered service the Russian supersonic aircraft would iprobably also be in service on the Moscow/Tokyo route, which would jmake it difficult for United States airlines to refuse to invest in super-sonic aircraft.  A unilateral withdrawal now would have a serious -effect on the e.c. negotiations at a crucial stage. Coming so shortly ;after the bankruptcy of Rolls-Royce, it would also have a damaging ;effect on the assessment by other countries of the reliability of the !British Government and of British industry.   In agreeing to jcontinuation of the project, however, we should take such steps as we i could to maintain our legal position, in order to preserve as much jfreedom of action as possible if the e.c. negotiations were to break 1down or if clear evidence were to become available that only alhandful of Concorde aircraft could be sold. We should also give the french authorities every opportunity at the meeting on 29 March to Iindicate whether they themselves had any doubts about the future 1of the project. IIn further discussion it was suggested that the public expenditure \forecasts were particularly affected by increases in the planned invest- Jment expenditure of nationalised industries. It would be helpful if 1the Cabinet could see an up-to-date assessment of public expenditure, fwith particular reference to the element representing nationalised findustry investment. I
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, inview of the international and industrial implications of withdrawalnow, the Cabinet agreed that there was no practicable alternative tothe course indicated in paragraph 20 (b) of the note attached to cp (71) 31, and that the Minister of Aviation Supply should proceed accordingly in his discussions with M. Chamant on 29 March. Inthese discussions, however, he should be guided by the advice of theLaw Officers in order to preserve as far as possible the British legal position in the event of a subsequent withdrawal. M. Chamantshould also be given an opportunity to indicate if the FrenchGovernment had developed any doubts about the project. TheMinister of Aviation Supply should restate our view that the manu-facturers should not quote a selling price below $33 million without reference to the two Governments; and, if M. Chamant was notprepared to agree with this, our position should be reserved. in preparation for the postponed review it would be necessary to have further information about the payload, noise level and cost ofproduction of the aircraft, and about the intentions of BOAC andAir France. The Central Policy Review Staff should keep a continuing watch on the progress of the project and should prepare a fresh assessment of its prosoects in the autumn as a basis for afurther examination by the Cabinet. The Chief Secretary, Treasury,should circulate a note to the Cabinet for information, giving thelatest forecasts of public expenditure, including the position of the contingency reserve and the planned level of investment bynationalised industries.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Ministerof Aviation Supply to be guided accordingly in his forth-coming discussions with M. Chamant.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation Supply, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to obtain further information on the aspects of the Concorde projectindicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theCentral Policy Review Staff to prepare an assessment ofthe Concorde project in the autumn as a basis for a further examination by the Cabinet at that time.(4) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to circulate a memo-randum to the Cabinet, indicating the changes in thepublic expenditure forecasts since the publication of cmnd. 4578, with particular reference to the investment expenditure of the nationalised industries.CONFIDENTIAL10. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that hehad been engaged in discussions with the British Steel Corporation(BSC) and private sector steel interests about the structure of the steelindustry.  Nationalisation had created anomalies in the boundary
between the public and private sectors; and he intended to pursuewith the BSC and the private sector interests how these anomaliesmight best be remedied. There was general agreement, however,among informed opinion (including the private sector of the steelindustry) that, in face of growing competition from Europe and japan, it would be foolish to go against the world trend towardsbigger steel making concerns and large integrated plants by sphttingup the bsc&apos;s basic iron and steel making capacity. This conclusionhad been considered and endorsed by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy; and he now sought the Cabinefs approval to make an early announcement accordingly, in order to end the presentdamaging uncertainty within the industry. It would be helpful if hecould be authorised to do so in his speech during the OppositionSupply Debate on the steel industry that afternoon.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that,before the Cabinet accepted that the bulk iron and steel makingactivities of the BSC should not be split up, they would wish to besatisfied that such a decision was fully justified both on economic grounds and in relation to the Governmenfs policy commitment atthe General Election. It would be preferable, therefore, that theSecretary of State should not refer to the matter in his speech that afternoon but should circulate a memorandum, dealing with both theeconomic and the political aspects of his recommendation, on thebasis of which the Cabinet could consider the matter in greater detail.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry &quot;to circulate an early memorandum on his proposal to main-tain intact the British Steel Corporation^ basic iron andsteel making activities.Cabinet Office,18 March, 1971.
