The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that relations between India and Pakistan had deteriorated further in the past 48 hours. It was clear that Indianregular forces, including tanks, were now engaged with the Pakistanarmy. The Indian representative at the United Nations, however,had rebutted the accusation of aggression made by the pakistan government. It was possible that the matter would now be raised in the Security Council.j The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that it now seemed reasonably certain that some accommodation which we could accept would be reached between the Shah of iran and the Ruler of Sharjah about the Gulf Island of Abu Musa,No progress had been made over the Tunbs Islands; but this problem was I less important;Middle east previous reference :CM (71) 47thConclusions,Minute 2MaltaPreviousReference :CM (71) 47thConclusions,Minute 2He would shortly be making a detailed report on thesituation to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that Arab/Israeli tension continued to mount. The latestspeeches by President Sadat of Egypt had been belligerent and anti-American in tone. We were watching the situation carefully incase the opportunity presented itself for a useful initiative by theUnited Nations.The Cabinet-i (1) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State for; -    Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.; The Secretary of State for Defence said that the Prime Ministerof Malja, Mr. Mintoff, was again showing dissatisfaction with theprogress of Anglo-Maltese negotiations for new defence and financialagreements. A further Ministerial visit to Malta might soon benecessary in order to review progress and to remove any illusionswhidh Mr, Mintoff might still harbour about our negotiating position.&apos;  The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for defence.136638-8

At the otherextreme nearly all the changes immediately required in our lawcould be made in the substantive Bill, leaving relatively little to be accomplished subsequently by subordinate legislation. But thiscourse would result in a Bill of undesirable length and complexity.Accordingly, after considering the matter with the other ministers concerned, he recommended a middle course, whereby the substantivelegislation would contain express provisions on the main mattersof importance and controversy, while less significant issues wouldbe dealt with in subordinate legislation under general powers providedby the main Bill. On this basis it should be possible to reduce thelength of the substantive legislation to about 50 clauses. If it were agreed to proceed in this way, the question would then arise whether these clauses should be embodied in one Bill or in two. The* Previously circulated  5 a Confidential Annex.&apos; 3. - The Secretary of State for Employment said that a reasonably satisfactory basis for a settlement of the official strikeby the Coventry and district toolroom workers had been agreed between the representatives of the engineering employers and ofthe Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. The employershad secured agreement to the abrogation of the Coventry Tool RoomAgreement (CTRA) which had been operating since the last war.They had, however, had to concede the reinstatement of thisagreement until 1 February next year when it was proposed tointroduce a new agreement. It had been noticeable during the last few days that, while the engineering employers directly involved inthe CTRA had taken a firm line throughout, other employers whowere indirectly affected by the dispute had beenurging that almostany settlement would be preferable to a strike.
preliminary view of himself and of the other Ministers concernedwas that a single Bill would be preferable. Accordingly, he invitedhis colleagues to agree that the legislation should be drafted onthe general basis indicated in paragraph 6 of CP (71) 137 and in theform of a single Bill, on the understanding that it would be possibleto split the legislation into two Bills later if this seemed desirable.In. discussion there was general agreement with the middle course recommended by the Lord President. Important changes inthe law, such as the provisions to operate the common agricultural policy and to enable the Import Duties Act to be used for Communitypurposes, could not be made appropriately otherwise than bysubstantive legislation; and the same was true of such sensitivematters as the rights of EUR ATOM joint undertakings to acquire and compulsorily and the rights of Community inspectors to examinedocuments and to enter premises. The omission of such provisions would not, in any event, save time, since amendments would otherwise be put down on these subjects. Final decisions on the precise scope of the legislation need not be taken until later; but inprinciple all suitable opportunities should be taken to reduce itsvolume and to restrict the scope for amendments. For example, thepowers of entry and inspection to be given to Community inspectorsmight be provided by attracting existing powers under Customs and excise legislation.There was also general agreement that the Government should seek to avoid, if possible, a re-opening of the issue of principle onwhich Parliament had already taken a decision; and this was anadditional-argument in favour of a single Bill. On the hypothesisof two Bills it might have been possible to defer the introduction ofthe second to a more opportune moment. But this loss of flexibilityhad to be accepted, on the assumption that it would be open to theGovernment to decide after the Second Reading of the Bill whetherthey should move to apply the guillotine to its subsequent stagesor whether they could command sufficient support for a Motion tosplit the Bill into two parts and to send the second part upstairs.; In further discussion attention was drawn to the importanceof; introducing the legislation immediately after the Christmas Recessin order to provide the maximum time for debate in the period before Easter. All possible pressure was being applied to secure an early settlement of the outstanding issues in the negotiations inorder that the Treaty of Accession might be signed before Christmas;but a certain number of questions remained to be settled. more over it was becoming increasingly doubtful whether the community would be able to complete, by the date of the introduction of ourlegislation, authentication of English texts of Community secondarylegislation, notwithstanding the extra staff which we had lent themfor this purpose.! The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the European legislation should be drafted inthe form of a single Bill, on the basis proposed in paragraph 6 of cp (71) 137.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in
consultation with the Lord President, the Solicitor General and other ministers concerned, should now arrange for the preparation of the&quot;Bill, taking account of the points made in discussion, and should bring a draft text before the Legislation Committee for approvalas early as possible in January, with the aim of introducing the Billimmediately after the Christmas Recess. The Chancellor of the duchy should continue to apply the greatest pressure to securethe signature of the Treaty of Accession before Christmas and, inconsultation with the Lord President, to arrange for the printing and publication of the English texts of the Community&apos;s secondary; legislation which would be required when Parliament considers theBill.The Cabinet (1)  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2)  Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, ini r. consultation with the other Ministers concerned, toarrange accordingly for the preparation of the Bill andfor publication, at the appropriate time, of English texts of the Community&apos;s secondary legislation.rhodesia previous reference:CM (71) 56thConclusions,Minute &apos;2 1&apos;SECRET.; *5 The Cabinet considered a memorandum on the Rhodesiannegotiations by the Solicitor General (CP (71) 138), a letter from theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary to the Prime Minister, dated21 November, and circulated to Ministers under reference PS (71) 39,and two telegrams (Nos. 125 and 126), dated 22 November, fromthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in Salisbury.The Attorney General, who had just returned from Salisburysaid that since his arrival in London he had spoken to the Foreignarid Commonwealth Secretary on the telephone and was thereforeable to provide the Cabinet with an up-to-date appreciation of theposition as it had developed since the circulation of the SolicitorGeneraFs memorandum and the subsequent messages from theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary. As a result of the very manydiscussions which the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary hadbeen able to have with representatives of all shades of African and european opinion in Rhodesia during the preceding week, it had become clear that, with the exception of Mr. Nkomo and some ofthose who had been detained by the Rhodesian regime, the vast majority favoured a settlement. Even though few had high hopes of the outcome, most agreed that it would be preferable to aprolongation of present trends in Rhodesia. Discussions with the rhodesian authorities had resulted in a certain advance on the two main points of difficulty isolated in the Cabinefs previous discussion,i.e., the first and fourth principles (unimpeded progress to majority rule and progress towards ending racial discrimination respectively).On the first, Mr. Ian Smith, the Rhodesian leader, had now accepted
that 10 common roll seats should be created at the point of parity;but he had stipulated that voting for these seats should be such asto permit I&apos; plumping &quot;, i.e., the whole country would be treated asa single constituency and each voter would have 10 votes which hecould bestow on one or more candidates, as he thought fit.   Thisstipulation could have the effect of deferring the attainment of an african majority in Parliament until beyond the first General Electionafter parity.  On the fourth principle Mr. Smith had now accepted a,,j,justiciable Declaration of Rights, designed to deter furtherlegislative discrimination in all fields including land and education.The problem of reversing the discriminatory trends in existing legislation, especially in the matters of land and education, was onewhich would be dealt with more appropriately by the proposedReview Commission than by any provision in the Declaration of rights; and some progress had been made in the arrangements forsuch a Commission, which it had been agreed would include an african  member  to  be  approved  by  the United   KingdomGovernment.   The main problem outstanding concerned the formof the Rhodesian Governmenfs undertaking to give effect to therecommendations of such a Commission.   They could clearly notbind   themselves   to   accept   these   recommendations   in   all circumstances; but an undertaking merely to give &quot; serious regard &quot;&quot; to them would not be considered in many quarters as an acceptablecontribution towards honouring the fourth principle.  The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had put forward a formula underwhich the, Rhodesian Government would undertake to &quot; commend &quot;the Review Commission^ recommendations to the RhodesianParliament; but Mr. Smith had sought to amend this text, which remained one of the main outstanding problems.  In the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s view the settlement now within ourgrasp would offer real opportunities to the African majority.  Thealternative was an almost inevitable tendency towards a Stateorganised on the South African pattern.In,discussion it was recognised that the Foreign and Common-wealth; Secretary and his colleagues had made remarkable and encouraging progress towards finding the basis for a settlement whichwould be defensible as being compatible with the Five Principles.It was generally agreed that the proposed justiciable Declaration of rights would provide adequate safeguards against the enactment of discriminatory legislation in the future and against the extensionby means of subsidiary legislation of existing discriminatorymeasures. , The latter point was of some importance, since it wascustomary in Rhodesia for the scope of legislation to be enlargedin this way. But the fourth principle required progress towardsthe ending of discrimination; and it had to be admitted that themeasure of discrimination existing in Rhodesia at the present time was greater than it had been at the time of the illegal declarationof independence; that the Declaration of Rights did not offer asuitable means of reducing it; and that the best hope of so doinglay in strengthening the Review Commission and ensuring, if possible,that the regime of the day would give effect to its recommendations.It had now been agreed that the Commission would contain an
8 ! : SECRETAfrican member and that its membership would be subject to Britishapproval; but the extent to which the regime could be bound by its recommendations was a major point of substance, which was still under negotiation. Unless a reasonably firm commitment on thispoint could be secured, the settlement would be open to the criticism that it had failed to comply with the fourth principle.In further discussion it was appreciated that discrimination inthe bse of land, if permitted to continue unchecked, would encourage1 the development of apartheid in Rhodesia on the South Africanmodel.  For this reason the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary had been pressing hard for the allocation of an additional definedquantity of land to be made available to the Rhodesian Africans;and it was noted that he had some hope of success. If the Rhodesianregime could be brought to agree to this, it would help us significantlyin the presentation of the settlement although its practical importance,!;;&apos;,    might be slight. A further and connected point of importance wasthe provision of the Land Tenure Act which made the access of;      ,&apos;:; African professional men to European areas dependent upon the;, &apos;   issue of permits by the Rhodesian regime.   This was repugnantto many sections of public opinion in this country and made itdifficult to establish that the fourth principle was being adequatelymet.  It would therefore be desirable to press the regime to meet us on this point.Satisfaction was expressed with the news that the Rhodesiannegotiators had conceded that the constitution might provide forthe creation, after parity, of 10 common roll seats.  The fact thatthis concession had had to be bought at the cost of agreeing that, votes should be &quot; plumped &quot; instead of being cast each for a separatecandidate, however, was regrettable.   This arrangement would favour the well-organised European parties at the expense of theirAfrican counterparts; and it could delay the move from parity tomajority rule for a number of years.   Nevertheless, despiteimperfections  of this  order,  the  current proposals  probably.   ,   represented the best which could be obtained from Mr. Smith&apos;sregime; and, since there would be no alternative Rhodesian authority in the foreseeable future with which the Government could hope to negotiate more favourable terms, it would be right to authorisethe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to accept the settlement which he himself recommended, provided that it was furtherimproved on the point of the implementation of the recommendationsof the Review Commission. The present situation of the RhodesianAfricans was virtually hopeless, whereas a settlement of the kind., - now envisaged would afford them, if not a guarantee, at least somehope of political, social and economic advancement, a process in;     which our proposed development programme could play a part.But the settlement would only serve the interests of RhodesianAfricans and be compatible with the honourable reputation of theUnited Kingdom if it dealt effectively with the problem of racial discrimination.   Particularly in view of the fact that Mr. smith had shown that day that he was prepared to make some concessions in the interests of concluding a settlement, it would be right tomaintain the pressure for a further Rhodesian advance on this issue.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had! made striking progress towards finding an acceptable basis for asettlement; they would hope, however, that further progress couldbe made towards providing for the ending of racial discrimination.More generally, the Cabinet were still concerned about the credibilityof the proposed settlement as a whole; and they were thereforeanxious that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should press hard for an improvement on the point of the degree ofcommitment by the Rhodesian regime to give effect to therecommendations of the proposed Commission to reviewdiscriminatory legislation. The Foreign and commonwealth secretary might be able to secure some improvement in this respectby linking the Rhodesian undertaking as regards the Commission^recommendations with a statement at an appropriate point thatthe; regime recognised the desirability of making progress towardsending any racial discrimination. It would further assist in makingthe settlement acceptable to Parliament and to public opinion ifthe Rhodesian authorities would agree to facilitate access by Africanprofessional men to European areas. The Cabinet agreed that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should be authorised to initialthe; proposals for a settlement, provided that he was able to secureah assurance on the point of the Review Commission^ recom-mendations in a form which he was personally satisfied that theGovernment could honourably defend to Parliament. He would send the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary immediatelyinstructions to that effect.The. Cabinet-L . Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summingi   .. : up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,,   ;(\  24 November, 1971.
