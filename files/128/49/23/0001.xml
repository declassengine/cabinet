CM 23 (71)secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theAnnual Meeting of the Council of the South-East Asia treaty organisation had just been successfully held in London. no particular problems had been raised at this meeting.The Cabinet 1.  Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that threeaspects of the continuing unrest in East Pakistan gave grounds for concern. First, some 200,000 East Pakistani refugees were now in indian territory without shelter or adequate supplies of food.Public opinion in this country would expect the Government to betaking some action to alleviate their suffering; and he was thereforeproposing to inform the major charitable organisations that wecould help them by providing space for relief supplies in military aircraft or, if this proved unacceptable to the Government of India,in chartered civilian aircraft. It would be wise to consider carefullygiving the Government of Pakistan an explanation of the actionwhich we were taking. Second, the economic plight of Pakistanwas very serious, particularly since the Governments reserves offoreign exchange were likely to be exhausted in May. Action bya number of countries would be required to deal with the situation;and we were already in touch with the United States Governmenton this matter. Third, there was a prospect of famine in EastPakistan in July or August. He had discussed this aspect of theproblem with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers; andthey had agreed to appeal jointly to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations, U Thant, to send an expert team to the area atonce in order to assess its requirements of foodstuffs.In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that parliament should soon be told as much as possible about the steps which we were taking in order to alleviate suffering and to restorestability in the area. But, although such a statement would be very desirable, care should be taken to say nothing which might causeembarrassment to the Government of Pakistan. Moreover, theUnited States Secretary of State had indicated that he would preferno publicity to be given to the approach to U Thant at this stage.-4b*
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hehad received a special envoy of President Yahya Khan, MianArshad Husain, on 27 April. He had explained to him that theamount of help which we could give was bound to depend on thestate of public opinion in this country and on the extent to whichthe Government of Pakistan showed that they were dealingeffectively with the situation in East Pakistan. He had emphasised that two matters were^ causing us special concern: the reportedlybrutal conduct of the Army in East Pakistan and the serious economic position of the country.The Cabinet 2.  Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and the Prime Minister.Soviet Union The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that the Soviet Government had asked for the removal ofa Second Secretary from the British Embassy in Moscow. Itappeared that this action was intended as retaliation for our havingrecently declared three members of the Soviet Mission in Londonpersonae non gratae and having also refused to accept the last 10officials whom the Soviet Government had proposed to assign for duty here. Consideration was being given to further action to dealwith the unsatisfactory situation in which the Soviet Governmentmaintained in London a large number of diplomatic representativeswhose activities in many cases appeared to extend beyond their normal duties.The Cabinet 3.

The Secretary of State for Employment informed theCabinet that the National Union of Railwaymen had now decidedto accept the revised wage increase offered by the British railways board and that the railway unions&apos; pay claim had therefore been settled on a basis which would add 9-4 per cent to the Board&apos;s totalwage bill. This was reasonably satisfactory in the light of recentwage settlements in the private sector.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the dispute between the British Overseas Airways Corporation and theMerchant Navy and Airline Officers Association about the pay offlight engineers had been settled on the basis of a 10 per cent wage increase and that the Corporation had therefore been able to bring their Boeing 747 aircraft into service.
Post OfficePreviousReference:CM (71) 17thConclusions,Minute 4MotorIndustryPreviousReference:CM (71) 19thConclusions,Minute 3MerchantNavyOfficersThe Secretary of State for Employment said that Fords had offered their supervisors and foremen a 3-stage increase in pay,which could raise their earnings by  1,000 or more a year. this settlement followed inevitably from the recent agreement with thecompany&apos;s manual workers.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the shipownershad, offered, and the unions representing Merchant Navy officers had accepted, a 16 per cent wage increase, effective from June.This was bound to! be followed by a similar offer to the seamen andmust be regarded as a matter of considerable concern. He hadalready discussed the matter with the shipowners&apos; representativesbut had failed to convince them of the need to take a firmer stand.This was an instance which emphasised the need for powers topenalise employers who acquiesced in extravagant settlements. he proposed to discuss further with the shipowners therecommendations in the 1966 Pearson Report about the bargainingstructure and methods in the shipping industry on which action was still outstanding.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe case for ensuring that firms conceding high pay increases shouldnot be protected from the economic consequences of their action by financial or other assistance from the Government needed furtherconsideration. An examination should be made of pricing policyin the oil1 industry, where it was necessary to establish that theconsumer was not being exploited as a result of the recentinternational negotiations. The possibility of the use of tariffs as asanction against extravagant settlements, despite its inherentdifficulty, should also be considered.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.132985-4B* 2CM 23 (71)The Secretary of State for Employment said that the report ofthe Committee of Settlement under Sir Henry Hardman, which was considering the pay claim of the Union of Post Office Workers, wasto be presented to the parties to the dispute on 6 May.
AircraftIndustryConcordePreviousReference:CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute 9RB-211PreviousReference :CM (71) 18thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET4. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that inthe course of his meeting with M. Chamant, the French Minister ofTransport, on 22 April, he had secured the latter&apos;s agreement to theproposal, approved by the Cabinet on 18 March, that thefundamental review of the Concorde aircraft project should be postponed until all the relevant information was available, probablyat about the turn of the year. The Cabinet had also been concerned that he should seek to ascertain whether the FrenchGovernment had developed any doubts about the project.M. Chamant had implied that they were in fact divided.M. Chamant himself believed, and had so advised his colleagues,that the aircrafts noise level would be critical to its commercial prospects; and he had also had difficulty, in the absence of any firmassurance that the future of the project was secure, in persuading the French Treasury to provide the additional funds needed for theproduction programme. But, although individual French ministers might vary in their attitude towards the project, it was clear that theFrench President was personally determined that it should proceed: and this had made it the more difficult to ensure that theterms of the published communique about the discussions did not create the impression that the future of the project was virtuallyassured but made it clear that the fundamental review of itsprospects was still to come.The Cabinet-1.  Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.The Secretary of State for Defence recalled that we had made it an essential condition of our willingness to conclude a newcontract for the RB-211 engine that the United States Governmentshould be involved in assurances, acceptable to us, that the TriStaraircraft project would be able to rely on sufficient financial support and sufficient airline orders to enable it to continue.   Subject tothe resolution of a number of relatively minor issues, we shouldshortly be in a position to initial a new contract; and the UnitedStates Administration had announced their readiness to seekCongressional authority to underwrite the final instalment of creditnecessary to enable Lockheed to complete the project, providedthat the United States banking consortium was prepared to advance the necessary funds and the airlines placed sufficient orders to makethe project viable.   But, since they wished the contract to becompleted and initialed before seeking Congressional authority,we should need to arrange for it to contain a clause to the effect thatit would not come into force until the United States Government,after obtaining Congressional authority, gave us the assurances were quired.  Such a clause had been drawn up in consultation with
confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Defence (CP (71) 52) about the pay of the armed Forces.The Secretary of State for Defence said that his proposals toincrease Servicemen&apos;s pay up to and including one-star officers the Attorney-General. There remained the question whether weshould seek to prescribe a final date beyond which we would notbe ready to wait for these assurances and would be released from our commitment to the RB-211. It would be unreasonable to expect Congressional authority to be obtained very quickly; and discussions with some of the airlines were also making slow progress. All the four airlines concerned, however, intended tosend representatives to this country for further discussions in thesecond week of May. On the other hand we should by then already have committed some  24 million under our indemnity agreementwith the Receiver in order to preserve the RB-211 project; and bythe end of July expenditure would have risen to at least  50 million.He therefore proposed to seek the advice of HM Ambassador in washington about the feasibility of stipulating a terminal dateacceptable to us which would not embarrass the United states administration. When the contract was initialed, it would be appropriate to inform Parliament.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The message recently sent to Congress by the Secretary of theUnited States Treasury, Mr. Connally, that continuation of theTriStar aircraft was essential to the future of the LockheedCorporation, the inclusion of a terminal date in the contract and anearly Parliamentary statement indicating the extent to which we ourselves had committed funds to the project should all be helpful in securing an early decision by Congress.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the suggestions made by the Secretary ofState for Defence, who should now prepare, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry and himself, the draft of a possible parliamentary statement to be made when the contract was initialed or earlier,if knowledge of the contract became public.The Cabinet , 2.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
(except doctors and dentists) by 9^ per cent from 1 April at a totalcost of about  60 million in 1971-72 were based on grounds of bothequity and national interest. The Armed Forces had achieved!comparability with civilian standards for the first time as a result!of the 26 per cent increase in pay in April 1970 which had been;!recommended by the National Board for Prices and Incomes!(NBPI). Since then their pay had again dropped substantially 1behind civilian pay; and, if no interim increase was given now, anlincrease of 25-30 per cent seemed likely to be justified in April I1972 which would be even more damaging to the Governments Jincomes policy. Although the NBPI report had envisaged that twoiyears would elapse before the 1971 pay scales were increased, it Ihad been recognised that interim reviews might be necessary. The jForces had been given an assurance to that effect; and they would be aware that others who were party to two-year agreements werelcurrently receiving interim increases. It was true that to some!extent the Forces were insulated against the full impact of increases!in the cost of food and accommodation; but the proposed interim1increase took account of that fact and would only restore 1comparability with civil standards. If Forces&apos; pay was increased as I proposed, there would be proportionate increases in married Iaccommodation charges; and food charges for single men would Jbe increased to reflect higher food prices. Moreover, the basis of Scalculating food charges would be re-examined during the nextjgregular review.The manpower implications of a refusal to grant an interim!increase would be serious. Even after the improvements in pay!recommended in the previous year the Services had still been I5,000 recruits short of their requirements; and the falling birth rated!combined with the raising of the school-leaving age, would 1accentuate a recruiting problem which unemployment would dofflittle to alleviate. ii in discussion, concern was expressed both about the!implications for the Governments incomes policy of acquiescing inla breach of a settlement which had clearly been intended to last for!two years and about the level of increase proposed, particularly inlview of the fact that single Servicemen had only very recently!received a 15 per cent increase as the second stage of their 19701award. At a time when the next round of pay negotiations wasjabout to start the proposed increase in Service pay could have a^obvious impact on the level of claims put forward by such diverse!groups as doctors and dentists and the local authority manual and!clerical workers; and it would also be liable to generate pressure!for the reopening of other long-term pay agreements, e.g. in the;case of the construction industry.  Doubt was also expressed aboutf
the seriousness of the problem of recruitment, which had been only10 per cent below target in the past year. Since most recruits weresingle men, the recent 15 per cent pay increase could be expected to result in a marked improvement in recruitment henceforward.On the other hand it was misleading to suggest that an interimaward to the Services could be used as a valid argument in the nextround of pay claims, since it was clear that the recent increase for single Servicemen was related to relativities before April 1970 and thatthe proposed further increase would be part of the current round of cost of living increases. Moreover, the NBPI had made it clearthat the two-year cycle was not immutable; and, although thecircumstances were not directly comparable, the Armed forces could reasonably draw analogies with the Civil Service, where staffnot subject to pay research in the current year had received an interim increase of 9% per cent. If the Armed Forces saw theircomparability being eroded so rapidly, their morale would be liableto be adversely affected; and the longer-term consequences for themaintenance of the principle of voluntary service might be serious.In further discussion it was suggested that the proposals shouldbe referred to the new Armed Forces Pay Review Body, particularlyin view of the need to demonstrate that the new Review Bodies,which had been instituted as one of the instruments of the government&apos;s incomes policy, were to be effectively used for thatpurpose. Alternatively, it might be possible to agree to an interimaward, but at a lower level, e.g. 4-5 per cent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thelevel of any interim pay increase granted to the Armed forces would clearly be a significant factor in the Governmenfs efforts to counter inflationary wage settlements, particularly in view of itsinevitable impact on the next round of negotiations. It was inevitable that in an inflationary period any wage settlement,particularly if it extended over two years, would at some point leavethose to whom it applied in a disadvantageous position. But therewere certain factors, such as the benefit to single Servicemen of therecent tax reductions and of cheaper food, which could not be ignored; and it was difficult in principle to maintain that the armed forces deserved different treatment from the public sector generallywhen their claim was in fact based upon comparability. The bestcpiirse might be to refer the matter to the Armed Forces Pay review body; but this must depend to some extent on the progressachieved in bringing the Review Bodies generally into being. Atthe same time he would arrange for the strategy to be adopted inrelation to the next round of wage increases to be discussed as amatter of urgency in the Economic Strategy Committee. Thereafter
mProbationandAfter-careServicePay6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 54) by theHome Secretary about the pay of the probation and after-careservice.The Home Secretary said that the probation service comprisedonly a relatively small body of officers; but it played a vital role inthe Governments policies for the maintenance of law and order.In order to enable a greater proportion of offenders to be treatedwithin the community and to avoid an increase in the prisonbuilding programme, it was planned to expand the service from itspresent strength of 3,500 to 4,700 by 1975. But the service had to compete for qualified staff with the local authority social services,which now offered trained recruits a rate of pay higher by some 300. The present pay agreement for probation officers ran from1 April, 1970 to 31 December, 1971; but it contained a provisionpermitting new rates to be introduced from 1 April, 1971 if therehad been significant changes. The decision to expand the probationservice, together with the new and higher scales of pay now availablein the local authority social services, constituted changes whichjustified invoking that provision. The Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had agreed that some increase would be justified from 1 April; but they had felt unable to endorsehis proposal to increase the maximum of the scale for the basicgrades by 9 - 4 per cent, to set entry points for trained officers at thesame level as those offered by local authorities and possibly todevelop a link between probation pay and local authority social service pay. It had been argued that these proposals, which in combination would produce a total increase of 13 per cent over a12-month period, would have adverse repercussions on other currentpay negotiations and on the level of pay settlements generally andthat the suggested link with local authority social service pay would put future Government control over probation officers&apos; pay at thethe Cabinet would need to give further consideration to the questionof the pay of the Armed Forces.The Cabinet-1.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of 1State for Social Services, to circulate a memorandum on Jthe action still required to establish the new Pay Review IBodies.
-4c*mercy of the local authorities. The Committee had accordingly suggested that any increase given now to the probation service should be limited either to 6 per cent, to run for the remainingnine months of the current agreement, or to 8 or 9 per cent, to last for a year. An inadequate settlement, however, would be liable to provoke an outflow of experienced probation officers and wouldmake it increasingly difficult to obtain enough new recruits ofacceptable standard. But, unless the quality and strength of the probation service could be maintained and increased, we shouldface difficult problems in relation to the treatment of offenders; andexpenditure would inevitably rise. He therefore maintained his proposals, which he considered would command Parliamentary andpublic support and could be convincingly presented as providing foran exceptional case. But he would be prepared, if his colleaguespreferred, to agree that the settlement should relate only to theremaining nine months of 1971, with the result that the overalladditional cost in the current year would be reduced to 9J per cent.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Although an interim adjustment of salaries was permissibleand justified under the pay agreement for probation officers, an award exceeding 13 per cent could not be defended at a time whenthe Governments main concern was to induce greater restraint in pay claims and settlements. If any award were made, it should last for 12 months and should not exceed 8 or 9 per cent the rateachieved in some other current settlements in the public sector.(b) Any greater increase in substantive salaries would riskreperpussions on the pay of teachers, which was expected to besubmitted to arbitration shortly, and on the pay of the social workservice in Scotland (which combined the duties undertaken byprobation officers and local authority social workers in Englandand Wales). Such risks might be reduced, however, if part of the desired improvement for probation officers were given in the formof a special allowance. This would accord with the fact that the probation service, like the nursing service, was generally regarded asa special case justifying exceptional treatment.(c) Probation officers had responsible and arduous duties; andthe nature of their work required them to be on call at all hours.They needed special qualities of ability and character which wentbeyond those required in the local authority social services and werenot found in the majority of graduates with social servicequalifications who were now seeking work. Some 350 qualifiedrecruits for the probation service would nevertheless complete their training this year; and, now that most of the new and higher gradedposts in the local authority social service had been filled, the wastage
of experienced probation officers should be less serious. On theother hand, while probation officers had formerly enjoyed a salary?lead over local authority social service workers, trained mature-;entrants could now earn  200 more in the latter service. If this jadverse differential were not rectified, both the numerical strength^and the quality of the probation service were bound to suffer inthe future.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that some increase in the pay of probation officers was justified, having regard to their important role and the need to expand the probation service. To introduce revised substantivesalary scales which on average would represent an increase of13 per cent on the present scales, however, would be liable to jeopardise both the success of the Governments general policies and the prospects of moderating the level of other pay settlements.Accordingly, the Cabinet were not ready to approve a total increaseof more than 8-9 per cent in the basic scales of probation officers.In recognition of the special circumstances of the probation service,however, it might be possible to contemplate introducing a specialallowance, which would not be part of the basic salary, incompensation for the exceptional calls made on probation officersby the nature of their work. The basic increase and the allowance should together not exceed the equivalent of a 13 per cent increase;and any award which might be made must last for a period of12 months. The Home Secretary should consider whethersatisfactory proposals could be framed on that basis. He mightundertake exploratory discussions with the employers&apos;representatives; and he should then seek the endorsement of the ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations to any revised proposals before a firm offer was made.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing!up of their discussion.NationalHealthInsuranceGraduatedPrescriptionChargesPreviousReference :CM (71) 21stConclusions,Minute confidential!7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary:of State for Social Services (CP (71) 55) about graduated prescription!charges.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the White!Paper &quot; New Policies for Public Spending &quot; (Cmnd. 4515) published fin October 1970 had indicated that measures would be introduced!to enable prescription charges to be related more closely than afpresent to the cost of individual prescriptions, subject to an upperjlimit.   Meanwhile, the flat rate charge was to be increased fromf
12^p to 20p; and Regulations to that effect had come into force on1 April. The Committee on Social Services had approved his proposals for legislation to give effect to the governments intentions and to make the charging provisions in existing legislationmore flexible generally. He had it in mind that Regulations to bemade under the new legislation would provide for the prescriptioncharge to be about half the total cost of the prescription, with aminimum charge of 20p and a maximum of 50p. The presentexemption arrangements would continue; and there would be pre-payment certificates on favourable terms for those needing frequentprescriptions. The measure would result in an annual net saving of about  15 million. These proposals had been communicated tothe doctors&apos; and chemists&apos; organisations, whose first reaction hadbeen hostile on grounds both of principle and of practical difficulty.He intended to try to persuade them to change their attitude; andhe was discussing with the Treasury the possibility of agreeing toreduce the proposed maximum charge from 50p to 40p if that would secure their co-operation. He thought that, if the doctors&apos; andchemists&apos; representatives were not open to persuasion, it would inpractice be impossible to introduce cost-related charges; and that, ifthe saving envisaged was to be achieved, it might be necessary toraise the fiat-rate from 20p to 30p. He proposed that he should report again to the Cabinet after further discussion with the doctors&apos;and chemists&apos; representatives.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatit was necessary to guard against the danger that the government&apos;s proposals in relation to prescription charges might bemisrepresented to an increasing degree as a callous attempt to undermine the foundations on which the National Health service was built. It had always been recognised that cost-related charges would arouse opposition; but they had been regarded as combiningthe advantages of a buoyant source of revenue and a safeguard against extravagant prescription. The Secretary of State for social services should therefore discuss the matter further with the doctors&apos;and chemists&apos; representatives as he proposed and report thereafter to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-1.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2.  Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to proceed as proposed in CP (71) 55 and to report further to theCabinet in the light of his discussions with the doctors&apos;and chemists&apos; representatives.
