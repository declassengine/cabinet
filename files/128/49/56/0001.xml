The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that on the basis of the reports received so far fromthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in Salisbury it was notyet possible to form any very definite view about our chances of reaching a settlement with the Rhodesian regime. It was alreadyclear, however, that the Rhodesian authorities would find it difficultto agree to increase the proposed number of Common Roll seatsabove the six which they had offered and that, as we had feared,&apos; they would be very reluctant to contemplate including in a settlement,any effective provision for the eventual elimination of racial discrimination.The Cabinet :&quot;;;,; Took note of the statement by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.Oversea ; -AffairsThe Gulf   .previous reference:CM (71) 51stConclusions,Minute .3SECRET3. The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that the prospects for a settlement of the problem ofthe Gulf Islands had improved as a result of Sir William Luce&apos;latest visit to Tehran. The Shah of Iran had shown himself preparedto be reasonably accommodating towards Sharjah over a division ofthe island of Abu Musa and in other ways;o Unfortunately, no progress had been made towardsfinding an acceptable means of satisfying Iranian ambitions as regardsthe Tunbs. The Shah had offered to pay a substantial sum to the ruler; of Ras al Khaimah in return for the transfer of the islands;but the;Ruler was adamant in his refusal to cede them. This made it virtually certain that the Shah would take control of the islands in his own time. We should have to consider carefully the publicaltitude;:which we should adopt towards such action; and proposals on; this issue would be brought forward as soon as possible.India/ ,PakistanPreviousReference:   \;CM (71) 53rd;&apos;Conclusions, ;Minute 2i\ k The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that reports from Pakistan and India indicated that the tension between the two countries had continued to increase during the past week. In particular, there were fairly reliable reports that Indianregular,troops had been involved in border clashes. Meanwhile thePrime Minister of India, Mrs. Gandhi, had returned from herEuropean tour and had indicated that she expected world leaders
CONFIDENTIAL,:4. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, although there had been a slight increase in the number of unfilled vacancies,Unemployment thefigures to be published that day showed an increase in thenumber of wholly unemployed (excluding school-leavers) on aseasonally adjusted basis from 833,000 in the previous month to855,00, i.e. 3-7 per cent of the working population on that basis.The total number unemployed, including Northern Ireland, was now970,000; and the December total was therefore likely to exceed,000,000.In discussion of the reasons why the level of unemployment was higher than expected, notwithstanding the measures to stimulate.. the economy which had been announced by the Chancellor of theExchequer in July, it was pointed out that the contraction in industry&apos;s requirements for manpower had been more far-reachingthan had been expected and that, although consumer expenditure,        had risen, the rate of increase in capital expenditure by industry had not been as high as had been hoped.  There was a lack ofconfidence in the future, to which the international monetary situation as well as the domestic problems of the United States economy had contributed; and industry was reluctant to invest until the increasein demand clearly justified it. The effect of the July measures would take time to work through the economy, particularly in the heavygoods industries.  On the other hand the additional expenditure oninfrastructure which had recently been announced, together with&apos;   the measures to accelerate industrial expenditure which the cabinet were about to consider, would further stimulate the economy.Moreover, the number of unfilled vacancies did not present a truefillip.::     picture of the situation, since many employers did not trouble to notify vacancies when unemployment was so high; and the level:..      ;of unemployment benefit implied that many individuals were nolonger genuinely seeking employment, even if it was offered them.: Some of those on the unemployed register were also unwilling tomove to areas where jobs existed or to travel long distances. Themain reason for the number of unfilled vacancies, however, wasThailandIndustrialAffairsto solve the problems of the Sub-continent. It.appeared that theGovernments of the United States and the Soviet Union at leasthad made it clear that they did not want open hostilities to break out.The. Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs reported that news just received from Bangkok indicated that thePrime Minister of Thailand, Field-Marshal Thanom, had set up amilitary dictatorship and that the King had apparently acquiesced in this action. It was too soon to judge what the outcome wouldbe; but the situation so far appeared to be under control.The Cabinet-i 1Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forRj        Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
Coventry ,Tool RoothAgreementPreviousReference:CM (71) 55thConclusions,Minute 3SECRETThe Secretary of State for Employment said that the executive of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers had voted infavour of official strike action in the dispute about the CoventryTobl Room Agreement (CTRA); and, in answering a Private notice question on the previous day, he had said that officials of his department would be meeting both parties to the dispute that afternoon. If the situation deteriorated further, there would be widespread repercussions which might threaten the jobs of up toprobably the fact that those registered did not possess the skillsrequired. It was impossible to establish the truth of allegationsthat there were significant numbers of unemployed who had notregistered as such. In any event, however, the most recent forecasts of, trends in the economy, based on the economic measures so fartaken but excluding those about to be considered, indicated that,if no further action was taken by the Government, the level ofunemployment next winter might still be unacceptably high. the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy would need to give further consideration to this matter when the study of these forecastshad been completed. In the meantime, the presentation of the december unemployment figures would need especial care,particularly if the dispute over the Coventry Tool Agreement hadnot by then been settled. In this context it was desirable thatadvance publication of regional statistics should cease.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was. clear that fundamental changes were taking place in the requirements; &apos;&apos; -for manpower, not only in this country but in all advanced economies,as a &apos; result of the economic depression in recent years and that; substantial numbers of workpeople would need to transfer frommanufacturing industry to the service industries. It would also benecessary to develop a new basis of forecasting employment and. other trends. As soon as the results of the recent review wereavailable the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy would; consider the implications and report to the Cabinet.   More, . immediately, the Lord President of the Council and the Secretaryof State for Employment, in conjunction with the other ministers concerned, should consider the steps which might be taken in relationto the public presentation of the December unemployment return,including the possibility of ensuring that regional and local statisticswere not published in advance of the national statistics.The Cabinet (1)  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of1  the Council and the Secretary of State for Employment;    to be guided accordingly.
100,000 workers in related industries. The dispute had already received widespread publicity; and he did not propose to do moreat this stage than to learn the views of both sides in more detail.1 This limited degree of intervention was probably desirable, sincepressure for action by the Government was likely to grow and mightmore easily be resisted if he could show that he was not indifferent to the situation. The 30-year-old CTRA was an inflationaryanachronism, which should be brought to an end; and the initiativefor terminating it had come from the employers themselves, whohad followed the established negotiating procedures throughout. Inparticular, they had not merely proposed to abolish the long-standingrate-fixing agreement but had offered the unions an alternativeagreement based on plant bargaining. The unions, however, wererefusing to negotiate on this basis. Some employers thought that itmight be preferable to pay a lump sum to end the CTRA, ratherthan to concede the weekly increases in wages involved in the presentoffer, since the overtime rates and other allowances would not then be increased as well.; * In discussion it was agreed that it would be necessary to helppublic opinion to understand the issues involved in this complexproblem, which might attract particularly adverse publicity if itsrepercussions affected the motor industry at a time when it was justrecovering from its earlier difficulties. It would be necessary tomake clear the responsibility which attached to the unions as aresult of their refusal to negotiate on the basis proposed; and itwould be important for the Governments policy of de-escalationof. pay settlements that the employers should stand firm, as theywould be encouraged to if they saw that the Government supportedthem- In view of the fact that negotiations had now been in trainfor a long period, it would be worth considering the desirability,if there were no early settlement, of applying to the industrial court for a ballot in accordance with the provisions of the industrial relations Act. On the other hand, it might be inexpedient to inflict this particularly difficult problem on the new Court at the out-set of its existence. In any event, however, it would be helpful if theSecretary of State for Employment could provide the Cabinet withan appraisal of the current attitude of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) to the implementation of the provisions of the industrial relations Act.1 The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Employment, in conjunction with other ministers concerned, should give careful consideration to the best means of ensuring that the dispute over the CTRA was presented to public opinion as simply and clearly as possible, the main emphasisbeing laid on the unions&apos; refusal to negotiate a new agreement onthe basis correctly proposed by the employers. The Secretary ofState for Employment should circulate a memorandum about thecurrent attitude of the TUC to the implementation of the industrial relations Act.
The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing-      ; up of their discussion and invited the Lord President ofthe Council and the Secretary of State for Employment toi be guided accordingly.PublicExpenditureDraft WhitePaperPreviousReference:CM (71) 50thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (71) 136), to which was appended a draft white paper on Public Expenditure to 1975-76.; The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft had beeninterdepartmentally agreed under the direction of the Chief Secretary,Treasury. The standard Parliamentary procedure required that itshould be the occasion of a two-day Debate, which was being arranged in the week beginning 6 December; and the White Paper should therefore be published not later than 25 November. The draft;satis(ied as, many as possible of the specific recommendations of theExpenditure; Committee (Third Report HC 549) about the formin which material on public expenditure should be presented toParliament; and, although it might still be criticised by those whoconsidered that it should include projections of revenue as well as of expenditure, the presentation had been modified and improved invarious ways which should help to meet the objections to the previous year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 4578). The purpose of the parliamentary debate was to consider the adequacy of the level of the variouspublic expenditure programmes and their relative priorities; andin order to reduce the extent to which it could be regarded as thebasis for a wide-ranging discussion of the prospects for the economy as a whole, it contained only such references to the general economiccontext as were required to justify the substantial additions whichhad been made to the programmes in the previous White Paper inorder to.create or to maintain employment in the years immediately ahead and to; improve social and other services throughout theperiod involved. While there might be a case at a later stage for amore definite statement by the Government about the prospects for the growth of the economy, it would be preferable to avoid any specific or quantitative predictions about the rate of growth at thepresent, juncture. On the other hand the continuing rise in umemployment suggested that it might be desirable to amend theintroductory paragraphs of the text in such a way as to leave moreroom;for possible variations in the programmes in future, if theneed should arise; and he would consult the Prime Minister on theterms of this amendment. Subject to this point he invited theCabinet to agree to the publication of the White Paper at a timeto be agreed With the Lord President.. In discussion it was noted that the draft did not include provision for the proposals for additional expenditure which theCabinet would be considering under a later item on the agenda and
! SECRETthat the timetable envisaged for printing and publication did not now permit amendment of the statistics to take account of thoseadditional proposals. It would be possible, however, to explain,when the proposals were announced, that they had been decidedafter the White Paper had been completed; and, provided that the timing of their announcement was correlated appropriately with thepublication of the White Paper, there might be advantage in their being made public separately., In further discussion the following main points were made (a) If the debate were to turn mainly on the adequacy ofparticular programmes, there might be criticism of the allocation to particular sectors such as education, which were shown in the table in paragraph 12 of Part I as not having been increased markedly in comparison with the provision in Cmnd. 4578. On the other hand,although some other expenditure programmes were increasingfaster than education, the rate of growth of education expenditure. was forecast to be greater that that of public expenditure as a whole.While there would always be pressure for higher expenditure in allfields, the proposals in the White Paper, taken as a whole, could be fully justified.(b) In the same table in paragraph 12 it was not made clear,&apos; except by reference to an earlier White Paper (Cmnd. 4715), that theI British contribution to the European Communities would be offset by levies on imports.  Consideration should be given either to the omission of this table or to a clarification of the relevant footnote.: (c) The figures for unemployment benefit in Table 2.17 werebasep! on the assumption that unemployment would fall to 2-5per cent by 1975-76. In that case, however, it was not clear why thefigure was as high as  172 million. It would also be undesirable to&apos; indicate, as in the present text, that these figures illustrated thedirection of Government policy. It would be preferable to deletethe sentence containing this comment and to add a footnote to the table indicating that the figures for unemployment benefit were notto he regarded as reflecting a forecast of the level of unemployment.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper attached to CP (71) 136,subject to the points which had been mentioned in discussion. TheChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Lord president and the other Ministers concerned, should arrange for the text tobe amended to take account of these points and for the White paper to be published at a time to be agreed with the Lord President.:  The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer to proceed accordingly.
PublicExpenditureAcceleratedIndustrialPurchasesPreviousReference:CM (71) 50thConclusions,Minute 1CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof, the Exchequer (CP (71) 135), to which was appended a note by officials on the possibility of accelerating civil and defence expenditurein order to relieve unemployment by taking under-used industrial capacity.- The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that officials had identifieda number of civil expenditure proposals, consisting mainly of capitalexpenditure by the nationalised industries, which could provide additional work over the next two years, particularly in areas of high unemployment, without entailing continuing expenditure in subsequent years. The proposals for capital expenditure by the nationalised industries involved the acceleration of investment projects which in other respects satisfied normal commercial criteria.The total value of the additional work during the period was about 110 million, of which about  40 million related to the acceleration: of a power station at Ince. The proposals were estimated to provideor to preserve some 12,000 jobs in 1972-73 and 9,300 jobs in 1973-74.Exchequer payments to a number of nationalised industries wouldbe required in order to offset the extra costs of bringing workforward. On the understanding that statutory authority for such payments would be obtained where necessary and that there wouldbe prior agreement on a formula for compensation in the case ofthe power (Station, he recommended that the proposals for civil expenditure should be approved and that further proposals whichmight come forward in the near future should also be considered ifthey satisfied the same criteria. Of the additional defence expenditure which had been identified by officials about  4-5 million, forrunway repair vehicles and Bulldog aircraft, satisfied much the samecriteria as the civil expenditure proposals and could also be approved.But most of the proposed  33 million for Nimrod aircraft and the 5 million for Army reconnaissance vehicles would accrue after1973-74; and the resultant employment would be created mainly in areas where the demand for labour was normally high. it followed that, although the immediate contribution to employmentmight be useful, there was not a sufficiently strong case for givingthese proposals priority over other potential claims on public expenditure in the later years. As soon as decisions had been taken on the various proposals, he recommended that they should be announced simultaneously, at an early date to be agreed with theLord President.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that there was now a reasonable prospect of settlement in the negotiations aboutcompensation for the acceleration of the power station, althoughthe amount involved would be substantial in relation to the valueof. the work brought forward. It was admittedly paradoxical that compensation was demanded when the electricity industry had only recently been pressing for a higher investment programme. Butthe additional provision which they had been seeking had related toearlier projects and not to the new power station at Ince; and, evenif the level of demand for electricity were subsequently to improve,it would be difficult to avoid the payment of compensation in respect
of a project which had been brought forward in the manner nowproposed. The power station at Ince could not incorporate nucleargeneration because it would be some months before a decision could be taken on the reactor system to be used in the next batchof nuclear power stations. It was important, however, that adecision on this issue should be reached as soon as possible in orderto avoid delaying the next power station to be built in Scotland.It was also important to press ahead with the energy review in thelight of which decisions could be taken on the balance between oil-fired and nuclear-powered stations; and that review would need to take full account of the uncertainties about the future price of imported oil. As regards the proposed purchase of Nimrod aircraftit was pointed out that, although the proposal was to be judgedprimarily by reference to employment criteria, it would also providea valuable increase in the reconnaissance capability of the RoyalAir Force. There would also be some benefit to employment inScotland. Although the prospects for export orders for Nimrodsmight be uncertain, they would disappear completely if the productionline were finally closed; and this step would also be damaging tothe aircraft industry as a whole at a time when the Governmentwould shortly be reviewing its future in the light of the possibilityof closer association with other European aircraft industries. Onthe Other hand the Governmenfs policy in relation to the aircraft industry ought to be determined in the light of a long-term policyrather than by short-term considerations; and in so far as the mainexpenditure resulting from the present proposal would accrue onlysubsequently to the period which was immediately in question, itwas open to considerable objection. It might be worth consulting the manufacturers, however, in order to ascertain whether, if orders were placed now, they could be completed more rapidly than was envisaged in the note by officials.: :In further discussion the following main points were made 1(a) A purchase of Sky van aircraft would be of considerablehelp in maintaining employment at the Short Brothers and Harlandworks in Northern Ireland. On the other hand there was no militaryrequirement for Skyvan; and the cost of maintaining the aircraft would be an unnecessary burden on the defence budget.(b) The proposals in CP (71) 135 would have very little impactin Wales. But the Secretary of State for Wales was discussing withthe Ministers concerned other possible measures of greater relevanceto,Wales, including the possibility of postponing certain railwayclosures.i ,(c) It might be possible to put in hand more construction workon schools within the period covered by the proposals brought forward in CP (71) 135. Such expenditure would not significantlytake; up under-used industrial capacity and would not, therefore, fall within the scope of conclusion 7 (b) of CP (71) 135. But it would help to: relieve unemployment in the development areas and might be examined separately., id) There might be a case for studying other means of dealingwith unemployment, such as a reduction in the age of retirement oran increase in the length of holidays, and for detailed study of the
prospects for different sections of the labour market, e.g. bydistinguishing between requirements for male and female employees.A more detailed analysis of employment statistics had alreadybeen put in hand by the Department of Employment and wouldbe completed within two to three months.(e) The estimates given in CP (71) 135 for the additional employment which might be generated by the proposals in question were only approximate and took no account of possible &quot; multiplier &quot;effects; Until more accurate figures were available, it would be preferable, if possible, to omit statistics of this kind from theproposed announcement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in paragraph 7 of CP (71) 135. TheChancellor of the Exchequer should discuss with the Lord president the arrangements for their announcement at an early date and should prepare, in consultation with the Lord President and the other ministers concerned a draft statement for this purpose, taking&quot;into account the point made in discussion at (e) above. The studies of nuclear reactor policy, energy policy and the aircraft industry should be pressed forward as rapidly as possible. The Chancellorof the Exchequer should examine further with the Secretaries ofState for Defence and Trade and Industry whether it would bepossible to place an order for Nimrod aircraft for early completion,avoiding substantial expenditure in the later part of the period inquestion; and he should examine with the Secretary of State for education and Science her proposals for additional constructionalwork on schools.The Cabinet &apos; &quot;Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (71) 132) to which was appended a draft Green Paper on government Research and Development. This comprised astatement by the Government, a report by the Head of the central policy Review Staff and the report of a working group under theChairman of the Council for Scientific Policy.&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos; The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ministerial Committee on science and Technology had approved the text of the Green Paperarid had recommended that he should make the necessary arrange-ments for announcing its publication and the subsequent process of consultation with the scientific bodies concerned and the appropriateStaff Associations. He had agreed with the Secretary of State for education and Science the arrangements for these consultations.The text of the Green Paper appended to CP (71) 132 would needminor amendment at a few points before publication.  In particular,government research andDevelopmentPreviousReference:CM (71) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4
the words &quot; applicable to&quot; in line 2 of paragraph 5 of thememorandum by the Government should be replaced by the words&quot; implemented in respect of &quot; in order to leave no doubt about the government&apos;s intention to adopt the customer/contractor principle.In addition paragraph 25 of the report by the Head of the central policy Review Staff had been modified to include a reference toapplied research carried out by the Science Research Council andthe Social Science Research Council, since, although these activitieshad been omitted from the recommendations of the original report,it was in fact intended that they should be studied in due course.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet approved the text of the Green Paper, amended inaccordance with the statement by the Lord Privy Seal, and agreed. that it should be published on Wednesday, 24 November. The lord privy Seal should make the necessary arrangements for briefingthe Lobby and answering appropriate written parliamentary questions on that day. He should also arrange, in co-operationwith the Secretary of State for Education and Science, for consultations with the scientific bodies and other interested partiesafter publication of the Green Paper.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up and invited the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,18 November, 1971.
