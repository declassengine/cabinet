The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons the following week.The Cabinet tendered their congratulations to the Lord Chan-cellor and other Ministers concerned with the Industrial relations bill on its successful passage through the Upper House.secret. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland;the conclusions reached were separately recorded and circulated onlyto the The Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who hadto take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.secret oversea 3.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a reportAffairs had just been received indicating that a British Overseas AirwaysLibya Corporation aircraft carrying, among other passengers, LieutenantColonel Babiker el-Nur Osman, the new President of the Sudan, andanother member of the Sudanese Revolutionary Council had made anunscheduled landing in Libya during the previous night, apparently onthe instructions of Air Traffic Controllers in both Libya and Malta.The aircraft had subsequently been released and had returned to thiscountry; but the Sudanese President, of whose regime the LibyanGovernment had been sharply critical, was being held prisoner in libya. On the face of it the incident seemed to amount virtually toan act of piracy perpetrated by a sovereign State. We might be legally within our rights in demanding that the Sudanese passengersshould be returned to the United Kingdom; but it would be unrealistic to believe that the Libyan Government would be receptive to any move which we might make to secure their release. Fuller reports were being obtained in order to enable the facts to be established and, in particular, to explain the action of the British pilot.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to inquire further into the circumstances in which theaircraft had altered course.China The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the cabinet would have seen the announcement that the President of the UnitedStates, Mr. Nixon, proposed to visit Peking before the middle of thefollowing year. The United States authorities had given us no priorwarning of this decision; but first reactions in the United Statesappeared to be favourable. This development in relations betweenthe United States and the People&apos;s Republic of China made it moreParliamentaryAffairsHouse ofLordsNorthernIrelandPreviousReference:CM (71) 38thConclusions,Minute 3141771-11B*
probable that the latter would be seated in the United Nations duringthe current year, although there were a number of formal procedures which would first have to be completed. The Government of theUnited States were so far adhering to their &quot; Two China&apos;s &quot; policy,whereby the People&apos;s Republic would become a member of theUnited Nations Organisation and would occupy a seat as aPermanent Member of the Security Council, while the TaiwanGovernment continued to be a member of the Organisation but nota Permanent Member of the Security Council. This arrangement,however, was known to be unacceptable to the Government of thePeople&apos;s Republic, who would refuse to take their seat in thesecircumstances. Our own view had always been that they were thelawful Government of China and should be a Permanent Memberof the Security Council and that the only means whereby theTaiwan Government could gain admission to the United nations would then be by applying for membership in a name other than thatof China.Persian Gulf The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there was at last some progress towards a settlement in the Gulf area. Six ofthe seven Trucial States (all except Ras al-Khaimah) had agreed toform a provisional Union. Meanwhile, Bahrain and Qatar were expected to opt for separate independence, although they wouldprobably seek to establish close relations, possibly regulated bytreaties, with the Government of the new Union. As a result thereshould now be a responsible Government to which we could transfer the Trucial Oman Scouts; and this would provide us with a meansof keeping a residual military presence in the area. As to the futureof the Tumbs and Abu Musa islands, the Shah of Iran had becomesomewhat less insistent in his claims; and the possibility of a settle-ment, which might involve leaving the matter of sovereignty in abeyance for a few years, was being examined with the IranianAmbassador in London. The Shah seemed prepared to accept theproposed Union so long as its provisional character was made clear.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.MaltaPreviousReference:CM (71) 38thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET4. The Secretary of State for Defence said that his discussions in Malta with Mr. Mintoff, the Prime Minister of Malta, on 19 and 20July had enabled us to ascertain the lattefs terms for a continuedBritish military presence in the island. Mr. Mintoff had sought tostipulate that we should henceforward make an annual payment of 30 million for exclusive rights, which would nevertheless be morenarrowly defined than the facilities which we enjoyed at present.Alternatively, we could pay Malta  20 million annually under anarrangement which, though not confining the use of the island&apos;sfacilities to United Kingdom forces, would exclude their military use?by forces of the Warsaw Pact. Mr. Mintoff had been told that the?British Government would consider these proposals and would;
need to discuss them in confidence with our NATO allies; but he hadbeen given clearly to understand that they were likely to proveunacceptable. In fact the prospects of agreement were slender. Itwas important that in dealing with Mr. Mintoff, whose behaviourwas irrational and unpredictable, we should seek to retain the full support of our NATO allies. In the circumstances it might be expedient to withdraw from Malta forthwith the advance party ofthe Royal Marine Commando Group, together with any dependants of members of the infantry battalion (which had originally been planned to be relieved by the Commando Group during the summer)who wished to return now to the United Kingdom, since this might serve to warn the Maltese public of the situation which they would face if Mr. Mintoff pressed his excessive demands to the point atwhich we should have no alternative to removing our presence fromthe island completely.In discussion, it was noted that our present aid commitment to Malta under the 1964 Financial Agreement amounted only to 5 million in the current financial year (about half of which hadalready been paid),  4 million in 1972-73 and  3 million in 1973-74.Mr. Mintoff was therefore seeking a wholly disproportionate increasein Malta&apos;s total receipts from the United Kingdom, while offeringus only reduced facilities. The co-ordination of our actions withthose of the rest of NATO was very important. In particular, therecent activities of the Federal German Government in makingequipment available to Malta had probably been unhelpful inreinforcing Mr. MintofFs intransigence. Nevertheless, we had a reasonably strong bargaining position, especially if we were able toact with NATO&apos;s full support.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatMr. Mintoffs terms were clearly exorbitant. The situation wouldbe examined in detail by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeeon the following day.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.confidential industrial 5.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that the JulyAffairs monthly count of the numbers of unemployed, to be published that day, would show a total of 786,000 registered unemployed. Thiswas 62,000 higher than the June count and represented an increase from 3-2 to 3-4 per cent. Included in the total were 24,000 adultstudents, who were seeking vacation work; and this figure would be separately identified. It had not proved possible, however, to arrangefor these students to be excluded from the seasonally adjustedunemployment figures, which would similarly show an increase from-2 to 3-4 per cent. It was hoped that the measures of reflationwhich the Government had recently announced would diminish the criticism with which these high figures would otherwise be received.SECRET141771-11 B* 2
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the course of theeconomic debate on 20 July both he himself and the Secretary ofState for Employment had emphasised that the measures taken bythe Government and the Confederation of British Industry were theoccasion to intensify, rather than to relax, the pressure to reducethe level of wage settlements; that the Government would make this a main objective in the pay negotiations for which they were them-selves responsible; and that they would expect other employers in both the public and the private sectors to conduct negotiations tothe same end. He had also expressed the hope that the Trade unions would now consider how best they could make a positive contribu-tion to securing the necessary restraint in wage claims. The initialreaction of the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress hadbeen as satisfactory as could be expected; and for the present it mightbe best for Ministers to refrain from further public exhortation,which could jeopardise the prospects of securing the desired response from the Unions at the August meeting of the National economic development Council. But the Government would need to continueto show undiminished firmness in dealing with public sector pay claims; and the forthcoming negotiations on the pay of local authority manual workers would be as critical to the continuing success of the government&apos;s policies as the pay negotiations in the electricity supply industry in the previous winter. Ministers should therefore take special steps to ensure that the local authority employers understood the importance of dealing firmly with the claim by their manual workers, whose unions would be likely, after their success in theprevious year&apos;s negotiations, to press the claim strongly. It wouldalso be desirable to review the related contingency plans for dealingwith any industrial action which local authority workers might seefit to take.In discussion it was recognised that the local authority employers were giving the Government their full co-operation by confiningthe offers which they were making in response to the current claims by their staffs within the range of per cent which the Govern-ment had made their target for public sector settlements in the newround of negotiations. But their present resolve might weaken unlessthe Government showed similar firmness in handling negotiationsfor which they themselves were directly responsible. The recentarbitration award for teachers, following the earlier pay researchaward to the non-industrial Civil Service, would add to their difhcul-ties. There would be other exceptional cases, for example wheregroups of workers had an established pay link with the Civil Service,which would present special difficulty; and the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had already commissioned a fullreview of the validity of these pay links and of the present procedures for deciding the appropriate remuneration of such groups.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hehad asked for the methodology of the statistical returns of unemploy- \ment to be reviewed in order to secure greater clarity and consistency ]of presentation.  The Cabinet agreed with the suggestions of the chancellor of the Exchequer about the tactics which would be best Icalculated to further the Governmenfs objectives in securing asatisfactory response from the Trade Unions on pay restraint; and I
they endorsed his proposals for dealing with forthcoming wage claims in the public sector. They noted that the Ministerial Steering Com-mittee on Pay Negotiations were reviewing existing pay links and procedures. The Home Secretary should also arrange for an earlyexamination of the detailed tactics to be followed in dealing with the pay negotiations with local authority manual workers and for a reviewof the contingency plans for anticipating any industrial action whichmight develop in this context.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP (71) .87) about the proposals for additional public expenditure during the period to 1975-76 and the arrange-ments for the next stage of the public expenditure review.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that at their meeting on29 June the Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer todiscuss with the Ministers who were proposing additional expenditurewhether or to what extent such proposals could be accommodatedby savings within their own respective programmes. In CP (71) 87he had set out the stage which had been reached in each of these discussions, apart from steel investment, on which Ministers awaitedthe report of the inquiry later in the year. Although there had been considerable progress towards the objective set by the Cabinet, the outcome of the discussions confirmed the need for a wider reviewdirected to finding further offsetting savings from public expenditure programmes as a whole. Such a review must also allow for thepossibility that alternative savings would now also be required toreplace those which the introduction of graduated National health service prescription charges had been expected to yield. he proposed, therefore, that he should now arrange for an inter-departmental review by the Public Expenditure Survey Committeeof the means by which, as consistently as possible with government policies generally, the remaining net totals of proposed additional expenditure could be matched by reductions. The Central policy review Staff would be associated with this review, which should becompleted in time for the matter to be further considered by theCabinet in September. The possibility of further reductions beingneeded for other reasons, such as an increase in the general pressure of demand or in the level of steel investment, should be borne in mindin the review. The Cabinet might also wish to consider whether anyof the additional proposals should be regarded as exempt from furtherscrutiny in the context of the interdepartmental review, even thoughfinal decisions on such proposals should still await the further discus-sion by the Cabinet in September.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that the proposed additional expenditure on health and personal social services, legal advice and assistance, and education need not be scrutinised in the context ofthe interdepartmental review by officials, except in so far as expendi-
ture on universities might need to be further considered in the lightof any preliminary indications of the outcome of the programme analysis and Review Study of higher education. Civil defence had recently been examined by the Ministerial Committee on HomeDefence, who had concluded that further study should be given tothe possibility of re-allocating expenditure within the present ceiling.On overseas aid it was accepted that the aid programme could notbe adjusted to conform- with each revised forecast of gross national product. But the aid programme was now likely to represent asignificantly lower proportion of gross national product in 1972-73than had previously been planned; and it would be right for the interdepartmental review to examine this problem and also to con-sider whether the needs of the under-developed countries for aidwould be modified by the present higher world prices for primarycommodities. As regards the defence budget, the examination hadnot yet been completed; and the review would therefore need to bebased on alternative assumptions, either that savings would berequired to match the additional provision proposed for 1975-76or that no additional provision would be required.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that an interdepartmental study by the public expenditure Survey Committee should now be arranged to examinehow the outstanding proposals for additional public expenditure could be matched by reductions and to consider the other points made in the discussion. The outcome of this review should be reported to the Cabinet in September. It was important for theGovernment to retain sufficient freedom of manoeuvre if the pressure of demand should become excessive in 1973-74; and the review should take this risk into account, together with the possibility that further savings might be needed to match increased steel investment.The review should also take account of the potential need for further savings to replace those which had previously been assumed to arise from the introduction of graduated prescription charges. In themeantime, no announcement should be made of the intention not tointroduce graduated charges. Decisions on the various proposals for additional expenditure should not be taken until the report of the interdepartmental review had been considered. When the Cabinetresumed their discussion in September, however, they should haveregard to the need to take decisions sufficiently far ahead to enablethe various expenditure programmes to be satisfactorily administeredduring the period until decisions were taken on the next annualpublic expenditure survey.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discus-ision by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for an interdepartmental study by the Public Expenditure survey committee of the means by which the outstandingproposals for additional public expenditure might be matched by reductions, having regard to the points men-tioned in the Prime Minister^ summing up; and to reportthe outcome to the Cabinet in September. CONFIDENTIAL9VoluntarySocialServicePreviousReference:CM (71) 34thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL.7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 86) by theLord Privy Seal on expenditure on voluntary social service.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;sdecision on 29 June, he had prepared detailed proposals for additionalexpenditure on voluntary social service, amounting to  4 millionover the period 1972-73 to 1975-76. He proposed an increase of 0-6 million in 1972-73 rising to  1-5 million in 1975-76. Thespecific suggestions of the Ministers concerned with the distributionof this additional expenditure for the year 1973-74 were set out inAnnex A to CP (71) 86. The emphasis was on additions to the UrbanProgramme, transport services in rural areas, environmental improve-ment, voluntary after-care of offenders and improved arrangementsfor the organisation of voluntary work; but the programme needed tobe sufficiently flexible to accommodate projects which might arise insubsequent discussion with local authority associations and voluntarybodies. Of the total proposed additional expenditure  0-9 millioncould be accommodated within the existing programmes of Depart-ments. The increases which he proposed were not large in them-selves but would afford a* significant demonstration of the importancewhich the Government attached to stimulating voluntary effort. Heproposed that a statement of the Government&apos;s intentions should bemade before the Recess on the lines of the text at Annex B to hismemorandum. There were several aspects of the Government&apos;smachinery for dealing with general questions about voluntary socialservice which might usefully be considered by groups of the Ministersand officials of the Departments concerned.In discussion it was suggested that an immediate announcementof the Government&apos;s intentions was not necessary and might, indeed,attract insufficient attention at the present juncture. Moreover, thecase for increased public expenditure on the proposals in questionwas not so compelling that they should be exempted from the scrutinyto be given to other proposals in the coming months. For the mostpart the proposals had not been regarded by the Ministers concernedas of such importance as to take priority over their existingprogrammes for public expenditure; indeed, they had not beeninitiated in the first instance as reflecting specific needs.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the merits of stimulating voluntary effort in socialservice but agreed that there should be no immediate announcementof any specific intentions by the Government for additional expendi-ture in this context. The Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposals should there-fore be considered further in the course of the general scrutiny ofproposals for increased public expenditure with a view to decisionsbeing reached in the autumn. Meanwhile, the Lord Privy Seal shouldarrange for consideration to be given in the light of the discussion,to the Government&apos;s machinery for dealing, with general mattersaffecting voluntary social service.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup of their discussion.CONFIDENTIAL

confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (CP (71) 85) about the pay of the Armed Forces.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, since the cabinets discussion in April of his proposals for an interim pay increase of9-1- per cent for the Armed Forces from 1 April, 1971, the armed forces Pay Review Body had begun their work and the Governmenthad set, as their objective for pay settlements in the public sector forthe remainder of 1971, a limitation of increases to 7^-8^ per cent. Inconformity with this strategy he was now prepared to accept anincrease of 8 per cent for the Forces; and, since it would be an interim award, it seemed unnecessary to ask the Pay Review body to express a view on it. The case for an interim increase rested on three grounds. First, the argument of equity was strong, sinceexisting pay was based on fair comparisons at 1 December, 1969;and, although the Services had to some exent been shielded from rises in the cost of living, an award as low as the 5 per cent which hadbeen suggested would be regarded as discriminatory and inconsistent with the claim that the Government attached importance to defence and to the role of the Forces. Secondly, an adequate interim awardwas needed to sustain recruitment. More recruits were needed if wewere to avoid a critical and cumulative shortage which might call inquestion the Governmenfs ability to fulfil their pledges on defence.Third, a substantial interim increase at the present juncture would reduce the size of the embarrassingly large increase of the order of25 per cent which otherwise would probably be recommended inApril 1972, as a result of the biennial review of Service pay by the pay Review Body. His revised proposal would reduce the cost toabout  47 - 7 million net, after taking into account concurrentincreases in food and accommodation charges. He remained unableto offer offsetting savings in 1971-72, without unacceptable con-sequences for defence policy; and the increase should therefore beregarded as a pay/price increase, as had already been agreed for thelarger increase within which it would be absorbed with effect from april 1972.In discussion it was pointed out that the introduction of themilitary salary had been part of a composite agreement between theTreasury and the Ministry of Defence, in which no provision hadbeen made for an interim increase in Forces&apos; pay. It would thereforebe necessary, if an 8 per cent increase were awarded, to make special provision for nearly an additional  50 million net of public expendi-ture, which should be offset by savings either from the defence budget or from other Votes. Moreover, single Servicemen were tosome extent protected from the full impact of the increase in the costof living by cheaper food; and rents for married men were mostlysubsidised. There was therefore no direct comparison with the pay of civilian analogues. The effect of recent tax reductions should alsobe taken into account in assessing changes in real incomes. Recruit-ing had recently improved, at least in two of the Services; and theunduly high rate of wastage might well be due to a dislike of Servicelife rather than to dissatisfaction with pay.armed forces&apos;PayPreviousReference:CM (71) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5
On the other hand, there was considerable support for an interimpay increase which the senior officers had already received-provided that it was at a level which was consistent with the Govern-menfs strategy for pay increases in the public sector. Pay agreements of more than one year&apos;s duration could not equitably be enforced ina period of marked inflation. Moreover, the level of recruitmentwas still too low; and the target might need to be set even higher to compensate for accelerating wastage if pay levels did not keep pace with comparable earnings in civilian life.In further discussion of the size of any interim increase whichmight be awarded it was emphasised that an increase of 8 per cent would not be compatible with the measures to combat rising costs and prices which had been announced by the Chancellor of theExchequer earlier in the week. The Government must now seek to achieve a further reduction in the general level of pay settlements;and they should be concerned to maintain the firm line taken inrelation to the negotiations with the steel workers, which had ledto an interim settlement on the basis of an increase of no more than6-6 per cent. Although a difference of 1 per cent or less in the interimaward to the Forces might not be significant in relation to the size ofthe biennial award in 1972 or to the level of public expenditure involved, it could exert a considerable psychological impact on pay negotiations elsewhere.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that the Armed Forces should be given  an interim pay increase, even though it seemed unlikely that it wouldbe possible to find any offsetting savings from the Defence budget.There were varying views, however, about the most appropriate levelof the increase. He would discuss the matter further with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Defence andthe Secretary of State for Employment in the light of the views expressed during the discussion and of further information, whichthe Secretary of State for Employment should provide, about the repercussions of an interim award on pay negotiations in other sectors, with particular reference to existing agreements which wereeffective for more than one year. The Secretary of State for Employ-ment should also take steps to ensure that, in assessing changes in circumstances affecting pay, the Pay Review Bodies took account of factors which affected real incomes, such as reductions in taxation,and not solely of increases in the cost of living.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
