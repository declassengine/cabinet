confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, tendered warmcongratulations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his budget statement on 30 March. Particular efforts should now be made by ministers to bring fully before the public the manner in which theBudget, together with the measures which had been announced in theprevious autumn, gave effect to the Governments economic policies.Ministers in charge of Departments, particularly those dealing withnationalised industries, should also seek to ensure so far as possiblethat the proposals for the reduction of the Selective Employment Taxwere seen to have an immediate effect on price levels.confidential. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said it was clear that the Pakistani Army was now in control of the major urban areas in East Pakistan; and the East Bengal political leader, SheikhMujibur Rahman, was said to be under arrest. It seemed clear thatthe Army had acted in a ruthless and punitive fashion; but was likelyto be subjected to severe criticism. So far as was known, no british nationals had been injured in the disturbances. It would nevertheless be prudent to reduce the size of the United Kingdomcommunity in East Bengal; and we had secured the agreement ofthe Pakistani military authorities to action for this purpose.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said the PrimeMinister of Sierra Leone, Dr. Siaka Stevens, had invoked theassistance of further troops from Guinea to his position following the disaffection in the Army which had probably itself resulted fromhis introduction of Guinean troops at an earlier stage. The situation was still confused and precarious. The Governor-General had nowbeen removed from office; and the Chief Justice had been installedin his place.The tenth anniversary of Sierra Leone&apos;s independence was dueto be celebrated on 27 April. It had earlier been intended to send a minister from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to representthe British Government; but in the present circumstances it seemedwiser to leave representation to our High Commissioner in Freetown.confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the FordMotor Company had now offered the unions a two-year wageagreement which provided an immediate increase of  4 a week to befollowed by two further increases of  2 a week on 1 December, 1971,and on 1 August, 1972. In return the unions would be required toundertake that no further claims for wage increases or changes inthe grading structure would be made or pressed by industrial actionduring the currency of the agreement.   The leaders of the two141771-10
ElectricalContractingIndustryBritish RailPreviousReference:CM (71) 17thConclusions,Minute 4principal unions, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering workers and the Transport and General Workers Union, were prepared to commend these proposals to their membership; and it seemed likely that there would be a general resumption of work at Ford&apos;s in thefollowing week. From the company&apos;s standpoint there were considerable advantages in securing a stable agreement for twoyears; and, given the prospect of being able to maintain regularproduction henceforward, they would probably claim that they couldavoid an increase in unit costs despite the relatively high increase which they had conceded. It must now be expected that the revisedoffer by Ford&apos;s would be matched by Vauxhalls. On the other hand the new Ford rates were still well below the wage levels being paidby Chrysler and the British Leyland Motor Corporation. The latter had now made an improved offer of  5-50 to workers at the Cowleyplant. This was a costly attempt to buy out present pieceworkagreements. So long as these remained in force, however, the;Corporation were faced with the prospect of fragmented bargainingand it would be impossible to make progress with proposals whichhe had put to the four major motor manufacturers that they should consist-ordinate their pay negotiations on a national basis.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the ElectricalContractors Association (ECA), which had earlier denied to his department that they were engaged in pay negotiations, had privately Ireached agreement with the unions representing the 50,000 workers!in the industry on the basis of wage increases of 12 per cent injJanuary, 1972, and a further 12 per cent in January, 1973. He wouldjdiscuss with the other Ministers concerned whether the ECA shouldbe informed that they must not expect the Government to pay]higher prices for electrical contracting work if costs rose as a result;of this agreement. The agreements made by Ford&apos;s and the ECA,;which provided for very large increases in wages in 1972 (and in1973 as well in the latter case) constituted a significant threat to theGovernments policy of wage de-escalation.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that theBritish Railways Board, in further negotiations with the railway;unions, had held to their earlier offer of a wage increase of 9 per cent and the unions were now considering their position.   There was some prospect that they would decide to accept the offer, althoughthe improved pay offer by Ford&apos;s might strengthen the Associated;Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen in their earlier]resolve to reject it and to persevere with their threatened work-to-rule from 5 April.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that,contingency plans for mitigating the effects of a work-to-rule on therailways had been reviewed. There would be inconvenience to Ipassengers, particularly London commuters, and problems in moving 1coal. But the difficulties should not be insuperable; and there was!no need at present to consider invoking emergency powers or;deploying troops. Any widespread extension of pay agreements!providing for such substantial increases up to two years aheadthose currently proposed in the motor and electrical contracting!
industries, whatever their advantages to employers, could have a damaging effect on the Governments policies for ending wageinflation; and the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategywould need to give early consideration to means by which theGovernment might exert greater influence over wage settlements inthe private sector. The Secretary of State for Employment should examine, with other Ministers concerned, whether action could betaken on the lines he had proposed with the Electrical ContractorsAssociation. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should ensure that the British Leyland Motor Corporation had no illusionthat they could expect help from the Government if they pricedthemselves out of the market by wage concessions whose cost theycould not absorb; and he should also urgently review the corporations structure in the light of the shareholding by theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation, which the Government would shortly inherit.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretaries of Statefor Employment and for Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.I secret the Civil 4.   The Cabinet considered certain developments in connectionjM* with the Civil List.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Civil List was in deficit and that it was desirable that new statutory provision shouldbe made in time to deal with the calendar account year 1972 at thelatest. Discussions had therefore been put in hand with The QueenSadvisers on the basis that revised arrangements for the Civil list should be such as to suffice, if possible, for the rest of the reign and atthe same time to continue to safeguard for as far ahead as could resonably be foreseen the position of those other members of theRoyal Family for whom provision was made by means of annuities.It had been concluded that it would not be possible to repeat in any new legislation the form of provision adopted in the Civil List Act,1952, since the contingency margin which that Act had incorporatedas a measure of insurance against future increases in costs and prices would need to be so large in current circumstances as to be indefensible against public criticism. Nor would it be possible toadopt the alternative course of providing that future increases inthe provision for the Civil List should be determined automatically:by reference to the movement in e.g. the cost-of-living index, sincean arrangement of this kind might prove embarrassing in relationto the Governments incomes policies in general. In thesecircumstances the most appropriate course would be to provide thatin future both the Civil List itself and the provision for the Royalannuitants should be financed by means of a basic minimum sum* Previously recorded as a Confidential AnnexSECRET141771-10 B*
committees exercising local supervision and regional health councilsundertaking tasks calling for administration over a wide area. Hisown proposals involved the use of the regional authorities for theco-ordination, supervision and allocation of resources of the areaauthorities, which would undertake the local management. the regional authorities would, therefore, be an integral part of themanagement structure. There would be community health councilswithout management functions to reflect the views of the localpublic in the districts. The Committee had approved his proposalsfor the new structure of health service administration, together with proposals for the appointment of Health Commissioners in England,Scotland and Wales to investigate complaints. They had not beenable to reach agreement, however, on the principle to be adoptedin appointing members to the health authorities, particularly thearea authorities. The emphasis of the previous Administration^proposals had been on community participation, one-third of themembers of the authorities being appointed by the local authorities,one-third by the professions and the remaining third by the Secretaryof State. The emphasis in his proposals was on efficient manage-ment. The finance for the health services, amounting to some 2,000 million a year in Great Britain, would be entirely a centralGovernment responsibility; and it would therefore be right that thereshould be a direct and unambiguous chain of accountability. he accordingly proposed that he himself should appoint the membersof the regional authorities in England, together with the chairmen of the area authorities. The regional authorities would appoint the area authorities. He intended to keep the membership of theauthorities small; and, while local government members would beinvited to serve on them, their appointment by the local authorities themselves militated against the principle of sound management towhich he attached great importance. Other members of theCommittee, however, held the view that the exclusion of direct localauthority representation was unacceptable, particularly in view ofthe statements about the functions and responsibilities of localauthorities which had been made on behalf of the Conservative Partywhen in Opposition. In Scotland and Wales, there would not be a regional tier for reasons of scale; but there would be central agencies.He intended to consult the interested bodies through the medium of a consultative document on the lines of the draft annexed to cp (71) 42, which would be made public. The Secretary of State forScotland would also issue a consultative document; but the Secretaryof State for Wales intended to take informal soundings in Walesbefore publishing proposals.In discussion it was maintained that it would be unacceptable to deny local authorities the right themselves to appoint members ofthe area health authorities. In commenting upon the plans of theprevious Administration, the spokesman for the Conservative party had stated in Parliament that they afforded insufficient scope for local and professional participation and that it would be preferable thathalf the members should be appointed by local authorities and halfby the professions. That expression of view had been a factor in securing the support of local government opinion for the Govern-
menfs current proposals for local government reform, and this Jsupport might be alienated if the Government now denied the local Iauthorities the power to appoint members of health authorities.!Moreover, the exclusion of local authority representation was in itself 1inconsistent with the Governments professed intention to delegate Ifunctions to local authorities so far as possible. Without prejudice!to the principle that the administration of the unified health service Ishould be based on sound management, it was not demonstrably true 1that a system of appointment would implement that principle moreleffectively than a system of representation. Indeed, the quality offmembers of local authorities was likely to be improved by the!Governments proposals for local government reform. The area!health authority would necessarily have to act in close co-operation Iwith the local authority for the corresponding area; and this co-opera-ltion might be withheld if the local authorities were not allowed tolappoint representatives to the health authorities.On the other hand the local authorities had no financial!responsibility for the administration of the health service; and itifollowed that they could not claim any presumptive right to appointlmembers of the health authorities.   The appointment of localpgovernment members by the local authorities themselves was likely Ito lead to a conflict of interest; the members so appointed might, for!example, feel that they owed it to their parent authority to allocate!health services resources in such a way as to relieve the burden on thejlocal ratepayer rather than the taxpayer.    Moreover, if local;authorities were given a power to appoint members to health;authorities, it would be virtually impossible to deny a similar righlto the medical professions; and that might result in the appointment!of individuals who would be more concerned to further professionalinterests than to bring sound management principles to bear oiladministration.In further discussion it was suggested that sound management Iwas determined not so much by the manner in which the members of&quot;health authorities were appointed as by the quality of the full-timJBadministrative staff of the authorities. Since the health services werejlfinanced wholly from Exchequer funds, it was preferable that themadministration should be in the hands of full-time executive staff whoUwould be answerable, perhaps directly, to the central departments and that the authorities should have purely advisory functions. Omthe other hand, although it would be useful for each authority tjihave a chief executive, a system under which there was no locaflresponsibility at all for the administration of the service was not likelwto enlist public confidence.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whiMthe Cabinet approved the general structure of the proposedreorganisation, they had not yet reached agreement about tinprinciples that should govern the appointment of members of tflauthorities. The issue concerned not so much the regional authorities as the area authorities; and it might be possible to devise a schemejlunder which all the members of the former were appointed by tlflSecretary of State, while some proportion of the latter were appointed^
by local authorities. The Secretary of State for Social Services should therefore reconsider his proposals in a further attempt to reconcile theneeds of sound management with the demand for local representativeparticipation and should bring fresh proposals to the social services Committee in the first instance.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to reconsider, in the light of the points made in discussion,the proposals in CP (71) 42 in relation to the appointmentof health authorities and to bring further proposals beforethe Ministerial Committee on Social Services.confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (71) 47) on the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament.The Lord President said that, with the agreement of hiscolleagues, he had announced in the House of Commons on  December, 1970, that the Government would refer the emolu-ments, allowances, expenses and pensions of Ministers and Membersof the House of Commons to one of the Review Bodies whoseestablishment had been announced by the Secretary of State for employment on 2 November, 1970. Lord Boyle had now acceptedthe chairmanship of the relevant Review Body; and it would therefore be opportune to announce that the Government wereinitiating the consultations on the terms of reference which he had promised in his earlier statement. He proposed that these consultations should take place on the basis of the draft terms ofreference which he had agreed with the Lord Privy Seal and had indicated in CP (71) 47. They had been deliberately drawn widelyin order to enable the Review Body to consider whether extendedcommon facilities were to be preferred to increases in pay and expenses, whether Members of Parliament defeated at a GeneralElection should be allowed to continue to draw their salaries for alimited period and other similar issues. The draft terms ofreference would not, however, permit the Review Body to discussthe Peers&apos; allowance; the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the lord privy Seal and he himself had agreed that this matter was betterdealt with administratively.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the draft terms of reference as a basis fordiscussion with Lord Boyle. If, as a result of those discussions,any significant change were proposed, they would wish to considerthe matter further.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP (71) 47.
Selection ofTopics forProgrammeAnalysis and review and theWork of theCentral policy review StaffRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute secret*9. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that, since it was clear that no further progress could beachieved by correspondence in our attempt to ascertain whetherit was possible to reach a settlement with the regime in Rhodesia, hehad concluded, in agreement with the Prime Minister, thatemissaries should be despatched to Salisbury in order to seek to discover whether the grounds for an agreement genuinely existed.The emissaries, who would be led by Lord Goodman, would be clearly instructed that their exchanges with the regime in Salisburywere to be ad referendum to the British Government; and allpossible steps were being taken to ensure that their visit to Salisburywould remain confidential.Cabinet Office,2 April, 1971.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP (71) 43) about the Selection of Topics forProgramme Analysis and Review (PAR) and a memorandum circulated by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP (71) 44) about thework of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS).The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had set out in cp (71) 43 a list of 11 programmes which he judged would providea useful start in the first experimental year of PAR. The selection of the programmes had to take account of the large number ofspecial reviews and studies already in progress, which might other-wise be suitable for PAR. He suggested that, in dealing withinquiries by the Select Committee on Expenditure, it would be wise not to refer specifically to PAR or to make known the listof programmes under consideration.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the proposals in the two memoranda. Itwould be in accordance with established practice not to disclosepublicly or to Parliament the methods by which any subject understudy was being reviewed by the Government; and the fact that \any particular topic was being reviewed under the PAR machineryor by the CPRS rather than by any other means should not be publicly indicated.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
