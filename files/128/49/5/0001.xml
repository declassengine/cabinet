CONFIDENTIALlarliamentary        1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.The Lord President said that the Legislation Committee had recently considered the Social Security Bill, which restricted thepayment of supplementary benefit to strikers. It seemed clear thatit might be inopportune to introduce the Bill immediately; and he intended to bring before Cabinet in the following week the questionwhen it would be right to present it. Meanwhile the Press hadunfortunately become aware that the Government intended topromote legislation about benefit for strikers; and it would thereforebe advisable to admit that this was so.The Cabinet-Took  note,  with  approval,  of the  Lord Presidentsstatement.secret oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that themilitary coup in Uganda, in which President Obote had been oustedllanda by the Army Commander, Major-General Idi Amin, had been a violent one. The President had taken refuge in Tanzania; but,despite rumours of Tanzanian mobilisation, it seemed unlikely thatthe Government of Tanzania would take any active military measures against Uganda. The new regime appeared to enjoy aconsiderable measure of popular support; and we should shortlyhave to decide whether to recognise it. The Government of Kenyahad asked us to keep in close touch with them on this question, andwe were doing so. General Amin had at one time been thought tobe unfriendly towards Britain. But this seemed no longer to be thecase; and his administration might prove to be favourably disposed towards the West.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as theresult of a recent offensive by the North Vietnamese almost theentire Cambodian air force had been destroyed on the ground. TheUnited States would now have to increase the scale of the air coverwhich they were providing in Cambodia. Operations conducted bythe Cambodian Army had been more successful; and they had succeeded in reopening the important supply route from the capital,Phnom Penh, and the seaport of Kampong Som, which had been closed for two months.128864-2a 2
Her Majesty&apos;ambassador,MontevideoPreviousReference:CM (71) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6RhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (70) 39thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a communique, believed to emanate from Mr. Jackson&apos;s kidnappers,had been received by the Uruguayan authorities, indicating thatMr. Jackson and the other hostages were safe and well and wouldbe in no danger unless the efforts of the security forces to rescuethem seemed likely to succeed. The Uruguayan Government, withour encouragement, had continued their attempts to establish contact with the kidnappers. The Chief Clerk of the Foreign and commonwealth Office, Mr. Oliver Wright, had concluded his visit to Montevideo and certain other Latin American posts and wouldbe returning to London to report later that week.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a reply had now been received by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in SouthAfrica from the representative in Pretoria of the illegal regime in rhodesia, Air Vice-Marshal Hawkins, to the communication whichhad been addressed to the latter on 11 January. The regime, while maintaining that they saw no advantage in modifying the principleof parity between Europeans and Africans which had beenembodied in the illegal 1969 Constitution, had asked to be informed of the changes in that Constitution which the British government intended to seek. We must now consider whether we shouldcontinue written exchanges with the regime or whether the time had come for a meeting to establish whether there was sufficient common ground to warrant the opening of discussions on questions of substance. We were under some pressure of time, since it would benecessary to take a fairly early decision on the Governments attitudewhen the Parliamentary Orders validating the continuance ofeconomic sanctions against Rhodesia became due for renewal inNovember. He proposed to discuss the matter at an early date inthe Ministerial Group on Rhodesia and thereafter to report to cabinet.South Africa:Arrest of theDean ofJohannesburgThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Deanof Johannesburg had recently been arrested by the South Africanauthorities. It was not yet known what charges would be brought against him; but it was likely that they would relate to allegationsthat he had distributed money for subversive purposes and haddisseminated subversive literature. The Dean had been seen by theBritish Consul and appeared to be being treated reasonably well.Whatever the merits of the case, however, the timing of the SouthAfrican action had been unfortunate; and we had intimated as muchto the South African Foreign Minister, Dr. Muller.The Cabinet-(1) Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.

The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that ingeneral the situation over the strike by Post Office workers was reasonably satisfactory. About half the Post Office telephonistscontinued to attend for work and even among postal workers therewas a return to work by a small but increasing number; 200 out ofabout 1,800 main Post Offices were manned with counter clerks.There had been no appreciable pressure from industry and commerce in favour of further concessions to the Union of PostOffice Workers (UPW) in order to end the strike, although a relatively few businesses were being seriously affected. There wasno case at present for any initiative from the Government or thePost Office to end the pay dispute.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had decided that, in the current negotiations on a central pay increase for a number of non-industrial civil Service grades, no advance should be made on theGovernments last &quot; without prejudice &quot; pay offer because to do somight undermine the Post Office&apos;s case on the UPW pay claim. TheNational Staff Side of the Civil Service Whitley Council had been persuaded that week to defer a decision on whether to seekarbitration, the outcome of which might well be less favourable toThe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the oil companies had now agreed proposals to be put to the oil producing countries on 29 January as a basis for negotiation. These proposals would cover a 5-year agreement and would involve an increase inthe current foreign exchange costs of United Kingdom oil importsof about 8s. a ton, or  40 million a year. This, however, was lessthan half the additional cost which would result from acceptance infull of the demands of the oil producing countries. The oil companies&apos; negotiating team had been divided in order to enableseparate but simultaneous negotiations to be undertaken in Tehranand Tripoli. There was a reasonable prospect that the Gulf states would accept the proposals as a basis for negotiation. But the libyan attitude was more problematical; and it was unfortunate thatshortage of tanker tonnage made us unable to dispense with shorthaul supplies from Libya.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.
the Government than an immediate negotiated settlement. However,if the Civil Service staff associations received no further pay offer,they would almost certainly decide on 2 February to insist ona reference to arbitration. The Governmenfs dilemma was a choice between the risk of arbitration or the risk of unfortunateconsequences in the Post Office pay dispute resulting from a higheroffer now to the civil servants.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the inter-relationship between the Post Office workers&apos; pay negotiations andthose on the non-industrial Civil Service had been considered bythe Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations. their decision to withhold any advance in the pay offer to civil servantseven at the risk of a reference to arbitration which might leadeventually to a higher pay award was motivated principally by theconsideration that it would otherwise be impossible to ensure a firmstand by the Post Office at the present important juncture when theWilberforce Inquiry was taking place.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that british european Airways (BEA) had dismissed a small number ofmaintenance workers who refused management instructions during a work-to-rule and as a result the airline&apos;s engineering maintenanceworkers had gone on strike and brought BEA operations to a halt.The corresponding employees of British Overseas Airways Corpora-tion had on the previous day decided not to resort to strike actionin parallel. There was, however, a risk of industrial action againstthe British Airports Authority (BAA) who had been persuaded byhis Department to cancel a meeting with the trade unions that day at which BAA had envisaged reaching a settlement with their ownindustrial staff. The BAA negotiations would have had a significant,influence upon the nationalised airlines&apos; pay dispute because of the close links between these negotiations.In discussion it was suggested that, although public opinionappeared undisturbed about the Post Office strike, there was a riskof a sudden hardening of opinion as its effects became more severe,with some pressure for Government action to achieve a settlement.However, Press opinion, even when arguing in favour of an early settlement, appeared to be urging on the unions acceptance ofarbitration. It was not clear whether the frequent appearances on television of the UPW General Secretary were fully in accord withthe rules on this subject relating to members of the Board of governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that no 3change was required in the line taken by the Government on theAir TransportWorkers&apos; PayDisputes
CONFIDENTIALtatement 4.  The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of State*he for Defence (CP (71) 8) to which was appended the text of thestimates 1971 ProPosed Statement on the Defence Estimates 1971, together with afurther Note by the Secretary of State (CP (71) 9) listing the amendments to the text which were proposed as a result of itsdiscussion by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on26 January.The Defence Secretary said that the draft White Paper, although no less informative than the corresponding documents of recentyears, was considerably more concise and had been so drafted as toemphasise that, after the many changes in policy to which theServices had been subjected in recent years, they could now hope for a period of consolidation and stability.In discussion there was general agreement with the text of theWhite Paper. It was recognised, however, that the passage dealingwith the Governments policy in the Gulf presented certain difficulties both of substance and timing. Any form of words fromwhich it might be inferred that we intended that our Forces would remain in the Gulf for a prolonged period might well encouragePost Office workers&apos; dispute or in the pay negotiations fornon-industrial civil servants. The question of rules about appearanceson television by BBC Governors should be explored in relation tothe UPWs General Secretary. The Secretary of State for Employ-ment should provide his colleagues with a commentary on the reportin The Times newspaper of 27 January that excessively high pay increases had been given during the last four months to over1 million workers in the private sector. The Cabinet noted theprospect of industrial action affecting the BAA.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, toconsider the position on television appearances by theGeneral Secretary of the Union of Post Office Workerswhile a Governor of the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to circulate a commentary on the newspaper report mentioned in thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
some of the Gulf Rulers to disregard the efforts which we were making to persuade them to take positive steps towards achieving a viable Federation of Arab Emirates. As regards timing therewas a danger that the basis on which Sir William Luce had been authorised to conduct his present discussions with the Rulers wouldbecome public knowledge before the White Paper was published.It was possible, therefore, that the resultant speculation might makeit desirable for some form of holding statement on our policy in theGulf to be made in advance of the publication of the White Paper.As between the alternative versions of the relevant passage in the text there were considerable political objections to the longer versionin that it outlined our plans for terminating our defence commit-ments without indicating the positive steps which we proposed totake in order to help to maintain stability in the area. The best icourse, on balance, would be to adopt the shorter version, with a ;islight modification designed to make it clear that discussions with jthe Gulf Rulers had recently taken place, that a report fromSir William Luce was being considered and that an announcement would be made shortly. iThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the jCabinet approved the text of the White Paper, subject to the Jproposed modification of the shorter version of the passage on policy in the Gulf and to the incorporation of consequential amend- 1ments to the remainder of the text.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing 1up of their discussion.i(2) Invited the Defence Secretary to arrange for the Statement 1on the Defence Estimates 1971 to be published jaccordingly.CONFIDENTIAL j5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord 1President of the Council (CP (71) 3) about the report of the Select committee on Procedure on Question Time.The Lord President said that the Select Committee, which 1reported in March 1970, had recommended changes in the 1procedures for tabling and handling Questions and in the duration 1of Question Time. He was now being pressed to state the Govern-1menfs attitude to these recommendations. The most significant of them was that the rule introduced in 1965 under which 1oral Questions might not be put down more than 21 days before due I
for answer should be amended to reduce the maximum period of notice to 10 sitting days. The change would place an added burden on Ministers and their Departments; but it would be difficult tojustify its rejection to the House of Commons, and the Cabinet might agree with the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedurethat it must reluctantly be accepted. If so, he would commend theproposal to the House and leave it to a free vote. The SelectCommittee had also made some minor recommendations about the handling of Questions, the most important of which was that, wherea Member had put down two Questions to the Minister at the headof the list, his second Question should appear on the Order Paperbelow all first or single Questions to that Minister by other Members.These might be accepted. The Select Committee&apos;s second main commendation was that the House should meet at 2.20 p.m.instead of 2.30 p.m. on Mondays to Thursdays so as to allow more time for Questions. The Ministerial Committee had beenunanimous in disliking this proposal and had thought that it wouldnot commend itself to most Members. But in the present state of feeling in the House there was a risk that, if Motions to implement the recommendation were tabled, they would be carried. If therecommendation that the period of notice be reduced wereconceded, the better course might be to give the Houseno opportunity to vote on the duration of Question Time.In discussion there was general agreement that the hour atwhich the House met should not be advanced. As regards the periodof notice for Questions, however, it would be difficult to reject therecommendation that the maximum period should be reduced. Butthe effect of implementing in addition the recommendation that allfirst Questions should be given priority in the Order Paper over allsecond Questions would seem to be that Departments would not know until the day of answer which Questions were likely to call for an oral Answer. One way of resolving this difficulty would beto reject the recommendation about priority for first Questions; itwas reduction in the period of notice for which there seemed to be most demand. Alternatively it might be possible to arrange that the priority should be established at an earlier stage, perhaps when theQuestions were first tabled.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the recommendation for advancing the time ofPrayers should not be put to the House but that the maximum periodof notice for Questions should be effectively reduced from 3 weeks to 2 weeks. The Lord President should, however, consider whetherthis might not better be expressed as 14 calendar days rather than as 10 sitting days.
Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing!up of their discussion and invited the Lord President to;proceed accordingly. jThe Cabinet-
