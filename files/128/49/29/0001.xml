CM 29 (71)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Whitsun Recess.The Cabinet took note of the progress achieved in theCommittee Stage of the Industrial Relations Bill in the House ofLords. They expressed their warm appreciation of the part beingplayed by the Lord Chancellor, the Government spokesmenresponsible for the Bill and the Government^ supporters.confidential. The Prime Minister said he would shortly be invitingMinisters to review their oversea engagements up to the end of theyear in order that the Cabinet could concentrate fully on theimportant problems facing the Government, particularly in relationto the European Economic Communities.secret.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that althoughPress reports of major clashes between Indian and Pakistani forces on the East Pakistan borders should be treated with some reserve,the refugee problem was becoming increasingly grave.  The IndianPrime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, had claimed that there were nowover 3 million refugees from East Pakistan in West Bengal. He had recently discussed the Pakistan relief problem with President YahyaKhan&apos;s economic adviser, Mr. M. M. Ahmad, and had emphasised that the prerequisites of any effective relief effort were the prospectof a political solution and a concerted relief plan promoted by international agencies.   On the first point he had been given tounderstand that President Yahya Khan was expecting to startdiscussions with the political spokesmen of East Pakistan during thenext two weeks, which it was hoped would lead towards a political settlement.   On the second point he had agreed with Mr. Ahmadthat there was an urgent need to deploy a United Nations team inthe area to assess relief requirements.   Political stability in EastPakistan was also the key to the West Bengal refugee problem.Nearly all the refugees were Hindus; and the flow to West Bengalwould not be reversed until the fear of persecution had subsided.There was considerable concern in this country about the plightof the refugees. We had made an initial contribution of  1 million for their relief; but, although further demands might be made onus, it would be undesirable to commit ourselves to any additional contribution pending the response of other countries to the appeal
which was being organised by the United Nations Secretary-General.Any criticism of our attitude could reasonably be countered on the1  lines that action lay with the United Nations, whose efforts wewould whole-heartedly support.Trinidad The  Foreign  and Commonwealth  Secretary  said that a constitutional problem had been created as a result of an Oppositionboycott of the recent elections in Trinidad, in which Dr. Williams&apos;People&apos;s National Movement had won all 36 seats. The constitutionrequired that four seats in the Trinidad Upper House should be filled by the Governor-General on the advice of the Leader of theOpposition; but, in the absence of any occupant of this post, it was doubtful whether compliance with the constitution was possible. Inthese circumstances Dr. Williams might think it necessary to takeextraordinary constitutional action; and if, as a result, public order was disturbed, an attempt might be made to involve us. Thesituation was being kept under observation from this point of view.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.rhodesia previous reference:CM (71) 25thConclusions,Minute 3secret*4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that LordGoodman and our other emissaries had just returned from a secondvisit to Salisbury, at which some progress had been made on thesubject of a blocking mechanism designed to ensure that agreedimprovements in the status of the African majority would not besubsequently reversed. But the main constitutional problem ofunimpeded progress to majority rule within a reasonable periodstill presented difficulties. He would be reviewing the situation inthe light of the emissaries&apos; reports and would be consulting hiscolleagues in the near future. It was a matter for satisfaction thatsome progress had been made and that for the second time theemissaries&apos; visit had taken place without attracting publicity.The Cabinet-Took note of the Statement by the Foreign and Common-;wealth Secretary.EuropeanEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (71) 27thConclusions,secret;5.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that during;the Conference organised by the Financial Times at Oslo he hadJIbeen able to discuss briefly with Norwegian Ministers the problems!which acceptance of the fisheries policy of the European Economic!Community (e.c.) would create for Norway and ourselves.
confidential. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theNational Union of Blastfurnacemen (NUB) had informed the british steel Corporation (BSC) on the previous day that they intendedto take strike action on 1 June in support of a pay claim. in response to general pressure from the unions representing manual workers in the steel industry the BSC had it in mind to putproposals to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (is to), on22 June for an interim increase for their lower-paid workers, as a preliminary to a review of all the existing pay agreements, whichwere due to remain in force until March or June 1972. The BSCwere not prepared to weaken their negotiating position by settlingout of turn with the NUB, who represented only 15,000 out of100,000 steel workers covered by the agreements. The ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations had agreed that theCorporation should be supported in their resolve to stand firm in face of the threatened strike.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the view of the Ministerial Steering Committeethat the BSC should be supported in their proposal to withstandthe industrial action threatened by the NUB. The potentialimplications of the Corporation^ proposal to enter into negotiationswith the is to for an interim increase for lower-paid steel workers and a review of existing pay agreements would need careful examination by the Ministerial Steering Committee. Meanwhile,the BSC should make no move to present these proposals to theISTC.The Cabinet ! ,j Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry reported thatduring his recent visit to Stockholm some Swedish Ministers hadbeen critical of the possible effect of our accession to the e.c. onour trading relations with Sweden.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that the formalSwedish position had been recorded at a recent European free trade Area (EFTA) meeting, at which the EFTA countries had welcomed the progress of certain of their members&apos; discussions withthe e.c. and had agreed that it was for each member state of EFTAto decide separately on its future relationship with the e.c..The Cabinet-Took note.
confidential . The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP (71) 62) about policy for the nationalised industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals in cp (71) 62 derived from the commitment in the Conservative Party&apos;sManifesto at the General Election to reduce the Governmentsinvolvement in the nationalised industries and to secure bettercontrol of their investment and more efficient use of their resources.The studies on this subject which had been carried out by theConservative Party in Opposition, together with a further reviewconducted by the Business Team since the Government came to power, had been taken into account by the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Policy (EPC) in the preparation of the memorandumbefore the Cabinet.   There had been general agreement in theCommittee that doctrinaire measures should be avoided and thatthe primary objective should be to promote the efficient use of resources.   The introduction of the new system of accountabilityand control described in Annex A of CP (71) 62 would inevitablycreate certain short-term problems, since it was unlikely that inpresent economic circumstances the Government would in fact beable to avoid retaining some measure of detailed control overnationalised industry policy in critical areas such as prices and wages.  This would make it difficult to attract equity capital from private sources on any significant scale; and private loan capital had little or no advantage to offer.  Annex B of CP (71) 62 listed theactivities which EPC had considered should be the subject of consultation with the undertakings concerned as with a view toremoving them from public ownership; and paragraphs 6-8 of thememorandum indicated why the other activities of nationalised undertakings had been judged inevitable for similar treatment.EPC had considered that it was inadvisable that any generalannouncement of the Governmenfs intentions in relation to the nationalised industries should be made and that it would be preferable that individual decisions should be announced at theappropriate points.   The announcement about accountability andcontrol could be made either simultaneously with one statement ofthis kind or separately.In discussion some concern was expressed about the adequacy of the arrangements for control of the investment decisions of the nationalised industries, which had been the central issue in the study icarried out by the Conservative Party in Opposition. The review \conducted by the Government since they came into office, however, had i demonstrated that the organisation of the nationalised jindustries had not reached a sufficiently advanced stage of INationalisedIndustryPolicy
development to permit of a sophisticated system of control; thefirst requirement was to improve the flow of information on whichthe undertakings&apos; investment proposals were based and to developcorporate planning, which was still in its infancy. The introductionof a new form of control of investment policy would inevitablyaffect the responsibility of Ministers and might tend to increase thedifficulty of attracting first-class management. It would take a longtime to establish the nationalised industries on a profitable basis,particularly if there was a continued need on wider grounds for theGovernment to determine their pricing policy for them; and it was inevitable that in the meantime the Government would have tocontinue to finance them to some extent. In the past they had suffered from excessive political intervention; and the difficulty oftheir task had been aggravated by inconsistency in the objectives which they had been required to pursue. The essential requirementnow was to define their long-term strategy on a realistic and economically defensible basis.On the other hand it could be maintained that the nationalised industries had a long record of faulty investment decisions, even where adequate data as a basis for such decisions were available.In particular their managements seemed to pay too little regard to both the cost of, and the return on, their capital investment and toproceed on a tacit assumption that whatever funds they neededwould be made available. Their approach to investment decisionscompared unfavourably with that adopted by the private sector;and they were not subject to the same constraints, for example inpricing policy. Both their investment decisions and their access to capital should be brought under closer control; the present arrangements did not ensure sufficiently critical supervision either by the Treasury or by the sponsor Departments.In further discussion it was suggested that the problems alreadyconfronting the Government were sufficiently numerous to makeit inadvisable for them to take a pronounced public initiative inthe complex field of nationalised industry policy, particularly since it Would be necessary to proceed with care in implementing theproposal to reduce the day-to-day accountability of Ministers toParliament and in gradually transferring the focus of Parliamentaryconcern to the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries. Thiswas an additional reason for refraining from any generalannouncement of policy at the present juncture.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not satisfied that sufficient account had been taken of the studies carried out by the Conservative Party before the
General Election on a new central system to secure improvedfinancial control over the nationalised industries, an objective whichhad eluded all Administrations hitherto. Further consideration should therefore be given to the various possible means offpromoting such a system of control, including the concept of apublic sector finance corporation. The Cabinet would then resume their examination of the issues involved; and in the meantime thereshould be no consultation with the nationalised industries.The Cabinet 1. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther study of the issues involved on the basis indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2.   Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Gas andElectricityPricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 41stConclusions,Minute 4SECRET8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry (CP (71) 64) on gas and electricityprices. They also had before them a Note by the Central policy review Staff (CP (71) 65).The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the Gasand Electricity Councils wished to submit proposals for increases in tariffs to their respective Consultative Councils. The Gas Councilproposed tariff increases from 1 July averaging about 1\ per cent,to raise  28 million in 1971-72 and  44 million in the first full year.The Electricity Council proposed a surcharge from 1 Augustaveraging about 10 per cent on all tariffs not automatically adjustedfor fuel costs, to raise about  60 million in 1971-72 and  100 million in a full year.   This might be followed by a full revision ofelectricity tariffs early in 1972.  The present proposals followed very rapidly after the gas and electricity price increases earlier in theyear, mainly as a result of the rise in costs which had faced Britishindustry as a whole.   Nevertheless, if the.,nationalised industries iwere allowed to drift into continued deficit financing, a situation iwould eventually develop in which either a capital write-off or evenlarger price increases would be inevitable.   In these circumstances jjit should be the Government^ policy to establish realistic financial \objectives for the industries and to accept that prices must be \: properly related to costs.   Otherwise, it would not be possible to Ihold the Boards to account for the efficient performance dischargeof their functions, to secure soundly based investment programmes and to limit demands on the National Loans Fund.  In particular,unless price increases included some element of anticipation of wage and other cost increases, frequent increases in prices and a
continuing insufficiency of profits would be unavoidable. Thepublic presentation of the price proposals, however, should avoid any reference to anticipation of wage increases and should be basedon the need to relate prices to costs. The current objectives forthe gas and electricity industries were to earn 7-4 per cent and7 per cent respectively on net assets during the quinquenniumending March 1974. The gas tariff proposals were designed to meet this objective; but the electricity surcharge would do no more thanarrest the growth of the shortfall, which had reached  165 million by April 1971. To make good this shortfall by the end of the quinquennium would entail prices in excess of economic costs. Tobring prices in line with costs an objective of 7 per cent for the last three year of the quinquennium would be appropriate, requiringelectricity tariff increases in 1972 of about  140 million a year,inclusive of the proposed surcharge. He therefore invited theCabinet to agree that the Gas and Electricity Council should beallowed to submit their present tariff proposals to their respectiveConsultative Councils and that the electricity industry should bei required to plan its full tariffs revision on the basis of earning 7 percent on net assets from April 1971 to March 1974.In discussion it was suggested that, although the economic arguments  supported the  proposed price increases,  the more immediate problem was to arrest the inflationary spiral.   the cabinet&apos;s discussion of nationalised industry policy had established that there might be occasions when, in the short term, theGovernment would have to bring pressure on the industries foroverriding reasons of national policy, for example at the presenttime in support of wages policy, which had now reached a criticalpoint.   Many settlements in private industry were taking placebelow 10 per cent; and it was possible that further de-escalationcould now be achieved if the cost of living, which played a large part in the determination of trade union attitudes, could be adequately restrained.   It would be both a political and apsychological error to implement the present proposals so soon after the last tariff increases and at the beginning of a new wageround; and it might be preferable for the Government to rejectthem and to take credit for having done so.   Moreover, theproposals for gas tariffs made advance provision for future wage increases, which was contrary to the policy which the Governmenthad previously adopted.   Even if no reference was made to this fact in the public presentation of the issues involved, it wouldbecome known to other nationalised industries and would furtherweaken their incentive to keep costs under control.   There were grounds for thinking that the industries could do more to offset
rising costs by increased efficiency, for example by more effectiveapplication of the funds available for investment or by reductions in staff.  The example of the British Steel Corporation showed that financial sanctions, if stringently applied, could be an effective spur\to increase efficiency.On the other hand there could be no certainty that inflationcould be curbed by price restraint, particularly if it did not applyuniformly in both the public and the private sectors. There were some indications that the profitability of industry was now tending to recover; and it was important not to inhibit this tendency, whichwas essential to the provision of adequate funds for investment andshould be encouraged in the nationalised industries as much as in private industry. The allowance made for future wage and other:cost increases in the proposals for gas tariffs accounted for only about one-third of the proposed increase; and, if such allowances were disallowed, the industries would inevitably fail to achieve their financial objectives. The deferment of tariff increases in response to short-term considerations of wages policy would entail evenlarger increases later. The sale of gas and electricity below cost would also stimulate uneconomic levels of demand and so increaseboth the amount of investment needed and the industries&apos; calls onthe National Loans Fund, unless the Government were preparedto contemplate the possibility of supplies becoming seriouslyinadequate. It would be necessary, in the context of public expenditure, to examine the investment programmes of all the nationalised industries very critically; but it was wrong to argue that the efficiency of these industries was generally low or that theywere not operating in a competitive context. It was questionable whether the withholding of price increases was the best way ofspurring the industries to more economic operation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were confronted by the dilemma that the general economic arguments in favour of the price increases, which were set out inthe two memoranda before the Cabinet, conflicted with the need to reduce the serious inflationary pressure. The Cabinet were inclined to the view that in present circumstances the need to contain inflation must take precedence; but the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy would give further considerationto the issues involved in the light of the views expressed in thediscussion.1     The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.
CM 29 (71)SECRET9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 63) by theLord Privy Seal on the pay of the Industrial Civil Service (ICS).The Lord Privy Seal said that negotiations with the ICS had tobe begun on 7 June and that the Ministerial Steering Committee on pay Negotiations had recommended that the ICS should be offered a betterment increase averaging 1\ per cent but that there shouldbe no increase in this offer if it proved unacceptable. He wascontent to proceed on this basis; but the Cabinet should be aware that the offer fell short of the most stringent interpretation of the betterment system recommended by the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI), which indicated an average increase of8-7 per cent. Moreover, this figure itself might well be artificiallylow, since it was based on a single month&apos;s deviation of the EarningsIndex. Many of the staff concerned were low-paid, 36 per centearning less than  17 a week and 50 per cent less than  20 a week;and for those to whom productivity agreements did not apply almost half the ICS an increase of only 1\ per cent would represent a reduction in the standard of living. An offer of 1\ percent would therefore represent a departure from the fair wages policy which had been applied for many years and would be liableto be strongly resented by the ICS, who would feel that the Govern-ment were treating members of the public service inequitably. Therewas unlikely to be industrial action on any significant scale as animmediate result of the proposed offer on 7 June; but the risk would increase progressively thereafter and would extend to certain sensitiveareas. A clear distinction could admittedly be drawn between thetreatment of the non-industrial civil servants, to whom a clear pledgehad recently been given, and the ICS whose betterment rested only ontraditional practice. It would be important, however, that allpossible measures should be taken to ensure that &apos; a similarlystringent attitude was adopted in relation to other employers in both the public and the private sectors.In discussion there was general agreement on the critical natureof the decision on the ICS claim in relation to the 1971-72 round of pay increases in the public sector. The ICS had received verylarge betterment increases of 8^ per cent and \A\ per cent in thetwo previous years; and, while these increases had in part been designed to restore ground previously lost, it was also clear thatthey had set the pace for increases throughout the public sector in1970, particularly in relation to the local authority manual staff.Moreover, many of the ICS had received substantial productivityincreases, bringing their total earnings increase in some cases up to20 per cent. On the other hand the scope for increased productivityearnings would be reduced in future, since the Ministerial Sub-
Committee on Pay Negotiations had just approved more rigorouscriteria in this field.The implications of industrial action should be fully assessedbut it seemed clear that the political and economic hazards whichthe Government had successfully faced in withstanding comparableaction by the electricity supply workers in the previous autumnwere greater than any risk involved in action by the ICS.however, there were to be a dispute with the ICS, it was essentialthat the facts supporting the Government^ case should be clearlyestablished in a form in which they could be convincingly presented,to the public.  For the future the Office of Manpower Economicsmight   be   invited   to   re-examine   the  basis   of   the  NBPIrecommendations on the calculation of the central betterment;settlements: and consideration might also be given to transferrinthe responsibility for negotiations with the ICS from the CivilService Department to the individual employing Departments.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thCabinet agreed that the ICS should be offered a betterment increasof 1\ per cent and that there should be no authority at this stageincrease this offer if it proved unacceptable.   The implicationsindustrial action, however, should be examined as rapidlypossible and a report should be made to the Ministerial SteerinCommittee on Pay Negotiations.  The Chancellor of the Exchequeand the Secretary of State for Employment should arrange for earldiscussions  on  the need for  continued  de-escalation of pasettlements with the other employers in the public sector and withrepresentatives of private employers. He would arrange for furtheconsideration to be given to the future arrangements for dealing!with negotiations in respect of the ICS and to the possibility 6promoting an examination by the Office of Manpower Economicof the basis of the present betterment system.The Cabinet-1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summinup of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided accordingly &apos;arranging for negotiations with the Industrial CivlService.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaof State for Employment to take appropriate action, discussion with employers in the public and privatsectors, to secure continued de-escalation of wag&quot;settlements.
