(lieenditure&quot;to Paperviouseference:(70) 47th*ute 3CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (71) 5) to which was attached a draft white paper on Public Expenditure 1969-70 to 1974-75.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that since the Cabinet had approved in December the public expenditure programmes for theperiod to 1974-75, the few outstanding points had been settled andthe analysis elaborated and completed. The draft White Paper wasagreed by all Departments; he wished to pay tribute to theco-operation of Ministers and their officials.  The White Paper setout in detail the estimates of future expenditure and the conse-quences for expenditure of the new priorities established by theGovernment. It showed continuing success in restraining the growth of public expenditure.   It also provided more information andanalysis than previously particularly in respect of the last two yearsof the period, though the estimates for the latter were necessarilymore subject to adjustments than those for the earlier years.  Thedraft compared the previous Governments programmes as set out intheir White Paper (Cmnd. 4234, 1969), the prospective levels ofexpenditure in June 1970, the position resulting from the decisions taken in the autumn and set out in &quot; New Policies for public spending&quot; (Cmnd. 4515, 1970) and the latest estimates; certain amendments were proposed to make the comparisons even clearer.For the first time, also, the relative price effect was attributed to individual programmes, giving a more accurate measure of thedemand they would make on national resources.   It was not,however, intended that the White Paper should this year include a table showing public sector receipts as well as expenditure and the resulting balances. The previous assumption that existing tax rates would continue was unreal; moreover, in a changing economicsituation the calculation of forward revenue was less accurate thanthat of expenditure.  On any reasonable assumptions such a tablewould show a substantial move into deficit in the public sectoraccounts over the next few years.   This would be liable tomisrepresentation in the absence of more detailed explanation than was appropriate to a public expenditure White Paper.   Newinformation about charges was, however, being incorporated.   he invited the Cabinet to approve the draft White Paper for publicationthe following week.In discussion it was pointed out that the White Paper showed acomparatively low rate of increase for expenditure on the health services; the Cabinet might be invited at an appropriate moment to review the priority which had been accorded to them.
The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed the White Paper, subject to any minor amendments which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, thought necessary. It should be published in the course ofthe following week. The Cabinet wished to congratulate the chief secretary, Treasury, on the outcome of the current year&apos;s review ofpublic expenditure..    The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft White Paper on Public Expenditure1969-70 to 1974-75 attached to CP (71) 5, subject to suchminor amendments as the Chancellor of the Exchequerconsidered necessary.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord President, to make the necessary arrange-ments for the White Paper to be published in the courseof the following week and, thereafter, to be debated inParliament.confidential. The Lord President, informing the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons the following week, said thatthe slow rate of progress in Committee on the Industrial relations bill would make it necessary for the Government to move aTimetable Motion at some stage. The sooner the Motion was approved, the longer was the time that could be provided fororderly debate at reasonable hours; if a Motion was approved onMonday, 25 January, 10 further days could be provided for theCommittee Stage and 3 days for the Report and 3rd Reading: an extremely generous allowance of time in the light of the precedents.The Home Secretary, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were agreed that a Timetable Motion was inevitable;that proper and ordered discussion of the Bill could be bettersecured by introducing such a Motion on the earliest possible daythan by delaying it for a further week; and that it would, therefore,be right to introduce the Timetable Motion on Monday, 25 January.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Home Secretary&apos;summing up of their discussion.ParliamentaryAffairs
CM 3 (71)secret. The Home Secretary said that Ministers would have seencopies of telegrams from the Prime Minister regarding the prolongeddiscussions which had taken place on the previous day in bothrestricted and plenary sessions at the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; Conference at Singapore on the issue of the supply of arms to South Africa. With the decision to set up a study group ofrepresentatives of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, Jamaica, Kenya,Malaysia and Nigeria, the danger had been averted of a direct clashat the Conference with the opponents of the arms supplies to SouthAfrica. The Prime Minister, on his return would probably wish toconsider the situation with his colleagues on Monday in advance ofa Parliamentary statement, and Ministers should hold themselves in readiness accordingly.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Home Secretary.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said there was nofurther news about Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Montevideo,Mr. Jackson; and no demands had yet been received from hiscaptors. The Uruguayan former Minister of the Interior hadresigned and been replaced by another General.A terrorist incident had occurred on 20 January at her majesty&apos;s Consulate in Guatemala City where the security guardprovided for Her Majesty&apos;s Consul by the local government hadbeen shot dead by four armed youths, who had probably been trying to obtain possession of the security guard&apos;s sub-machine gun.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.secret. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thestate of negotiations between the major oil companies and the oilproducing countries appeared a little more hopeful than when hehad last reported to his colleagues, although it still seemed possiblethat the Persian Gulf States would seek to maintain a separate agreement covering production in their own countries. Thesituation was by no means clear, however, and the Cabinet shouldbe aware that if a breakdown in these negotiations should coincide with some hostile action by Nigeria in consequence of an announce-
ment about South African arms supplies, we might face a serious situation, especially if Libya should decide to follow NigeriaSexample. There was, however, no evidence that the last consequencewould necessarily ensue.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, before thestrike by the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW) had started hehad called in representatives of both sides to establish their relativepositions and the facts of the dispute. It had been clear from thediscussions, which had been lengthy and conducted in an atmosphere of goodwill, that the gap between the parties was at presentunbridgeable and the threatened industrial action inescapable. ThePost Office Corporation had taken a firm and well argued stand against improving their pay offer (and he himself had made it clear to them that they would be under no pressure from the Governmentto do so). On the UPW side, it was evident that the Union&apos; executive were under pressure from their more militant members and felt strike action to be a tactical necessity. The general secretary&apos;s stated public attitude of reasonableness and his com-mendation of the Governments attempt to conciliate were no doubtdue in part to his realisation that, lacking the funds to sustain a longstrike, the union would need within a week or two to take a new initiative to secure a settlement which would show the rank and filethat they had gained little from following the advice of the militantsand pressing their case by industrial action; but he would be equallyconscious of his need to win public opinion to the union&apos;s side.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that earlyreports that morning suggested that the union&apos;s industrial action was, if anything, having rather less adverse effects on Post office services on the second day of the strike than it had had on the first.Some 40 per cent of telephonists were still at work and 3,000-4,000postal workers had reported for duty. The Post Office corporation were paying close attention to the public presentation of their case and their efforts were making a good impact; but it would be unwise to underrate the UPW&apos;s skill in handling their own public relations.The Corporation were however anxious that the firm attitude theyhad adopted in response to the union&apos;s pay claim, initially at theGovernments behest but later on their own conviction, should not now be undermined by the impact on public opinion of the emphasisIndustrialAffairsPostal ServicesPreviousReference:CM (71) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3
CM 3 (71)currently being laid by Press reports on the Corporation^ own responsibility for conducting pay negotiations and their refusal tomake any improved offer. It would be helpful to the Chairman ifit could again be made clear that the Corporation^ action had the government&apos;s full backing.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although the emphasis given in the previous day&apos;s Press tothe Governmenfs move to conciliate in the dispute might have giventhe Post Office Corporation legitimate grounds for concern that theywere being left to fight their battle alone, any such concern should now have been dispelled by the widespread reference in the currentday&apos;s Press to the firmness of the Governmenfs own resolve.(b) The Government might usefully arrange further publicity for the view as being their own, as well as that of the Post Office that the UPW were in breach of an accepted agreement in rejectingarbitration on their claim; by stressing this and reiterating the effecton postal tariffs of meeting the claim in full, they would help to counter the impression given by the union that their attitude inthe dispute had been a wholly reasonable one.(c) As against this, although it was right for the Government to urge the use of agreed arbitration procedures as the means ofsecuring the orderly conduct of industrial relations, there weredangers in pressing too strongly for arbitration in the present dispute. In particular, there were apparent inequities in the existingpay structures for postal workers and telephonists whose correctionan arbitration body might well recommend, at a considerable costto the Post Office. These inequities were the subject of continuingstudies by working parties in the Post Office, and though it was desirable that they should be corrected, it would be unfortunate toallow a commitment to their removal to become the price of a resumption of work.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment remained in full support of the Post Office Corporation.It would, however, be unwise at present to make a further expressstatement to that effect; the matter could best be handled obliquelyon the lines suggested in discussion. The Cabinet were agreed thatno further Government action or initiative was required at themoment, in relation either to the deadlock in pay negotiations or theeffects of the strike; the Ministerial Committees concerned would,however, keep the position under continuing review.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Home Secretary.
NegotiationsPrivate Sector The Secretary of State for Employment said that he wasxf^ . arranging to see the President and Director-General of the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and a number of leadingprivate employers to impress upon them the Governments concern that the progress made in reducing the level of pay settlements inthe public sector should not be undermined by inflationary settle-ments by private employers. Having regard to forthcoming pay negotiations in the private sector, he would urge the CBI to influenceall their members to that end.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.Cabinet Office,21 January, 1971.
