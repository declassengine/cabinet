The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that the position of the Pakistani forces in the East Wingappeared to be hopeless and that they might collapse completelywithin the next day or two. The Pakistani Army had achieved somepenetration of Indian territory from West Pakistan; but neither sidehad made very significant advances on that front. Every effort was now being made to evacuate British subjects who wished to leavePakistan, particularly those in East Pakistan who were in the greatestdanger. Unfortunately, it had not yet proved possible to secureclearances for the aircraft which were standing by for this purpose;and it seemed unlikely that further efforts to be made that day wouldbe successful. The position on the ground was extremely confused;but no opportunity of removing British subjects to places of safetywould be lost. The United Nations General Assembly had passed a Resolution calling for a cease-fire and for the withdrawal by forcesof both sides. The British Delegation had abstained from voting onthe grounds that the Resolution was unlikely to have any practical effect and that to become involved in this initiative might haveawkward implications for our policies in other parts of the world,e.g. Rhodesia. We were continuing to take soundings at the united nations about the possibility, which seemed rather remote, ofworking out a common policy on the supply of arms and military equipment to the belligerents.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that he had summoned the Libyan Ambassador and had left him in no doubt of the serious view which we took of the action of the libyan Government in withdrawing their sterling balances andnationalising the assets of British Petroleum. The Ambassador, whoclaimed that he had no information on these matters, had said thathe would seek instructions from his Government. He had confirmed,however, that the Libyan action had been intended as a protest against the Iranian occupation of the islands of Abu Musa and theTunbs in the Gulf. The Chairman of British Petroleum had askedfor strong action in support of the claim for compensation which hethe Swansea City Council in providing free milk up to the time whenthey had decided to comply with the Act. The Borough Treasurerof Merthyr Tydfil had indicated that, if the District Auditor found of expenditure on free school milk had been improperly incurred, hewould not continue to sign cheques for that expenditure. TheSecretary of State for Scotland and he were in close touch about the presentation of the issues involved to public opinion.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that the milk Marketing Board had now desisted from issuing unhelpfuladvertisements drawing attention to the fact that free milk was nolonger supplied for pupils over the age of seven.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
would be making; but the effect of the Libyan action on oil supplies to this country:. I was not expected to be serious, at least in theimmediate future.j,; The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs reported that the Union of Arab Emirates had now been formallyestablished and that the Admission Committee of the United nations organisation had approved its application for membership. It was intended that the Trucial Oman Scouts should be transferred to theUnion within the following 10 days or so. Apart from Iraq andLibya, the Arab States had reacted rather mildly to the Iranianseizure of the islands in the Gulf; and there were indications thatthe Egyptian Government in particular were exercising a moderatinginfluence on the others. The Security Council would be meeting that afternoon; and there was some risk that the Iranian representatives would seek to pin on us all responsibility for the actions which wereunpalatable to the Arabs.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the debate on Rhodesia in the Security Council had been interrupted to make way for the meetings on the war between Indiaand; Pakistan;,and the Gulf. But it would no doubt be resumedshortly. On the whole the reaction to the announcement that proposals for a settlement had been agreed with the Rhodesian regimehad been moderate. It was hoped very soon to complete the membership of the Commission which was to conduct the Test ofAcceptability required to satisfy the Fifth Principle.; i The Cabinet-:   Took note of the statements by the Minister of State for;;/Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that therewould be a further Ministerial meeting in Brussels on Saturday,11 December, between the European Economic Community (e.c.)and the States applying for membership. He hoped that it wouldbe possible at this meeting to resolve the two main outstandingproblems the; Community&apos;s fisheries and animal health regulations.The prospect of reaching a satisfactory settlement on animal healthnow seemed reasonably good; but there remained serious fisheryproblems.: We had so far secured that we should enjoy exclusive fishing rights within the six-mile limit for 10 years from entry andthat there would then be a review to decide the arrangements there-after.1 /Provided that there was a genuine review at the end of thefirst 10 years we: should be able, by one means or another, to preserveouri-vital tiatlbhal&apos;interests in the subsequent period. But, although we could probably reach agreement on a satisfactory review formula,we&apos; should be liable to encounter considerably greater difficulty inpreserving the present position in a 6 to 12-mile belt in certain areasof our coastline which were of major importance to us.   The
Community had so far proposed that, for the first 10 years and subjectto review thereafter, we should continue to maintain the existingregime in the 6 to 12-mile area around the Orkneys, the Shetlandsand an unspecified part of north-east Scotland. In these areas,we should, of course, be expected to maintain the existing&apos; fishing rights of other Member States. We had requested, however,that this special treatment should be extended to the Shetland islands and the Orkneys, the Scottish coast from Cape Wrath to Berwick,the north-east coast of England to Spurnhead, the south-west coastfrom Sidmouth to Aberdovey and County Down. We could not expect, perhaps, to achieve this objective in its entirety; but, providedthat we realised it in part, we should have done reasonably well in practical terms, having regard to the existing fishing rights of member states within the existing 6 to 12-mile belt. An additional problem,however, was the fact that it now seemed improbable that theNorwegian Government would be ready to settle with the community on fisheries before next spring, in which case we should have to settleourselves before the final terms for Norway were known.  In thesej&apos;circumstances we should have to exert such influence as we could with the Federal German Government and others to keep thearrangements for Norway other than the comparative lengths of, 12-mile belts as close as possible to those for the United Kingdom.When he had discussed the matter on the previous day with theConservative Party&apos;s Fisheries Sub-Committee he had found thatthere was a widespread feeling that we were being asked to agree tounreasonable terms. Nevertheless, the economic impact on ourinshore and deep-sea fishermen of the arrangements on which wewere seeking to settle was more favourable than was generally, assumed; and this should be made clear in the public presentation ofthe probable outcome.In discussion it was pointed out that a number of theGovernments supporters in Parliament with fisheries interests werecomplaining that it now appeared that we should not secure as favourable a settlement as they had been led to expect and, as aresult, were indicating doubts about their continuing support for united Kingdom membership of the e.c.. This disquiet, however,had arisen partly because the Chancellor of the Duchy had prudentlygiven no undertaking that any specific areas in England would be assured of 12-mile rights, although we were in fact determined tosecure such rights for Devon and Cornwall and parts of north-east england. The Norwegian position placed us in greater difficulty.Our deep-sea fishermen were in favour of Norwegian accession to the eec in order that the Government of Norway might be precluded from extending their jurisdiction against other Member States beyond12 miles. On the other hand preferential treatment for Norway inrelation to the United Kingdom on the terms of the review clause orthe length of time for which the initial arrangements would run beforethe review would cause us very serious domestic political difficulties.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.
CoocordePreviousReference :CM (71) 61stConclusions,Minute 5i-jl1&quot; 1 I CONFIDENTIAL!5.: The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that ata meeting pn 7 December with the French Minister of Transport,M.: Chamant, the Minister for Aerospace had secured the objectivesas regards the future of the Concorde aircraft which the Cabinet had approved at their discussion on 2 December. In collaboration withhis colleagues principally concerned he was now seeking suitableopportunities to express the Governments wholehearted support forthe, project.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry., CONFIDENTIALNationalised 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChiefIndustry Secretary, Treasury (CP (71) 149), about nationalised industry policy.PolicyPrevious      .....The,Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Cabinet had invitedReference : ;   the Chancellor of the Exchequer earlier in the year to consider furtherCM (71) 29th   ways&apos;of securing improved financial control over the nationalisedConclusions,    industries, including the concept of a Public Sector FinanceMinute 7      &apos; Corporation (PSFC), which might control the allocation of capital to the industries and hope ultimately to attract private capital as well., This, concept implied less intervention by the Government in manage-ment but greater strategic control based on better information; andit would require the establishment of improved methods ofaccountability and control within the nationalised industries. It had also been: envisaged that as far as possible the same criteria should apply in the attraction of capital, from whatever source, to the nationalised industries as applied to the private sector and that theGovernment should be in a position to ensure, with the minimumi of detailed intervention, that the nationalised industries complied with: the broader needs of national policy.Subsequently it had become necessary to apply to the nationalised industries a policy of stringent price restraint, in supportof the initiative by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Butthis had demonstrated the conflict between those two objectives andhad retarded progress in making the industries viable. The broader; objective for the next few years should therefore be to make good, the setback resulting from the effects of price restraint on the finances of the undertakings. In these circumstances it would be unrealistic to proceed with the concept of a PSFC at the present time. But themeasures to improve accountability and control set out in CP (71) 62should be. put into effect; and the various possibilities for.   . denationalisation contained in Annex B to that memorandum should. ;   betfurtherconsidered by the Ministers concerned. At the same time,it&apos; was necessary to equip the Government to carry out its&quot;entrepreneurial&quot; functions more effectively; and recent discussionof the concepts of a Regional Development Agency and a Ship-building; Agency had shown that there might be need for an agency
to implement, centrally as well as regionally, the responsibilitiesaccepted by the Government towards private sector concerns in which large sums of public money were at risk. The establishment of suchan agency should permit greater expertise to be brought to bear onthe;problems which confronted industry; and it was in any case likelyto be made necessary by future policies for full employment, involvingadditions to, and changes in, the pattern of public industrial investment in both public and private sectors. Consideration should therefore be given in this context to the form of central organisationbest suited to provide for the management of public investment in selected industrial enterprises, including at the outset those parts ofthe nationalised industries which were in a position to attract private capital or could without legislation be converted into Companies Actcompanies, together with existing subsidiaries which could betransferred to such an organisation without legislation.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries should now take steps to carry into effect the measures toimprove the industries&apos; accountability and control which had beensuggested in CP (71) 62. Care should be taken to give no publicindication of changes in the nature of Ministers&apos; accountability toParliament in advance of a considered formal announcement. TheMinisters concerned should also, as appropriate, pursue the proposals in Annex B to CP (71) 62 on the future of particular nationalised industry activities, subject to the approval, case by case, of the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy. The Cabinet endorsed the view that the broader objective for the next few years should beto make good the effects of price restraint on the finances of the nationalised industries. The pricing policy to be followed after theend of the present period of price restraint, however, would need to be discussed with the CBI as soon as they were ready to do so&apos;,bearing in mind the complications arising, for example in the case of&apos; the&apos;British Steel Corporation, from our intention to join the european economic Communities. The question of a central organisation toprovide for the management of public investment in selected;industrial enterprises was linked with the wider question of themeasures which were now under consideration for reducingunemployment and securing the expansion of industrial capacitygenerally. Any further study of such an organisation should accordingly be undertaken within this wider context.y  The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concernedwith the nationalised industries to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,9 December, 1971.CONFIDENTIAL
