The Cabinet, who had before them revised drafts ofThe Queen&apos;s Speeches (CP (71) 117 and 118), approved one further amendment to the draft Speech for the Opening of Parliament.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had announced on 18 October a further allocation of  7^ million forrefugee relief in India and  1 million for relief in East Pakistan.These large payments were part of the price of the failure by theparties concerned to make progress with a political settlement;and we could not carry this burden indefinitely. The impendingvisit of the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, to this country would provide us with an opportunity of seeking to establish India&apos;sreal aims and to make some progress in reducing the numbers inrefugee camps. The first requirement was to establish the facts.Present evidence was conflicting, the Indian Government maintaining that the flow of refugees still amounted to 40,000 a day, whereas the Pakistani authorities claimed that it had virtually ceased. Hewas pressing the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant,to obtain reliable information on this point. In the political contextthe recent initiative by the President of Pakistan, Yahya Khan,towards establishing a civilian government in East Pakistan had had a mixed reception. The Bangladesh leaders were still insistingthat their starting point in any discussion was that East Pakistan1. The Cabinet considered the arrangements for the forth-coming debate in the House of Commons on our accession to theEuropean Economic Communities. In discussion Ministers agreed on the importance of clearly defining our position on the issue of fisheries, on which negotiations were not yet complete.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that three dayswould now be required for the corresponding debate in the Houseof Lords. Although it would have been desirable to conclude the debate in the Upper House on the day before the end of the commons debate, it had proved impossible to secure the agreement of theOpposition to a programme which would make that possible. the debate would, therefore, take place on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday of the following week.The Cabinet (1)  Took note of the statement of the Lord Privy Seal.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy and the, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to settle the terms in which our position on the issue of fisheries should be described in the debate.
should be independent. Meanwhile, IndoPakistani relationsremained tense; and, although it seemed unlikely that India would begin a war, the possibility that Pakistan might in desperation attackKashmir could not be ruled out.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that it would bedifficult to refer the situation to the United Nations as a threat to peace, since neither India nor Pakistan accepted that there was such a threat. Consideration should perhaps be given, however,to arranging some judicious publicity for the political efforts whichwe were making to reduce the present tensions.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that good progress had been made towards the formation of a Union of ArabEmirates, combined with plans for the maintenance of residual local military forces in the area after our withdrawal. The continuedinsistence of the Shah of Iran on estabhshing Iranian sovereignty over the islands of Tunbs and Abu Musa, however, was a majorobstacle to a satisfactory settlement; and, although some progress had been made in reconciling opposing attitudes by our special representative, Sir William Luce, the situation was still potentiallydangerous. Sir William Luce was paying another visit to the area during the following week, after which Ministers would probablyneed to give further consideration to our own plans.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP (71) 116) about statutory local authority committees.The Home Secretary said that the White Paper &quot; LocalGovernment in England: Government Proposals for Reorganisation &quot;(Cmnd. 4584) had stressed the importance of sound management in local government and had indicated that the present controls affectingthe internal organisation of local authorities would be re-examined in order to give the authorities the maximum discretion to take theirown decisions within national policies. In this connection the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment(RE) had been considering which of the statutory requirementsimposed on local authorities to appoint committees for particularfunctions should be retained in the legislation to reorganise localgovernment in England and Wales. It had been agreed that severalstatutory committees were no longer required but that statutorycommittees for police and for national parks would still be neededbecause they contained members appointed from outside localgovernment. RE had not been able to agree, however, on thetreatment of the statutory committees for social services and for education. As regards education it was arguable that the service was now sufficiently well-established not to need a statutory
committee. On the other hand there were grounds for fearing thatthe present breadth of representation in the education committeesmight be jeopardised if the requirement was withdrawn; and itswithdrawal would be strongly opposed by the Association ofEducation Committees and the National Union of Teachers. Whilethe statutory requirement to maintain a committee might be abolishedin the context of general removal of all such requirements, RE had accepted that it could not be abolished so long as social servicescommittees remained obligatory. The requirement to appoint aseparate committee for social services, however, had only recentlybeen imposed, following the recommendations of the SeebohmCommittee, in order to establish and protect the newly-integratedlocal authority social services.In the light of these considerations some members of RE had felt that the retention of statutory committees for social services andfor education would not only lead to pressure for the retention ofother committees which, it was agreed, could be dispensed withbut would also weaken the credibility of the Governments promise to confer greater independence on local authorities. These argumentspointed either to the abolition of the statutory requirement or atleast to the establishment in the forthcoming legislation of a clearterminal date, e.g. 1981, possibly with a provision for a furtherlimited extension by Order. Other members of RE, however, had maintained that any mention of a terminal date at this stage wouldbe seen as undermining the basis on which the new service wasbeing built and would give encouragement to those local authorities who were still hostile to the Seebohm reforms. Morale among thesocial services staff would be impaired; and services which were responsible for helping the poorest and most vulnerable membersof the community would suffer. Whichever decision was taken,however, the Government were likely to be criticised, either for not living up to their promises to give more freedom to localgovernment or for not caring about the poor and under-privilegedand for giving a low priority to education.In discussion it was suggested that, even in the absence of a statutory requirement, local authorities could be expected to appointseparate committees to exercise their main functions. If statutorycommittees were maintained for some of these functions, however,it would be difficult to find convincing reasons for resisting proposals to create such committees for the other functions where there wasno less urgent a need for energetic development of the service,such as housing or employment. Police committees and nationalparks committees had only reluctantly been admitted as special cases because they contained representatives appointed from outsidelocal government and because their areas did not always coincide with local government boundaries. The Government had declaredthat the main reason for reform was to give more power to localgovernment; and the local authority associations would regard thedecision on statutory committees as a test of the genuineness ofthat intention. A recent report by representatives of local govern-ment,,which had obtained wide publicity in local government circles,had strongly criticised the imposition of requirements for statutory
icommittees, on the grounds that there was no evidence that servicessubject to statutory controls over committees or officers were betteradministered than services without such controls. The argument that the local authority social services had only recently beenintegrated into a new service could be met by the compromisesuggestion that the requirement should not be abolished forthwithbut should be continued until a predetermined date.On the other hand it was urged that statutory requirements toappoint particular committees did not in practice greatly restrictlocal authorities&apos; freedom of management. In demanding moreindependence, local authorities were more concerned about thescope of the functions allotted to them and about their power toappoint the members of committees than about statutory require-ments that the committees should be established. The report bylocal government representatives had ignored the beneficial effect which the statutory requirement of a separate children&apos;s committeehad had on the child care service. The reforms recommended bythe Seebohm Committee had been supported on both sides ofParliament. If doubt was cast now on the Governments acceptanceof the principle of those reforms, many of the more able directorsand professional staff would be unwilling to seek reappointmentwhen the new local authorities were created in 1974. It wouldalso have an adverse effect on the public presentation of theGovernments record on services to the poor and disabled. Asregards education, while it might be possible to remove the statutoryrequirement in the context of a universal removal of all such require-Reinforcements, abolition of the requirement in any other circumstances would be widely criticised by the whole range of educational opinion.: The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that maintenance of statutory requirements toappoint particular committees would be criticised as inconsistent with the general intention of the reorganisation of local government.Oh the other hand, a decision to set a terminal date on the statutory requirements to appoint education and social services committees would provoke widespread opposition from those concerned withthose services and would be represented as evidence that theGovernment did not care for the under-privileged and the disabled.On balance, therefore, the Cabinet concluded that local authoritiesshould continue to be required by statute to appoint committees for education and for social services. This could be defended onthe grounds that considerable steps had been taken towards removingother such statutory requirements but that in the case of social services the requirement had only been recently introduced in supportof a newly-integrated service, and in the case of education there wasa risk that the breadth of representation in the committees mightbe impaired if the requirement was removed.The Cabinet Agreed that in the forthcoming legislation to reform localgovernment in England and Wales, local authorities should still be required to appoint separate statutory committees for education and for social services.
Review of 5. .; The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivyGovernment     Seal &apos;(CP (71) 115), reporting the conclusions of the MinisterialResearch and   Committee on Science and Technology on a review by theDevelopment    Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) of Government research anddevelopment and making recommendations about the presentationalissues involved.  The CPRS report was attached to CP (71) 115.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Committee had consideredthe CPRS report and had endorsed its principal recommendations.They had also concluded that the report itself should not be publishedbut that it should be incorporated, with the minimum of textualalteration, in a White Paper, which should be published simultaneously with a separate but related report by the Chairman of the council for Scientific Policy (the Dainton report). In order to honour earlierundertakings that the Government would initiate full consultation on their proposals for the future organisation of research anddevelopment it would be desirable that the President of the royal society, the Chairmen and Secretaries of the Research Councils andthe Institution of Professional Civil Servants should be informed,about one week before the White Paper was published, of both the: Dainton report and the Governmenfs intentions and should be toldat the1 same time of the basis on which the Government envisagedsubsequent discussion of their proposals. This discussion wouldbe directed to the detailed implementation of the customer-contractor relationship recommended by the CPRS report, including,in particular, the extent of the transfer of financial provision forthe Research Councils from the Science Budget to DepartmentalVotes.&apos;   ;-f. The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that sheendorsed the proposals in the Lord Privy seal&apos;s memorandum. Butthey involved major changes in the organisation of government research and development; and the Government would be wise to devote both time and trouble to securing the maximum agreement to their new policy and to implementing it over a reasonable period which would allow the Research Councils adequate opportunity forthe necessary adjustment.In discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable to publish the CPRS report as it stood, but in the form of a Green,rather than a White Paper. Its forthright style would be in keeping with the Government&apos;s commitment to more open government; andit would enhance the reputation of the CPRS. On the other hand,an important question of principle was involved. If advice givenconfidentially to the Government were published in one instance,the integrity of the Governmenfs advisers in general would be liableto be compromised because the advice would inevitably be comparedwith the decision. The Governmenfs advisers might then cease tobe accepted as impartial and might come to be regarded as littlemore than pressure groups. In this respect the CPRS were in thesame position as other Departmental advisers; and, if their reporton research and development were published, this would establish a precedent for future reports, both by the CPRS and perhaps byother advisers, which it would be hard to resist.
i      As regards the undertaking of consultation which had been*given to the scientific community, it was suggested that limitedI circulation of a White Paper shortly before it was published, as1 proposed in CP (71) 115, would not be accepted as full consultation.Nor could the discussions which had already been held by the CPRS; with the community be regarded as satisfying this requirement.; The Governmenfs proposals were likely in any event to evoke; criticism; and this increased the importance of seeking to associate: the scientific community with them as far as possible.  On theother hand there had already been considerable delay in reaching decisions; and from the point of view of the morale of the scientificestablishments concerned it would be preferable to publish as rapidly as possible a White Paper, endorsing the main principles of the cprs report as approved policy, and to offer subsequently to engage in more detailed consultations about their precise application.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the substance of the CPRS report and acceptedits main principles as a basis for future policy. It would be necessaryto arrange for sufficient discussion with the scientific community,as regards both the policy and its implications, to avert any criticism that the Government had failed to carry out their undertaking of full consultation on the organisation of research and development.For this purpose the Government should publish an appropriatedocument but should stipulate a definite time limit for the subsequent discussions. The form and content of this document would dependon a prior decision whether the CPRS report should be published as it stood; and he would give further consideration to the balanceof advantage on this issue. The Cabinet would have anotheropportunity of discussing it before a decision was taken.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministefs summing up of their discussion.5 (2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.SECRET, 6. The Minister for Aerospace said that Britten Norman Ltd.,a small company which produced the &quot; Islander &quot; aircraft, had become insolvent. The company had lost nearly  2 million andhad total liabilities of  4f million, compared with assets of about 3 million including stocks and work in progress. It had soldaircraft at well below the cost of production; and it had a stock ofabout 70 completed &quot; Islander&quot; aircraft, although there wereprospective orders for only 17. The aircraft was also producedunder licence in Romania; but the market was limited by the refusal of the United States authorities to grant a certificate of airworthiness.A new venture, the &quot; Trislander&quot;, would need substantial new investment capital; and the project depended in part on tentativenegotiations for its purchase by either the Romanian or the israeli government. Moreover, a United States Company had justintroduced a new aircraft to serve the same market at a considerablylower price than the &quot; Islander &quot;. Since the Ministerial Committeeoh Economic Policy had considered the situation earlier that week,the British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC) to which much of theBrittenNormanLimited
production was sub-contracted, had asked Britten Norman to repaya million loan which had been guaranteed by the ExportersRefinance Corporation (ERC). Britten Norman could not repay the loan; and the ERC, which had itself lent  3 million to thecompany, had decided to appoint a Receiver. In these circumstances;it would be right that the Government should take similar actionin respect of their own interest, which consisted of a  250,000debenture and an unsecured liability of about  120,000 for leviesdue under a launching aid agreement. The Governments action should preferably follow, within 24 hours, the appointment of aReceiver by ERC, in order to make it clear that the prime responsi-bility lay with the latter. It might be desirable, however, that officials should thereafter explore, without commitment, whether any action could usefully be taken, after the company had gone into receivership, to assist in the maintenance of the &quot;Islander&quot;production line, particularly to safeguard the provision of anafter-sales maintenance and spares service.In discussion it was pointed out that the liquidation of BrittenNorman would adversely affect the prospects of the sale of british aircraft abroad, not least in the loss of prospective orders for theTri slander. There would also be public concern that a privateventure which had shown imagination and promise should now have failed. On the other hand it was clear that the company,which did not form an important part of the aircraft industry, wasnot viable, that no important social or strategic issues were involved and that it would therefore be wrong for the Government to try tosupport it. Moreover, to assist the company with further funds inorder to,, prevent liquidation would risk involving the Governmentin responsibility for all its liabilities. At the same time it was important to avoid any action which would create the impression that the Government were directly involved in the decision to appoint a Receiver or would associate the Government with that decision.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted the action being taken by ERC to put Britten Normaninto receivership and agreed that events should be allowed to take their course. It was important, however, to dissociate theGovernment, so far as possible, from any direct responsibility for initiating the action taken. The appointment of a Receiver to protect the Governments stake in the company should therefore be delayedfor at least 24 hours after the ERC Receiver had been appointed;and any statement by the Government should be confined to rebuttingcriticism of their alleged failure to assist the company. At thesame time, and on the basis that Government assistance in any form was unlikely to be forthcoming, the Minister for Aerospaceshould have discretion to explore, in confidence and without commitment, the possibility of keeping the &quot; Islander &quot; project aliveafter the Receiver had been appointed.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for Aerospaceto be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,21 October, 1971
