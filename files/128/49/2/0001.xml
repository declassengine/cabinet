confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.secret. The Minister for Posts and Telecommunications said thatthe Union of Post Office Workers (UPW) would be meeting thePost Office Board that day in pursuance of their pay claim, in response to which the Post Office had so far offered a 7 per centpay increase. The UPW had declared that, in default of asatisfactory improvement on the offer, they would take industrial action; the Union executive were to meet the following day andwere likely to call for an official strike beginning on the following monday. The Post Office proposed to improve their offer to 8 percent, with the addition of a further % per cent to which they were committed under productivity agreements affecting some of thestaff concerned, and this offer had already been approved by ministers. The UPW were unlikely to accept the improved offer and they had already rejected arbitration. They had virtually nostrike funds and might in the event decide on a work-to-rule ratherthan full strike action, though there might be pressure from union members for the latter and, in the view of the Post Office, the UPWcould sustain a full strike for a week or a fortnight, especially ifpublic opinion were favourable to the postal workers. A full strike would disrupt normal postal services but have a less severe effecton telecommunications. Main Post Offices would be likely to closebut so long as sub-Post Offices were able to continue it seemed likely that the majority of social security payments could be kept up; there were also plans for continuing some of these paymentsCONFIDENTIAL1. The Home Secretary expressed the Cabinefs relief that theSecretary of State for Employment and his wife and daughter had escaped unhurt from the bomb explosions that had taken place athis house on 12 January and their admiration of the dignity andcourage which he had shown after the incident.He informed the Cabinet of arrangements made by the policefor the protection of members of the Cabinet and said that he had arranged for a police officer to call on each of them to explain the precautions which they should take.
through the local offices of the Department of Health and social security and the Department of Employment, subject to the co-operation of the staff concerned.   However, it was likely that theUPW would seek so far as possible to avoid action which would interfere with the maintenance of social security payments.   Eventhe pay increase of 8 per cent which was to be offered would belikely to necessitate a further increase of at least a penny in postaltariffs within the next year or two, and the Post Office Board were anxious about the financial effects of any greater pay concession.They would be doing all they could to make these effects clear tothe public.   In previous instances of industrial action by postalworkers, however, pressures had quickly built up from industry and commerce to reach an early settlement which would bring the disruption of services to an end.  While, therefore, the Post office board were very ready to stand firm on an 8 per cent offer, theysought reassurance that the Government as a whole were fullycognisant of the disruption that a postal strike would cause and the pressures that it would generate and that they would have the fullbacking of Ministers.  They also wished to be sure that ministers would not concede, either before or during a postal dispute, a largeroffer in response to the claim for a central pay increase for theCivil Service.  The corresponding offer of 8 per cent for the CivilService had however already been rejected by their Staff Side and,if it were to be improved, the Post Office Board would feel obligedto revise their own offer in parallel, though they thought it unlikelythat the UPW would be prepared to reach a settlement at lessthan a 10 per cent increase with certain additional concessions.  if his colleagues confirmed that the Post Office Board should not go beyond 8 per cent in an attempt to avoid the threatened industrial action, the fact that the UPW had rejected arbitration in advance would assist the employers&apos; stand in the eyes of public opinion and,if the support of public opinion could be retained, a settlementmight become possible at some further marginal, face-savingincrease in about a fortnights time.   If, however, public opinionsupported the postal workers, it seemed&quot; unlikely that the strikecould finally be settled except for an increase exceeding 10 percent.The Lord Privy Seal said that the central pay claim for theCivil Service related to some 140,000 staff and his colleagues had authorised him to make an offer not exceeding 8^ per cent to secure a settlement. However, publication of the December wage indexhad strengthened the Staff Side&apos;s resolve to reject the 8 per centso far offered as inadequate and they were in his view unlikely toaccept an improved offer which did not exceed 9 per cent. If theStaff Side were to opt for arbitration, an award of as much as 11-12 per cent was possible.   For this reason and because of the
SECRETimportance of retaining the good will of the Civil Service, whoseconfidence in the Governments professed intention of notdiscriminating against the public service had been underminedunder the previous Administration, he would see great advantage in improving the current offer in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement. However, he accepted that the Civil Service pay claimcould not be handled without regard for its effects on the PostOffice negotiations; and, if his colleagues concluded that the PostOffice should adhere to their present offer, he accepted that there could be no resumption for the present of negotiations on the CivilService claim.In discussion, the view was expressed that the Cabinet lackedthe detailed information to form judgments over the desirabilityof offering relatively marginal increases of the order of 1 per centin the offers under discussion: these were matters which were better considered by the Ministerial Committees concerned with pay negotiations in the light of fuller information as to relative payrates and earnings. It was in any event now impracticable to alter the negotiating tactics already agreed for the Post Office negotiations that afternoon, in which the Post Office Board already had latitudeto arrange their offer to the best advantage within a maximumincrease of 8 per cent on earnings, together with the \ per cent dueunder productivity agreements. On balance it would be desirableto adhere to that limit. It would, however, be important to ensurefuller publicity for the level of Post Office workers&apos; earnings andfor the effects on postal charges of conceding higher wages. It wasalso important to continue stressing the reasons why wage inflationneeded to be fought by a series of battles over individual pay claims and could not be ended by adopting a single policy on wages and prices.Pay of Local The Rome Secretary said that the pay settlement of JanuaryAuthority 1970 for firemen employed by local authorities had provided fora 15 to 17^ per cent pay increase from that date^, a reduction inhours of work from April 1971 which in effect meant an increasein pay of 4  per cent for that year, and an evaluation of the workof a fireman by comparison with outside employment, taking intoaccount the long hours for which firemen were at work or on call.The fire authority employers, after a false start in the negotiations,had offered the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) a pay increase of 10per cent for the 1971 pay negotiations, which would include the A\per cent value of the April hours reduction; it would thereforemean a further pay increase of only 5  per cent. This was coupled with an undertaking to carry out the previous commitment to havean inquiry into the evaluation of the fireman&apos;s job, which wouldtake some months and would lead to further negotiations on the
level of pay appropriate from then on. The FBU had decided toaccept this offer and would not be extending their present industrial action, in which firemen were only responding to emergency calls.They would consider reverting to normal working if satisfied aboutthe composition and terms of reference of the inquiry. Given thatthe A\ per cent hours reduction and the inquiry were both priorcommitments from the period of the previous Administration, asettlement at a cost of only a further 5\ per cent increase was highlysatisfactory and the Government should make efforts to impressthis view of the settlement upon the public.Pay of The Secretary of State for Social Services said that negotiationsNurses on faQ pay 0f National Health Service nurses had begun on 12January, when the nurses&apos; representatives rejected an offer of apay increase of 1\ per cent against their claim for 20 per cent.There would no doubt be attempts in the near future to lobbyMinisters and Members of Parliament, and to arouse sympathyamong the members of the public for the nurses&apos; claim.In discussion it was suggested that the Government should, ifpossible, avoid a pay dispute with nurses, since there would nodoubt be strong public sympathy for the pay claim. In agreeing to the initial offer of 1\ per cent, the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Pay Negotiations had understood that an opening offer in these terms would be consistent with a quick settlement achieved withoutpublic dispute, if that were desired, and were expecting to be consulted very shortly about the means of achieving that result.An acrimonious dispute about nurses&apos; pay with an eventualsettlement at a very high level would have a damaging effect on other pay settlements.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that in negotiations with the UPW the Post office board should that day offer no more than 8 per cent, plus the \ percent due under productivity agreements^ contingency plans againstthe possibility of industrial action by Post Office workers had beenconsidered and agreed by the Ministerial Committee on emergencies. The outcome of the negotiations and their implications for the handling of the central pay increase for theCivil Service should be further considered by the ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations at a meeting early in thefollowing week. The Committee should also take stock of thenegotiations on the pay claim in respect of nurses.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Home Secretary&apos;summing up of their discussion.
CM 2 (71)confidential. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that hehad ordered a preliminary inquiry into the accidents that had occurred in the English Channel off Folkestone on 11 and 12January. Three ships were involved; two had sunk and 29 people were dead or missing. The accidents took place outside UnitedKingdom territorial waters, and all the ships and their passengers and crews were foreign. The inquiry would be of limited use, sinceonly a few witnesses would be available, but he had asked theGovernments of the Flag States concerned for permission for officials of his Department to attend any inquiries which theymight hold. At present the traffic in the Straits of Dover wasgoverned by an international separation scheme, involving separatetraffic lanes for up-channel and down-channel traffic. It was forthe most part observed (although it was possible that one of theships involved in the accidents might not have complied with it),but it was not mandatory. He was seeking to improve the existing scheme by securing agreement in the Intergovernmental maritime consultative Organisation to its extension and to its being mademandatory. Trinity House and certain pilots bad advocated achange in the scheme by reversing the traffic lanes, but this proposal was likely to create more danger to shipping, particularly since thebulk of traffic in the Straits was bound for European and not UnitedKingdom ports, and the proposal would involve severe crossingdifficulties.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.secret. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said thattalks between the major oil companies and oil producing countries on higher prices for oil from the Persian Gulf had been broken offafter the oil company representatives had intimated that they werenot yet ready to engage in substantive negotiation. The oil companies wished to avoid negotiating piecemeal or with individual groups of producers, both in the Gulf and elsewhere,but were hampered in the pursuit of their aim of simultaneousnegotiations by the need under American Anti-Trust laws to securethe agreement of the United States Justice Department to theirdoing so: steps were being taken to press the Americans on this inview of the severe consequences of risking the disruption of
Western Europe&apos;s oil supplies, and there were good prospects thatthe companies would soon be able to engage in joint negotiations.Meanwhile an extraordinary general meeting of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries had been summoned for 19January. It should be clearer by the end of that week how far the producing countries were prepared to go to put further pressure on the companies, and what degree of risk to our oil supplies we might face. Our current stock reserve represented some65-70 days&apos; normal consumption (as compared with our target of90 days&apos; normal consumption). Emergency oil supply arrangementsfor the whole of Western Europe were handled by the Oil Committeeof the Organisation for European Co-operation and development which would also be meeting next week.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.SECRETOverseaAffairsKidnapping ofHMAmbassador,Montevideo6. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, reviewingdevelopments since the kidnapping on 8 January of HM ambassador to Uruguay, Mr. Geoffrey Jackson, said that the kidnapping hadbeen skilfully planned and executed. The guards accompanyingMr. Jackson had not been armed. But even if they had been, it was by no means certain that they could have prevented the kidnapping.The Deputy Under Secretary for Administration at the foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr. Oliver Wright, had flownto Montevideo on 12 January and had had an initial interview withthe Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs at which he hadconveyed to the latter a personal message from the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary. At this meeting, Mr. Wright had beenprimarily concerned to establish a rapport with the Uruguayanauthorities: in further conversations depending on their reaction, hewould seek to induce them to follow the tactics successfully pursued by the Canadians in the case of the kidnapping of the UnitedKingdom Trade Commissioner in Montreal, Mr. Cross, and enterinto a dialogue with the kidnappers. Mr. Wright had also beengiven a message from the Prime Minister to convey to theUruguayan President, and would deliver this when the President,who was at present out of Montevideo, returned to the capital.Mr. Wrights first impression had been that the outlook was somewhat less gloomy than it had appeared on his departure from london. The Uruguayan Government had declared a state ofemergency and were vigorously pursuing the search for Mr. Jackson.They had moreover increased the reward they had offered for
secret the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that on 11January Soviet authorities at checkpoints had prevented Alliedfreight vehicles from proceeding between Berlin and western germany along the autobahn on the grounds that theirdocumentation was inadequate. The British, French and UnitedStates political advisers had, on instructions, jointly protested to theSoviet authorities in Berlin on 12 January. The Russians hadalleged that there had been a misunderstanding, but had continuedto maintain that the documentation of the Allied vehicles infringedagreed procedures specifying that the vehicles&apos; documents shouldcertify that they belonged to the garrison of West Berlin. Despitesome further Soviet prevarication the transit of Allied vehicles hadnot subsequently been interfered with, although the soviet authorities at checkpoints continued to assert their dissatisfaction with the Allied vehicles&apos; documentation.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.Cabinet Office,14 January, 1971.information leading to the apprehension of the kidnappers to the equivalent of  16,000. For their part, the Foreign and Common-wealth Office had taken steps to strengthen the staff of the Embassy,and had sent a security expert to Montevideo.In discussion it was pointed out that the Swiss government appeared to have prevailed on the Brazilian Government to release a number of political prisoners in order to secure the return of theirkidnapped Ambassador; public opinion in this country might wellpress for similar action by us vis-a-vis Uruguay. As against this it was argued that it would be wrong to urge on the Uruguayans acourse of action which they had consistently opposed and which, byshowing that blackmail paid, might lead to further acts of violence.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and of the points made in discussion.
