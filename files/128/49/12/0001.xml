secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thetwo Brazilian and United States officials who had been kidnappedand detained in Uruguay by the Tupamaros had now been released;the latter apparently because he had suffered a mild heart attack.This seemed to confirm the supposition that the British Ambassador,Mr. Jackson, was alive and in reasonable health. There had been some indications that his captors might consider releasing him inreturn for the payment of a sum of money; and these indicationswere now being investigated.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thesituation in East Pakistan was deteriorating. The local politicalleader,. Sheikh Mujib, was pressing for a degree of autonomy forthe East Wing; and he enjoyed widespread public support. PresidentYahya Khan of Pakistan was not prepared to concede autonomyand was trying to reimpose military rule in East Pakistan. Butpolitical sentiment was increasingly opposed to this course; and itwas not impossible that the East Wing would secede from the larger-3CM 12 (71)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Secretary of State for the Environment suggested that itmight be desirable to indicate during the debate that afternoon inthe House of Commons on the report of the Commission on thethird London airport that the Government intended to reach anearly decision on the reports proposals. The complex procedures of land acquisition would take time in any event; and unnecessarilyprotracted uncertainty would depress property values in all the areasunder discussion.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it should be made clear that the government wished to reach and to announce a conclusion at the earliest possible moment. But adequate time must be allowed to take into account the views expressed in debates in both Houses of Parliament; andthere should be no commitment to an announcement before the easter Recess.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State forthe Environment to be guided accordingly.

The Government of theUnited Arab Republic, however, seemed prepared to interpret this as a tactical device rather than a decision of policy designed tobring the dialogue to an end. There were accordingly grounds for believing that the present cease-fire, which was due to expire om7 March, might be extended. Meanwhile we were co-operating with;the other Permanent Members of the Security Council in the detailed;consideration of the international guarantees which would be appropriate to a settlement.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was notyet clear how our announcement that we were prepared to authorisethe sale of Wasp helicopters to South Africa would be received by -the Commonwealth Governments who had agreed, at the recent meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government at Singapore, tojfconstitute a study group on the security of the sea routes in the.-&apos;Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic.   The Commonwealth^Secretary-General, Mr. Arnold Smith, was now consulting them.flMeanwhile, we should continue to indicate that we remainedprepared to participate in a study group if it was the wish of otheiMembers of the Commonwealth that one should be constituted.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign andjCommonwealth Secretary.

The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.SECRETRoyce *4.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatcritical reactions in foreign countries to the Rolls-Royce failurewere increasingly disturbing. There were indications that serious damage to the prestige of British industry had been caused inCanada and the United States and that the Governments of thosecountries were concerned about the consequences for undertakings in their own jurisdictions. Coming at this time, these developmentswould further complicate what would in any case have been difficult negotiations with the United States Government on matters such asthose arising from our approach to Europe and our plans for theimprovement of European defence.The Secretary of State for Defence said that negotiations hadtaken place with the Lockheed Corporation during the previous two days about the basis on which a new contract might be arranged for the RB211 engine. Our negotiators had gained two clearimpressions: first, that Lockheed were in no position to undertakecommitments involving significantly increased liabilities for themselves; second, that they thought that our cost estimates for continuing the RB211 project were inflated. Nevertheless, it was important that a breakdown in the negotiations, if it provedinevitable, should be on the basis of a United Kingdom offer whichwas demonstrably reasonable. After discussion in the ministerial group on Rolls-Royce and with the approval of the Prime Minister,he had therefore put to Lockheed on the previous day a proposal which, in effect, invited the Corporation to back their own judgmentthat the costs of continuing the RB211 would be lower than webelieved. We had proposed that Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. andLockheed should establish a joint company to share the management and risk of the project, the detailed execution of which would besub-contracted to Rolls-Royce (1971); that the United KingdomGovernment should contribute  60 million, in addition to moneyalready spent, to development costs and that Lockheed should bearany excess development costs; that a new contract should be madewith Lockheed for the purchase of RB 211 engines on the basis of anaverage increase of  140,000 in the price per engine (a figure some* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET132969-3B* 2
 50,000 below our own estimate of average production costs); andthat any production cost excess should be borne equally byRolls-Royce and Lockheed. We had further proposed that all profitsor losses which might accrue over the lifetime of the RB 211 project should similarly be shared equally by Rolls-Royce and Lockheed;that Lockheed and the airlines should agree to waive all penaltiesarising under the original contract for late delivery; and that any new arrangements should be on the basis of a waiver of penalty for six months&apos; delay and only a modest penalty for three monthsthereafter. In addition, we would require cash assistance to bearranged with United States banks, e.g. by means of appropriateprogress payments; and there should be cross-warrantyarrangements, involving both Governments, under which the UnitedStates Government or United States banks would provide a warrantyto recompense the United Kingdom Government for the moneyinvested from the date of the new agreement if the Lockheedprogramme of TriStar aircraft were subsequently abandoned.The President of Lockheed, Mr. Haughton, had made it clearthat he was in no position to accept a settlement of this kind; andthat his Corporation lacked the resources or credit to undertaketheir share of the risks, even if the engine itself was delivered tothem at the original contract price. He claimed that the furthest hecould go would be to pay some  40,000 more per engine and to waive claims for six months&apos; delay. It had been made clear toMr. Haughton, however, that such an offer would provide no basis for further negotiations; and he had then agreed, though withoutholding out much hope of success, to submit our revised proposals to his bankers, the United States Government and the United Statesairlines later that week. Since the negotiations were approachingso closely to a breakdown and the gap between the two sides was so wide, it would be desirable that the Prime Minister should himself see Mr. Haughton before his return to the United Statesand should perhaps indicate to him that, subject to Lockheed&apos;acceptance of the remaining elements in the settlement which we had offered, we would regard the revised price of  140,000 for the engineitself as open to further negotiation. That, however, was the furthestwe should go at the present stage.The Attorney-General said that arrangements had now beenmade for the protection of Rolls-Royce patents against any claim fortheir sequestration in the United States and that he hoped toarrange for similar protection of the patents in other countries.But patent law differed from one country to another; and it mightnot be possible to complete the process for a few days. Meanwhile,no public statement on this subject should be made.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that, beyond intimating that our estimate
of  140,000 for the increase which we required in the price ofthe engine might be negotiable, we should show no willingness tomake further concessions to Lockheed at this stage. SinceLockheed&apos;s own financial position was precarious, it might be dangerous to reach any agreement with them which was not supported by cross-warranties at Governmental level; and,although our proposals had been conveyed to the United states administration, they had not yet been discussed with them. Thegulf between our requirements and the offer which Mr. Haughtonfelt that he could make was wide; but, since he had undertaken to submit our proposals to his bankers and the United States airlineslater in the week, it was unlikely that there would be any immediatebreakdown in the negotiations. Nevertheless, our proposals mightrapidly become public knowledge; and, in order that they might beseen to be fair and reasonable, it would be desirable that theyshould be made known in this country at the appropriate moment.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Defence to be guided accordingly.The Lord President said that notice had been given of a motion in the name of Mr. William Rodgers, m p, with substantial support from Opposition Members, criticising the Governments failure tomake a statement on the circumstances of the agreement betweenRolls-Royce and certain financial institutions in the previousautumn, together with a general lack of information on thebankruptcy of Rolls-Royce and the position of creditors, and calling for an early debate and the publication of a White Paper. An earlydebate was clearly undesirable while negotiations were still proceeding. But, since it seemed inevitable that at some point theGovernment would be compelled to publish a White Paper dealingwith at least the economic factors bearing on their actions withrespect to Rolls-Royce and the current negotiations, there might be advantage in indicating forthwith that a White Paper would bepublished at the appropriate juncture.In discussion it was agreed that there could be no question of publishing any White Paper until the current negotiations with the lockheed Corporation had been completed. It seemed likely,however, that a White Paper would thereafter be desirable for thepurpose of setting out the results of those negotiations and theeconomic factors which had influenced the Governments decisions.Whether the White Paper should go further and deal, in particular,with the allegations which had been made in the Press that theacceptance houses and the company&apos;s creditors had been misled
during the negotiations with the Government in the previousautumn was another question.  On the one hand, although it couldbe demonstrated that the suggestion that the Government hadmisled the financial institutions concerned was unfounded andirresponsible, the facts were complicated and differing constructionshad been placed on various Government statements.  It might notbe easy to refute these suggestions convincingly without referenceto documents  and conversations which had been essentiallyconfidential in character. The publication of such exchanges wouldbe liable to damage the basis of mutual confidence on which such discussions were conducted and to make them impossible in thefuture. On the other hand the Government could hardly avoid theneed to answer the allegations at some point.  It might be possibleto explain the situation by detailing the chronology of events, public statements and documents, which should speak for themselveswithout the reinforcement of confidential exchanges.   But thedifficulty of breaching confidence with those who had been partiesto the various discussions would arise whether the Government explained their actions in a White Paper or in a debate or by anyother means. A White Paper would at least afford the government an opportunity to set out the facts of the situation logically andcomprehensively, without the interruptions and distortions which were bound to occur if an explanation were simply given in debate. ;Nevertheless, before there was any commitment to publish a White ;;Paper it would be desirable that the Cabinet should have anopportunity to consider a draft text, indicating the scope and natureof the relevant discussions. The inquiry under the Companies Actwhich it was expected would be requested at an extraordinarygeneral meeting of the company would deal only with the eventsleading up to the appointment of a Receiver and would not debarthe Government from publishing a White Paper either about the General economic factors which had influenced the negotiations or jabout the transactions with the financial interests concerned, if that Ishould seem desirable.IThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the ICabinet agreed that it would probably be advisable at the jappropriate point to publish a White Paper dealing with the Ieconomic considerations affecting the Governments actions in Irelation to Rolls-Royce and that it would be right to indicate 1forthwith that such a White Paper would be published but to make Jit clear that its content and timing would depend on the course of Ithe important negotiations which were currently in train. The Jcontent of the White Paper, and particularly the question whether Iit could deal with the allegations that the financial institutions Iconcerned had been misled, required further consideration, 1particularly in relation to the disclosure of confidential transactions. $Meanwhile, especial care should be taken, in answering questions, J
secret. The Secretary of State for Employment said that afterprotracted discussions on the previous day, the Post Office Boardand the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW) had reached agreement on the establishment of a body which he had described as a&quot; Committee of Settlement&quot; to inquire into the dispute about the pay of postal workers. The terms of reference provided for an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute, which would includethe financial situation of the Post Office, its utilisation of manpower and the present relationship between the Post Office and the UPW;and they required the committee to make recommendations for asettlement. The committee would consist of a nominee of each side and a mutually agreed chairman. The recommendations of thecommittee (or of the chairman if the committee could not agree)would be binding on both sides. The agreement was conditional onratification by the UPW membership, by a ballot of branches, whichshould be completed within a few days, of the unanimousrecommendation of their Executive in favour of a return to work.By agreeing to these conditions the UPW had yielded much ground,since the procedure envisaged would be very similar to arbitration,which, they had hitherto rejected.Although there were risks in a settlement by arbitration, thereturn to work would have been achieved without an increased offer,the Government would be able to influence the choice of thecommittee&apos;s chairman, and the Department of Employment wouldprovide its Secretariat. Moreover, it had proved possible, with the help of the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, to draw theterms of reference of the committee sufficiently tightly to prevent them from trespassing on the field of Post Office management, anot to indicate that the White Paper would necessarily deal withthe issues raised by Mr. Rodgers&apos; Motion; answers to such questions should, indeed, contain no reference to the White Paper.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President tobe guided accordingly.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to arrange forfurther consideration to be given, in the course of drafting the White Paper, to the desirability of discussing the allegations that financial institutions had been misledduring the Governments negotiations with Rolls-Roycein the previous autumn.
matter in which in any case other unions were concerned and theBoard themselves were bound by certain statutory obligations.Since the committee would be set up not by the Government butby the parties to the dispute, the terms of reference did not refer tothe national interest. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the referenceto the financial situation of the Post Office should be a safeguard against an excessively high settlement.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Government had throughout adopted the attitude that, where an industry&apos;s procedures provided for disputes to be resolved by arbitration, as in this instance, it was through arbitration and not by industrial action that the union should pursue its claims. Therewere, however, disadvantages about arbitration, particularly in theabsence of a specific requirement to have regard to the national interest, which would need to be taken into account in other cases.In the present case the procedure now proposed would need to be presented to public opinion with care in order to bring out clearly that the strike had been unrewarding for the UPW, who had been compelled to accept a means of settlement which they could haveinvoked from the outset. To establish this point could be helpful in regard to other disputes.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Non-industrial civil ServiceCentralPay ClaimPreviousReference:CM (71) 8thConclusions,Minute 6SECRET*6. The Lord Privy Seal said that, at the instance of the staff side of the Civil Service National Whitley Council, the claim for a central pay increase for 140,000 non-industrial civil servants hadbeen referred to arbitration. The hearing would take place on15 March and the tribunals award was likely to be published on17 March, before the Post Office &quot; Committee of Settlement&quot; had decided on their recommendations. If, as was possible, the CivilService award exceeded 10 per cent, it might influence the committeeto make an undesirably high award to postal staffs. The national staff Side, who would earlier have been willing to negotiate asettlement on the basis of an increase in the region of 9 - 7 per cent,were meeting that morning in order to decide the precise terms oftheir submission to the tribunal. It now seemed too late for themto withdraw the reference to arbitration; but it might nevertheless be worthwhile approaching their Secretary-General in strict confidence in order to ascertain whether there was still any prospectof achieving a negotiated settlement on the basis of an increase of9 - 7 per cent.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (CP (71) 25) about negotiations withthe United States regarding proposed changes in our import regimefor cereals.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, said that attheir meeting on 16 February that the Cabinet had invited him, inconsultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to make a further effort to secure agreement with the United States Administrationon our proposals to change our import levy arrangements for cereals.There had so far been no positive response to our proposals; but,since he had circulated his memorandum, the United StatesGovernment had intimated that there was some hope of reaching agreement if we gave them a little more time in which to considerthe issues involved. It would be necessary to stipulate that theyshould not adopt an obstructive attitude if, in default of eventualThe Secretary of State for Employment said that, in addition tothe risk of prejudicing the Post Office award, there was a danger that the negotiations with British Rail, and perhaps othernegotiations, such as those with the teachers, would be adversely affected by an arbitration award to the Civil Service which exceeded10 per cent. He would therefore favour negotiating a settlementbelow 10 per cent, if that were still possible.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should explore with theSecretary-General of the National Staff Side, in strict confidence and on the understanding that he might consult one other memberof the Staff Side on a similar basis if he wished, whether the staff side might be willing to withdraw from arbitration and to negotiate a settlement on the basis of an increase of 9-7 per cent. If so, heshould report to the Ministerial Steering Committee on pay negotiations, who should consider urgently whether, having regardto the implications of volunteering an increase of nearly 10 per cent at the present time, it would on balance be preferable to reopennegotiations by offering, as suggested, 9 - 7 per cent on a &quot; withoutprejudice &quot; basis or to allow the matter to be settled by arbitration.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord Privy Seal tobe guided accordingly.
agreement with them, we were compelled to apply to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to unbind our cerealstariffs.   But, provided that this stipulation was made, it would be reasonable to allow them a further opportunity, until the end of thefollowing week, to weigh our arguments.   If, however, agreement&apos;had not been secured by then, the Cabinet should decide to applyimmediately to GATT. to unbind our tariffs.   In the meanwhile itwas probably unnecessary for the Prime Minister to send a message jto the President of the United States.  But the Cabinefs agreement 1to defer a decision on making an application to GATT should be jconveyed to the United States authorities through the United States \Embassy in London; and we should also give notice forthwith to Iterminate our agreements with our minor suppliers, under which weapplied country levies to cereals from the countries concerned.These agreements required four months&apos; notice of termination.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that the jCabinet agreed that, in view of the latest developments, we should not yet apply to GATT to unbind our cereals tariffs. We should,]however, immediately give notice to terminate our agreements with jour minor cereals suppliers. We should allow a further interval,!until mid-March, in which to seek to reach agreement with the united States interests. But, if no agreement had been concluded!by then, it would be necessary for the Cabinet to decide whether to Istart the procedures to unbind our tariffs. The Chancellor of the jDuchy of Lancaster should be guided accordingly in his forthcoming)visit to Washington, during which he might find it helpful to bejjsupported by a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture,!Fisheries and Food. IThe Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their 1discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, inlconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy oilLancaster  , , I(i) to pursue negotiations with the United States 1authorities as indicated in the Prime Ministers 1summing up of their discussion;(ii) to arrange for our minor overseas suppliers to bejgiven notice of termination of our bilaterallagreements with them on cereals.
