ParliamentaryAffairsCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that the Opposition had agreed withhis proposal that the debate on the forthcoming White Paper onour accession to the European Economic Communities (e.c.) shouldbe arranged for 21 to 26 July and that the Lords&apos; amendments tothe Industrial Relations Bill should be considered from 27 to 29 July.On that basis it should be possible for the House of Commons torise for the Recess on 30 July.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Lord President of the Councils statement.The Cabinet considered the business remaining to be transactedin the House of Lords before the Recess.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe House of Lords seemed likely to have to sit during the first week of August. The most appropriate time for the Lords&apos; debate on the eec, which was likely to have a favourable public impact, wouldbe during consideration by the Commons of the Lords&apos; amendments to the Industrial Relations Bill. Every effort should continue to bemade to reduce to the minimum Government amendments to that bill. A Motion on Rhodesia by Lord Salisbury might provoke aninopportune debate during the next few weeks; and the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should consider how its discussionmight most conveniently be deferred.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Lord Privy Seal to be guided accordingly.confidential. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said thatthere had been a successful outcome of the British steel corporation^ resumed negotiations with the Iron and Steel TradesConfederation (is to), on the basis determined by the ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations and approved by theCabinet. The settlement provided for a fiat rate increase of  1-60a week for all is to members from 1 July, within the terms of theexisting three-year agreement, which would run its course untilJune, 1972, It would be desirable, however, to avoid presenting thesettlement as an increase over and above the existing wageagreement. The National Union of Blastfurnacemen might be reluctant to settle at this level but would now find it more difficultto resist.136611-5
nationalised industry WageIncreasesPay of theScientificCivilServicePrivate SectorWageIncreasesThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, together with other ministers, he had had a satisfactory discussion of wages policy withthe Chairmen of the nationalised industries. They understood theproblems facing the Government in relation to wages and prices and were anxious to co-operate in combating inflation. They had accepted the strategy of limiting wage increases in the public sectorfor the remainder of the year to 1\ to %\ per cent, although theydid not wish the Government to give any public indication that the nationalised industries would be operating under specific guidance in this respect. They foresaw difficulty in achieving settlements atlevels below the current rate of increase in the cost of living; andthey attached importance to the Government^ efforts to persuade the Industrial Civil Service (ICS) to settle at the level of the offernow authorised. Thereafter it might be helpful if the Governmentcould find some occasion to make a public statement, to which the nationalised industries in common with other employers could refer,about the limits which considerations of the national interest imposed on the settlement of wage claims.The Lord Privy Seal said that it seemed likely that, after hismeeting with the Institution of Professional Civil Servants (IPCS)earlier that day on the pay of scientific and related classes of theCivil Service, the IPCS would elect to go to arbitration. This wouldbe on the basis of an open offer of 2\ per cent on the overall wagebill.The Minister of Agriculture said that excessive wage settlements Iwere still being reached in the private sector, notably a 20 per cent Iincrease awarded by brewers in the North-West. He had met 1representatives of the brewers and had made clear to them the %Governmenfs attitude to pay awards which aggravated the 1inflationary pressure. IThe Cabinet Took note of these statements.OverseaAffairsMaltaPreviousReference:CM (71) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2- 1SECRET IH3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed thelCabinet that there were some signs that the new Prime Minister of IMalta, Mr. Mintoff, might be prepared to adopt a more moderate wapproach to the question of the future relationship between Malta 1and the United Kingdom than his initial utterances had implied, mThe United States Government had indicated that they might bellprepared to provide additional work in the dockyard by orders forjlship repairs, etc; and this should help to ease the situation further, a
PakistanPreviousReference:CM (71) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had discussed the position of the refugees from East Pakistan with theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Sadruddin.The High Commissioner had painted a gloomy picture of thesituation; and the only suggestion which he had been able to makewas that 50 United Nations representatives should be stationedbetween East Pakistan and West Bengal in order to help to create the atmosphere of renewed confidence which was essential if the refugees were to be encouraged to return to East Pakistan. This,however, would require the co-operation of the Indian Government;and their present attitude in relation to e.g. the management of therelief supplies which had been sent to the area made it doubtfulwhether they would be prepared to collaborate in giving effect to aproposal of this kind.The Prime Minister said that the recent visit of the ItalianPrime Minister and Foreign Minister to the United Kingdom hadbeen an unqualified success. Signor Colombo&apos;s public statements,particularly at a luncheon at the Mansion House on the previous day, had been helpful; and in private discussions he and SignorMoro had displayed a commendably robust attitude on the problemsof East-West relations, European security and the position in theMediterranean, despite their understandable anxiety aboutdevelopments in Malta. After a discussion with Members ofParliament about British accession to the European EconomicCommunities (e.c.) Signor Colombo had expressed some surpriseabout the extent to which they appeared to be ill-informed aboutthe e.c. and to apprehend only imperfectly its purposes and methodsof work. This confirmed that the Government would have to makea considerable effort to inform and educate public opinion aboutthe Communities if they were to mobilise adequate support for our accession.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (71) 75), to which was annexed a draft white Paper on proposed changes in the National Insurancescheme.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the Homeand Social Affairs Committee had approved the text of the draft white Paper for submission to the Cabinet. If the Cabinet agreed,he proposed that it should be published on 13 July. Its publication would promote a desirable increase in the number of newoccupational pensions schemes; and the insurance interests generallywere likely to welcome the proposals. They should prove equallyacceptable to the Confederation of British Industry; but an136611-:-5B* 2
junfavourable reaction must be expected from the Trades UnionCongress. The features of the scheme which might excite particularcomment were  as follows.    First,  as  regards  the  level  of jcontributions, average wage-earners would from September, 1971,be paying about the same by way of flat-rate and graduated jcontributions as they would eventually have to pay by way of jearnings-related contributions when the new scheme began.   The ilower-paid would be paying less in 1975 than they did now.  The jhigher-paid would in general have to pay more; and the upper limit Iof earnings on which contributions were payable would have to beraised from time to time.   The 1971 and 1973 pension upratingsprovided staging points for the increases; and these would be usedin order to bring people as near as possible to the contributionlevels of the new scheme before its introduction.   Second, asregards the self-employed, it had been found necessary to impose a 5 per cent surcharge on Schedule D earnings in addition to thefiat-rate contribution.   The surcharge would be unpopular; but itwas needed in order to ensure substantial parity of contributionwith employed persons.   Third, it was necessary to provide that members of contributory occupational pension schemes should notbe entitled to a refund of contributions as an alternative to adeferred pension in respect of a period of service of five years ormore after the appointed day.   This might be criticised as a restriction of choice; but it would be wrong to allow pension rightsearned after the legislation had come into force to continue to be sold away, with the risk that recourse to supplementary benefit would be increased as a result. Finally, as regards the reserve fund,he had hoped to divide the management of its investment among anumber of agencies; but the advice which he had received was?strongly against that course.   The protection against possiblemisuse of the fund would therefore rest on a statutory requirement!to conduct investment in the interests of the beneficiaries of the jreserve scheme, coupled with a limitation on the voting equity!which could be held in any one company.In discussion the following main points were made (a) While it might be imprudent to reject the advice that thejmanagement of the reserve fund could not be divided among fivlagencies, its management as one unit would be liable to give it ailundue dominance in the market. Moreover, there might appear!to be an inconsistency between a requirement to manage!investment in the interest of the beneficiaries, which implied an activlrole, and the limitation on equity holdings, which connoted a morjpassive one.(b) It was probable that the proposal not to allow refundscontributions in occupational pension schemes, together with thj
provision permitting the forfeiture of pension rights in such schemes(referred to in paragraph 20 of Appendix 2 to the draft white paper), would be strongly opposed by certain of the Government^supporters in the House of Commons. While the former must beaccepted as a necessary element in the scheme, the latter deservedreconsideration.(c) It might be possible fractionally to reduce the 5 per centsurcharge on Schedule D earnings for the self-employed if pressure for a reduction developed.(d) When the detailed structure of short-term benefits was examined, the savings in manpower which would be achieved bydeparting from a system involving both a flat-rate and an earnings-related element should be borne in mind.In further discussion it was suggested that the advantages of promoting a more rapid development of occupational pension schemes and of enabling the independent pension interests to plan on a foundation of reasonable certainty might be as well secured by publishing the White Paper in September as by publishing it in mid-July. It would be desirable to avoid public discussion in Julyof major issues of policy which were not of pressing currentsignificance and might distract attention from more immediateissues, such as our accession to the European EconomicCommunities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,although the proposals for the management of the reserve fundmight give rise to some criticism, the Cabinet agreed that they represented the most effective safeguards which could be devised.The draft White Paper was therefore approved, subject toreconsideration by the Secretary of State of the provisionpermitting forfeiture of pension rights in occupational schemes. Ifpressure developed for a reduction in the 5 per cent surcharge onSchedule D earnings for the self-employed, the Secretary of state should consider, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, whether the rate of surcharge could be marginallyreduced. The timing of the publication should be decided by theSecretary of State in consultation with the Lord President and in thelight of the points made in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the points made in the Prime Ministers summing up, approved the White Paper annexed to CP (71) 75and the preparation of the necessary legislation for introduction in the 1972-73 Session.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to decide the timing of publication of the White Paper inconsultation with the Lord President of the Council.
reconstruction of theNationalInsurance ;jScheme Short-termBenefitsAdvanceChangesin Earnings-RelatedSupplementCONFIDENTlf5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 74) by secretary of State for Social Services on advance changes in $Earnings-Related Supplement (ERS) to short-term benefits.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that entitleme:to ERS was based on earnings taxed through PAYE and that present earnings in a tax year governed the amount of ERS for trlensuing benefit year, which started in May.   The procedure fagassessing ERS involved either asking the claimant to produce tilannual certificate of pay and tax deducted or sending an inquifjform to his employer.   Under the proposed arrangements for Wmreconstruction   of   the   National   Insurance   scheme   earning!information would be obtained from his Departments centralrecords, which were held on a computer. This information had noflhitherto been accessible in a form in which it could be usedlextensively for ERS without excessive staff costs; but computer!capacity now available made it possible to use it for ERS purpose!from January, 1973, without waiting for the introduction of thejlreconstructed scheme in April, 1975. The use of the central records!for this purpose, however, would involve deferring the start of the!ERS benefit year from May to the following January in order tojenable each employees earnings for the tax year ending in thejprevious April to be fully recorded.   As a result the amount olERS would be based in many cases on an earlier tax year than ailpresent and would therefore tend to be smaller. The change wouldaalso entail the deferment from May, 1973, to January, 1974 of tihejiimplementation of the modification of ERS in the current National!Insurance Bill, with the result that higher earners would have to wait!eight months longer before becoming eligible for their extra ERS.;some opposition to the change was therefore to be expected. Orijithe other hand the new system would make possible a saving offl350 personnel from January, 1973, after a small initial increase ofistaff for the preparatory work required; and it would provide both!a more efficient service to the public and a relief for employers fronrldealing with enquiries.   The Home and Social Affairs Committee!had concluded that it would be right to make the change proposed;!but, in view of the opposition which it might engender, they had!invited him to refer it to the Cabinet.  The change would be madeffin regulations, which would have to be submitted to the National!Insurance Advisory Committee. He proposed to make this reference!at the end of September and to make his proposals publicly known!at the same time.1.  The Cabinet- jApproved the advance changes in Earnings-Related 1Supplement proposed in CP (71) 74, on the understanding!
that the Secretary of State for Social Services would submit them to the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee at the end of September and would make thempublicly known at the same time.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (71) 77) on non-industrial manpower in the Civil Service.: The Lord Privy Seal said that in April the Cabinet had endorsed the political importance of reducing the size of the Civil Service, towhich the Government were committed, and had agreed that therewas practical scope for such a reduction. There was now growingconcern among the Governments supporters that the commitmentshould be met. The number of non-industrial civil servants on1 June was 500,400 as against 496,000 in July, 1970; and theestimates foreshadowed a further rise to 510,000 by April, 1972, and530,000 by 1975. In order to reverse this tendency it was essentialto take both short-term and longer-term measures; and it was also desirable to improve the public presentation of staff numbers.Halting the present rise would win time for more radical measures;and the first requirement, therefore, was a reduction in the totalCivil Service non-industrial staff estimates for 1 April, 1972, by aminimum of 1+ per cent. It would be necessary, however, to makeexceptions for Departments which were hard-pressed by increases in work which had not been foreseen at the beginning of the yearand to compensate for these exceptions by seeking reductions greaterthan 1^ per cent from other Departments. He therefore proposed a once-for-all reduction of 2 per cent in the manpower estimates ofall Departments, other than the few in exceptional difficulties, on thebasis that Ministers who were able to accept a larger reduction should do so. He would then negotiate with Ministers individuallythe relaxations required to deal with exceptional cases. In order to forestall criticism from the Staff Side it would be necessary to makeit clear that existing staff numbers were being reduced not byarbitrary action but as a result of a contraction in Departmentalactivities.In the longer term it would be necessary to eliminate or toreduce Departmental functions on a more significant scale and to identify those which could properly be &quot; hived off &quot;. The review of functions initiated by the Prime Minister had so far yielded savings in staff numbers which were smaller than the increases required for new tasks; but proposals currently under consideration for &quot; hivingoff &quot; could result in significant reductions. It would be necessaryto decide before the end of the year whether these measures would permit a significant net reduction in numbers or whether a controlled
rise during the remainder of the present Parliament was inevitable. 1Whatever decision was taken about the level of future requirements jthe system of presentation of Civil Service manpower statistics must Ibe improved; and clearer definitions and criteria must be established, ijHe would make proposals for a new system of presentation later in 1the year.I, IIn discussion the following main points were made (a) Although discussions with certain Ministers had indicated \a general confidence that the target of restricting numbers to about j500,000 by April, 1972, could be achieved, it was not clear that the jbasis on which the estimates for individual Departments in the annex to CP (71) 77 had been calculated took sufficient account of 1the individual understandings which had been reached during those Idiscussions. On the other hand, if a global reduction of \\ percent was to be achieved by April, it would be necessary to base this Iupon a 2 per cent reduction in Departments&apos; estimates.I&apos;2(b) Arbitrary reductions would be liable to impair efficiency and Igood management. For example, the replacement of military by Icivilian staff and the implementation of the recommendations of 1the Fulton Committee on the Civil Service would be slowed down 1in the Ministry of Defence; and in other cases essential services 8might have to be discontinued. The reaction of the Staff Side to an 1arbitrary 2 per cent reduction would be bound to be adverse. The Iproposal took no account of the fact that some Departments had Ialready reduced their staffs and would therefore be more severely Jaffected than those which had not. Moreover, a reduction in all IDepartments at the present juncture would be likely in some cases Jto put at risk more substantial savings at a later stage.1(c) It was the function of Departmental Ministers to examine!whether staff savings could be achieved by the elimination offprocesses which, though desirable, might not be essential.(d) In some cases it was an object of policy to increase staff&apos;such as prison officers; it was not with increases of staff of this type 1that the public were concerned. Reductions ought therefore to be]sought primarily in headquarters staffs.(e) But, although some measure of discrimination of this kind;!might be justified in particular cases, there was no substitute for a 1percentage reduction of general application as a salutary corrective 1of the natural tendency of all staffs to increase over a period of time, p(/) Considerable political importance attached to the fulfilment 1of the Governmenfs pledge to reduce the size of the public service. 1
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was important that progress should be made with both short-term measures to reduce, and longer-term measures to restrain, the size of the non-industrial Civil Service. Improvement of the presentation of the manpower statistics was equally important. The Lord privy seal should now initiate further discussions with departmental ministers about the savings which could be achieved and should report back to the Cabinet before the Recess. For this purpose theCabinet agreed that a 2 per cent reduction should be regarded as a planning target, to be achieved in default of special circumstances.Ministers with responsibility for functions which might be &quot; hivedoff &quot; should take all possible steps to accelerate this action.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord Privy Seal toproceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,30 June, 1971.
