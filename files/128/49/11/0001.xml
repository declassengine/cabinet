The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theAfiairs House of Commons the following week.OverseaAffairsArms for south AfricaPreviousReference :CM (71) 10thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there actions of Commonwealth and foreign Governments to theannouncement that we were prepared to license the export of Wasphelicopters for use by frigates of the South African Navy had so far been much as had been expected. Criticism had in the mainconcentrated on the point that our decision had been taken before the study Group established by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Conference at Singapore had been constituted and started its work.As a result the Nigerian Government had declared that they intendedto withdraw from the Study Group. The Organisation of AfricanUnity was due to meet on 26 February; and that meeting might provide the occasion for further attacks on our policy. The situation was complicated by the probability that we should soon have to take some action to deal with the problem of Rhodesia. In these circum-stances any announcement in the near future that we were preparedto consider approving orders for arms in addition to those which wehad a legal obligation to supply would undoubtedly provoke furtherdiscord; and it would therefore be wise to defer the consideration offurther orders for some months.Arab/IsraelPreviousReference :CM (71) 10thConclusions,Minute 3The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it had nowbeen confirmed that the Government of the United Arab Republic(UAR) had responded favourably to the initiative of the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations,Dr. Jarring, on which he had reported to Cabinet on 16 February.In particular they had indicated that they were prepared to make a formal peace with Israel and to accept all the implications of this step. The Israeli Governments reply to Dr. Jarring, on the otherhand, appeared to be negative; and there were grounds for fearingthat they were trying to evade the provisions of Security council resolution 242 by trying to deal with the Government of the UARdirectly rather than through the Secretary-General&apos;s Representative.The United States Government had now agreed that the representa-tives of the four Powers in New York might discuss the forms whichinternational guarantees of a settlement might take; and this could be helpful. Meanwhile, there was little scope for independent action on132969-2
Indo-ChinaPreviousReference :CM (71) 10thConclusions,Minute 3Persian Gulfour part. We should, of course, keep in touch with the parties and take any opportunity which presented itself to urge them towards theconclusion of a settlement.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theoperations in Laos were proceeding slowly. The South VietnameseArmy had overrun a number of Communist supply depots and were now consolidating their positions. The weather was still impedingprogress.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Foreign andJOommonwealth Secretary said that at a meetingof the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on 24 February it hadbeen agreed that he should make an early statement in the House ofCommons on our policy in the Persian Gulf. He intended to informthe House of certain offers which Sir William Luce had been authorised to make to the Gulf Rulers on the basis of an under-standing that the Rulers would co-operate in forming a Union of arab Emirates. These offers comprised a treaty of friendship,containing an undertaking to consult with the Union Governmentin time of need; and the transfer of the Trucial Oman Scouts to formthe nucleus of a Union Army. For the latter purpose we should beprepared to make available British personnel on loan; to assist inthe supply of equipment at the expense of the Union Government;to supply, if the Union so wished, teams to assist with the training of security forces on a continuing basis; and to arrange for regulartraining exercises in the area involving British Air Force units,together with regular visits to the area by ships of the Royal Navy.In discussion there was general agreement that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should take an early opportunity to makethe proposed Parliamentary statement. It was suggested, however,that certain aspects of the Governments policy would be unwelcome to some of their supporters and that it would therefore be helpful ifa clear indication were given that the present statement was, in effect,only a progress report, that replies to our offers were still awaitedand that a senior Minister would, if necessary, visit the area at an appropriate time in order to persuade the Rulers that it would bein their interests no less than in ours that they should proceed withthe formation of a Union. The undertaking to consult theGovernment of the Union in time of need could be argued to carry the implication that in certain circumstances we might have to sendmilitary forces to the area. But this possibility was perhaps relatively
secret. The Secretary of State for Employment said that during thetwo preceding days he had held a number of further meetings with each of the parties to the dispute about the pay of postal workers;but neither party had changed its position. The Post Office Boardremained firm in their contention that they should not offer a pay increase of more than 8 per cent except in return for acceptance bythe Union of Post Office Workers (UPW) of new measures to offset the additional cost through productivity improvements. The unioncontinued to insist on an improved offer as a precondition of consideration of any new productivity arrangement; and an under-taking by the Board that they would be ready to discuss a shorteningof pay scales, to be effective in the following year, had not movedthe union from this stipulation. There were some grounds, however,for believing that the union&apos;s General Secretary, Mr. Jackson, might feel able to modify his position after the rally of UPW members that day and that, if the Board were then to offer a 9 per cent increasewithout making it dependent on the union&apos;s acceptance of the Board&apos;present formula on new productivity arrangements, Mr. Jackson mightbe able to secure a majority in his Executive for recommending the-2B* 2remote; and we should not be assuming an unconditional commitment in this respect. Nothing should be done, for example by indicating that we should be prepared to postpone the withdrawal of ourremaining forces, to reduce the pressure on the Rulers to form a union without further delay. But, if no Union could be formed,we Ought still to be able to secure a satisfactory position from which to protect our interests by making bilateral arrangements with thelarger Shiekhdoms, notably Abu Dhabi and Dubai. By offeringtraining facilities and other support to the local forces we were making it clear that we did not intend to abandon our friends.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, in preparing the final version of his statement to the House of Commons, should take account ofthe points which had been made.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
Teachers&apos; PayPreviousReference :CM (71) 8thConclusions,Minute 6offer to a ballot of the membership as a basis for settlement. TheUPW militants, however, were fortified by the promise of further financial assistance from other unions; and they were likely to be ableto continue to frustrate any action of this kind so long as the Boardpersisted in making their willingness to increase their offer to 9 percent subject to the union&apos;s acceptance of the productivity undertaking in the terms in which the Board had tabled it. This document had notbeen wisely framed; and it was unlikely to achieve the results forwhich the Board hoped.If a 9 per cent settlement could be achieved, even withoutconditions about productivity improvements, it would be consistent with the Governmenfs general policies and it would also be helpful inrelation to other current and impending pay negotiations in both thepublic and the private sector. In particular, although the FordCompany had so far refused to increase their present pay offer of8 per cent, it would be unrealistic to suppose that they could avoiddoing so for long. They remained anxious, however, to secure asettlement at less than 10 per cent; and their chances of successwould be greatly improved by an early 9 per cent settlement for postalworkers. The same considerations were relevant in relation to the imminent pay negotiations in the transport, gas and water industries,whereas failure to resolve the deadlock in the postal dispute mightentail the risk of simultaneous strikes in these industries as well. Anincrease limited to 8 per cent would do no more than offset theincrease in the cost of living; but it would elevate many workers toan income level where, through the operation of the qualifications for,e.g. housing rebates and tax liability, they were relatively worse off.There was accordingly a growing disincentive to acceptance of settle-ments which were limited to 8 per cent. For these reasons it mightbe desirable at the appropriate time to seek further private discussionwith the General Secretary of the UPW and the acting Chairman ofthe Post Office Board in order to explore the possibility of achieving a settlement of the dispute on the basis of an increase of 9 per cent.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that heendorsed these views. The Post Office Board were confident that itshould be possible to achieve a settlement at less than 10 per cent.While they would also wish to secure a commitment by the UPW toimprove productivity arrangements, they were unlikely to insist onacceptance of their present formula for this purpose.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that negotiations in the Burnham Committee on pay of teachers had broken down on the basis of an open offer by the management sideot an 8-8 per cent increase linked to pay restructuring. The largest
CM 11 (71)union, the National Union of Teachers (NUT), were opposed to this offer; but some of the other unions were more favourably disposed towards it. If the dispute were taken to arbitration, these unionsmight be at a disadvantage in relation to the NUT: and she therefore proposed to invite the Secretary of State for Employment and herother colleagues primarily concerned to consider whether it mightbe desirable to appoint a court of inquiry.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Pay Negotiations had agreed that the pay of the police, who werestatutorily forbidden to take industrial action, must be treated as aspecial case which warranted exceptional treatment. The Committeehad therefore accepted that the earlier offer of 10 per cent should nowbe supplemented by proposals for revised pay scales. Theseproposals, which would increase the total value of the two-stage offer to 16 per cent, would be tabled at a meeting of the Police council that day. Public opinion should recognise that the police force, whowere seriously undermanned, required special consideration. But hewould concert the public presentation of the offer with the Secretaryof State for Employment with particular care.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Employment should,when he judged it propitious, further explore the possibilities of reaching a settlement of the Post Office dispute on the basis which hehad outlined. Any settlement, however, should not appear to be theresult of conciliation by the Department of Employment; no pressureshould be put on the Board to increase their offer beyond the point which they themselves judged right; and it would be preferable thatany new offer should, at least in the first instance, be put forward ona &quot; without prejudice &quot; basis in order that it might subsequently be withdrawn if the union&apos;s reaction made this necessary or expedient.Moreover, if the Board made a new offer of 9 per cent withoutconditions about productivity, it would nevertheless be desirable thatthey should obtain a separate commitment from the union to negotiateimproved productivity arrangements. The suggestion that it mightbe appropriate to appoint a court of inquiry in relation to the teachers&apos;pay dispute should be considered by the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations. The Ministerial Committee on emergencies should arrange for the contingency plans fot dealing with industrial action in the gas, water and transport industries to bere-examined against the possibility of simultaneous action in these industries.
The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Employment to be guided accordingly.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science tosubmit proposals in relation to the teachers&apos; pay dispute to the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotia-tions.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to review the plans for dealingwith the possibility of simultaneous industrial action in the gas, water and transport industries.SECRETAnnual    iReviewof theAgriculturalIndustry,19714. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President of theCouncil (CP (71) 23) about the 1971 annual review of the agricultural industry.The Lord President of the Council said that it was necessary todecide the agricultural guaranteed prices in the light of the 1971 reviewof the industry. In considering the size of the total award torecommend the Ministerial Committee on Agricultural Policy (AG)had sought to take account of the need to reinforce the industry&apos;confidence, to encourage agricultural expansion and to keep theindustry&apos;s goodwill in order to facilitate the introduction of theproposed new support arrangements. On the other hand they hadkept in mind the need to restrain public expenditure, to protect theconsumer and to avoid treating the agricultural industry undulyfavourably in comparison with other sectors of the economy. In thecircumstances they had recommended that agreement with the farmers&apos; unions should be sought on the basis of a total award of 135 million, including the  54 million increase in the guarantees which had been made in October 1970. They had been prepared to contemplate an award of  138 million if the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food felt that this was necessary in order to secure agreement with the farmers; but they had asked the Minister to consult them before offering more than  135 million. The Committeehad left to the Agricultural Ministers, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, the detailed allocation of the total award. Themain effect of the proposed award on consumers would be an increasein the retail price of milk from 5p to 5^p per pint from 1 July; butthis increase was unavoidable in any event.
CM 11 (71)The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that theagricultural industry&apos;s total costs had increased by  212 million sincethe last annual review and by  140 million in respect of productioncovered by the guarantees. The industry&apos;s spendable income had fallen from  505 million to  454 million. Productivity had risen by not less than 6 per cent. The industry was in a depressed state; and encouragement was needed to secure expansion. The cost to theExchequer of the proposed award would depend on the course of market prices. In 1970-71 the Exchequer had saved  68 million ondeficiency payments compared with the published Estimates. He wasnot sure that agreement would be possible with the farmers&apos; unions onthe basis proposed by AG; but such an award should be readilydefensible to public opinion.In discussion, the total award proposed by AG was generally approved. While it was important to secure the industry&apos;s goodwill and to demonstrate the Governments intention to secure expansion,the award should not exceed  138 million. The proposed awardwould cover virtually all the industry&apos;s increased costs on guaranteedproduction and would require farmers to make a very small contribu-tion from their increased productivity.In further discussion it was noted that, while the increase in the retail price of milk was necessary to prevent the milk fund remaining in deficit into 1972, such increases handicapped the Governmentsefforts to bring wage inflation under control.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food should seek to reach agreement with the farmers&apos; unions on the basisof a total award of  135 million. If necessary, after consulting AG,he might offer a total award of  138 million. The agricultural ministers, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, shouldsettle the detailed allocation of the total award. The Cabinet would need to take an early opportunity to consider in more detail theproblem of price increases.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Subject to the points made in the Prime Ministers summing up, invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food to seek to reach agreement with the farmers&apos; unions on thebasis of a total award of  135 million and in any event not,       to settle for more than  138 million.
AircraftIndustryThe RB 211PreviousReference :CM (71) 10thConclusions,Minute 25. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for defence to which was attached an appraisal by the Ministerial group on Rolls-Royce of the cost of continuing, as compared with the costof cancelling, the RB 211 engine (CP (71) 24).The Secretary of State for Defence said that the Working Partyunder the chairmanship of Sir William Cook had been asked to answer three questions. Could the RB 211 engine be made to worklsatisfactorily; if so, by what date; and what increase was required!in the price originally negotiated between Rolls-Royce and the!Lockheed Corporation in order to avoid losses on its production.;!Sir William Cook&apos;s Working Party were confident that the remaining Iproblems of developing the engine could be overcome, that an engine Iwith 37,000 lb. thrust could be provided for introduction into airline 1service six months after the date provided in the original contract fand that further improvements could thereafter be made which would Ipermit the introduction by early 1973 of engines with the required &apos;42,000 lb. thrust.   The Ministry of Aviation Supply, however, considered that it would be safer to assume that the engine of ]37,000 lb. thrust for initial airline service could not be produced for \some nine to twelve months after the date required in the originalcontract.   The Cook Working Party considered that each engine\would need to be sold at  150,000 above the price in the originalRolls-Royce/Lockheed contract in order to cover production costs.The Ministry of Aviation Supply, however, thought that the price increase required to cover production costs would be between 180,000 and  190,000. The estimate of the remaining launching costwas about  120 million, including a contingency provision, but excluding the purchase price of the assets required to make the engine.If the engine went into production, the most optimistic estimate, basedon an assumed 20-year life, suggested that we should make a loss ofsome  60 million; but a more pessimistic forecast by the Ministry of aviation Supply implied that the loss might amount to nearly 200 million.These estimates of the expenditure involved in continuingproduction of the RB 211 had to be weighed against the costs involvedin cancelling the project. Cancellation would result in an increasein unemployment, together with a corresponding loss of output whileresources were transferred to alternative uses; a potential loss ofother exports, in addition to those of the RB 211, as a result of the adverse effect on Britain&apos;s trading reputation abroad; and a waste of investment to date in the technology of the project, with the result thatRolls-Royce would forfeit, perhaps permanently, their position as a leading manufacturer of large civil aero engines.
The Ministerial Group on Rolls-Royce, under his chairmanship,had concluded that in these circumstances negotiations with the lockheed Corporation should be based on the position outlined inparagraph 5 of the memorandum appended to CP (71) 24. But theterms there suggested were very exacting; and there was virtually no chance of securing an agreement with Lockheeds on this basis, even ifthey could command adequate financial resources to meet our require-ments, which was improbable. It was important that, when mr. Daniel Haughton, the Chairman of Lockheed, returned to london on 2 March, he should not find our position so demanding andinflexible that he decided that it was not worth continuing negotia-tions. It would be desirable, therefore, that HM Ambassador in washington should be instructed to inform the United states administration of the terms which we intended to propose toMr. Haughton in order that the United States interests could consider to what extent they might be able to help Lockheed. Moreover, inorder to allow the negotiations to proceed it would be necessary to renew the indemnity to the Receiver for the work being done on the rb 211, which would otherwise expire on 4 March. The extensionshould be for a further month, although it might initially be announced as for two weeks. It was estimated that the cost of the indemnity to 4 March would be about  5 million and that the costof extending it for a further month might be  6 million.The Board of the new company, Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited, hadnot yet been consulted about the basis of the negotiations nowproposed; and they would no doubt have views. But in the mean-while he asked for agreement that the discussions with Lockheed on  March, to which the Government were already committed, should start on the basis of the terms set out in paragraph 5 of thememorandum attached to CP (71) 24.The Attorney-General said that he was advised that under new york State law it would be possible for creditors of Rolls-Royce to institute bankruptcy proceedings and that for this purpose atrusteecould be appointed, who would become the beneficial owner of the assets of Rolls-Royce Limited, including some thousand patentsregistered there. If so, successor companies to Rolls-Royce Limitedwould be prevented from exporting cars or aero engines to the UnitedStates and the patents could be sold to, e.g. the General ElectricCorporation and General Motors. He had therefore arranged fora Treasury Counsel and the Treasury Solicitor to visit the UnitedStates in order to investigate this potentially menacing situation andto consider possible methods of dealing with it. His advisers wouldbe returning from the United States on Saturday, 27 February.
In discussion it was suggested that the cancellation of the RB 2111project might allow the development and production of other Rolls-iRoyce aero engines, including collaborative projects with other!European countries, to go forward more rapidly. On the other hand,!in view of the greatly improved management which the Board of 1Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited would provide, there should be no reason!to doubt that the RB 211 engine could be produced without adversely!affecting development and production of other engines. It was further I pointed out that very considerable loans for RB 211 engines had been!underwritten by the Export Credits Guarantee Department.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the!Government should adopt a hard-headed approach to the forth-coming negotiations with the Lockheed Corporation. The Cabinet Iagreed that the discussions between the Government and the 1Corporation on 2 March should be based on the proposals outlined in I paragraph 5 of the memorandum attached to CP (71) 24. HM-IAmbassador in Washington should be instructed to inform the United!States Administration of our negotiating position in order that they I might be able to consider what help, if any, United States interests!were prepared to offer. The indemnity to the Receiver for continuing Jwork on the RB 211 should be extended for a further four weeks after I4 March.It would be important to maintain strict security while negotia- jtions were in progress and to provide no grounds for uninformed 1speculation in the Press about the Governments negotiating position. 1The necessary action for this purpose should be taken forthwith.The Cabinet-.   1(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing ;1up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State foT Defence to arrange for jdiscussions   with   representatives   of   the   LockheedCorporation on the lines indicated in paragraph 5 of the memorandum attached to CP (71) 24.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, in iconsultation with the Secretary of State for Defence, to \arrange for instructions to be sent to HM Ambassador in fWashington to inform the United States Administration of our negotiating position.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to arrange for an iextension for four weeks from 4 March of the presentindemnity to the Receiver for work on the RB 211.
