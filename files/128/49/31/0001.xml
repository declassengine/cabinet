&quot;SECRETSubjectUpper Clyde Shipbuilders
lb*The Prime Minister recalled that on 10 June the Board of UpperClyde Shipbuilders (UCS) had agreed not to apply for theappointment of a provisional liquidator before 15 June in returnfor assurances that finance would be provided by the Governmentto cover a further week&apos;s staff wages and that they would beindemnified in respect of any liabilities which might be personallyincurred by the directors on account of the intervening days&apos; delay.But after the company&apos;s serious financial situation had becomepublic knowledge during the weekend the Board had concluded that they could not defer action beyond 14 June and that, in theabsence of a promise that morning of an injection of further capitalby the Government, they must petition the Court at 12.30 p.m. forthe appointment of a liquidator. The Lord Advocate considered it possible that the application could properly be deferred until3.30 p.m. in order that the House of Commons might, at the sametime, be informed of the matter; and he was in touch with thecompany&apos;s solicitors to that end.At a meeting with the Secretary of State for Trade and industry on the previous day the Chairman of UCS had acknowledged thatthe company had been unable to devise any feasible alternative plan. In particular, they had suggested to the Scottish TradesUnion Congress (STUC) that the workpeople should accept a20 per cent reduction in wages, the proceeds being held in trustuntil the company&apos;s finances were restored. But, although the STUChad been prepared to endorse this proposal, the latter had been rejected by the unions concerned. In these circumstances the board had reached the conclusion that they would be unable to continuetrading unless they were provided by the Government with 5- 6 million additional capital, either as a grant or in the formof equity participation. The Cabinet had therefore to decide whether to comply with this request or to acquiesce in an application by the company for the appointment of a provisional liquidator.The position had been considered earlier that day by the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (ES). The Committeehad recognised that the collapse of UCS would aggravateunemployment on Clydeside, which was already serious. On theother hand UCS had now become the symbol of an ailing enterprise,bedevilled by bad labour relations and poor management, in whosefuture prospects there could be little confidence. Despite the managements claims that a striking increase in productivity hadalready been secured and that the outlook for the company was nowbrighter, there was no clear or firm assurance that they would infact achieve profitability in the foreseeable future.   An additional
 5- 6 million capital contributed by the Exchequer now was i accordingly unlikely to prove the end of the Governmentalinvolvement in the firm; and it would be difficult to justify alsubvention of this kind in terms of their general industrial policies, jThe failure of UCS might admittedly cause some damage to -confidence on the Lower Clyde; but the Lower Clyde shipbuilders!had indicated that further Government assistance to UCS, whosefaulty wage policies and bad labour relations had already had very&apos;adverse effects on the Lower Clyde, would entail even more Jdamaging consequences for them. If the Government decided toiallow UCS to go into liquidation, however, it would be essential Ito take urgent action to mitigate the effects on employment and1confidence, to try to secure the completion of ships now under!construction and to keep as much as possible of the group&apos;s facilities!in working order in the hope that they might be taken over by other Ifirms. Apart from the shipbuilders on the Lower Clyde, no]potential purchasers of UCS assets had yet been identified. The!Lower Clyde shipbuilders, however, were at present in no position!to finance the acquisition of additional assets; and it would in any!case be advisable to consider carefully whether the addition of UCS Iyards to the Lower Clyde group might merely recreate the conditions!in which the former group had been unable to survive.For these reasons ES had concluded that the Government would Inot be justified in contributing more capital to UCS and that they Ishould acquiesce in the appointment of a provisional liquidator,!whom they should then be prepared to finance for the period offsome six to eight weeks which might be available before thelliquidation of the company was formally confirmed, in the hope Ithat, without prejudicing the position of the creditors, he might belable to keep the yards at work and that there would be time tolnegotiate with shipowners for the completion of ships now under!construction and to make a determined attempt to find purchasers!for those elements of the group which had viable prospects. The!Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would seek the!co-operation of the provisional liquidator to realise these aims and!proposed to appoint a small group of expert advisers to assist himlin organising the reconstruction of that part of the UCS group which 1it was hoped to save.In discussion there was general agreement with the conclusionireached by ES. The following main points were made:(a) The management of UCS were actively creating the!impression that the company could now look forward to anlincreasing improvement in its affairs. The Government should!ensure that this version of the current situation, which had anil
appearance of credibility, was seen in the perspective of thecompany&apos;s previous over-optimistic expectations, which had never been fulfilled. They must also emphasise that the Board had been quite unable to say by what date they might realise their expectationsof future viability. Moreover, they had acknowledged that a merebridging loan would not suffice to resolve their present difficulties;and that the  5- 6 million which they needed to save them fromcollapse must be in the form of permanent capital. The Governmentcould therefore have no confidence that, if they acceded to this request, they would be putting the group on to a permanentlyviable basis.(b) In dealing with the probable impact of the firm&apos;s collapseon employment in the Clydeside area, the Government should be concerned to correct some of the more exaggerated estimates whichwere gaining currency. In particular, the Secretary of State for trade and Industry should make it clear that the company had undertaken at his request not to close their yards before theprovisional liquidator had been appointed.(c) The wording of the necessary Parliamentary statement would need to be carefully considered by the Law Officers in orderto ensure that, in indicating their willingness to finance theprovisional liquidator for a limited period, the Government didnot undertake an indefinite commitment.(d) There might be some advantage in allowing it to be known that the trade unions concerned had rejected a proposal that theyshould assist the company by accepting a voluntary and conditionalreduction in wages.(e) The international aspects of the course proposed would need further consideration, particularly as regards the four cargo ships under construction in the UCS yards for the israeli government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should proceed as recommendedby ES. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should notify the Board of UCS accordingly. The Lord Advocate had nowconfirmed with the company&apos;s solicitors that their application forthe appointment of a provisional liquidator would be deferred until3.30 p.m.; and the Secretary of State should therefore make an appropriate statement in the House of Commons that afternoon,the content of which should be considered urgently by the Ministersmainly concerned under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary.If, as might be expected, the Opposition secured the Speakers
agreement to an emergency debate under Standing Order 9, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry should open and the&apos;Secretary of State for Scotland should wind up for the GovernmentThe Cabinet-Took  note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,14 June, 1971.
