The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;suggestion at their meeting on 13 May, he had considered, inconsultation with the Lord President, how the remaining stages ofthe Industrial Relations Bill might be so conducted as to ensure thatthe Bill would be enacted as expeditiously as possible. discussions with the Opposition in the House of Lords had led to an understanding that they would use their best endeavours to facilitate the progress of the Bill, with a view to returning it to the House ofCommons by 19 July. But they could not, of course, give any firm commitment to adhere to this timetable, which would have to be reviewed by the two Front Benches from week to week. Such a programme left little time for the House of Commons to considerthe Lords&apos; amendments; but it would not be realistic to hope forany more favourable arrangement. In particular, an attempt toimpose a guillotine on the remaining stages of the Bill in the Houseof Lords would lead to the withdrawal by the Opposition of allco-operation; and the remainder of the Governmenfs legislative programme would then be imperilled.: The Lord President said that it would be necessary to allow a generous timetable in the Commons for the consideration of the lords&apos; amendments; and time would also have to be allowed to debate the timetable Motion itself. To defer the consideration ofthe Lords&apos; amendments so close to the Recess left no room for manoeuvre, particularly when the possible need for a substantialdebate on our proposal to accede to the European EconomicCommunities was taken into account; and it might therefore benecessary for the House of Commons to sit during the first week in August.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that itwas generally agreed that there was no practical alternative to accepting the arrangement with the Opposition described by theLord Privy Seal, unsatisfactory as it was. But, in the interests of expediting the passage of the Bill, the Secretary of State for employment, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and theLord Privy Seal, should urgently review the Government amendmentswith a view to withdrawing any which were not essential and avoidingnew amendments wherever possible. In addition, the conduct of theOpposition made it necessary to examine what procedural measures could be devised for the future in order to prevent the Upper House132993-3a 2
from frustrating the will of the House of Commons by dilatorytactics, lest the Governments programme for the remainder of the parliament should be put at risk.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor and the lord privy Seal, to reconsider the amendments to the industrial relations Bill tabled by the Government in the Houseof Lords.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for an urgent inquiry into the possibility of instituting more systematic rules ofprocedure in the House of Lords.SECRETOverseaAffairsUnited ArabRepublic2. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the drastic changes which President Sadat had made in the Governmentof the United Arab Republic (UAR) had probably been designed togive him more freedom to pursue the policies which he favoured, not least in relation to the current efforts of the Government of theUnited States to promote an interim settlement between the UARand Israel. President SadatS success in the longer term, however,would depend on his ability to retain the support of the army andthe general public; and the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary was therefore considering whether it would be opportune to warn the Government of Israel discreetly that, in their consideration ofthe proposed interim settlement, they should have it in mind that itwas in their own interests that President Sadat should survive.United states forces inEuropeThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster informed the Cabinetthat Senator Mansfield had recently reintfoduced in the UnitedStates Senate the Resolution, which had not been adopted during theprevious Session, calling for a 50 per cent reduction in the UnitedStates forces in Europe. For several reasons circumstances might be smore favourable to the adoption of the Resolution in the current \Session; and we were therefore taking such action as was open to usto support the United States Government in their attempts to ensurethat it would fail once again.
CM 26 (71)secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that during his discussions with Ministers of the European Economic Community(e.c.) on 11 and 12 May agreement had been reached on almost allthe outstanding problems concerning the transitional periods for industry and agriculture. As regards industry these included thearrangements for the progressive removal of tariffs between theUnited Kingdom and the e.c. and for 12 of the 13 industrialproducts for which we had asked for special treatment. on agriculture agreement had been reached broadly on the linespreviously approved by the Ministerial Committee on the approach to Europe. Our transition to Community agricultural prices wouldbe achieved by six even steps spread over five years. Reasonablearrangements had also been negotiated for horticulture, including aprovision that there should be no change in horticultural tariffs until a year after our accession to the Community. Agreement had alsobeen reached on reasonable terms for British accession to theEURATOM Treaty. On the United Kingdom contribution to theCommunity budget there had been only a very general discussion.The Community had now suggested a new approach, under whicha notional British contribution to the Community budget would be calculated for each of the years of the transitional period but in orderto determine the sum actually payable in each year this notionalcontribution would be reduced by a proportion which becameprogressively smaller during the transitional period. Provided thatthe sums corresponding to these proportions were themselvesreasonable, there was no reason why this approach should not provide a satisfactory solution. The Community had also agreedthat they would be prepared to reaffirm the 1963 Declaration of intent as regards the independent Commonwealth countries in the carribbean and the Indian and Pacific Ocean. This ensured thosecountries a period during which they could choose between twoforms of association and a trading agreement; and in the meantimeour existing pattern of trade with them would remain unchanged.As regards sugar, the Community had eventually endorsed adeclaration that it would be the firm purpose of the enlarged community to safeguard the interests of the countries in questionwhose economies depended to a considerable degree on the exportof primary products, in particular sugar. It was difficult to imaginea general assurance couched in stronger terms, particularly since theprevious Administration had renegotiated the Commonwealth sugar agreement in 1967 in such a way as to exclude any contractual obligations jas regards quantities after 1974 if we entered the e.c..It would now be necessary to persuade the Caribbean countries thatthey could not have a stronger general assurance than the-3B*
Community were offering and that it was in some respects more 1satisfactory than an assurance linked to specific quantities of sugar Iimports. We could indicate that the United Kingdom market alone 1should be capable of absorbing the existing levels of imports front 1Commonwealth producers other than Australia, while still leaving 1room for an expansion of our own production. The tactics of the 1discussions with the Caribbean countries on this subject, which would 1take place early in June, would need to be considered in more detail 1by the Ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe.In discussion, it was suggested that the presentation to public 1opinion of the outcome of the successive negotiating conferences 1with the e.c. Council would be of critical importance; and further 1consideration would need to be given to this aspect of the matter. 1The Governments supporters were clearly uneasy about the a procedure by which agreement appeared to be being reached on jseparate successive topics, with the result of precluding any further Hamendment at the final stage when the settlement would have to beevaluated as a whole. In particular, it would be necessary, as regardssugar, to explain convincingly why a general assurance would bemore advantageous to the producing countries than an assurance!linked to specific quantities of imports. On the other hand we couldnot avoid a piecemeal method of negotiation; and, if we were to succeed in obtaining the agreement of the e.c. to our accession, itwould not be realistic to suppose that points which had been agreed!during the negotiations could subsequently be reopened. As regards isugar we had made it clear that, before accepting the Communitydeclaration, we must consult the Commonwealth Governmentsconcerned; but even in that case it was unrealistic to expect thatiflthe Commonwealth Governments were unwilling to agree, better terms could be obtained.   In fact, the Commonwealth Sugar,Agreement would continue in force until arrangements were madeto replace it.   When the Yaounde Conventions were renegotiated?the French Government would seek to persuade the Community togive favourable treatment to the former French territories; and, since;by that time we should be full members of the Community, it would]then be possible for us to insist on negotiating similar treatment for]the developing countries of the Commonwealth. In the forthcoming!discussions with the Caribbean countries, however, we should not golin any way further than the assurances which the Community were)prepared to give, since that would expose us to accusations of baifaith and would also make the Community less willing to offeiconcessions on the arrangements for New Zealand.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thlCabinet welcomed the progress which had been made at thidiscussions in Brussels on 11 and 12 May. As regards twCommunity declaration on sugar we must now seek to persuade the
SECRET*4. The Prime Minister said that careful preparations had beenmade for his forthcoming meeting with M. Pompidou, the Presidentof France, on 20-21 May. The agenda for the discussion, whichhad been agreed in advance, would begin with a general review ofthe need and scope for enlarging the European economic community (e.c.) and the means by which, once enlarged, it might best be organised to exercise its proper influence in the world. Thediscussion would then proceed naturally to the present method ofworking of the institutions of the Community and their futured development. The French President would wish, in particular, tosecure the agreement of the British Government that, on issueswhere the vital national interests of one or more Member States were at &apos;stake, decisions in the enlarged Community should be reachedonly by unanimous agreement. There should be no differences of substance between the French President and himself on this subject;the Chancellor of the Federal German Republic had recentlyadmitted to us that in practice Community decisions on issues of vital national interest could only be reached by unanimity.The next item on the agenda was the future of sterling and, inparticular, the level of the sterling balances, which the FrenchGovernment wished to be reduced by a fixed percentage annuallyafter the entry of the United Kingdom into the e.c.. It now seemed possible, however, that the French President would adopt a less rigidapproach to this question. In reply to the President, he would makeit clear that the British Government were ready to deal with theproblem of the sterling balances but that the methods to be employedwould have to be worked out carefully since they would need tosafeguard the interests of the United Kingdom, the holders of sterling and the general international monetary situation.Commonwealth countries concerned that this adequately safeguardedtheir interests and that no better terms could be obtained. But itwas important that in the forthcoming discussions they should not be offered assurances going beyond those which the Community had offered; and the tactics to be adopted in those discussions should therefore be considered carefully by the Ministerial Committee onthe Approach to Europe.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.
The next item was the future of the French language within the!Community, since the French Government realised that, on the)!entry into the e.c. of the United Kingdom as well as the Irish]Republic, Norway and Denmark, English would tend to become a&apos;lsecond working language and the present privileged status of the!French language in the institutions of the Community would beldiminished.  He would not be able to give any real reassurance teathe French President on this subject; but he would propose the!development of cultural exchanges between France and the United;Kingdom and would emphasise that in our schools French was1overwhelmingly the most commonly taught second language.The French President would next be concerned to ensure that the interests of the associated French States, under the Yaounde!Convention, would be protected after the United Kingdom entered!the e.c.. It would be necessary, in reply, to emphasise theimportance to the United Kingdom of providing commensuratlprotection for the interests of British associated States, including the sugar producers.Other items on the agenda, in addition to the major remainingproblems in the enlargement negotiations, were the relations of the enlarged Community with the European Free Trade Association andother West European countries (including Spain) which were not seeking membership; the need to develop genuinely European!companies within the Community; and the co-ordination of policy!by Member States towards inward investment.  There would then!remain on the agenda the major decisions required for early success!of the enlargement negotiations with the Six, which would belresumed at Ministerial level at meetings in Luxembourg on 7 and ori22 June.   He would raise under this head our contribution tojCommunity finance in the years before we adopted fully thiCommunity system;  New  Zealand  dairy  products;  and thefCommunity&apos;s fisheries policy.   He hoped that, as a result of discussions on these subjects with the French President, it would bipossible to provide a basis for a final settlement at the Luxembourg!meetings.The Prime Minister said that he believed that M. Pompidoiigenuinely wished the negotiations to succeed. He had now interestedhimself personally in the issues involved in a way which suggesteflthat he intended to work for a successful outcome. If so, the mailissues might indeed be resolved by the end of June; and it woulithen be necessary to make prompt arrangements for thiconsequential action, including the publication of a White Paper anfa Parliamentary debate.
,    , confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP (71) 59) about the proposed voluntary sample survey of incomes to follow the 1971 Census.The Home Secretary said that the intention to hold a voluntarysample survey of incomes following the 1971 Census had been indicated to the previous Parliament; and the preparations, whichhad continued under the authority of the present Administration,had reached an advanced stage without any real objection beingvoiced. But, in view of the popular disquiet expressed during therecent Census, a small group of Ministers under his chairmanshiphad considered whether the decision to hold the survey should be modified. The survey would enable family incomes to be related toother characteristics and would thus remedy an important deficiency in the statistical material on which decisions of social and economic policy could be based. Some Ministers had nevertheless feltconsiderable anxiety about the project. If the information was tobe useful, it must be reliable; and in present circumstances there wasa possibility that, if it was made clear that the survey was genuinelyvoluntary, the response would be insufficient. The group hadnevertheless reached the conclusion, on balance, that the surveyshould proceed but that before a final decision was taken on itstiming the public reaction should first be tested by means of anarranged Parliamentary Question. This conclusion, however, hadbeen reached before the recent Press reports alleging that personalrecords were accessible to private information agencies. In view ofthe current feeling engendered by these reports he now felt that theproposed survey should at least be postponed.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised the importance of the information abouthousehold incomes which such a survey could provide. Moreover,it was now known that, in spite of the anxieties which had been expressed in some quarters at the time, the response to the 1971Census had been as satisfactory as in the case of the 1966 samplecensus. On the other hand, in the present climate of concern aboutalleged disclosures of private information about individuals, therewas a risk that recipients of the questionnaire would not reply orCM 26 (71)The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
Security ofPersonalRecordsCONFIDENTIAL;6.  The Prime Minister said that the results of an investigation^by the Metropolitan Police into recent allegations in the Press that;personal records in public offices were accessible to private inquiry;agencies were expected shortly. He was considering whether, in theinterests of privacy but at the cost of some inconvenience and delay,the current rules about the transmission of such records by telephoneshould be amended in order to provide that, when it was impossible,to check the identity of a caller purporting to seek information about his own affairs by telephone, the reply should be given by letter only, jThe Cabinet-1Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Cabinet Office,18 May, 1971.would give inaccurate answers, thus reducing the reliability of the Istatistics to a point at which the survey would have no real value.!The Cabinet concluded, therefore, that in these circumstances thelbalance of advantage was against the proposed survey.The Cabinet- j1Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.
