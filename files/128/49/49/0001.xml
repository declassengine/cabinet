I secret parliamentary 1. The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the forthcomingAffairs debate in the House of Commons on entry into the european economic Communities.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that in the House ofLords it was expected that the debate would last only two days andthat the division would take place on Wednesday, 27 October.OverseaAffairsJapanSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theresults of the State Visit of the Emperor and Empress of Japan hadbeen satisfactory. The public attitude towards the visitors had been marked by a certain coolness. But this had not marred its success and had possibly been useful in impressing on the Japanese authorities that further efforts would be needed to persuade European opinionthat they were acceptable members of the comity of nations.Soviet UnionPreviousReference:CM (71) 48thConclusions,Minute 1The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the reaction of the Soviet Government to the recent eviction of Soviet spies fromthe United Kingdom had been as moderate as we could expect. Theyhad apparently not sought to impose a ceiling on the number ofmembers of the British Embassy in Moscow; and we could thereforehope to, replace, gradually and discreetly, those officials whoseremoval1 had been requested. Certain cases now before the courtsconfirmed our judgment that Soviet espionage had had some success in penetrating our national security.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.SECRETRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (71) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3*3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that considerable progress had been made by the British emissaries during their most recent visit to Salisbury in pursuit of an acceptable basis for a settlement with the Rhodesian regime. But there was still no agreement on the sensitive issue of the Rhodesian determination toretain the right to exercise discrimination in the areas of education and land use; and the Rhodesian leader, Mr. Smith, had just agreedto receive officials for further discussion of this and related aspectsof the problem. If the outcome of these discussions was satisfactory,he proposed to visit Rhodesia himself, possibly during the first week of November; but it was important for the successful outcome of thenegotiations that his intention should not be made known at thisstage.* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex
In the course of a brief discussion it was agreed that the; discussions with the Rhodesian regime appeared to be developing notunsatisfactorily. But the Cabinet would need to have a full discussionof the proposed terms of a settlement before the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary left for Rhodesia.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the points made in discussion.northern ireland previous reference:CM (71) 48thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the outcome of his meeting with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,Mr; Faulkner, on 7 October. The Cabinefs discussion and theconclusions reached were separately recorded and circulated onlyto The Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who had totake action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.UpperClydeShipbuildersPreviousReference:CM (71) 47thConclusions,Minute 6SECRET5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP (71) 109)by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, discussing further action in relation to Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS).The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that in his statement in Parliament on 29 July he had indicated that, if theGovernment were to support the new shipbuilding enterprise on theUpper Clyde, there must be satisfactory undertakings by the unions on working practices and wage rates. No negotiations on this subject had yet started, however, because the shop stewards were demandingassurances that all four UCS yards would be kept in operation andMr. McGarvey of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions had so far been unable to persuade the workers to abandonthis demand.   The more hopeful statement issued following hismeetings with Mr. Stenhouse, the Chairman of Govan ShipbuildersLimited, on 10 October had, indeed, been challenged by the shop stewards&apos; declaration on the following day that they would not co-operate with the company unless the future of all four yards was assured.   Mr. Stenhouse had already undertaken to study the feasibility of retaining the Scotstoun yard as well as the Govan andLinthouse yards; and, if this study showed a three-yard solution tobe economic, it would hardly be practicable to defend a refusal toallow the company to include Scotstoun, despite the probableincrease in capital requirements.   Mr. Stenhouse saw no feasiblefuture for the fourth yard at Clydebank.   There was therefore noquestion of its being taken over by the company; and, since therewere no proposals from private interests for Clydebank, it wasimppssible to give the unions any assurance about the maintenance
of employment there. It was now clear that, if the yards in question were to,be..kept at work while the search for a solution continued,the Government would be obliged to accept further and onerous new financial commitments. The future even of the Govan and Linthouseyards would be at risk within a fortnight unless there was an earlyassurance that new keels would be laid. But the brazilian government and Irish Shipping Limited would not confirm their orders without the promise of cost subsidies of the order of  2^- 4^ million.in total, together with refund guarantees under which, if their ships were not completed, progress payments made duringconstruction would be refunded by the Government. Theseguarantees would involve a contingent liability of the order of  15- 20 million; Neither the subsidies nor the refund guarantees werecovered by existing statutory powers; and, if the government undertook to provide them, a full Parliamentary statement wouldhave to be made. Moreover, they would open the door to other similar demands, with the result that it might become difficult to limit the Governments commitments. If, on the other hand, the shipowners could not be induced to confirm their orders, theLiquidator would probably feel obliged to declare over 800 moreredundancies within two to three weeks; and the industrial actionwhich could well follow might make it impossible to keep any ofthe yards; in operation. The Liquidator would also need furtherworking capital in order to continue paying wages beyond a furtherfortnight or three weeks; and, in order to avoid prejudicing UCS&apos;ssecured creditors, the Government might have to provide this as agrant or a subordinated loan. Agreement by the Government toextend their commitments in these ways should assure the retentionof almost all the present 7,500 jobs in the yards until about the endof the year; but in present circumstances there could be no assurance that Govian Shipbuilders could be established as a continuing entityor that, if so established, the company would be commercially viable.Virtually all the orders which it would inherit were likely to involveit in loss. On normal criteria, therefore, it would not be justifiablefor the Government to undertake an open-ended commitment ofthe kind now contemplated; and the Law Officers had advised thatthe Departments Accounting Officer would be acting at the limit of financial propriety in authorising the expenditure. On the otherhand, the consequence of not doing so might be to precipitate anearly crisis on the Upper Clyde, which could be fatal to the prospects of maintaining a shipbuilding capacity there. Against thatbackground, the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had accepted his recommendations in the note attached to CP (71) 109that, provided that Mr. McGarvey was able to give him undertakings which satisfied him both that there was a real and positive prospect that the unions would start meaningful negotiations with GovanShipbuilders Limited and that there was a reasonable chance of the undertakings being honoured and not being subsequently denouncedby the shop stewards, he should enter into negotiations with the brazilian Government and Irish Shipping Limited for theconfirmation of their orders. In those negotiations he would seek to persuade them to modify their demands for cost subsidies andrefund guarantees; but, if those demands were maintained and he141771-17B*
and his Accounting Officer were satisfied, after further consultationwith the Law Officers, that they could properly undertake the further commitments sought by the shipowners, he should be prepared to doso. He invited the Cabinet to endorse these conclusions.In discussion, it was suggested that an undertaking byMr. McGarvey that the unions would be willing to enter intomeaningful negotiations with Govan Shipbuilders would provide no assurance that the new and extensive commitments which theGovernment were now asked to accept would secure a viable future for shipbuilding on the Upper Clyde. Mr. McGarvey himselfappeared to accept that this objective required the concentration of work in two or three yards; and he might readily give the requiredundertaking. But there was no certainty that he could obtain thesupport of his members, who were still dominated by shop stewards,whose purpose was less to assure the future employment of their members than to create industrial anarchy. But an apparent victoryfor the shop stewards would encourage the spread of industrial unrestin similar forms to other parts of the country; and there were already. sbme signs of this. It would therefore be desirable to bring matters to a head, and the real issues into the open, as soon as possible. Itneeded to be shown that it was not the Government but the shop stewards who, by their obstruction of the plans of GovanShipbuilders, were now jeopardising the future of shipbuilding onthe Upper Clyde. It might help to isolate them and to establish the true measure of the support which they enjoyed from the men at the yards if the company could arrange with the unions for a written statement of the proposals to be given individually to each worker asthe basis for a secret ballot. This, however, might be impracticable.It was questionable if it would advance the Governmenfs aims&apos;. if the Secretary of State conceded at this juncture that theI Government were prepared to contemplate new financial commitments, which might amount to  20 million in addition to the already large capital sums which Govan Shipbuilders would needfrom the Exchequer on taking over the Govan and Linthouse yards and, perhaps, the Scotstoun yard. Such commitments, once given,could not be withdrawn; and, in the present uncertain outlook, itwould be difficult to defend acceptance of the contingent liability to public funds, more especially since Govan Shipbuilders might now have little hope of ultimate viability. Moreover, to make such a concession, except in return for a clear withdrawal by the shop stewards of their previous demands and their endorsement of theunion&apos;s agreement to negotiate meaningfully, would appear to becapitulating to them; and it would also further weaken the government&apos;s negotiating position with the shipowners. Since aspokesman for Irish Shipping Limited had publicly declared that hiscompany were not threatening early withdrawal of their orders, itwas in any event not clear why confirmation of these orders wasconsidered so urgent. If early confirmation were not secured, a consequential decision by the Liquidator to issue further redundancynotices (which would not take effect immediately and could perhaps be provisional) might be a salutary warning to the work force andinduce them to cease withholding their co-operation.
On the other hand it was for the benefit of Govan Shipbuildersand the yards that early confirmation of these orders was desirable:Irish Shipping Limited themselves were in no hurry to see their shipsstarted. If, therefore, the Government wished to insist on clearundertakings being given on behalf of the labour force beforecontemplating the further commitments which might be necessary tosecure the orders and to place the onus for any failure on the shop stewards, it was to the unions that they must look to secure the shop stewards&apos; compliance. They should not treat with the shop stewardsdirectly. The Government would also need to be ready to contemplate the possibility of a complete collapse of shipbuilding onthe Upper Clyde, entailing perhaps some 15,000 redundancies at the yards and at the firms which supplied them. It might be necessary todeal with this situation if the shop stewards disowned any under-takihgs which were given officially by their unions; and in that case it would be essential that it should be publicly clear that the blame for the collapse rested on the shop stewards. It might be desirableI to prepare the ground for such an eventuality by means of a ministerial speech in the next few days, setting out the facts of thesituation dispassionately.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that inthe present confused and uncertain situation the Cabinet were notprepared to authorise the acceptance of extensive additional commitments, of a potentially open-ended nature, which would bedifficult to defend as a proper use of public funds. The Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry should therefore inform Mr.McGarvey at his meeting with him later that day that theGovernment could not contemplate entering into negotiations withthe shipowners about the conditions on which they would beprepared to confirm their orders except on the basis of acceptable andpublic assurances by the unions of co-operation with GovanShipbuilders and meaningful negotiations on working practices andwage rates. He should give Mr. McGarvey to understand that if,after the unions had given such assurances, they were then repudiatedby the shop stewards, the Government would not be prepared toproceed. Meanwhile, however, he should put further pressure onIrish Shipping Limited and the Brazilian Government to modify their demands. The Cabinet would then consider the position again in the light of the response by Mr. McGarvey and the shop stewards.The Lord&apos;President of the Council, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry, should give urgent consideration tothe way in which the Governmenfs case could be presented tothe best advantage. The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Shipbuildingshould complete their review of the shipbuilding industry as quickly as possible and should make early recommendations for the industry&apos;srationalisation and the manner in which this could best be planned and phased.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
CammellLaird(ShipbuildingandEngineering)Limited6. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that ithad been suspected for some time that Cammell Laird, 50 per cent ofthe shares in which were Government-owned, was operating on afinancially unsound basis; and the new management appointed inthe previous August had accordingly undertaken a thorough analysis of the company&apos;s finances. The provisional conclusion, which wouldbe submitted to the Board on the following day, was that thecompany&apos;s losses were at least  15 million and that  14 million of new investment and working capital would be needed to enable the yards to operate efficiently. Without this assistance the company would very quickly become insolvent. Urgent steps were beingtaken to determine the situation in more detail in order that thevarious possible courses of action could be assessed with a view toan early decision whether, in the light of the social implications, theGovernment should endeavour to prevent the company from going into liquidation and, if not, what steps should be taken t(&amp; alleviate the impact of liquidation in Birkenhead and the MerseysideDevelopment Area.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.SECRETPublicExpenditurePreviousReference:CM (71) 40thConclusions,Minute 6Defence: 7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP (71) 103) and by the Central Policy review staff (CP (71) 108) on the 1971 public expenditure review, togetherwith a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence (CP (71)107) on the annual public expenditure allocations for the defence budget.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was concerned about the shortage of troops to deal with the present and prospectiveposition in Northern Ireland, where the Army, particularly the infantry, were subject to severe and increasing strain. The recentimprovement in recruitment now made it possible to contemplateraising additional units; and on present forecasts it should be possibleto sustain as many as four additional battalions. These could bebased on four of the representative companies which had previously been reduced from battalions. The capital cost of the equipmentinvolved would be about  5  million; and there would be additionalannual expenditure of  2-2^ million for maintenance and  7-1 million for manpower costs. In the context of the public expenditure surveyhe had already pruned the long-term costings for the years 1972-73to 1974-75 by some  300 million in order to reduce them to the targets prescribed in the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policyof October, 1970 (Cmnd. 4521); but he had sought an extra  25million over the same three years in order to meet the cost of improved recruitment; together with an additional  105 million in1975-76 in order to make good deficiencies in equipmentprogrammes.   Subsequently, however, it had been agreed that an
additional  70 million should be spent over the next three years onaccelerated purchases of ships for the Royal Navy in order tocontribute to a reduction in unemployment in the development areas.He would&apos; !also shortly propose additional expenditure in order tomaintain employment in certain defence-based industries. While he still wished to maintain his request for an increase in the defence budget ceiling for 1975-76, he was prepared to accept that his request for  25 million over the preceding three years for additionalrecruitment should be regarded as subsumed in the additional  70million which had been allocated over the same period for thepurchase of ships. He did not, however, regard it as possible, withinthe limits prescribed for those three years, to meet the cost of raising the proposed four additional infantry battalions. He was thereforeseeking the agreement of the Cabinet for the defence budget ceilingsfor those years to be increased in order to accommodate this additional element of expenditure.In discussion it was suggested that it would have been preferable to deal with a particular item of additional defence expenditure inthe context of a more general discussion of the public expenditure survey. Against the background of the Cabinefs earlier decisions on public expenditure, the total additional outlay which had been proposed for defence, including the provision envisaged for 1975-76,was such that it could only be accepted by finding savings elsewhere.On the other hand, it would be unwise to refuse to accept recruits at atime when they were once again available. To the extent that somerecruits would otherwise have been unemployed, there would beoffsetting savings in social benefits. It would also be useful toconsider;whether there was any additional expenditure which mightbe authorised in order to promote employment in the immediatefuture; but this could be discussed separately.: The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that four additional infantry battalions should beraised, based on the present representative companies, and that thedefence budget totals for the years 1972-73 to 1974-75 should be augmented to accommodate the consequential costs as well as theadditional expenditure on ships which had recently been authorised.The Cabinet noted, however, that the Secretary of State for defence was no longer pressing for the additional expenditure of  25 million in those years, which he had originally proposed in the public expenditure review. They would wish to resume their discussion ofpublic expenditure at a later meeting, when they would consider theproposal for a. further  105 million for defence in 1975-76, togetherwith the other outstanding proposals for additional public expenditure.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office,\   12 October, 1971.
