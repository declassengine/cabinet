confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (71) 131) about the future programme of the european space Research Organisation (ESRO), to which was attached areport by officials on the costs and benefits to the United Kingdomof participation.The Lord Privy Seal said that our delegation at the meeting ofthe Council of ESRO on 23-24 November would be required toindicate whether the United Kingdom Government were willing toparticipate in a 10-year programme of scientific space research andthe development of satellites for telecommunications, air traffic control and weather observation. The Ministerial Committee on science and Technology had considered this programme and had concluded&apos; that it could not be justified on technological or economic grounds.: Nevertheless, there were strong political grounds for ouragreeing to participate, provided that we were not irrevocablycommitted! to an expensive telecommunications satellite project if further studies before the proposed review in 1975 failed to reveal auser requirement. Although it was possible to propose an intermediate position between outright acceptance and completerejection of the whole programme, there was little to be gained bydoing so; and it would be preferable to make the decision on thebasis of weighing the cost of the programme against the political advantage of contributing to it. We should not underestimate theextent to which we should be able in 1975 to persuade our Europeanpartners to determine the future of the telecommunications projecton strictly economic grounds; and the voting convention which required a two-thirds majority of participating countries,representing at least two-thirds of the contributions to theprogramme, would provide considerable protection againstunwarranted enthusiasm.* Previously circulated 46 a Confidential Annex.t,  : i   ,:.

The Prime Minister said that the critical stage in theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s negotiations with the rhodesian leader, Mr. Ian Smith, had now been reached. Amemorandum had been prepared by the Solicitor General(CP (71) 138), which indicated the points on which it had not yetbeen possible to reach agreement; and this was being circulated to members of the Cabinet for their information. Mr. Smith should now have a clear idea of the concessions which he would have tomake if a settlement compatible with the Five Principles was to be concluded; and the Rhodesian Cabinet were understood to bemeeting that day in order to review the situation. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would meet Mr. Smith again thereafter;and as soon as his report of that discussion was available it wouldbe necessary for the Cabinet to consider the matter in greater detail.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.
In discussion it was urged that no decision on the mostexpensive part of the programme would be needed until 1975 andthat in the interval we should honour the undertakings which wehad given to ESRO and affirm our willingness to abide by the votingconventions. Only three or four countries were determined todevelop an independent European competence in space even if itebst much more than alternative ways of achieving the same results;and there was therefore little danger of our being coerced by a two-thirds majority of the countries participating in the telecommunications project, provided that a sufficient number of countries contributed to ensure that the two-thirds majority decision in 1975 would be taken strictly on grounds of technological andeconomic merit. On the other hand, a decision to take part in a programme for which there was no user requirement was contraryto the criteria which had been developed for domestic technologicalprojects; and we should be committed to work on programmes forwhich there was no better justification than a desire to maintain a competitive position in relation to the United States.&apos;.&quot; The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that wewere not yet in a position to persuade other European countries to concentrate on projects which gave value for money. Although itwould be cheaper to purchase applications satellites than to developthem, part of the purpose of the European space programme was todevelop a capability independently of the United States. It could be argued that United Kingdom participation in the programme would run counter to the principle, which the Cabinet had recentlyendorsed, that any research and development project should derive from an established &quot; customer &quot; requirement. But this argumentwould not necessarily be valid, since the requirement in this case was based partly on the need to develop an independent Europeancapability and not solely on the technological merits of the project.Nevertheless, it would afford some assurance that a decision tocontinue the telecommunications project after 1975 would be taken on sound economic lines if enough countries joined in theprogramme. Our delegation to the Council of the European space research Organisation should therefore be authorised to commit theUnited Kingdom to the programme of the Organisation, includingthe development of applications satellites, subject to the condition that at least seven other countries agreed to participate in the telecommunications satellite project. If less than seven othercountries were prepared to contribute to that project, the delegation should seek further guidance.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the UnitedKingdom delegation to the meeting of the Council of theEuropean Space Research Organisation on 23-24November to be instructed accordingly.,;:1 Cabinet Office,23 November, 1971.
