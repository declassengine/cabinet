CM 9 (71)CONFIDENTIALIreland 1. The Home Secretary said that the renewed disorder inNorthern Ireland was being deliberately fomented by the militantwing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) known as the ProvisionalArmy Council. The security forces were intensifying their efforts to contain the violence and to seek out and arrest the ringleaders; anda number of detectives from the Metropolitan Police had been sentto Northern Ireland to assist the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Asregards the possible use of the power available to the NorthernIreland Government under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)Acts to intern persons without trial the Government at Stormonthad said no more than that they would be prepared to invoke this power if the security forces requested them to do so.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the recent riotsrepresented a new phase in the campaign of violence. The disorderwas no longer a merely intercommunal matter; and a situationapproaching armed conflict was developing. There was a danger that the Provisional CounciFs forces were being reinforced from theIrish Republic. In these circumstances he had authorised thedespatch of further reinforcements to Ulster; and the General OfficerCommanding, Northern Ireland, had expressed confidence that he now had enough troops to deal with the current situation. the morale of the Army was high; and they were responding to the new situation with courage and restraint.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although the Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, had condemned theviolence in Northern Ireland, the Government of the Irish Republicshould be urged to take a stronger stand against the IRA, who were using the Republic as a base from which to promote terrorism in ulster. On the other hand Mr. Lynch was probably exerting.asmuch influence towards moderation as the political situation in theRepublic allowed him; and it was particularly difficult for hisGovernment to take stronger measures against terrorism when thecourts had dealt leniently with those members of the IRA who hadbeen arrested.(b) Although it might eventually prove necessary to adopt apolicy of internment in Ulster, this course should be approached withgreat caution. It could succeed only if the terrorist leaders could be identified and arrested; and it would be liable not only to exacerbatecommunal relations afresh but also to create a category of political;o-4
secret \1prisoners whose arbitrary treatment might be held to justify reprisals?in the form of kidnapping and the seizure of hostages.f(c) Public opinion in Great Britain was beginning actively toresent the situation which was developing in Northern Ireland; and]many people would favour abandoning the Province to its fate-ajcourse which the Government could not contemplate. It was;important, therefore, that the general public should be helped torealise that the disorder was no longer the result of communal strife;or rebellion against political injustice but was the outcome of]deliberate terrorism by the IRA. jThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the;Cabinet approved the objectives currently being pursued by the;security forces. Continued rioting, however, would lead to public!pressure for some initiative by the Government; and the true nature!of the current situation in Northern Ireland should therefore be Iclearly explained. Any request by the security forces for the.adoption of a policy of internment would call for very careful!consideration of its consequences, both direct and indirect. Although!it seemed unlikely that the Government of the Irish Republic could Iusefully be urged to take any action in relation to the situation in jUlster, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary might consider the&apos;matter further in consultation with Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in dublin.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing!up of their discussion.Rolls-RoycePreviousReference :CM (71) 8thConclusions,Minute 1secret!12.   The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to his Note II(CP (71) 18) inviting the Secretary of State for Defence to take charge!of the complex of issues arising from the failure of Rolls-Royce and,!together with the Secretary of State for Employment, the Secretary of state for Trade and Industry, the Minister of Aviation Supply, the!Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Attorney-General, to ensure the necessary co-ordination of action across the board. This Ministerial IGroup was being supported by an Official Team under Cabinet!Office chairmanship.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the Ministerial!Group had met for the first time on Friday of the previous week and!had allocated the work which had now to be done. The Rolls-Royce j(Purchase) Bill, empowering the Government to acquire certain of the 1
132950 4B* 2company&apos;s assets, had already been published. Reactions to thecompany&apos;s failure and to the Governments intervention had beentolerably well received by the French and Italian Governments butnot quite so well by the Federal German Government. It waspossible that the multi-role combat aircraft which was being built in collaboration with the Federal Government might be in danger. Hehad as yet received no reaction from Mr. Packard, the United StatesDeputy Secretary of Defense, to our offer to explore with the UnitedStates Government the possibility of keeping in being the RB 211-22engine project. He had met the Receiver on the previous Friday,when the RB211 contract between Rolls-Royce and LockheedCorporation had not so far been disclaimed. He intended to discussthe situation with him again that afternoon. The Receiver would be helpful and would almost certainly be prepared to continue work onthe RB 211 engine provided that he was appropriately indemnified bythe Government. The Minister of Aviation Supply had now reported,however, that it might cost as much as  9 million a month tomaintain the present level of activity on the project; and the ministerial Group would need to decide at what level the work should be continued for the time being while possible renegotiationof the Lockheed contract was being examined. The presentChairman and Deputy Chairman of Rolls-Royce, Lord Cole andMr..Morrow, would be taking up these posts in the new successorcompany. But a new Managing Director was urgently required;and he would be grateful for suggestions from his colleagues. Itwas too early yet to assess the effects of the failure on employment or on trade suppliers.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the opposition were prepared to take all stages of the Rolls-Royce (Purchase) Billin the House of Commons on Thursday, 11 February, and that itshould thereafter be possible for the House of Lords to take the bill at the beginning of the following week. It was argued that theGovernment must be particularly careful in dealing with two aspectsof the situation. First, it would be unwise to give the impression thatthey considered that the RB211 engine was technically inferior inany way to competitive United States engines. It was the terms ofthe contract with the Lockheed Corporation and not the technicalquality of the engine which, on present information, were to blame for the failure. The Government should make this clear in theSecond Reading debate on the Bill and so avoid any suggestion that,by denigrating the engine, they had themselves made it impossible torenegotiate a new viable contract with Lockheeds. Second, theGovernment should avoid putting themselves in a position wherethey, rather than Rolls-Royce or the Receiver, appeared to be
IndustrialAffairsElectricity PayDispute:WilberforceReportSECREM3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ojfthe Cabinet (CP (71) 19) to which was attached a Note by tbjDepartment of Employment, summarising the recommendations of the  court of inquiry into the pay dispute in the electricity supplies!industry (the Wilberforce Report) and its implications forGovernments&apos; strategy in relation to pay negotiations in general anlcertain impending pay settlements with other groups of workers. Iresponsible for the substantial redundancies which Rolls-Royce had!indicated would be inevitable whether a new contract for the RB 21 Ifengine could be renegotiated or not. The higher the level of interim Iwork on the engine which was financed by the Government throughjthe agency of the Receiver and the longer a decision on the future of Ithe project was delayed the greater would be the prospect that the government would be blamed for redundancies which should;properly be laid at the door of Rolls-Royce and the Receiver. The!Government should therefore seek to limit the interim work as much-as possible; and the Receiver should not be discouraged from Idismissing staff whom he judged redundant. When in due course the!Government had to decide whether a new contract should be]negotiated with Lockheeds they would have to bear in mind notJmerely the economic effects in this country, including those on:employment, but also the effects on our national reputation for!commercial reliability if the Lockheed aircraft had to be abandoned!because of our failure to deliver its engines.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said it was!important that the Receiver should disclaim the existing contract!between Rolls-Royce and the Lockheed Corporation as soon as possible: until this was done the Government could not discuss the!terms of a new contract. It should be made plain to the Receiver jthat the Government would in no circumstances agree to take overithe existing contract. The Ministerial Group under the Defence!Secretary should ensure that in the debate on the Rolls-Royce!(Purchase) Bill the Governments position on the points raised midiscussion was made clear and that it was understood that it waslRolls-Royce, not the Government, who had decided to discontinuelthe existing contract and to call in a Receiver.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to arrange thaSthe Governments position was clearly explained, allindicated in the summing up by the Prime Minister, in thenforthcoming debate on the Rolls-Royce (Purchase) Bill.    II
The Secretary of State for Employment said that the courfsreport was unanimous, save for a note of reservation by Mr.Mortimer about the Governments general economic policy inrelation to inflation. It recommended that, from 21 September, 1970,when the previous pay agreement expired, to 14 December, 1970,when the unions had called off their &quot; work-to-rule &quot;, the flat rateincrease of  2 a week offered by the Electricity Council should standwithout any improvement. From 14 December two improvements in the employers&apos; offer were proposed. First, skilled workers shouldreceive an extra 54s. a week instead of 40s. in order to prevent an undue narrowing of differentials and to keep rates in line with thoseof skilled workers in other industries; second, shift allowances inthe industry should be increased by rather more than the electricity council had intended. In order to accelerate the introduction ofincentive bonus schemes the court also recommended the payment of&quot; lead in&quot; bonuses on a rising scale to workers who formallyundertook, corporately and individually, to accept such schemestogether with their implications for reductions in the labour force.These payments would cease when an incentive bonus scheme was actually introduced.Excluding the &quot; lead in &quot; payments, the Reports recommenda-tions would represent a 10-9 per cent increase on an annual basisfrom December onwards. The &quot; lead in &quot; payments should facilitatea faster run-down in the labour force and should therefore costnothing in practice. If the court were right in their assessment, theindustry&apos;s total wage bill should rise at most by 7 per cent and at best by only 2-3 per cent because of the reduction in the labour forcein 1971. The court had criticised the unions for their rejection ofarbitration and had declared that the &quot; work-to-rule &quot; had in practicebeen conducted in a manner which was in breach of the relevantagreements. The court had also taken reasonable account of theinterests of the national economy. They had claimed that, set againstpast and prospective performances and the special factors relating tothe particular case into which they were inquiring, the settlement which they recommended should not intensify inflationary pressures.The Governments main objectives should now be to secure anearly settlement of the electricity workers&apos; claim within the limits set by the courfs recommendations; to ensure that 11 per cent shouldnot become a &quot; de facto&quot; norm and that &quot; de-escalation&quot; ofsettlements should continue; and avoid any action which mightweaken the resolve of other employers, such as the Post Office andFords, who were standing firm on pre-Wilberforce offers. In order toguard against the risks which would arise from the varyingSECRET132950-4 c*
interpretations which different commentators might put on the jReport, it would be important for the Government to make their jinterpretation and attitude known immediately it was published. This :should be on the following day, when he would propose to make a .iParliamentary statement commending the Report as a basis of settlement in the electricity supply industry, pointing out that the recommended increase was specifically related to the circumstances of jthat industry, noting that the court had stressed the need to resistinflationary pressures and had satisfied themselves that their proposals would not intensify them, and emphasising the need to continue the Iprocess of reducing the rate of increase in successive settlementsthrough the months ahead.&quot; &apos; ii in discussion the following main points were made -i(a) The fact that the reports recommendations were very jclearly directed to the special circumstances of the electricity supply industry should help to counter the risk that certain of those recommendations might be invoked in support of the claims of other jgroups of workers. On balance, the Report should be helpful to the government&apos;s policies.(b) It would be very important, however, to focus public Iattention on the true measure of the increases recommended in the report. Their cost (expressed in terms of a constant labour force) was 10-9 per cent and not 13 per cent or more as had been suggested jby certain advance speculation in the Press. In addition, attention Ishould be drawn to the court&apos;s belief that, by means of more rapidimplementation of productivity schemes, for which the recommenda- Jtions provided the Electricity Boards with a powerful incentive, the Ilabour force should be contracted to an extent which would reduce jthe payroll cost over a year to 7 per cent at worst and 2 per cent Iat best. The court&apos;s strictures on the unions for resorting to industrial Iaction in breach of their arbitration agreement, together with the 1reporfs stipulation that the additions to the Electricity CounciFs offer which it recommended should take effect only from the date when fnormal working was resumed should also be emphasised. The 1Government should not be concerned to minimise the impact of these sections of the report merely in order to secure the union&apos;s jacceptance of its recommendations or to help the union leaders to extricate themselves from embarrassment.(c) In order to ensure that the Report would be fairly reported 1and interpreted it should not be made available to Members of 1Parliament or released generally until after the Secretary of State for employment had made his Parliamentary statement. It was also for 1consideration whether advance copies should be provided under I
132950-4SECRETc* 2embargo to the Lobby and industrial correspondents as wascustomary and at what stage the Secretary of State should brief thesetwo groups.(d) The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations would shortly consider the implications of the Report for current pay negotiations in respect of other groups of workers in the electricity industry and the gas and water industries, together with localauthority and National Health Service craftsmen. The Minister of posts and Telecommunications was arranging to inform the ActingChairman of the Post Office Board in confidence of the Reportsfindings and would consider urgently with him the tactics to beadopted in relation to the outstanding pay dispute with Post office workers. The right course might be for the Board to reiterate thatthey could consider an improvement in their present offer only tosuch extent as the cost could be confined within the same total asthe 8 per cent already offered. If so, it should be made clear thatthis would require an increase in productivity and perhaps the non-resumption of certain services (some of which, after the present strike,would probably be no longer economic).(e) Contingency plans against industrial action in the gas industry or its resumption in the electricity industry had recentlybeen reviewed; the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry wouldbe meeting the Chairmen of both industries that afternoon.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Employment shouldmake a Parliamentary statement on the following afternoon and thatthe Wilberforce Report should be published after that statement.The arrangements for briefing the Lobby and industrial correspon-dents, and for the provision of confidential copies of the Report tothese groups, should be further considered by the Secretary of state in conjunction with the Lord President of the Council and the PrimeMinister&apos;s Press Office. The implications of the Report for impendingpay negotiations with other groups of workers should be urgentlyconsidered by the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations;and the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications should discuss with the Acting Chairman of the Post Office Board the tactics to befollowed in relation to the dispute with the Union of Post office workers, including the possibility of announcing that the strike had made it doubtful whether some postal services could be resumed.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services on the reconstruction of national insurance and the preservation of occupational pension rights (CP (71) 12 and13).The Secretary of State for Social Services said that his main proposals for reconstructing the national insurance scheme, theiradvantages and disadvantages and the alternative possibilities whichhe had rejected were set out in CP (71) 12. The details of the scheme were described in CP (71) 13. About one-third of the labour force,for the most part women, were not covered by occupational pension schemes.  In accordance with the commitment in the conservative party&apos;s Manifesto at the General Election his proposals would establish a reserve scheme for such individuals over and above abasic scheme providing flat-rate benefits, which would, over a period,make it unnecessary for them to rely on means-tested supplementary benefit.  Contributions for both the basic and the reserve schemes would be earnings-related.    Their effect would therefore  beNationalInsuranceScheme \(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment (i) to   make   a   Parliamentary   statement   on   theWilberforce Report on the following day;(ii) to circulate a draft of his statement to the ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations;(hi) to consider further, in consultation with the lord president of the Council and the Prime MinistersPress Office, the precise arrangements for briefingthe Press and for the release of the Report, whichshould not be available to Members of parliament or be published generally until he had made his parliamentary statement;(iv) to arrange for the Ministerial Sub-Committee on pay negotiations to consider the implications of theReport for other pending pay negotiations.(3) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications to initiate, in the light of the views which had been expressed,further discussions with the Acting Chairman of the PostOffice Board about the pay dispute with the Union of post Office Workers.
progressive; and a buoyant revenue would be ensured. Certaindisadvantages, however, were inherent in his proposals. First,although an individual on less than average earnings would pay lessby way of contribution to the basic scheme than at present, the contribution by the above-average wage earner would be substantially increased. Two upratings of pensions, however, were due before thenew scheme was introduced; and since these would involve increases in the contributions due from the highest paid to a level only about or 6 shillings short of that proposed for the start of the new scheme, they might soften the impact of the latter to a significantextent. For those contributing to the reserve scheme there would be additional payments of 1^ per cent of wages. Second, in order tokeep the contributions by the employee as low as practicable theproportion of the total contribution paid by the employer would beincreased, at an additional cost to employers of about  200 million for the basic scheme and a further  100 million for the reserve scheme. The increased contribution by the employers wouldprobably result in a once-for-all increase in prices of about 1 to 1 per cent, extending over a year or two. Third, the reserve scheme would involve the establishment of a fund which might grow by theend of the century to something of the order of  5,000 million at current earning levels. This might encourage fears that in the wronghands the funds could be used for ill-judged intervention in industry.He would ensure, however, that the financial management of thefund was independent of the Government and would imposesafeguards against its misuse. Fourth, the reserve scheme wouldmature over a period of 40 years compared with the 20 years inthe scheme proposed by the previous Administration. The periodcould be curtailed, however, only by subsidising the scheme, with consequent damage to the growth of occupational pensions. he believed that his proposals would be generally acceptable. The LifeOffices would naturally be concerned about the future of their ownschemes; but they would welcome the certainty which an announce-ment about the new scheme would provide. If his proposals were generally approved, he would wish to conduct preliminary technical discussions about the terms of exemption from the reserve scheme with representatives of the main organisations concerned withoccupational pension schemes. He would also consult in confidencethe leading officials in those organisations and in the confederation of British Industry about the proposals as a whole; and he would seek; the views of the Ministers concerned with public service pension schemes. He would then prepare a White Paper as a basis forfurther public discussion. He would not now be ready to introduce legislation in the 1971-72 Session; but he would hope to do so during
the following Session. Royal Assent by April 1973 would enablethe scheme to come into effect in April 1975.In discussion of the main scheme the following points weremade:(a) It was argued that the increased burden of contributions which it was proposed to impose on employers had seriousimplications for industry. Employers as a whole would have to findan additional  300 million a year (if estimated contributions to thereserve fund were taken into account). The need to impose this additional burden flowed from the proposal to retain the link between contribution and entitlement to benefit, which was becoming increasingly artificial. The fact that in the european economic Community (e.c.) employers generally bore a relativelyhigher burden of contributions to national insurance schemes wasnot in itself a justification for increasing the proportion of theemployers&apos; contribution in this country. Account should also betaken of the differences in the fiscal provisions affecting industry inthe United Kingdom and the e.c. respectively. The whole basisof the increased employers&apos; contribution deserved more searchingconsideration.  .(b) It had been argued that the national insurance uprating of1971 and 1973 would soften the impact of the increased contributions which would be required from those with above average earningswhen the new scheme took affect. But, so far as the 1971 upratingwas concerned, it might well prove to be both untimely andinconsistent with the Governmenfs present objectives to increase therate of contributions to match an increase in the rate of benefit.In discussion of the reserve scheme the following main points were made:(c) There were disadvantages in both the funded basis of thereserve scheme and the potential size of the fund involved. A fundedreserve scheme would increase the pressure which already existed forthe funding of public service pension schemes. Public servantsmight well feel that, if their schemes were funded they would derivemore value from their contributions than they received under schemes which were, as at present, only notionally funded. On the other handpublic service schemes were protected from the effects of inflationby periodical pension increases. Moreover, there was a differencebetween instituting a funded scheme which was intended to do no more than provide pensions just above the supplementary benefitlevel and the conversion to a funded basis of public service schemes which were organised to deal with a much higher level of pension.
cm 9 (71)(d) The potential size of the reserve fund might entail the riskof its possible misuse in the future. On the other hand theadministration of the reserve fund could be insulated from government interference by entrusting it to an independent boardof management. Although the Government were not committed bytheir Manifesto to the particular form of reserve scheme which was now proposed and, in particular, were not committed to the principleof funding, it was necessary in setting up the reserve scheme to do allthat was possible to encourage the growth and development of occupational schemes. But this could not be achieved if the privateinsurance interests felt that their schemes were exposed to unfair competition from a scheme subsidised by the State. The only alternative would be to establish a scheme on the lines proposed bythe previous Administration. But this would necessarily entail futureliabilities of unpredictable dimensions, whereas the proposed schemewas self-financing.(e) Many existing occupational schemes fell far short of a desirable standard. Some were neither funded nor supported by insurance; and careful consideration would therefore need to begiven to the criteria for exemption from the reserve scheme.(/) Instead of establishing a single reserve scheme on the lines proposed, it might be preferable to require everyone to be covered bysome earnings related scheme in addition to the main flat-rate benefitscheme. It could then be left to private interests to introduce a variety of possible schemes from which individuals could choose thearrangements best suited to their own requirements. On the otherhand those to whom the reserve scheme was intended to apply wouldoften find it difficult to make the necessary choice. Many of them would be only intermittently employed; and it would be virtually impossible to enforce a system which required no more thanmembership of some earnings related scheme.In further discussion of the proposals as a whole it was pointedout that, although there would be reductions in the manpowerinvolved in administering national insurance and related schemeswhen the new arrangements had taken full effect, their early stageswould entail a requirement for additional manpower rising to 3,500in 1975; and this additional manpower commitment would accrue ina period in which the Government had made it their objective toreduce civil service members.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet felt some concern both about the additional burden ofcontributions which it was proposed to impose on employers and
about the nature of the reserve scheme. The Ministerial Committeeon Social Services should therefore re-examine the proposals, taking account of the points made in discussion. A careful appraisal shouldbe made of the manpower implications for all the Departmentsaffected up to the point when the new scheme had come into full operation.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, as Chairman of the ministerial committee on Social Services, to arrange for the Committeeto reconsider the proposals in CP (71) 12 and 13 in the lightof their discussion.CONFIDENTIALFuture 5.  The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumLegation     by the Lord president of the Council (CP (71) 15) on legislative1971-72Session priorities for the 197^72 Session.previous reference: jy^ j^or^ president said that the decision of the Secretary of conclusions State for social* Services that the projected National Insurance BillMinute 8 could not be ready for introduction in the 1971-72 Session hadconsiderably eased the problem of legislative priorities for thatSession; and it should now be possible for the Government to commit themselves to introduce legislation on local government reform inEngland and Wales in 1971-72. The Ministerial Committee on future Legislation would shortly be beginning their detailed examination of legislative proposals for the 1971-72 Session andwould endeavour to find room for the proposed National health service Bill, although it could not be accorded as high a priorityas the other major Bills indicated in CP (71) 15.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that the JCabinet agreed that there was no objection to the Governmentsannouncing it as their aim to introduce legislation on localgovernment reform in England and Wales during the 1971-72 1Session. The Cabinet would take the remaining decisions on thelegislative programme for the Session when they had received therecommendations of the Future Legislation Committee.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
CM 9 (71)confidential. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Home Department (CP (71) 11)about Local Government Reorganisation, memoranda by theSecretary of State for the Environment (CP (71) 10) and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP (71) 6), covering draft White Papers on the reform of local government in England and Scotland respectively, anda memorandum by the Secretary of State for Wales (CP (71) 7)covering a draft Consultative Document on the reform of localgovernment in Wales.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that,since it appeared that the necessary Bills could now be accommodated within the legislative programme for 1971-72, there was no longer any objection to the references, in the White Paper on localgovernment in England and the Consultative Document, to the government&apos;s intention to introduce legislation on local governmentreform in England and Wales during the 1971-72 Session. Boththe White Papers and the Consultative Document, as amended in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion on 4 February, should now bepublished as soon as practicable. The three Secretaries of state concerned should discuss with the Lord President the timing of publication; and they should consider in particular whether the threedocuments should be published simultaneously or on successive days.There appeared to be no need for their publication to be accompaniedby Ministerial statements.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of Statefor Wales, in consultation with the Lord President, toarrange for publication of the White Papers and the consultative Document as soon as practicable.confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council on the Social Security Bill (CP (71) 14).The Lord President said that the Legislation Committee had recently considered the draft Social Security Bill, which was designed,among other things, to give effect to earlier decisions of the Cabineton the payment of supplementary benefit during and after strikes.
Subject to confirmation by the Cabinet of one point of substance, theBill was ready for introduction. But, although it was well known that legislation dealing with supplementary benefit in relation tostrikes was to be introduced before Easter, there were grounds for believing that its introduction before the end of the Committee stage of the Industrial Relations Bill would give rise to more bittercontroversy than if it were deferred until the Committee. Stage hadbeen completed. On balance he recommended that the introductionof the Bill should be postponed accordingly.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the objectof that part of the Bill which dealt with the payment of supplementary benefit after a strike was to prevent a striker who returned to work from refusing an advance of wages (which was taxable and repayable)in favour of drawing supplementary benefit (which was not taxableand at present not repayable). The draft Bill gave effect to thispurpose. There had been no intention, when the Cabinet consideredthe matter at their meeting on 20 November, 1970, to impose any new restriction on the grounds on which supplementary benefit mightbe paid after a strike. But in order to avoid any uncertainty onthis point which might arise from the earlier Cabinet conclusion theLegislation Committee had thought it right that the Cabinet&apos;authority should be specifically sought for the provision in the draftBill that payments made during the first 15 days after taking up work should be recoverable through the employer.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that jthe Cabinet approved the proposed provision in the Bill about the recovery of supplementary benefit.   They also agreed that theintroduction of the Bill should be deferred to the end of theCommittee Stage of the Industrial Relations Bill.   If there was jpressure for earlier introduction, however, the timing should be 1reconsidered. Public opinion might well be critical of the Bill for not igoing far enough to withdraw from strikers the advantages which thepresent system gave them. In particular, if it was suggested, when jthe Bill was introduced, that the payment of PA YE refunds should jbe deferred and that supplementary benefit paid during a strike Ito strikers&apos; families should be recoverable, it would be important to Jmake it clear that the possibility of introducing legislation on these 1lines at some future time was not excluded.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing Jup of their discussion. I
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications (CP (71) 16) about broadcastingfinance.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had forecast that their deficitwould rise to  49-25 million during the period ending March 1975,even if allowance was made for the increase in licence fees to 6 10s. (monochrome) and  11 10s. (colour) which had been approvedby the previous Administration with effect from 1 April, 1971. the size of the forecast deficit was due largely to the wage settlement ofJuly 1970, which would cost  17 million over the period. In order tomeet this deficit the BBC had originally sought an increase in the basic licence fee to  7 10s.  After discussion with the Corporationhe had concluded that an increase of this order was not necessary;but an increase to  7 would be needed. Savings of the order requiredto meet the forecast deficit could only be found by unacceptablereductions in the quantity or quality of BBC television services.  Asregards the radio services he hoped that it would be possible to abolish BBC Radio 1 in connection with the Governments plans toauthorise commercial radio; and this would leave the accountsapproximately in balance at the end of the five-year period.  Thearguments for abolishing BBC local radio were more evenly balanced;but, if this were also done, there would be a modest surplus.  the bbc had often been accused of extravagant administration; but an examination by management consultants had found little to criticisein this respect.   Moreover, cost comparisons with independent television and with foreign broadcasting companies were generallyfavourable to the Corporation. With the agreement of the ministerial committee on Broadcasting he therefore recommended that theincrease in licence fees due to take effect on 1 April, 1971, should be revoked and that, instead, the fees should be increased to  7(monochrome) and  12 (colour) with effect from 1 &quot;July, 1971.   Adecision was also needed on the future level of the levy charged onthe advertising revenues of independent television programme companies.    The Independent Television Authority (ITA) had originally proposed a reduction by  18-5 million from the current level of some  20 million, i.e. a virtual abolition of the levy.  after discussion, however, they had accepted a reduction to  12 million andhad suggested that some basis for the levy should be sought otherthan a charge on revenue. He recommended that with effect fromthe end of July 1971 the rate of the levy should be changed so asto reduce the yield in a full levy year by  10 million and that duringthe ensuing year the basis of the levy should be reviewed.   He
proposed that the decisions to increase the licence fees and to reducethe levy should be announced to Parliament on the lines indicatedin the draft statement annexed to CP (71) 16.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he had notbeen satisfied that a case for reducing the levy had been made out on purely financial grounds, he was prepared to agree to theproposed reduction in the light of the broader political arguments.He supported the proposed review of the basis of the levy. TheGovernments future attitude to the levy should take account of theextent to which the present concession was used to improve thequality of programmes.In discussion, it was suggested that, if a further increase in thelicence fees was approved, the BBC would be under no serious financial constraint to ensure economy and efficiency. It was arguable that the Corporation should not necessarily seek to cater for the same range of tastes as the commercial broadcasting organisations; they should be concerned particularly with the interestsof minorities, leaving the commercial networks to cater for themajority. In spite of the favourable report of the management consultants, the BBC appeared to be lavishly staffed and themanagement seemed sometimes to be lacking in a proper perceptionof the right objectives. On the other hand, it could be maintained that the BBC had a wider function than simply to cater for minorities.While the inclusion in the financial forecasts of an allowance forfurther cost increases was contrary to normal practice, there wasmerit in settling the matter for five years ahead rather than having to contemplate a further increase fairly soon. It would have been preferable to bring the increase in the licence fee to  7 into operation in April 1971, the date when the previous increase would have become operative. There was now insufficient time, however, to print the new licences and issue them by that date.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the increase in BBC licence fees due to take effect on 1 April, 1971, should be revoked and that, instead, the feesshould be increased to  7 (monochrome) and  12 (colour) with effect from 1 July, 1971. They also agreed that the independent television levy should be reduced by  10 million with effect fromthe end of July 1971 and that there should be a review of the basisof the levy before the end of July 1972. The Minister of Posts and telecommunications should consult with the Lord President of theCouncil about the timing of his proposed statement annexed to cp (71) 16.
