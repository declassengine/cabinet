SubjectOversea AffairsVisits by the Prime Minister to Cyprus, Pakistan,India and MalaysiaCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference
SECRETeesea T/ze Prime Minister, reporting on the visits which he had paid5 to Cyprus, Pakistan, India and Malaysia on his way to the Meetingtsbythe 0f Commonwealth Heads of Government at Singapore in the.me Minister . ,      . ,  ,     .    - , , , .   ..Cyprus,      previous week, said that m Cyprus he had spent much of his time&apos; stan, India with the British Forces and had been greatly impressed by theirjdMalaysia   high quality and morale.   He had also been encouraged by theServices&apos; evident realisation of the concern which the present government felt for their welfare and efficiency.   During the visithe had had discussions with the President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, and had also met the Vice-President, Mr. Kutchuk.   Itwas clear that there had been little movement towards a solutionof the inter-communal problem; and the prospect of any further progress was not bright.  But he had urged both the President andthe Vice-President to use their influence to secure a settlement.  in doing so he had emphasised that neither we nor the othercontributors to the United Nations peace-keeping Force in Cypruscould be expected to accept indefinitely the heavy financial and manpower commitments which our respective contributions entailedif the contending parties made no attempt to settle their differences;and criticism on these lines would be likely to increase if, as waspossible, the United Nations had to assume a commitment for yet another peace-keeping force in connection with the Arab-Israeldispute.Turning to his visit to Pakistan, the Prime Minister said thathis arrival there had unfortunately coincided with anti-Britishdisturbances provoked by the publication in London of a book,originating in the United States, which was allegedly insulting toMuslim beliefs. Nevertheless, he had had full and cordialdiscussions with President Yahya Khan. The latter was anxiousto stabilise the political situation after the recent elections, tointroduce a new constitution and to return to normal forms ofgovernment. But the irresponsibility of the two major parties made it unlikely that this could be achieved in the immediate future.The difficult economic situation in East Pakistan was also causing the President anxiety. He recognised that the remedy for EastPakistani economic problems lay in opening up trade with India;and he was anxious to do so as soon as possible. The Governmentof Pakistan seemed to have lost their initial enthusiasm for theChinese connection and now appeared to be keeping China at arm&apos;slength.In India the Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, had been relaxedand friendly. She expected to win the forthcoming election andhad emphasised her anxiety to obtain greater British investment inSECRET128864-1 a 2
India; indicating that she was willing to make the changes necessar;to attract possible investors. In Malaysia the welcome had been?warm; but there were indications that the political situation wasomewhat unstable. Discussions on the Five-Power defendarrangements had been going well; but relations between malaysia and Singapore appeared to be deteriorating.In general the Prime Minister had been impressed by the warmth1of the bilateral relations between Britain and the four countries!which he had visited. In particular, Anglo-Indian relations appearedto have greatly improved.   There had been little disposition tcdiscuss the South African problem or Commonwealth affair!generally; and he had gained the impression that relations with thecountries concerned were likely to prove more fruitful if they wereconducted on a bilateral basis rather than in a more generalised-Commonwealth context. In all four countries, and also in Singapore;there was a desire, particularly among the Services, for closer linksiwith Britain, together with a certain degree of disillusionment wittlthe links which they had attempted to form with other countries irilan attempt to replace the British connection.   For example, the!Singapore authorities were dissatisfied with their Israeli Service!advisers; they were reducing the strength of the Israeli Service!mission by two-thirds and hoped to replace them by British advisersfThe Cabinet 1.  Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.Commonwealth The Prime Minister said that the atmosphere of the Meeting offcSnrerS81618 Heads of Government at Singapore had been very different from!that of earlier meetings of the same kind. The increase in the number!of Commonwealth members and in the size of individual delegations!had necessitated the use of a very large hall, with microphones for!the speakers and all the other apparatus of a conventional!conference.  This had reinforced the tendency towards set speeches!and formal procedures;  and a number of other Heads offGovernment had shared his own view that the Commonwealth was!in danger of losing its unique character and becoming something!more like a miniature United Nations.   It was only when the!discussions had moved into restricted session that they had regained!a measure of vitality and realism; and it had been significant that,after agreement had been reached in restricted session on the issue]of the British supply of arms to South Africa, certain delegations!had still insisted on reverting to plenary session and making, for!the record, the bitter and provocative speeches which had been^prepared before the restricted meeting and bore little relation to ithe comparatively constructive attitude which many of them had i
then adopted. There had been a widespread feeling that anotherMeeting conducted on these lines might irretrievably damage the concept of the Commonwealth; and the Secretary-General had been instructed to give further consideration to a simplification of the procedures before the next occasion.Predictably, the major part of the discussions had centred onthe question of British arms supplies to South Africa and the relatedquestions of the security of the Indian Ocean and the proposal,put forward by President Kaunda of Zambia, for a declaration of commonwealth principles. The prolonged debate on these subjectshad left little time for other matters of equal, if not greater,importance to the Commonwealth; and the discussions on worldpolitical and economic affairs, on the Commonwealth in the 1970sand on the British approach to the European Economic Community(e.c.) had been disappointingly superficial. Similarly, there hadbeen little opportunity for the bilateral exchanges which normallyformed an important part of any Meeting of Commonwealth Headsof Government, although there had been useful discussions with theGhanaian and Jamaican delegations on their financial and economic problems.The question of the British supply of arms to South Africahad from the outset become linked with consideration of PresidentKaunda&apos;s proposed declaration. On the basis of his draft PresidentKaunda, with the active support of the Presidents of Tanzania and uganda, had sought to commit the member countries of theCommonwealth to use all their resources (including, by implication,force) against regimes practising racial discrimination and to refuseall assistance to them. This had obviously unacceptable implications for our policies towards Rhodesia as well as towards South Africa;and the declaration had represented a clear attempt by the east african Governments to restrict our freedom of action in southern africa. In discussion in restricted session, however, the tone hadbeen rather more restrained; and several countries of the new commonwealth had made a genuine effort to be helpful. But itwas evident that many delegations had failed to appreciate the clear distinction which we drew between the issues of defence policy which we regarded as justifying the supply of arms to SouthAfrica under the Simonstown Agreement and the South african governments policy of apartheid, which we condemned no lessstrongly than other Commonwealth Governments. They were equally ill-informed about the real scope and nature of the new and insidious Soviet threat to the security of the vital sea routesround southern Africa which we believed was developing in theIndian Ocean. After prolonged discussion agreement had beenreached on a wording for the proposed Commonwealth declaration
which we could accept, since it committed each country to no morethan a resolve to combat racialism within its own territorities and left it free to decide, in its own judgment, how far it could denyassistance to other countries which adopted racialist policies. Inaddition, the Nigerian representative had proposed the establishmentof a Commonwealth study group to consider the factors affectingthe security of maritime trade routes in the South Atlantic and IndianOceans; and this proposal also we had been able to accept, subjectto the provisos that we retained our right to take such action as we considered necessary to give effect to our global defence policy,that we were bound, if so requested, to carry out our obligations to the South African Government under the SimonstownAgreements, the nature and extent of which had been explained to the Meeting, and that, having received from the South african government an assurance that they had no aggressive intentions and would not use items of maritime equipment which we suppliedfor purposes other than those for which they had been supplied,we would refuse further supplies if this assurance were breached.These three points had been firmly placed on record: and we hadresisted any attempt to bind us to defer any action in regard to thesupply of arms to South Africa until after the proposed study group had reported.In all, the Meeting had been a trying and, at times, an unpleasantexperience. But we had made some progress towards the objective of establishing Commonwealth relations on a more mature and lessirresponsible basis; and we had retained our freedom of action inregard to South Africa, the security of the Indian Ocean and, by implication, Rhodesia. Moreover, we had gained valuable time inwhich we could work out our policies as regards these importantareas at greater leisure.All these considerations would be reflected in the statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thedetermined and concerted effort by the East African governments to limit our freedom of action had resulted in a difficult anddisagreeable Meeting. But the attempt had failed; and in the longer term the results might be salutary. There was a growing realisationthat Commonwealth Meetings could not continue to be conducted on the basis adopted at Singapore if the Commonwealth was notto go the way of the United Nations. Moreover, some governments had begun to understand that we were confronted with a genuineproblem of security in the Indian Ocean and that our legal&apos; and moral obligations to the South African Government were a veryrelevant factor, which we had to take into consideration.  It was
significant that there had been no attempt to bring pressure to bearon us to abrogate the Simonstown Agreement or to abandon the simonstown base; and, in so far as the criticism of our policies hadpurported to be based on moral grounds, the other members ofthe Commonwealth were beginning to realise that the kind of attack which they had directed against us might one day be turned againtthemselves.In discussion, there was general support for the attitude whichthe Prime Minister proposed to adopt in his Parliamentary statement that afternoon on the outcome of the Singapore Meeting. TheOpposition, who had committed themselves to a number of statements denying that we had any legal obligations under the simonstown Agreement, would certainly seek to challenge the PrimeMinister^ assertion that such obligations were inherent in theAgreement; and it would therefore be advisable to decide in advance the best way of rebutting the Opposition^ argument on this point.The Attorney General said that it could be inferred that theOpposition, when in office, had failed to establish the full extent oftheir legal liability. Not only was there no indication that theirLaw Officers had even submitted formal advice on this issue; butan opinion expressed by the Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeLegal Advisers to the effect that there was no obligation on us tosupply further Wasp helicopters had been based on incompleteinformation. His own advice, based on an exhaustive study of allthe relevant documents (including some which might not have cometo the notice of the previous Administration), was that such an obligation clearly existed.. It was his duty to advise the House ofCommons on points of law; and he was ready to do so. But, inview of the- length arid complexity of the argument involved, itwould be preferable to deploy it in a White Paper, which could also reproduce the supporting documents on which his advice was based.In further discussion, the following points were made (a) The South African Government had agreed, for their part,to the publication of those documents which concerned them.(b) A convincing exposition of our legal obligations mightwell affect the attitude of some Commonwealth countries, e.g,Nigeria, to the issue of the supply of arms to South Africa.(c) Two main questions of timing remained. The firstconcerned the equipment which we were legally obliged to supply.There might be some advantage in seeking to persuade the SouthAfrican Government to defer for a short time a formal request forsuch equipment.  As for equipment which we might think it right
to supply not on legal grounds but in conformity with the generalspirit and purpose of the Simonstown Agreement, the considerations were conflicting. On the one hand, early action might be desirable in order to consolidate the favourable tactical position which wehad achieved as a result of the Singapore Meeting. On the otherhand there might be advantages in allowing time for the legalconsiderations and the realities of the defence situation to become more widely recognised before moving to this further stage.Moreover, the timing of any action in this respect would need tobe considered in relation to the pending decisions on other matters which would affect Commonwealth countries, including the problemof Rhodesia, our approach to the e.c. and the renegotiation of theBasle agreements on sterling balances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, in approving the general lines of his proposed parliamentary statement, agreed that our legal obligation under the simonstown agreement could best be explained to Parliament in a White Paperby the Attorney General; and arrangements should be put in handaccordingly. The timing of our subsequent action required, as thediscussion had shown, very careful consideration; and it wouldbe appropriate for the issues involved to be examined initially bythe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee, on the basis of amemorandum by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion. .(3) Invited the Attorney General, in consultation with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the lord president of the Council, to arrange for the publication,as rapidly as possible, of a White Paper defining theGovernments legal obligations under the simonstown agreement.(4) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,in the light of the points made in their discussion, to circulate to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeea memorandum on the timing of our subsequent action as regards the supply of arms to South Africa.
