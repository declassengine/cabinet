ParliamentaryAffairsRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (71) 58thConclusionsMinute 5*2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (CP (71) 139), to which was attached the text of proposals for a Settlement which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had signed in Rhodesia on the previous day, together witha supplementary note relating the Proposals to the Five Principles.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in thecourse of his recent visit to Salisbury for negotiations with Mr. IanSmith, the Rhodesian leader, he had met more than a hundredindividuals or representatives of organisations, European and African, and had formed the impression that, political extremistsapart, the general desire was for the conclusion of a settlement.  Ithad to be recognised that racial antagonisms had grown sharper inthe years, since the illegal declaration of independence; but all save the extremists regretted this deterioration in relations and appearedgenuinely to believe that a settlement would enable the substantialbut necessarily silent body of moderate opinion to express itselfafresh. The only serious opponent of this view had been Mr. JoshuaNkomo of the Zimbabwe African People&apos;s Union, who had seemedresigned to a further deterioration in relations between the races and to the development in Rhodesia of a political system resemblingapartheid in South Africa before there could be any real hope ofadvancement for Africans.   No one believed that the RhodesianFront regime could be overthrown, although a number of its more extreme members might well desert the Party following a settlement;and the choice before us lay, in effect, between Mr. Smith&apos;s regimewith an agreement or Mr. Smith&apos;s regime with no agreement.  Hewas clear in his own mind that the former would be indisputablythe more beneficial to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.  It wascardinal to any defensible settlement that it should include provisionfor a justiciable Bill of Rights; and this had been secured in full.As tp the time scale for the achievement of parity of representationhe had found Rhodesians, including Africans, in general realistic.The multi-racial Centre Party had stated that they would regardparity: within 30 years as representing an acceptable rate of progress;and he himself judged that it was reasonable to hope for something of this order. The Land Tenure Act, however, was a major obstaclein the. way of African advancement.  It was a successor to earlierlegislation -which had been designed primarily to prevent the wholesale purchase of land by Europeans; and there was no doubtthat such a provision was no less necessary today. But the present act had.two unattractive features.  In the first place it required arigid division of land between the two major races, althoughMr. Smith had assured him that it would be possible to arrangefor additional land to be made available for the African population.There were 3-J million acres allotted to Tribal Trust Lands and a* Previously circulateddfi a Confidential Annex.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
further \\ million to African Purchase Areas which had not yetbeen settled; and there was a possibility of making further landavailable if it was required. Second, some of the subsidiarylegislation made under the Land Tenure Act imposed unwarrantablehardship and discrimination on the non-European sections of thepopulation. Nevertheless, the various provisions which had nowbeen agreed, both in the Declaration of Rights and elsewhere, todeal with the problem of racial discrimination amounted to amarked improvement in the position and prospects of the Africans.Moreover, it had to be accepted that the removal of the Land TenureAct in toto would be liable to provoke a reaction in Rhodesiansociety which might prove disastrous. In addition to provisions to review existing discriminatory legislation and to prevent theextension of such legislation, other major improvements which hadbeen secured in negotiation with the Rhodesians included the repeal of the income tax regulator, which governed the rate of^enfranchisement under the 1961 Constitution; the incorporation ofexpressed and entrenched provision for progress from parity of representation to majority rule; and the establishment of effective machinery to block retrogressive legislation. Critics of the Proposalsfor a Settlement might argue that no agreement made with theexisting illegal regime would be kept. In practice, however, wehad no real choice in the matter of our interlocutors. It was, ofcourse, possible to identify various respects in which the settlementfell short of the ideal. But he was convinced that the present proposals represented the best settlement which could be made from the British point of view as well as from that of the Rhodesiansas a whole; and that if, as he believed, it was possible to conclude asettlement on this basis, the question whether to do so should atleast be referred to the people of Rhodesia, as was now envisaged by holding a test of acceptability under the Fifth Principle.In discussion it was agreed that the improvements to theProposals for a Settlement which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had achieved during his visit to Salisbury were remarkable.It was further agreed that it would be right to put the proposalsnow agreed with Mr. Ian Smith to the people of Rhodesia. the test of Acceptability would be of the greatest importance; and itwas essential that membership of the Commission which would beresponsible for conducting this operation should be such as to command respect not only in this country but abroad. If the testwas rigorously and painstakingly carried out, it would establishwhether there was a genuine desire to set Rhodesia on a new coursetowards the peaceful co-existence of the different races; and it wouldalso rebut criticism of the settlement based on the argument that therights and aspirations of the Africans had been disregarded. It was recognised that, given the complexity of the factors involved, itwould be unwise, if not impossible, to say with certainty when parity of representation or majority rule would be reached. The expectedrapid development of the economy, to which it was hoped thatBritish aid would contribute, would have a useful effect in thisconnection.   It was noted that a satisfactory assurance on the
acceptance by the Rhodesian regime of their liability for outstandingdebts could be expected and that the Rhodesians had agreed toprovide matching funds equal to 100 per cent of our developmentaid so long as it was provided in grant form. If it was decided thataid would have to be provided partly in the form of loans, the rhodesian matching contribution would be reduced.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary deserved the warmest thanksand congratulations of his colleagues. The Cabinet agreed that theProposals for a Settlement which he had agreed with Mr. Smithcould be endorsed and commended to Parliament and the country.They also agreed that it would be right to refer these proposals tothe people of Rhodesia; and they were concerned to emphasise the critical importance of appropriate arrangements for an early andconvincing Test of Acceptability. Meanwhile, it would be important that in public statements Ministers should adhere closely to the text of the proposals as now agreed and, in particular, should eschewspeculation about the time scale for the achievement of parity.&apos; ! The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing upof their discussion.Cabinet Office,26 November, 1971.
