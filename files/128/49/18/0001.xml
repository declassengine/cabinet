CM 18 (71)SECRET*1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (CP (71) 41) on the negotiations on the RB 211project, and a note by officials (CP (71) 40) providing factualbackground.The Secretary of State for Defence said that in the course ofthe meetings which he and the Attorney-General held in washington on 25 March, 1971, with the Lockheed aircraft corporation he had offered a price for 646 engines such as to producereceipts of  80 million over and above those arising under the oldcontract. Lockheed had made a counter offer which amounted onthe same basis to an additional  50 million or  60 million. He was satisfied that this represented Lockheed&apos;s final offer, both becausethey did not have the resources to offer more and because a further increase in engine price would leave the TriStar uncompetitive withits competitor, the Douglas DC 10.They had discussed the question of warranty with the UnitedStates, Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Connally, and the UnitedStates Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Packard. It had become evident that it was not in Lockheed&apos;s power to guaranteeperformance of the contract on their side, and that there was no way of securing a warranty for reimbursement of money committed by the United Kingdom Government to the RB211 if Lockheedsubsequently failed. However, the United States Administration had concluded that in any event the TriStar project could not becontinued without United States Government help. Mr. Connallyand Mr. Packard had therefore indicated that if the Administrationcould satisfy themselves, by their own examination of Lockheed&apos;position, that the company and the project were viable they wouldbe prepared to:(a) put pressure on the United States banks to increase theircredit to Lockheed from $350 million to $500 million;(b) seek the authority of Congress for a Government loan of$300 million.Any new agreement between Lockheed and Rolls-Royce andthe British Government could safely be expressed as conditional upon the satisfactory completion of these financial arrangements bythe United States Administration. Thus, there would be no risk ofour commitment to the continuation of the RB 211 unless the UnitedStates Administration was satisfied as to the TriStar&apos;s future and* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
I&apos; tprovided the additional finance required for it.  Mr. Connally had i thought that the Administration could complete their investigation %of Lockheed&apos;s viability within about 10 days.   If they were not satisfied that would be the end of the matter. If they were satisfied!and approached Congress, it should be a further 30 or 40 days beforeCongress&apos; decision was known, or, at the outside, not more than90 days.There were a number of ancillary issues which would have to besettled before the final terms of a contract could be agreed betweenLockheed and Rolls-Royce: the programme for achieving higherlevels of thrust, the renunciation of claims under the old contract,the status of the deposits lodged with the old Rolls-Royce, thearrangements for financing a new contract and the question ofJcover by the Export Credits Guarantee Department.   The latest!reports from Washington indicated that Lockheed were no longer!insisting that an order for the TriStar from British European Airways f(BE A) was a precondition for any agreement but that they continued Ito empTiasise the importance of BEA&apos;s attitude in maintaining the!credibility of the project.The Secretary of State recommended that, on the understanding!that these subsidiary points could be satisfactorily resolved, weishould accept Lockheed&apos;s final offer on engine price, subject tolbeing satisfied by the financial arrangements promised by the United!States Administration. The latter had made a generous proposal!which should not be rebuffed.The Attorney-General said that although the negotiations had!not resulted in anything of the nature of a legal warranty, the 1assurance we should get from the proposals put forward bylMr. Connally and Mr. Packard would be more effective than any!commercial warranty in securing the objective that we should not!invest further sums in the RB 211 only to find the project frustrated!by Lockheed&apos;s own financial failure. The United States Govern-iment would become directly involved in seeking to ensure the!success of the TriStar as a result of their commitment to the United!Kingdom Government. MIn discussion, attention was drawn to the extent by which ourademands had been relaxed since the negotiations with Lockheed &apos;kstarted. We had begun by offering no more than  60 million towards Ifurther development of the engine. We were now prepared to meet Jall development costs, amounting to at least  100 million. Whenf!Lockheed rejected the suggestion of a profit-sharing joint venture;;!we had asked a price for the engines calculated to meet ihefestimated costs of production, and more recently had authorised anaoffer (of a price returning  80 million over and above receipts underl!the old contract) in the knowledge that on the most favourable!
assumptions it would involve some production loss. To indicatewillingness to settle now at Lockheed&apos;s offer of an additional 50-60 million would involve a loss on production of about 30-40 million. Moreover, there could be no assurance that thiswould be the end of our retreat. If we reached a conditionalagreement on price with Lockheed on the basis proposed we might subsequently be faced with other unacceptable terms in the context of the peripheral points. In each case, the argument would nodoubt be advanced that the point was marginal, and that we shouldbe putting ourselves presentationally in the wrong if the negotiations were allowed to founder on it. Mr. Connally&apos;s assessment that theperiod of uncertainty as to whether Congress would approve furthercredit to Lockheed might be as long as 90 days was alarming.Throughout that period, we should have to finance the continuation of work on the RB 211 at a rate of some  2 million a week. If, atthe end of the day, Congress turned the Administration^ propositiondown, all this expenditure would be wasted. If Congress endorsed the proposition, we should find ourselves committed to Lockheedand to the expenditure of massive sums over the next few years which would limit the amount available for other desirable public expenditure programmes. The offer by the United states administration was one which reduced the cost at our expense of maintaining in business a company whose survival was probablyregarded as essential for United States Defence. There could be no assurance that Congress would decide within three months whetheror not to provide the funds requested: we might well be faced witha refusal from Congress after we had supported the project for many months. On the other hand, it was argued that an economic cost would also be imposed by a decision to discontinue the RB211,although it could not easily be quantified. The United states administration^ proposals meant that we need not commit ourselves to the RB 211/TriStar project until we had the best possibleassurance that Lockheed would be capable of carrying the projectthrough. But, in any event, if the Government were to break atthis point over a matter of  20 million or  30 million it would adversely affect relations with the United States Administration andwould leave the Government vulnerable to severe criticism.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that if theGovernment had been considering this project at this stage without prior involvement by the previous Administration there would be no case for supporting it. However, in the light of the offer made bythe United States Administration, rejection of Lockheed&apos;s latestoffer would have serious consequences. In view of the international and political implications of withdrawing now, there was no
practicable alternative to proceeding on the basis recommended bythe Secretary of State for Defence-that is to say, indicating thatwe should be prepared to settle with Lockheed for a price returning 50-60 million more than the old contract, provided that the UnitedStates Government first satisfied themselves of Lockheed&apos;s and theTriStar&apos;s viability and then ensured, on the&apos; basis proposed byMr. Connally, that the necessary finance was available to complete the project.  In addition, no further concession of any kind must bemade in relation to the ancillary issues, and no further commitmentsmust be undertaken.   In particular, it must be made clear toLockheed that BEA would be put under no Government pressure ;to order the TriStar and there must be no commitment that theGovernment would finance the development of the engine beyond42,000 lb. thrust. The public handling of this decision would require Icareful consideration, since it was essential that the United States jGovernmenfs involvement should be made public at the same time \as Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs willingness to reduce the price of 1the engines. Since time was short, the best course would be for the secretary of State for Defence to instruct our Ambassador in IWashington to clear with the United States Administration a formula jto be used publicly for this purpose.   The statement should 1subsequently   be   agreed   between   the   Ministers   principally Jconcerned the Lord President, the Secretary of State for Trade and industry, the Minister of Aviation Supply and the Chief Secretary, ITreasury.  When clearance had been obtained for the formula, our inegotiators in Washington should be instructed to inform the JChairman of Lockheeds of our terms: but this should be delayed, Iif possible, until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had completed his jBudget statement on 30 March.   Our negotiators should make it 1clear to the United States Administration and to Lockheeds that 1we could offer no further financial concessions.   They must also Iensure that a reasonable term was set to the period for obtaining 1Congressional authority for financial assistance.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministefs summing M.P of their discussion. 1(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence (i) to   be   guided   accordingly   in   instructing  our jAmbassador and negotiators in Washington;(ii) to consult the Lord President of the Council and Ithe other Ministers principally concerned about ithe terms of any public statement to be used by jthe Government when news of our conditional flacceptance of Lockheed&apos;s offer became public.
CM 18 (71)secret. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet conclusions.Cabinet Office,29 March, 1971.
