Non-industrial civil ServicePayPreviousReference:GM (71) 24thConclusions,Minute 6CM 28 (71)SECRET*1.   The Lord Privy Seal said that some 300,000 non-industrial civil servants were due to receive, with effect from 1 January, 1971,pay adjustments based on the pay research procedure. The principleof settling the pay of the Civil Service by fair comparison withsalaries  being paid for comparable work in other fields  ofemployment, as determined by pay research, had been endorsed by successive Governments; and in March 1971 the National Staff Sidehad been given an assurance (in the terms indicated in Annex A toa memorandum which was circulated during the Cabinefs discussion)that the Government would continue to observe these principles and procedures. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay negotiations had accepted that the Government must honour that assurance andhad concluded that, on the basis of interpreting the pay researchevidence as stringently as was possible, the minimum offers that could be made consistently with the Governmenfs undertaking were an average increase of 11-7 per cent for the Clerical grades and-75 per cent for the Administrative / Executive grades.  There was some chance of negotiating a settlement with the Clerical grades at11-7 per cent.   But the Administrative/Executive grades would almost certainly reject an offer of 8-75 per cent, which would entail,an increase of at most 5 per cent for considerable numbers of executive staff; and they would be able to make out a good caseat arbitration for substantially higher increases.   The minimumoffers consistent with the undertaking, however, were themselves% per cent below the figures which officials of his Department, theTreasury and the Department of Employment agreed to be areasonable but stringent interpretation of the pay research evidence.He therefore sought negotiating authority to seek a settlement at upto 9-25 per cent for the Administrative/Executive grades in orderto avoid the risk of a higher award at arbitration.  Presentationally,there was little to choose between 8-75 per cent and 9-25 per cent.If it proved impossible to secure a negotiated settlement on the basisof offers of 9-25 per cent for the Administrative/Executive gradesand 11-7 per cent for the Clerical grades he would consult hiscolleagues again before proceeding to arbitration.The presentation of a settlement would be of great importance;and it would be important to take the initiative by issuing, at theproper time, a Press announcement on the lines of the draft at annex B of the memorandum. This emphasised that the proposed increases did no more than reflect changes which had taken place inoutside pay rates since 1 January, 1968; since then the Civil service staff concerned had received only interim increases amounting toabout 14 per cent, by comparison with an advance of nearly 30 percent in the wages index over the three-year period.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET133000-1
In discussion it was suggested that, since the pay research!findings could be argued to be open to widely varying interpretations!the initial offers should be pitched rather lower than the Lord PriyjiSeal had suggested, in the knowledge that this would force the Staff!Side to arbitration. Although arbitration could result in highersawards than the Government would welcome, that might nevertheless be preferable to volunteering offers at the proposed levels, whicajcould be argued to be inconsistent with the Governments declare!!intention to effect progressive reductions in the levels of pi.settlements. On the other hand the offers recommended by thj9Lord Privy Seal were based on a stringent interpretation of the pay!research evidence; and the Government could not conscientiously!decline to negotiate seriously up to these levels. While it would Wmpossible, under well-understood conventions, to make lower &quot;openoffers &quot; for the purpose of arbitration once negotiations had brokerSdown, failure to negotiate in good faith on the basis of the paj &apos;research evidence would be a clear breach of the undertaking gives!to the National Staff Side only two months previously.In further discussion the following main points were made :(a) The wide differences between the conditions of servicienjoyed by civil servants and those in other fields of employmentmade a direct comparison of pay misleading. Although thiGovernment could not now abandon the principles of the Priestleireport for settling Civil Service pay, which they had so recently!endorsed, they ought not to be committed to them in the futurejgOn the other hand previous examination of the issues involved hadjfailed to reveal any other satisfactory basis for determining CivlService pay: the more obvious alternatives would in any event havl!been likely to produce even less acceptable results at the present!juncture than the findings of pay research. The Government shoulfltherefore adhere to the principle of fair comparison, even though Mmight well be right after the forthcoming negotiations to re-examinljpossibly with the help of an appropriate outside body, the mannellin which this principle was applied in terms of the existing method^of conducting pay research and of analysing its findings. 9(b) The negotiations would be taking place at a critical momemjust before the opening of a new round of annual pay claims, illwhich it was hoped that increases in the public sector could hagenerally limited to perhaps 7^-8-J per cent. Both the locapauthorities and the nationalised industries would be concerned tjfobserve how rigorously the Government dealt with the claim bjtheir own employees; even in the later stages of the current annulround of negotiations, the Government had urged other public sectolemployers to restrict pay offers to comparable staffs to about 9 picent. Nevertheless, the Government were bound by their undertakinjto the National Staff Side to pay serious regard to the findingspay research; and the Civil Service was merely following ratf
already being paid for analogous work elsewhere. It could bedempnstrated that the increases proposed did no more than restoreCivil Service rates to a proper relationship with those in comparableoccupations.(c) At annual conferences of the Civil Service Staff Associationsindustrial action, such as the banning of overtime, had beenthreatened in retaliation for the Governmenfs alleged delay inopening negotiations. If these threats were implemented and the goodwill of the staffs was lost, the work necessary in connection withthe uprating of social security benefits and the programme of taxreforms announced in the Budget would be jeopardised. these considerations, however, should not be allowed to influence the government&apos;s decision, since the present system of determiningCivil Service pay rested on the presumption that the Civil Servicedid not resort to industrial action in furtherance of pay settlements.If the Government proposed to maintain their commitments to thePriestley system, they could properly expect that the staffs for their part would also continue to observe the basis on which that systemrested.(d) If a negotiated settlement was considered preferable to arbitration, it would be reasonable to allow the negotiators thelatitude to go to 9-25 per cent instead of 8-75 per cent for theAdministrative/Executive grades, as proposed by the Lord privy seal.; ; &apos;\The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government must honour the clearundertaking given to the National Staff Side in March and that itcould not reasonably be claimed that circumstances had changed since that date. They accepted that it was desirable for the lord privy Seal to seek a negotiated settlement on the basis of a stringentinterpretation of the pay research evidence; he would accordinglyhave authority to offer 11-7 per cent for the Clerical grades and upto 9-25 per cent for the Administrative /Executive grades. TheCabinet also accepted that the commitment to determine CivilService pay on the basis of fair comparisons, as prescribed in thePriestley report and endorsed by successive Governments, must continue in the absence of any satisfactory alternative. After thepresent negotiations were completed, however, the Lord Privy Sealshould arrange for the existing methods of conducting pay research and analysing its results to be reappraised, possibly with the help ofan independent body; but no reference should be made to this inthe negotiations. The draft Press announcement annexed to theLord Privy Seal&apos;s memorandum should be revised in consultationwith the Lord President and the Prime Minister^ Press Office, inorder to convey more clearly and simply that the proposed awardsto the Civil Service would do no more than bring the grades in
question up to the levels which pay research had shown that their;!analogues in other fields of employment were already receiving.The Lord Privy Seal should also arrange for the Official Side,negotiators to keep closely in touch with the Prime Minister^ PressOffice in order that the Government might retain the initiative asregards the public presentation of a settlement or a breakdown inthe negotiations.The Cabinet-1Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing;up of their discussion and invited the Lord Privy Seal tobe guided accordingly.SECRET*2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that, in response to an appeal made at our suggestion by president Allende of Chile to the Tupamaros guerillas to releaseHM Ambassador in Montevideo, Mr. Jackson, the Tupamaros had told HM  Ambassador in  Santiago that they would releaseMr. Jackson on payment by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of a secretransom of 1 million dollars.  In addition, they demanded publicity in the Uruguayan Parliament and Press for President Allende&apos;s appeal and their own response, together with the payment of  10,000to a charity in Uruguay.  Meanwhile a Mr. 0&apos;Shaughnessy, of theFinancial Times, having learned of the Tupamaros&apos; offer, was trying1to raise the 1 million dollars ransom from private sources in theUnited Kingdom. He was being discouraged from proceeding withthis project, since, if he succeeded, the payment of the ransom might become known and could well be attributed to the Government;!and a surrender to the demands of the kidnappers would be liable!to aggravate the risk that episodes of this kind would recur with increasing frequency.   It would therefore be right that we should;refuse any offer for the release of Mr. Jackson involving payment of;a ransom by the Government and that we should continue to seek to dissuade Mr. 0&apos;Shaughnessy from trying to raise the necessary funds by voluntary subscription.Meanwhile, no communication had been received from those;who had kidnapped Mr. Sylvester, the Honorary British Consul inRosario, Argentina, beyond the news that he was well. We had;expressed our concern to the Argentine Government.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Foreign and Common^wealth Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office,25 May, 1971.* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex.SECRETOverseaAffairsKidnapping ofthe BritishAmbassadorin Montevideoand a british consul inArgentinaPreviousReference:CM (71) 17thConclusions,Minute 2   *
