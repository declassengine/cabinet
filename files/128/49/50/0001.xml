The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP (71) 103), on the 1971 public expenditurereview. They also had before them memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Defence on the defence budget (CP (71) 107 and 113) anda memorandum on the public expenditure review by the central policy Review Staff (CP (71) 108).\The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that at their meetings on29 June and 22 July the Cabinet had decided as a matter of policy to establish for annual public expenditure the totals set out in cp (71) 103 and had invited him to arrange for an interdepartmentalstudy of the means by which the outstanding proposals for additional public expenditure could be matched by reductions. He had alsobeen asked to deal in this study with the problem of the aid programme and to take account of the possible need for further savings both to offset increased steel investment and to replace savingspreviously assumed from cost-related prescription charges. officials had now completed the study and had identified net reductionssufficient to cover the proposals for additional expenditure on health,education, legal aid and voluntary social service. If, however, the outstanding proposals for overseas aid, defence and steel investment,together with the recent proposal for a regional development agency,were also accepted, total public expenditure would exceed the annualtarget figures by amounts rising to  254 million by 1975-76.As regards overseas aid, the Cabinet had already accepted thatthe programme should not be adjusted with each revised forecast of gross national product (GNP); but they had also been concerned about the likely fall in the proportion of GNP represented by the planned figure for 1972-73. In order to avoid such a fall anadditional  9 million would be needed in that year. For 1975-76, hehad already proposed an extra  8 million.As regards defence, the Cabinet had approved at their last meeting increases in the defence budget totals for the years 1972-73to 1974-75. This would accommodate the additional expenditureof  70 million which had recently been authorised for ships. Moreadditional proposals for defence expenditure, such as the extra 105 million sought for 1975-76, could not be accommodated without seeking further offsetting reductions in other programmes; and thisraised a major issue of Government priorities.The general problem of containing public expenditure would alsobe eased if the Government were to revert, as soon as price restraintallowed, to the policies on charging for public services announced inthe White Paper &quot; New Policies for Public Spending &quot; (Cmnd 4515).The Cabinet might therefore wish to resume their previous discussionof prescription charges, which they considered on 15 July, and also toconsider moving towards the objective in Cmnd 4515 of covering the running cost of school meals.As regards steel investment, the estimates had again been revised;but they were still provisional. There were also uncertainties in the forecasts of housing investment.
As a result of these factors total public expenditure seemed likely to be somewhat above the target annual totals, while the medium-term economic prospect appeared marginally, but not significantly, less difficult. In the circumstances he did not feel it necessary to ask the Cabinet to consider major policy changes atthe present stage in order to meet the possible additional expenditureon steel investment. Such changes would be required, however, if further substantial additions to public expenditure were contemplated; and even without such additions there would be even greater need to secure savings and to restrict demands on the contingency reserve to the inescapable minimum. There would also need to be a separate study of possible rephasing of programmes inorder to provide more room for manoeuvre in 1973-74. With theseprovisos, he recommended that the proposals for health, education,legal aid and voluntary social service should now be accepted as setout in Table 1 of the Annex to CP (71) 103; that the additional provision for overseas aid should be limited to the amounts whichhe had proposed; that the outstanding additional proposals for defence should be rejected; that no offsetting savings should besought at this stage for steel investment; but that the Cabinet should examine the possibility of increasing charges as envisaged in cmnd 4515.Defence The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was seriouslyPrevious        concerned about the suggestion that the proposed additionalReference:      expenditure of  105 million on defence in 1975-76 should become (71) 49th   rejected.   It was proving increasingly difficult to reconcile theConclusions,    defence objectives of the Government published in the Supple-Minute?        mentary Statement on Defence Policy in October 1970 (Cmnd. 4521)with the financial targets for the years 1971-72 to 1974-75 whichhad been agreed and published at that time.   In order to meetchanges required for urgent operational reasons and to offsetincreased forecasts of the cost of new classes of ships, he had already&apos;&apos;    pruned the long-term costings for new equipment and works        programmes for those years by more than  300 million.   He wasnot now seeking, on defence grounds, any increase in the amountsfor those years which had been approved by the Cabinet at their last meeting; but additional provision might be necessary later inorder to meet unforeseen requirements in Northern Ireland and malta or an expansion of recruitment beyond present expectations.He had also circulated in CP (71) 113 proposals for possibleadditional expenditure on defence which the Cabinet might wishto consider primarily by reference to the contribution which theymight make to the relief of unemployment.    The proposedadditional expenditure on Buccaneer aircraft was small; and he was prepared to finance it from within the defence budget.  He hopedthat the Cabinet would also agree that officials should continue to study the possibility  of some modest  extra expenditure for. exploratory development in areas of high technology. The suggestedadditional expenditure on Nimrod aircraft and on the acceleration of orders for Army vehicles should be assessed in the light of theemployment which it might generate, although the proposed order for Nimrod aircraft would have the additional advantage of
avoiding a break in the production line and might thus place the manufacturers in a more favourable position in relation to potentialfuture export orders. As regards 1975-76, the defence budget totalproposed by the Treasury, which had been put forward before the costings had been completed, took insufficient account of theconsequences of carrying out a more effective defence policy thanthat of the previous Administration. To keep expenditure withinthe total proposed would require still further reductions in the equipment programme and in the capability of the Services. Insome critical areas it was now doubtful whether the defence programme was sufficient to sustain the healthy industrial basewhich was essential to future defence procurement. The Treasuryproposal would also imply both a reduction in the proportion of gnp spent on defence and a fall in the actual amount spent on defence, at constant prices, between the years 1971-72 and 1975-76,compared with the substantial increases planned for some civilprogrammes. This would be evident from the published figures and would be bound to cause considerable concern to our allies., In discussion of the suggested additional defence expenditure to relieve unemployment it was pointed out that the additions to public expenditure up to 1973-74 which had already been approved hadabsorbed the savings recorded for those years in the public expenditure review of 1970 and that this would be evident when thenext public expenditure White Paper was published later in the year.Hitherto, the general reflationary measures initiated by theGovernment had taken the form mainly of reductions in taxation;and additions to public expenditure for reflationary purposes hadbeen restricted to the assisted areas and had also been limited, asfar as practicable, to the period up to 1972-73. Even if it werejudged necessary that public expenditure should be further increased in order to encourage a revival of demand, it was questionable whether defence was the most appropriate category of expenditure for this purpose. The Nimrod aircraft, for example, were not included in the defence long-term costings and therefore did nothave priority on defence grounds. But they would be equallyunjustified on employment grounds, given that most of the additional employment would be outside the development areas. more generally, there were many other competing claims for expenditure,for example on regional policy and retraining, which might have abetter claim for consideration.On the other hand, the preservation of continuity in theproduction of defence equipment which might have an exportpotential was also important. Nimrod aircraft might be of interestto a number of countries, including Canada, South Africa and australia. The present proposal emphasised the importance of early consideration by Ministers of the outcome of the study at present being carried out by officials into the future of the aerospaceindustry. A decision on the purchase of Nimrod aircraft could notbe taken, however, until further information was available aboutthe point at which the production line would otherwise have to cometo an end. In view of the employment forecasts which the cabinet had recently been considering in another context, consideration
should be given to the steps which might be taken to stimulateemployment generally. Such a study, however, should extend more widely than the defence-based industries and the construction industry, which had hitherto tended to be regarded as the most appropriate instruments for varying expenditure programmes for economic reasons. Consideration might also be given, for example,to bringing forward orders for electricity generating equipment andto the possibility of obtaining for our industry a better share of workarising from collaborative projects with other countries.. In  discussion  of  the  longer-term  prospects   for  defence expenditure it was emphasised that the Government were publicly1 committed to maintain an adequate defence capability. It was also important to encourage industries concerned with advanced technology, which might be adversely affected by a too rigorouslimitation of defence expenditure.  On the other hand, the Central- - Policy Review Staff had drawn attention in CP (71) 108 to the risk that the reduction of taxation, which was one of the Governmentsmajor objectives, would be endangered by approving totals of public expenditure in excess of the capacity of the economy. Some riskwould be involved even in the amounts recommended by the chief secretary, Treasury, in CP (71) 103. Moreover, if our allies were likely to press us to increase our defence effort, it would be prudent to anticipate this pressure by keeping some room for futuremanoeuvre. If we became publicly committed now to a level of, defence expenditure in 1975-76 which proved to impose an undue; burden on the economy, there would be great political andpresentational difficulties in subsequently reducing it. In any case,the estimates in the public expenditure White Paper for the finaltwo years of the review period were acknowledged to be less precisethan those for the earlier years. It might be possible to deal withthe immediate problem, therefore, by indicating specifically that the forecast for defence in 1975-76 was provisional and was subject to subsequent reappraisal. Before the amount to be published was finally decided, however, it would be relevant to ascertain to what extent the proposed additional provision was necessary in order toenable orders to be placed in the immediate future.&apos;\ The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,i said that the Cabinet noted that the Secretary of State for defence was not now seeking, on defence grounds, additions to the defence budget for the years up to 1974-75 beyond those already approvedby the Cabinet. They also noted that he might need to proposeadditional expenditure later in respect of Northern Ireland, Maltaor increased recruitment. As regards the proposals in CP (71) 113,the Cabinet agreed that officials should continue to study thepossibility of modest extra expenditure for exploratory development in areas of advanced technology; and they noted that the Secretaryof\ State for Defence did not ask for any increase in the defence budget to finance the suggested additional expenditure on buccaneer aircraft. Before a decision was taken on the other proposals in thismemorandum additional information was required about theprospects for continuity of production of, and possible export ordersfor, Nimrod aircraft. Consideration should also be given to possible
additional expenditure in civil expenditure programmes, such as theelectricity investment programme, which might serve to relieve unemployment by taking up under-used industrial capacity. Asregards the defence budget for 1975-76, any amount agreed and published at the present stage could only be provisional and subjectto the reappraisal which was already in progress. The Secretary ofState for Defence should therefore arrange for officials to examinehow far a decision now on the defence burget total for 1975-76would materially affect the placing of orders in the immediate future.When this information was available he should consider further,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the amountto be published for 1975-76 in the public expenditure White paper and the manner in which the provisional nature of this sum could best be indicated.:   The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretaries of State for Defence and for Tradeand Industry and the other Ministers concerned, to,,, arrange for officials to carry out a fuller examination,from the standpoint of the effect on the various industries concerned, of the proposals in paragraph 2 (a) and 2 (c)of CP (71) 113 and of other possible proposals for additional expenditure in civil programmes which might take up under-used industrial capacity; and to make recommendations accordingly.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to arrange for officials to continue their study of the possible benefits to be obtained from increased defence expenditure on development in areas of advanced technology.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to reappraise theconsequences for our defence capability and for thedefence-based industries  of the alternative amounts&apos; which had been proposed to the Cabinet for defence expenditure in 1975-76; and to examine, on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up, themanner in which forward estimates of defence expendi-ture in that year might best be publicly presented in themeantime.In discussion of the proposals in CP (71) 103 on the civil expenditure programmes the following main points were made &apos; (a) It was agreed that, in order to avoid a decline in theproportion of GNP assigned to the aid programme in 1972-73, 9 million (at constant 1971 survey prices) should be added to theprogramme for that year. It was also agreed that  8 million shouldbe added to the programme for 1975-76.
(b) The outcome of the study on steel investment was stillawaited. While the present expenditure provision might prove tobe inadequate, the forecasts were still tentative and provisional; andit therefore seemed wise to leave the matter in abeyance for the timebeing, even though this involved some risk that additional provisionmight be required later.(c) The additional provision for the legal aid programme would suffice to enable the Lord Chancellor to implement the scheme proposed by the Law Society to provide legal advice and assistanceto people of modest means.(d) Approval of the proposed additional provision for voluntarysocial service would enable the Government, at small cost, to takea useful initiative in this field. The Lord Privy Seal would submit to the Home and Social Affairs Committee his proposals for implementing this initiative and for ensuring appropriate public presentation for it.(e) The Secretary of State for Social Services would shortlycirculate to the Cabinet further proposals about prescription charges,&quot;which might go some way to remedy the deficiency resulting fromthe abandonment of cost-related charges. Any announcement ofthe abandonment of cost-related charges would be better deferred until these proposals had been considered.(/) A substantial increase in the charge for school meals hasrecently been made. It seemed difficult to contemplate bringing forward the date of the next increase; but further consideration might be given to its amount. There was always the possibility,however, that, if local authorities disagreed with the governments proposals, they could reintroduce an element of subsidy themselves by using their power to apply the product of a Id rate to general purposes. The treatment of this power in the legislation to reorganise local government in England and Wales was at present being reconsidered in the light of discussion in the Home and social affairs Committee.(g) Although the Cabinet had reviewed all the proposals for additional expenditure which had been put forward in the context of the public expenditure review, there was a possibility that further proposals might need to be considered later in order to implementnew developments in regional policy, particularly when the regional employment Premium came to an end. Further proposals might also be necessary to implement the Governments Election commit-ment on industrial retraining.The Cabinet-(5) Approved recommendations 1, 2 and 4 of CP (71) 103.(6) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to bring before the Home and social Affairs Committee proposals for the implement a-tion and public presentation of the proposed new initiative on voluntary social service.
(7) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, to circulate to the Cabinet his further proposals regardingprescription charges.(8) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, toexamine what further steps might be taken to implement the objective set out in Cmnd. 4515 of covering the running cost of school meals; and to bring forwardrecommendations to the Cabinet.the queen&apos;sSpeecheson theProrogationand on theOpening ofParliamentSECRET2. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(71) 111 and 112), to which were annexeddrafts ;bf The Queen&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and on theOpening of Parliament.The Cabinet considered the draft Speeches paragraph by paragraph.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the drafts, subject to the various amendments which had been suggested.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.UpperClydeShipbuildersPreviousReference:CM (71) 49thConclusions,Minute 5SECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 114) bythe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about Upper ClydeShipbuilders (UCS).The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, sincethe Cabinet had last discussed UCS, he had met Mr. McGarvey ofthe Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU)and had informed him of the Government^ willingness to enter into negotiations with shipowners about the conditions on which theywould confirm their orders provided that the unions gave acceptableand public assurances of co-operation with Govan Shipbuilders Ltd.and of meaningful negotiations on working practices and wage rates.The joint statement annexed to CP (71) 114, which had been issuedas a result of the meeting, had been subsequently approved by the shipbuilding Committee of the CSEU and had been endorsed, onthe recommendation of the shop stewards, at a mass meeting ofworkers, although with some reservations.   The statement had
provided public assurances of the kind which he had requested but had also reiterated that the unions&apos; principal objective was to preserve employment in all four UCS yards. The Minister for industry had in the meantime discussed with Irish Shipping Ltd. theconditions which they had earlier laid down for maintaining their orders for ships. Although they had made some small concessions,they would not increase the original contract price; and they stillrequired a refund guarantee in respect of all payments on their four ships after liquidation together with their pre-liquidation paymentof  320,000, which was covered by a bank advance. Negotiationswith the other shipowners concerned, the Brazilian Government,had also begun.Unfortunately, there was still some doubt about the realintentions of the shop stewards; and there was a risk that, once the guarantees had been given to the shipowners, they might withdraw their support from the agreement with the CSEU officials. On theother hand the undertaking from the CSEU went further than hadbeen hoped for in giving an assurance that the work force would contribute to the timely and efficient delivery of the ships.Moreover, Govan Shipbuilders Ltd. was now in existence; and theGovernment had been able to make clear the responsibility of theunions in relation to its future. In these circumstances, and bearing that mind that the actual financial commitment of the Governmentin: the event of failure to complete the ships was likely to be much less than the total contingent liability of  15- 20 million, he feltjustified in asking the Cabinet to agree that he should enter intoarrangements with the shipowners on the lines indicated in hisearlier memorandum CP (71) 109. It was also urgently necessaryto provide the Liquidator with further working capital. Subject tohis colleagues&apos; agreement to these proposals, he proposed to make an early statement to the House of Commons, describing the latest developments and the action now envisaged and refuting recentassertions that, if UCS had been allowed to continue, it would by now have been making a profit.In discussion, there was general agreement that the Secretaryof State should proceed on the basis which he proposed. There was some hope that the shop stewards were coming to realise that theycould not be certain of the continued support of the workers, manyof whom now understood that the choice was in fact between the closure of all four yards and the preservation of a substantial proportion of the jobs under the Governments proposals. In theinterests of the Governments employment and industrial relationspolicies generally, the shop stewards could not be allowed to dictateterms to the Government; and, if they proved unreasonable in thenegotiations which lay ahead it would be better to pay compensation to the shipowners than to allow the shop stewards to dictate terms.When the Secretary of State made his Parliamentary statement heshould make clear why it would not have been more practical and economical to keep UCS in being; and he would need to beprepared to deal with questions about the future of the Clydebankyard. There was still some possibility of its sale to an Americancompany which was interested in the yard for the construction of
ships carrying natural gas. Other possibilities might be to develop the yard for the construction of oil rigs or to commission a study of the most suitable alternative uses for the site, for example as an industrial estate, by private interests. The location did not seemto be a suitable one for a retraining centre. It would be desirable for the Government to give early evidence that they were activelypursuing these various possibilities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesituation was now more favourable, in that the unions had signedan agreement providing clear assurances of the kind which theCabinet had envisaged at their earlier discussion. Provided that no government money would be contributed to Govan Ship-builders Ltd. until the unions had reached and signed an agreementwith the company about working practices and wage rates and theGovernment had had the opportunity of considering the company&apos;sproposals for the future of the Govan/Linthouse, and perhaps theScotstoun, yards in the light of the study which was now takingplace, the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry should give the necessary guarantees to Irish Shipping Ltd.and might provide the Liquidator with increased working capital of up to  2 million. He should also make a statement in the House ofCommons, as proposed.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,19 October, 1971
