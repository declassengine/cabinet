The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theMiddle East Cabinet of the main features of his recent visit to the Arab republic of Egypt. His discussions with President Sadat and EgyptianMinisters had shown that the present Government of the arab republic of Egypt were prepared to recognise the State of Israel,to sign a peace treaty with the Israeli Government and to accepta plan for a two-stage Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories.In the first stage the Israeli forces would withdraw from the suez canal; and there would be some form of United Nations presenceduring the ensuing six months, when the second stage, including afull Israeli withdrawal, would be negotiated. The egyptian government believed, however, that the Israeli Government were unwilling to proceed beyond the first stage of withdrawal from the canal. It had been possible to convey to them an assurance fromMr. Eban, the Israeli Foreign Minister, that his Government were infact prepared to proceed to the second stage. But the israeli government had still not indicated what permanent frontiers betweenEgypt and Israel they would accept, while the Government of theArab Republic of Egypt, for their part, were willing to contemplateonly minor administrative changes in the 1967 frontiers. Deepsuspicions on both sides complicated the task of Dr. Jarring, theUnited Nations mediator; and it was additionally unfortunate thatduring the preceding three months there had been very little contact between the Egyptian and United States Governments. The presentrelatively moderate Egyptian Government was under considerabledomestic pressure; and the morale of the Egyptian Army was low.It would therefore be in the Israeli interest to approach the nextexchanges in a constructive spirit. In this difficult but not entirelyunhopeful situation we could play a useful part, since we had somestanding with both parties; and the forthcoming meeting of theUnited Nations General Assembly would provide a useful opportunityto pursue the search for a settlement.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had found during his recent visit to Gibraltar that, despite the continuingSpanish restrictions, the atmosphere was one of prosperity and calm.Local opinion, while expecting the fullest United Kingdom support for Gibraltar in its confrontation with Spain, nevertheless expectedus to pursue actively the possibility of a negotiated settlement.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.1. The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements for 22 and23 September, when the debate on the situation in Northern Ireland,for which Parliament had been recalled, would take place. no time would be provided for oral answers to Parliamentary questions on these two days; but the Speaker would probably accept private notice Questions on the second day.
4 j SECRET! iMalta &apos;   I   The Prime Minister said that Mr. Mintorf, the Prime MinisterPrevious        0I Malta, had suggested at the end of the preceding week that reference: I   should visit London for further discussion of the issues outstandingCM (71) 46th   between the Government of Malta and ourselves.  It had seemedConclusions,    right to accede to this proposal; and Mr. Mintoffs generalMinute l      , demeanour at Chequers on 17 and 18 September had beenrelatively restrained.  He had explained that he did not wish Malta to be used by either Soviet or United States forces but that hisGovernment needed financial assistance and would accept a continuing British presence in the Island on appropriate terms.We for our part had explained that the offers already made to malta on behalf of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)represented, so far as the British Government were concerned,&apos;the limit of the price which we were prepared to pay; and we had held out little hope that Mr. Mintoff would in the event find himselfable to negotiate large additional amounts of economic aid from our other NATO partners. In an effort to enable him to withdrawwithout too much embarrassment from the exposed position in whichhis extravagant claims for financial support had involved him wehad offered an interim arrangement, covering a six-month period,during which all restrictions on our Forces would be removed,payments would be made to Malta at the rate proposed in thecurrent NATO offer and negotiations on a longer term arrangement to replace the existing Defence and Financial Agreements wouldtake place.  Mr. Mintoff had agreed to this proposal; and, subjectto, its acceptance by the North Atlantic Council, the necessary! detailed negotiations with the Government of Malta would begini I during the following week.  Mr. Mintoff had indicated that&apos;, despitehis wish to exclude a Soviet or United States presence from the island, he would be willing to allow courtesy visits by UnitedStates naval forces, providing that, if so, he must be free to allowcorresponding Soviet visits. There was a certain logic in thisi attitude; and it would be necessary to ascertain the reactions of theUnited States Government to the proposal. During his return journey to Malta Mr. Mintoff had visited Bonn for discussions with herr Brandt, the Federal German Chancellor, whom we had advised of the outcome of the meeting at Chequers. Herr Brandthad accordingly given Mr. Mintoff no grounds for hoping that hecould play one NATO ally off against the other. In general, ourrelations with the new Maltese Government now seemed to bedeveloping on a more stable and realistic basis; and, although there would no doubt be further arguments with Mr. Mintoff, wecould be more hopeful that a major crisis would be averted.The Cabinet-(2)  Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.Northern   ;IrelandPreviousReference:CM (71) 46thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet reviewed the situation in Northern Ireland;the conclusions reached were separately recorded and circulated onlyto The Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who had totake action.
confidential. The Cabinet discussed the dispute in the newspaper industry,which had prevented publication of the daily papers for several days.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the NewspaperPublishers Association (NPA) had recently agreed with officials ofthe six unions concerned an increase of  1 a week and the consolidation of a cost-of-living bonus with effect from 1 July,when the previous pay agreement had expired. Members of one ofthe six unions involved, the National Graphical Association (NGA),had nevertheless rejected the proposed settlement, demanding a percentage (5 per cent) instead of a flat rate pay increase in orderto maintain existing pay differentials. Mr. Victor Feather, theGeneral Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, had apparentlysecured the agreement of the six unions to a common policy in further discussions with the NPA, which were taking place that afternoon. Although the NPA had indicated that they would stand firm On the offer which they had already agreed, there was obviouslya risk, that they would in fact give some ground. In that case thedanger would be not so much the size of the resultant pay increase as the fact that militant members of one union would have succeeded in improving an offer which officials of all the unions concerned had considered acceptable.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (71) 101), to which was annexed a draft white Paper setting out the proposed new financial policy for ports.The Minister for Transport Industries said that the proposals inthe White Paper had been endorsed by the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Policy. Partly because of the markefs loss ofconfidence following the financial difficulties of the Mersey dock and Harbour Board and partly because of deficiencies in theconstitution, management and financial control of the independenttrust ports, ports which were basically viable were finding it difficultto raise finance by market borrowing, even on short term. Thereconstituted National Ports Council (NPC) were now seeking, in collaboration with the ports, to elaborate a programme to strengthenmanagement and finances. In the longer term, the introduction ofan equity element should provide a further spur to efficiency; butearnings must first reach an adequate level. He proposed that,subject to reports from the NPC on the viability of the portsconcerned and on the measures needed to ensure an improvement inCONFIDENTIAL15 b*2The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.
their financial performance, the Government should be prepared tomake loans to ports for the renewal of debt at a high and steadily increasing rate of interest. The initial rate would be only some two percentage points above the Government lending rate; but ityvould be increased progressively over the life of the loan, probably by about one half of one percentage point every two years. A highinitial rate of interest should discourage port authorities from havingrecourse too readily to borrowing from the Government; andsuccessive increases in the rate should constitute a progressivelyincreasing incentive to look to the market for finance. Improvedearnings should also encourage the market to resume long-termlending as confidence improved and should subsequently facilitate the replacement of Government by private capital.In discussion the following main points were made (a) It would be better to omit the second paragraph of the draft white Paper, which dealt with labour relations and the national dock Labour Scheme (NDLS). An interdepartmental committee hadbeen reviewing the future of the NDLS; and Ministerial discussions on this subject were just starting. It would be unwise to imply thatthe scheme ought to be abolished or modified before new proposals had been agreed; and in any event the case for abolition was not clear.(b) The comparison with practices in other countries in the first sentence of paragraph 4 of the draft White Paper, and in the beginningof the second sentence, should be omitted.(c) The drafting of paragraph 12 of the draft should be clarified.(d) Since it was unlikely that an early place could be found inthe next Session of Parliament for the Bill to empower theGovernment to make the proposed loans, it would probably benecessary to have recourse to the Civil Contingencies Fund.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the White Paper, as amended in discussion,should be published at an early date to be agreed between the lord president and the Minister for Transport Industries. The minister should circulate the final version of the White Paper to the cabinet for information.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for transport industries to proceed accordingly.Upper ClydeShipbuildersPreviousReference:CM (71) 42ndConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL6. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, inaccordance with the views expressed when the Cabinet had last discussed the problem of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS), he had given further consideration to the possibility of securing the participa-tion of private enterprise in any new company which was established
I :i ;to take over operation of part of UCS. It had proved possible toobtain the promise of investments totalling up to a maximum of 500,000 from certain private interests; and the Scottish banks seemed likely to agree to advance loan capital, although only with a fullguarantee from the Government. But the bulk of the capital requiredto ensure the operation of the Govan and Linthouse yards, estimatedat up to  15 million, would have to be provided by the Government.Given the unprofitable orders already on the books of these twoyards, the new company could certainly not be expected to make a profit in the first five years of its existence. The position of the tradeunions was complicated by the fact that the Confederation shipbuilding and Engineering Unions were now probably reconciledto the Governments proposals to operate only two of the four yards of the original UCS; but their influence might well be outweighed bythat of certain shop stewards, who had secured a monopoly of publicity in the Press and on television and would probably continueto oppose any solution which did not embrace all four of the yardsconcerned. But, despite the unsatisfactory financial prospects and thedifficulties which probably lay ahead with the unions, the Governmentcould not withdraw their offer to help at this stage; and a statementof their willingness to provide financial assistance was urgently required, since the Liquidator of UCS would otherwise be unable tocontinue to keep the Govan and Linthouse yards intact and the shipowners concerned would not be prepared to maintain their orders in the present uncertainty. He therefore proposed to announce onthe following day, 22 September, that the nucleus of a new Board hadbeen set up, with Mr. Hugh Stenhouse as Chairman, Mr. A. Gilchristas Chief Executive and a number of prominent Scottish businessmenas directors, including Mr. Douglas, the former managing director ofUCS.; Mr. Stenhouse had that day arranged for the incorporation ofa new company, with an initial paid-up capital of the private invest-ment from Scottish interests. This company, directed by the board which he had described, would initially become the vehicle for discussions between Mr. Stenhouse and Mr. Gilchrist, the banks, theunions, the shipowners and the others concerned with a view toreporting to the Government about the viability of a new undertakingbased on the Govan and Linthouse yards and about the officialassistance required for this purpose from the Government. On theassumption of a satisfactory outcome to these discussions this new company would receive the necessary financial support from theGovernment and v/ould operate the Govan and Linthouse yards.In discussion there was general agreement, particularly in viewof the premature disclosure of the Governments intentions in theScottish Press that the Secretary of State for Trade and industry should be authorised to proceed on the lines which he had suggested.The statutory powers required to give Government financial assistanceto the new company should be sought in the Shipbuilding industry bill rather than in a separate Bill.In further discussion it was suggested that, in terms of the public presentation of the issues involved, the shop stewards&apos; leaders atUCS had managed to pre-empt the Governments efforts to put the true facts of the situation before the public and that a fresh attempt
8       j CONFIDENTIALj must be made to redress this position. Consideration should: therefore be given to the publication of detailed information aboutthe financial state of UCS at the point at which the company went into liquidation, together with a realistic assessment of its future prospects at that time if it had continued to trade. On the otherhand the Government must observe due caution in public statementsabout the situation for fear of damaging the prospects of the salvageoperation in which, they were engaged: the leader of the shop stewards was not similarly inhibited. The Liquidator would in anycase provide a full statement of the position of UCS at the time ofliquidation; and Hill Samuel, with the assistance of Scandinavianshipbuilding experts, were producing a report on the company&apos;operations for the Government. In addition, the inquiry by theScottish Trades Union Congress had already received evidence of theserious financial difficulties which had faced UCS.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Trade and industry should announce in Glasgow on 22 September the plans which he had outlined for the new company under the chairmanship ofMr. Stenhouse. He should send copies of his proposed announcement to the Lord President, the Secretary of State for Scotland and theChief Secretary, Treasury. The Secretary of State should also consider, in consultation with the Lord President, the possibility of seeking the statutory powers required to provide government financial assistance for the new company in the Shipbuilding industry bill rather than in a separate Bill.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.i CONFIDENTIALLondon &apos; 7.   The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial CommitteeTransport on Economic Strategy had considered a proposal by the LondonFares Transport Executive (LTE) to increase bus and Underground faresin London as from the following January by an amount designed toincrease fares revenue in 1972 by  16 - 6 million. This would represent an increase of 13-3 per cent over the current year&apos;s level of trafficreceipts. But, since the last general increase had been in August 1970,thenet increase over 17 months would be at the rate of only 9-6 percent a year. The Greater London Council (GLC), after close examination of the proposals, had concluded that, since the LTE wasstatutorily prohibited from operating at a deficit, the only alternative to an increase in fares would be a subsidy from the rates, which theywere not prepared to contemplate. The Committee had taken theview that a 13 per cent increase in fares would be liable to be verydamaging to the Governments economic policies but that a subsidyfrom the rates would also be objectionable. There were two issues to be considered: first, the immediate problem of the attitude whichthe Government should adopt when the LTE&apos;s proposals were made
public later in the week and, second, the need to consider subsequentlywith the GLC whether any reduction in the level of increase waspossible. The Committee had concluded that a firm statement bythe Government would have to be made when the LTE&apos;s proposals were announced.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that the GLChad persuaded the LTE to reduce the provision in their proposalsfor wage increases in 1972 from 12 per cent to 8 per cent, a saving of 3 million, and that they intended to consider the scope for limitingstill further the total amount of the proposed increase in fares. Thenew management of London Transport appointed since the Transport(London) Act, 1969, came into effect had done much to improve efficiency and to reduce costs. But increases in costs, for example forfuel oil, over the 17 months since the last general fare increase hadbeen very substantial; and the Traffic Commissioners, whose statutoryduty was to determine fares outside the GLC area, would almost certainly grant the increase which the LTE sought. The alternative of ah increase in the GLC rate of about 5 per cent in order to subsidise fares would be equally unacceptable politically, as would areduction in the level of services provided. The Government should,however, make public, when the LTE published its proposals, theiranxiety about the effect of an increase of 13 - 3 per cent on their efforts to curb inflation.In discussion it was pointed out that, whatever was said at thetime when the LTE proposals were announced, an increase of 13 percent, or anything approaching this figure, would undermine the government&apos;s strategy for curbing inflation. It was particularly important that the first public sector price increase to be announcedafter the Confederation of British Industry&apos;s price initiative shouldnot be. so conspicuously out of line with the objectives of thatinitiative. There was no reason why allowance should bemade in the fare increase for wage increases not due until 1972; but even without this element the level of the increase would be 11-6 percent, i There must be scope for further economies, including, ifnecessary, a reduction in the services provided. The precise nature ofthe obligation on the LTE under the 1969 Act not to operate at a deficit should be re-examined: were the LTE required, for example,to break even &quot; taking one year with another &quot; or were they required at no time to run into deficit? In any event, the LTE should not be permitted to make any announcement of proposals for fare increasesuntil the Government had had the opportunity to consider the matter in more detail, both with the Executive itself and with the GLC.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet considered that public proposals for a fares increase of13 per cent, or of anything approaching this figure, would seriouslyundermine the Governmenfs attempts to contain inflation and their support for the Confederation of British Industry&apos;s initiative in thisconnection. London Transport could not therefore be permittedlightly to announce a proposed increase of this magnitude; and hewould discuss the matter with the Chairman of the GLC and the
io      ;., confidentialChairman of London Transport in order to impress on them the government&apos;s concern and to request them to find savings or other; means of bringing the fares increase within acceptable limits withoutI raising the GLC rate. Ministers must adopt an equally strict attitudei; towards all other proposed price increases which infringed the agreed!&apos; criteria.1        The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.. (2)confidential.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (CPRS) (CP (71) 96) about an Early Warning System.The Prime Minister said that the memorandum represented a first step in establishing a flow of information between Departments andthe CPRS, which was designed both to provide early warning ofissues of major importance over the coming 18 months and to afford: a basis for analysis whereby the issues identified could be related not:. only to one another but also to the achievement of the government&apos;s policy objectives.   The Cabinet would wish to consider possible; improvements in the form in which the information was presentedi and the manner in which a regular review of this kind might best be\ developed. Certain economic issues had necessarily been dealt withrather summarily in the memorandum; but they might be examinedI more fully at a later stage, when Ministers would need to considerthe questions of substance raised by the review.In discussion it was suggested that the Early Warning system was likely to be more useful to the Central Departments in the planning of Government business than to individual Ministers inrelation to the management of their separate Departments, since theyshould in any event be aware of potentially critical developments intheir own affairs.  On the other hand a regular return of the kindi envisaged would be of value in giving all Ministers a synoptic viewof major issues likely to engage the collective responsibility of theGovernment over the coming 18 months and of the possible effect which any one of these might have on the development of the Govern-i menfs strategy as a whole. It would also help to identify thoseproblems which might require further analysis in depth, for exampleby the system of Programme Analysis and Review.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the cprs should continue to co-operate with Departments in developing the Early Warning System, paying particular attention to the value ofInvited the Secretary of State for the Environment to ensurethat the London Transport Executive^ proposals for fareincreases- were not announced pending the outcome ofthe discussions to be arranged with the Chairmen of theGreater London Council and the London transport executive.EarlyWarningSystem
n i11-1:1the System in helping Ministers to relate individual issues to theGoverhmenfs strategy in its totality. They should report again tothe Cabinet in six months&apos; time, when a comparison might be made between forecast and actuality. Meanwhile, the information already available should be subdivided into its main component categoriesby broad subject heading; and the Chairmen of the relevant cabinet committees should review each category regularly in order to draw the attention of the Cabinet to any difficulties or critical developments which they could foresee in the areas of policy for which they were responsible. Ministers would have a further opportunity in the nearfuture to discuss the substance of the issues raised, when they considered a memorandum by the CPRS on the Governmenfsstrategy as a whole.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,.      22 September, 1971.
