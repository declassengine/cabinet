ParliamentaryAffairsOverseaAffairs        rEuropeanEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (71) 37thConclusions,Minute 5Yugoslavia The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit toLondon of, President Tito of Yugoslavia had been a success.President Tito had made it clear that the reason why the Soviet: Government were prepared to treat Yugoslavia more leniently than other Communist countries was that they knew that the Yugoslavpeople were prepared to fight to keep their independence; and he gave; the impression that the Soviet authorities were now consciouslytrying to mend their fences with the West. Members of the presidents staff had said that the Yugoslav Government were greatly preoccupied with the problem of domestic inflation, a problem which was made the more acute for them by the division of responsibilities in their own federal system. In general, however,President Tito had appeared to be in relaxed and confident controlof his country.Belgium ;: The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in therecent Belgian elections M. Harmel, the former Minister of ForeignAffairs, had lost his seat. The constitution allowed for him to become-opted as a member of the Government; but it was not yet known whether this would be done. He had proved a staunch friend to thiscountry; and his disappearance from the political scene would beregrettable.rhodesia previous reference:CM (71) 54thConclusionsThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theadoption of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 (Continuation) Order,1971, by both House of Parliament without a division would strengthen his hand in his forthcoming discussions with the rhodesian regime.The; Cabinet-&apos;i&apos;.v.   Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.141771-18 ;.: i1.A21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House Of Commons in the following week.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported that hehad;recently; attended a meeting in Rome of the Foreign Ministers ofthe countries of the European Economic Community, together withthose of the four candidate countries. The atmosphere had beencordial; arid it was satisfactory that it appeared to have been generally agreed that the summit meeting at which all 10 States would berepresented should be held later, rather than earlier, in the following year, unless/it had to be advanced in the light of developments suchas failure on the part of the Finance Ministers to reach agreement on outstanding matters of monetary policy. It had been agreedthat we should in any case participate fully in the preparation of the summit meeting.
IndustrialAffairsHeathrowAirportStrikePreviousReference :CM (71) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3. i-i; The CATNJC had also represented to him the need for a thorough inquiry into the industry&apos;s negotiating machinery. This,however, would have little support from either unions or employers;and it would be greatly resented by BAA. He did not intend, there-fore, to accept this proposal.The CoventryTool RoomAgreementThe Secretary of State for Employment said that the pay oftoolmakers in member firms of the Engineering Employers federation in Coventry was governed by the National Tool Room Agreement,supplemented by the Coventry Tool Room Agreement (CTRA).Under these Agreements, the minimum earnings of toolmakers in theCoventry district must not be less than the average earnings of skilled production workers for all the federated firms in the districtemploying skilled production workers and having a tool room. TheCTRA, which dated from 1940, had been introduced in order toprevent the drift of skilled tool room workers to the wartime factorieswhere production workers could earn very high wages on piece-work. It was entirely inappropriate to the conditions of 30 yearslater and should have been terminated long since. The Coventryand District Engineering and Employers Association had in factgiven notice of termination in the summer; and a series of one-daystrikes, to which the employers had responded with lock-outs, hadensued. Recently, the union had balloted its members for an indefinite stoppage; and the results would be known on the following day. Such a stoppage could have serious and widespread effects on production throughout the Midlands, particularly in the motor industry. He accordingly expected requests from both sides of theindustry that he should intervene; and a refusal to do so would undoubtedly attract criticism. Nevertheless, he was anxious toavoid, if possible, the appointment of a court of inquiry or any other action which might lead to the restoration of the CTRA, which was. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, althoughservices at Heathrow Airport were now again operating normally,, both the employers&apos; and the union members of the Civil air transport National Joint Council (CATNJC) had represented tohim the serious danger of further interruptions within a month unless a satisfactory understanding was reached with the British airports authority (BAA) about policy for the award of contracts for groundhandling services. They did not favour the appointment of anothercourt of inquiry such as had previously investigated and endorsedh BAA&apos;s decision to authorise General Aviation Service (GAS) toprovide a ground handling service for the smaller airlines as analternative to that which the major airlines provided. They had requested him, instead, to appoint an independent individual to actas mediator with the BAA. After consulting the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry, who acknowledged that it would be difficultto refuse this unanimous request of the CATNJC, he proposed to tell the Chairman of BAA that afternoon that he was prepared to accede to it. In announcing the appointment, he would say that BAA&apos;s agreement with GAS was not in question.
highly inflationary. His present intention was that, if asked to intervene, his Department should provide a conciliation service to both sides in the normal way.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the Secretary of State for Employmentsproposals for dealing with these two industrial disputes.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.northern ireland previous reference:CM (71) 49thConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered certain developments in relation to northern Ireland; the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.School MilkPreviousReference:CM (71) 53rdConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP (71) 130), to which was attached a reportby officials about suggestions which had been put forward in theprevious discussion for dealing with local authorities who were acting in contravention of the Education (Milk) Act, 1971.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that replies had nowbeen received from 8 of the 25 individual members of the MidlothianCounty Council who had determined to defy the 1971 Act. none of them had argued that the CounciPs action in providing free school milk to pupils over the age of 7 was not contrary to the law; but some of them had attempted to justify the action on other grounds.None had indicated a willingness to cease from defying the law. Hewas under no statutory obligation to take further action; but he remained of the view that it would be wise to warn the Councilofficially of the consequences which would follow if they did notdesist from further contravention of the law. The consequences ofsufcharge in Scotland were less serious than in Wales, since therewas no provision for the disqualification of councillors. he therefore proposed to approach the Council on the lines which hehad suggested irrespective of the outcome of any further approach to the Merthyr Tydfil Council by the Secretary of State for Wales.If he took action before the end of the week, the Ayrshire CountyCouncil might be encouraged at their meeting in the following week todesist from incurring illegal expenditure.
i The Secretary of State for Wales said that the education committee of the Merthyr Tydfil Council were due to meet onWednesday, 17 November. There were likely to be local pressuresbefore the weekend to arrange for the question of school milk to bediscussed, although it was not yet clear whether it would in fact beon the Committee&apos;s agenda. If it was discussed, the Council mightidecide to comply with the law. He therefore proposed that beforethe meeting Welsh Office officials should informally indicate to theTown Clerk that, if a decision to comply with the Act was taken on 17 November, or at any stage before a surcharge was imposed, hewould use his power under the proviso to Section 228 (1) of theLocal Government Act 1933 to sanction the unlawful expenditure&apos; Which had been incurred. If no decision was taken by the Committeeon 17 November to end their defiance, however, he saw no alternative to his directing the District Auditor to carry out an extraordinaryaudit in Merthyr Tydfil. Thereafter, if the Auditor formed the viewthat unlawful expenditure had been incurred, he would be requiredto give those concerned an opportunity in public to explain their action. If he subsequently decided that the expenditure was in factillegal, he would have to disallow it. Subject to appeal to the HighCourt, the councillors would then be surcharged and automaticallydisqualified from membership of any local authority for five years,although they would not as he had earlier thought be sent to prison for civil debt. Surcharge would be imposed against all those concerned, including the local authority officers who had signedcheques in respect of expenditure incurred for the unlawful provisionof milk. But it was not possible to take action against the officersalone or otherwise than in accordance with the prescribed surchargingarrangements. The Councils determination to defy the law had placed their officers in an unfair position; and he proposed thatthis should be drawn to their attention in the proposed informal; approach to the Town Clerk by Welsh Office officials. The political consequences in Wales of surcharging the Merthyr Tydfil council would be serious. He therefore wished to wait until after the meetingof the Education Committee on 17 November before taking formalaction..: The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Wales should arrangefor an informal approach to be made to the Town Clerk of MerthyrTydfil on the lines which he had proposed. The Cabinet also agreedthat the Secretary of State should then wait until after the meetingof the Education Committee of the Council on Wednesday,17 iNovember. If no decision was taken at that meeting to ceasedefiance of the law, he should direct the District Auditor to carry out an extraordinary audit. It was desirable that the Ayrshire CountyCouncil should be encouraged to comply with the law; but theCabinet considered, on balance, that the Secretary of State forScotland should wait until after the meeting of the Merthyr TydfilEducation Committee before making a formal approach to theMidlothian County Council on the lines which he had in mind. in discussion some doubt had been expressed about the validity of the argument in the report by officials that it would be meaningless for
surcharges to be borne by the Council concerned and not by individual councillors. This question should be considered separatelyby the Secretary of State for the Environment.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for wales to proceed accordingly.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to consider further the suggestion that sanction should be directed against the Council concerned as a body.Cabinet Office,11 November, 1971.
