In discussion it was agreed that the events of the past two weeksindicated the basic weakness of Mr. MintofFs position. In fact hehad repeatedly had to abandon the successive ultimata which he had sought to impose; and ways could be found to ensure that the relatively mild sanctions which he had now invoked against us would not become too burdensome. Nevertheless, it would be prudent not to provoke him to take further retaliatory measuresby increased Service activity at the present juncture. It was reason-able that Mr. Mintoff should ask for an indication of the amountof economic aid which he might expect to obtain from membersof NATO; and, if bilateral negotiations could be started, it oughtto be possible for sanctions to be suspended. At the same time we could not submit to repeated pressures to negotiate under duress;nor could we contemplate any further increase in our financial contribution. We should take account of the risk that Mr. Mintoffwould seek to play one ally against another; and his action in thematter of the oil duties suggested that in any event he could not be trusted to observe any agreement which we might finally negotiate with him.-14b*1. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that since the Cabinet had last discussed our relations with the Govern-ment of Malta on 2 September it had been agreed to increase by 250,000 our offer of financial support to Mr. Mintoff largely asencouragement to some of our North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) allies who were only prepared to contribute, or to raise thelevel of their proposed contributions, if we increased ours. Theproposed total United Kingdom contribution at present stood at If million in cash and  3^ million of development aid per annum.Mr. Mintoff had accordingly been informed that the total amount in cash which might be contributed by ourselves and our NATO allieswas now close to  10 million and that there would be substantialeconomic aid in addition. Mr. MintofFs reply had been characteristi-cally intemperate; he argued that the important matter of bilateralaid had been left very vague and that, pending clarification he wouldbe obliged to take retaliatory measures against us. These had taken the form of the withdrawal of the right of our forces, conferred inthe Anglo-Maltese Defence Agreement, to draw their requirementsof petrol and oil without payment of customs duty. The cost to us would be of the order of  15,000 a month; but, more importantly,it would imply that our aircraft would be virtually grounded andthat we should be required to continue negotiations under duress.The NATO Council was meeting urgently; and it was proposedto try to ascertain how much our allies were prepared to contributein the form of bilateral arrangements with Malta and to ask them,if possible, to quantify the aid which they were ready to offer. Itshould be made clear to the Government of Malta that any proposalsfor economic support would be based upon the conclusion of asatisfactory new Defence Agreement and that all sanctions wouldhave to be removed before negotiations were resumed.
HMAmbassador,MontevideoPreviousReference:CM (71) 28thConclusions,Minute 2The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the cabinet would have noted Press reports that the Tupamaros might bepreparing to release Mr. Geoffrey Jackson, HM Ambassador toUruguay. There was so far no reliable confirmation of these reports.But there were grounds for hoping that they might prove to be sub-stantially true; and HM Embassies in Montevideo and Santiagowere keeping in close touch with developments.The Cabinet-(2)  Took note, with satisfaction of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.InternationalMonetarySituationPreviousReference:CM (71) 45thConclusions,Minute 1M M SECRET: ii*2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his discussions with the French Finance Minister, M. Giscard d&apos;Estaing, in Parison 7 September had confirmed him in the view that early international agreement on a return to fixed currency parities was unlikely. nor was it probable that the six Finance Ministers of the countries of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) would be able to agree inthe near future on fixed exchange rates as between their owncurrencies. The Six had decided that at their resumed meeting on13 September they would concentrate on determining their tacticsat the group of Ten meeting on 15 September rather than on seeking to make progress on currency parities within the e.c.. It appeared likely that they would strongly press the United States Governmentto make a positive contribution towards resolving the problemsprecipitated by United States actions in August, for example by increasing the dollar price of gold.   The French Finance Ministerbelieved that, if all the other members of the Group of Ten, togetherwith the authorities of the International Monetary Fund, pressed strongly enough, the United States Government would give way onthis issue.  He himself believed this view to be over sanguine, inthat President Nixon&apos;s own commitment to maintaining the presentdollar price of gold made it politically all but impossible for theThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theI Cabinet agreed that, while doing nothing to provoke a breach withi the Government of Malta, we ought to make it clear that we werenot prepared either to increase the amount of our financial contri-.; button or to negotiate under threat. This and the other points madein discussion would be reflected in the instructions which would nowbe sent to the British High Commissioner and to the United kingdom delegation to NATO.The Cabinet-; (1)  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
United States Administration to yield to such pressure. Nevertheless,he! intended at the meeting of the Group of Ten to press the UnitedStatds representatives strongly, in concert with other members of theGroup, to increase the dollar price of gold; but he would seek toavbid ja situation in which the other members of the Group madeUnited States action on this matter a necessary pre-condition of any action Ion their part to resolve the present difficulties.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.northern ireland previous reference :CM (71) 45thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet discussed the situation in Northern Ireland;the conclusions reached, were separately recorded and circulatedonly to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who hadto take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.f. The Cabinet considered a request which had been made bythe Opposition on the previous day for the recall of Parliament inorderj to debate the situation in Northern Ireland.In discussion it was agreed that, while the recall of parliament in response to the Opposition^ earlier suggestions would not havebeen; justified, the situation was now such as to make it proper to accede! to the request. The business should be confined to a debate on Northern Ireland; and the most suitable days were 22 and 23September. It was recognised that the House of Lords might not need to devote more than one day to the debate.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council and the lord privy Seal to make the necessary arrangements for therecall of both Houses of Parliament on 22 September.Cabinet Office9 September, 1971.
