*1. The Prime Minister said that the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) intended to hold a special meeting of their GrandCouncil that afternoon, at which they would propose to their members that they should enter into voluntary undertakings notto raise prices during the 12 months ending 31 July, 1972, whereverthis was possible; to limit unavoidable price increases to a maximum of 5 per cent; and, where in exceptional circumstances a particularincrease had to exceed 5 per cent, to ensure that the weighted averageof increases for all the related products should still not do so. the cbi had informed Ministers privately some weeks ago of their proposal to take this initiative. They had said that they believedthe Government should seek to achieve a faster rate of economic growth but that they accepted the Governmenfs difficulty in movingin this direction in a period of high inflation. They also appreciated the difficulty of carrying de-escalation of wage settlements furtherwhile prices continued to rise steeply. Accordingly, they saw their proposed initiative as a way of helping to break into the inflationarycycle and of assisting managements to secure lower wage settlements;and they hoped thereby to create conditions in which the government might feel able to take steps to stimulate more rapid expansion ofthe economy. They hoped also that the Government would respondby arranging for the nationalised industries to observe similar price restraint. In preparation for their Grand Council meeting the CBIhad already sounded their leading members privately and had obtained a satisfactory response. If the Grand Council nowendorsed their proposal, it was likely to be made public at a press conference that evening.The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (ES) had considered what response the Government should make in those circumstances in respect of the nationalised industries. Althoughprice restraint would have severe effects for some industries, theCommittee had concluded that it would be right to arrange for themto. make a broadly matching response. The Chancellor of theExchequer was in consultation with the Ministers responsible for nationalised industries for the purpose of settling the detailed arrangements for particular industries. It might be necessary tomake certain exceptions, for example for international air fares andthe nationalised ports; but a matching response by the nationalised industries generally was both economically and politically desirable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also considering theeconomic situation more generally, in the light of the mid-Julyeconomic forecasts. It was proposed that he should announce his conclusions, together with the Governmenfs decision to match price restraint by the private sector in the nationalised industries, in a parliamentary statement on 19 July and that the Lord Presidentof the Council should so indicate in the business statement in theHouse of Commons, announcing at the same time that there wouldbe an economic debate on 20 July. Members of the Cabinet should therefore hold themselves available for a possible Cabinet meeting* Previously circulated in a Confidential Annex.secret-8 a 2
on the morning of 19 July. In the meantime they should be particularly careful to avoid any premature disclosure of theGovernments intentions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the chairmen of themain nationalised industries were members of the CBI Grand Counciland had been privately informed of the CBFs proposals. Togetherwith the responsible Ministers he had discussed the proposals withthe chairmen confidentially. All of them had recognised the politicalnecessity for the nationalised industries to match the CBIS initiative;and at the Grand Council they would respond to it in a generallyfavourable sense, while stressing that price restraint would havemajor financial implications for their industries about which theymust consult the Government. He had given the chairmen assurances that, if they adopted measures of price restraint, the government did not intend the investment programmes of the industries to beaffected thereby or to increase their own controls; and he had undertaken that the corporations would be allowed additionalborrowings from the National Loans Fund to finance investment which they might otherwise have been able to finance from, internallygenerated sources. But he had also emphasised the benefits whichprice restraint should yield by providing increased scope for faster growth and for a reduction in unit costs; and he had made it plain that the Government would expect the nationalised industries tomaintain a fully commercial approach in the pursuit of efficiency and reductions in the level of wage settlements and other costs.He would try to defer until his Parliamentary statement on 19 july the announcement of the proposed application of price restraint tothe nationalised industries; and if other Ministers were questionedabout the CBFs initiative and the Governments attitude towards it,it would be appropriate that they should confine themselves to sayingthat any move of this kind which was designed to reduce inflationwas welcome to the Government. The CBI were that morninginforming the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress oftheir proposed initiative; and he himself proposed to discuss its implications with the General Secretary before making any announcement on behalf of the Government.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the Government should welcome the CBISinitiative to secure voluntary price restraint by private industry andshould arrange for the nationalised industries to make a broadlymatching response. It was not proposed, and the CBI did not expect, that the Government would extend these arrangements toother charges in the public sector, such as those made for school meals and social services. The application of price restraint tothe nationalised industries should not be regarded as a reversal of present policies for the industries, although it would postpone the date by which their operations could be placed on a morecommercial footing. In present economic circumstances, however,even if general price restraint were not to be imposed on nationalised industries, it was unlikely that the Government would have beenable to approve in full price increases of the order which many ofthe Boards were contemplating.  The CBIS proposal related to a

The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Home Secretary said that the traditional parades in belfast on 12 July had been well handled by the security forces and serious disorder had been avoided. The repeated attacks on armyposts in Londonderry, however, were a cause for growing concern,since they suggested that the &quot; Provisional&quot; group of the irish republican Army were intensifying their campaign of terrorism.The Social and Democratic Labour Party were withdrawing fromthe House of Commons at Stormont (which was now in Recess),justifying their action by reference to the Government^ failure to order an independent inquiry into the deaths of two men in recentriots in Londonderry. At Westminster there was some discontent among the Ulster Unionist Members about the lack of firmness,as they saw it, on the part of the United Kingdom Governmentin dealing with terrorism in Northern Ireland. Together with theSecretary of State for Defence, he was considering legislation toprovide for the formation of a full-time unit of the Ulster DefenceRegiment in spite of the unfavourable initial comment on thisproposal. He would also take an early opportunity to discuss with the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, whetherit was desirable that the traditional procession which was due totake place in Londonderry on 12 August should be prohibited.The Cabinet-Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.OverseaAffairsMaltaPreviousReference:CM (71) 37thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the newPrime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mintoff, had informed us that he wished to replace the 1964 Defence and Financial Agreements andhad asked that a British Minister should go to Malta for the negotia-tion of a new agreement, to be concluded by the end of July.Mr. Mintoff&apos;s replies to messages from the Prime Minister, designedto establish a satisfactory basis for negotiations in preparation fora Ministerial visit to Malta, had been churlish and increasinglyabrupt; and it had become necessary to suspend preparations forthe visit at the last moment. By contrast, our own positionthroughout the exchanges had remained moderate and reasonable.
IndustrialAffairsTeachers&apos; PayPreviousReference:CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL5. The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thatshe expected on the following day to receive the report of the arbitration on the pay of teachers. This was likely to recommendincreases equivalent to 10-8 per cent, by comparison with the&quot; without prejudice &quot; offer of 9 - 7 per cent which the teachers&apos;representatives had rejected before arbitration. This award, how-ever, would include the assimilation costs associated with arestructuring of pay, which the arbitration body had approved onthe basis of the managements proposal. The final outcome of the arbitration, therefore, was not unsatisfactory. She would consult the Ministers concerned; and if, as she hoped, it was agreed thatthe Government should accept the award, she had it in mind to make an appropriate announcement on 19 July, when the report of the arbitration body would be made available to the management andthe teachers&apos; panels.The Cabinet Took note of the statement of the Secretary of State for education and Science.He would seek to demonstrate this in reply to a Private notice question in the House of Commons that afternoon by reference tothe text of the Prime Ministers latest exchanges with Mr. Mintoff.In discussion it was agreed that we should continue to demonstrate that we were prepared to adopt a reasonable attitudetowards a possible renegotiation of the 1964 Agreements, providedthat Mr. Mintoff was correspondingly co-operative. From thedefence point of view, however, the facilities in Malta which weenjoyed were not vital to us; and their significance lay rather intheir value to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO),particularly in so far as the Agreements enabled us to deny the useof the islands to the Soviet Government. If the latter could established themselves in Malta, they would greatly increase their military strength in the Western Mediterranean. Nevertheless, there mightbe advantage in our letting it be known publicly, at the appropriate: stage, that we had no wish to keep our Forces in Malta if this didnot accord with the wishes of the Malta Government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should make a Parliamentary statement on the lines which he proposed. Publication of the full sequence of his own exchangeswith Mr. Mintoff should be withheld for the time being; but, if mr. Mintoffs reply to the latest message was negative, it would benecessary to consider what further action should be taken to demonstrate publicly the obduracy of his attitude.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
I CONFIDENTIAL6i The Cabinet considered a memorandum about prescription charges (CP (71) 83) by the Secretary of State for Social Services,the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for wales.The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that, whenthe Cabinet had considered proposals for graduated prescription charges in April, the Health Ministers had been invited to initiatethe necessary consultations with representatives of the doctors,dentists and chemists. These consultations had made it clear thatall three professions were irrevocably opposed to the principle of graduated charges. Since it would not be practicable to introducethem without the co-operation of the professions, consideration was now being directed to the system in use in Sweden under whichmedicines were made up in standard units and were priced appro-appropriately before they reached chemists&apos; shops. Even if such a systemproved appropriate for adoption in this country, however, it couldnot be introduced in less than three to four years; and it was therefore necessary in the meantime to find a new method of increasing the yield from prescription charges which would render it buoyant andwould realise the saving of  15 million which had been envisagedwhen graduated prescription charges had been first suggested. the health Ministers accordingly proposed that the forthcoming charginglegislation should enable them to seek power to make regulationsprescribing the relationship between a flat-rate prescription charge and the average cost of a prescription to the National Health Serviceand thereafter to make annual adjustments in the charge by administrative action. Since this legislation might not have been enacted by the time when it was desirable to make the first increasein the charge from its present level, that increase could be made bymeans of regulations under existing powers, regulations under thenew powers being made a year later. The initial increase shouldbe from 20p to 30p per item and should produce an estimated netsaving of some  17 million a year. Since a charge at this level would be liable to be regarded as very high, particularly after theincrease from 12^p to 20p on 1 April, 1971, it would be preferable that the necessary announcement should be deferred until october and that the new arrangements should not come into effect until1 April, 1972. It would also be necessary to provide means ofmitigating the impact of the increase on those who could less easilyafford to pay it. Proposals for increasing from 30p to  1 the incomelimit for exemption or refund had already been agreed; and it wouldbe appropriate that, in addition, the prepayment certificates already available for periods of 6 or 12 months should be made available on generous terms for three-monthly periods.In discussion the abandonment, at any rate in the short-term,of any system of cost-related charges was viewed with regret. Sucha system would avoid periodical increases in prescription charges,which always tended to be politically contentious; and it would impose a salutary check on extravagance by doctors in prescribingdrugs. In considering whether cost-related charges were practicableit had to be borne in mind that before the estabhshment of the
reorganisation of the ScottishHealth ServiceDraft&apos;WhitePaperCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 84) by theSecretary of State for Scotland, to which was annexed a draft white paper on the Reorganisation of the Scottish Health Service.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the draft white paper, which had been considered by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee, contained his proposals for a single-tier structure of14 health boards and outlined arrangements for a Health ServicePlanning Council and a Common Services Agency. The membersof the boards would be appointed on their individual merits and national Health Service chemists had been obliged to compute thecost of prescriptions and, indeed, still did so for customers who didnot participate in the Service. On the other hand it was clear that every effort had been made to secure from the professions theco-operation which was indispensable for the effective functioning of any graduated scheme which could be introduced in the short term.In further discussion it was suggested that, if the flat-rate chargewere increased even in April 1972, by an amount of the order proposed,the Government^ efforts to contain inflationary wage claims and to achieve a greater degree of price stability would be liable to be seriously affected. Moreover, the cumulative effect of two sharpincreases in prescription charges and the other unpopular measureswhich the Government had been obliged to take in the national interest might tend to give the Government, however unfairly, areputation for callous indifference to the claims of those with special needs, which it would be difficult to reverse. On the other hand,if the proposed increases were not made, it would be necessary toconsider how the savings in public expenditure which they wouldhave yielded should be recovered from other programmes.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that in the short term the attitude of the professionsconcerned made it impracticable to introduce a system of cost-relatedprescription charges but that the Health Ministers should continueto study other methods of relating charges to actual costs with aview to possible changes in the longer term. As regards the flat-ratecharge the Cabinet judged that the economic situation in the coming12 months would make it impolitic to increase the charge by anamount of the order proposed by the Health Ministers. The matter should therefore be reconsidered in the autumn in the light both ofthe general economic situation and of the effects on public expenditureof deferring increases in the charge. Meanwhile, provision forrelating charges to the average cost of prescriptions should be omitted from the Bill which it was proposed to introduce in theautumn; and the content of that Bill should be limited to the subsidiary provisions already agreed for adjusting the present law relating to optical and dental charges and to exemptions and refunds.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
not as representatives of special interests, a position which reflected the need for control by Parliament and the Government over a service which was largely centrally financed. In particular, since there would be only one tier of health boards, the local authorities as such would not be represented on them. There would, however,be consultative machinery through which the views of the professionswould be taken into account. He hoped that the necessary legislation would be introduced in the 1971-72 Session; and he sought the agreement of the Cabinet to publication of the white paper before the Summer Recess in order that detailed preparatory work might be begun, in conjunction with the interests affected, onthe issues which required further study.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper annexed to CP (71) 84,for publication during the last week of July.Cabinet Office,15 July, 1971.
