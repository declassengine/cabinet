The Home Secretary said that pay negotiations on 22 Junebetween the British Steel Corporation (BSC) and the Iron and SteelTrades Confederation (is to) for an interim increase for workerscovered by a three-year pay agreement had been adjourned until29 June after the is to had rejected an offer of  1-50. The BSChad represented that they would be unable to secure a settlementunless the negotiating limit were increased to  1 - 75- 1 - 80 and thata breakdown in the discussions was likely to be followed by industrial action. But there could be no assurance that such an increase would secure a settlement; and, having regard to the implications for other public sector pay negotiations, the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Pay Negotiations had concluded that it should not be authorised.Taken together with holiday improvements worth \\ per cent in thecurrent year, it would have brought the total of the current year&apos;spay improvements for steel workers to about 8f per cent, thusexceeding the 7^-8^ per cent range which it had been decided shouldbe the Governments objective for public sector pay settlements inthe new round of negotiations. The Committee had thereforeconcluded that the BSC should be asked not to go beyond an offer of  1-55 but that they should have discretion to reach a settlementat  1-60 if the is to were themselves to propose to settle at that level.This would be the equivalent of an increase of about 6 - 6 per cent or,taken with the holiday improvements, 8 -1 per cent in all. If, however,the Government decided to stand firm on this basis, they must beprepared to accept the risk of industrial action. In addition, the bsc might wish it to be known that they were acting in accordancewith the Governments instructions and might ask for a formaldirection in the sense proposed.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that a breakdown in the negotiations might adversely affect both the BSCSfinances and the chances of securing the unionS support for theproposals for reorganising the steel industry which he had announced on the previous day. Nevertheless, he agreed with the Committeesconclusion. It appeared that the chairmen of the nationalised industries were likely to represent that they were finding increasingdifficulty in continuing to accept informal Government advice aboutpay negotiations; and they might soon suggest that if the government wished to continue to exercise control over the level of settlementsthey should do so openly.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry.136611-4
PublicExpenditureGeneralSECRET;2.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor offthe Exchequer (CP (71) 68) on public expenditure to 1975-76,together with a Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP (71) 73)1to which was attached the 1971 report of the Public Expenditure!Survey Committee (PESC). They also had before them memoranda by the Secretary of State for Social Services on the health andIpersonal social services (CP (71) 69); by the Lord Chancellor oillegal advice and assistance (CP (71) 70); by the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science on educational building programmes!(CP (71) 71); and by the Lord Privy Seal on voluntary social service!(CP (71) 72).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the 1971 PESC report!presented problems in the short and medium-term on which the&quot;!Government now needed to take strategic decisions.   The basic!problem was to reconcile the proposals for public expenditure with!the Governmenfs broader fiscal policies announced during and!since the General Election of the previous year. The Governmentalgeneral objective was to reduce the high levels of taxation; and afstart had been made in this direction.   The decisions taken andjfannounced in 1970 had reduced the expenditure programmes of the!previous Government by net savings amounting to about  300 million in 1971-72 and rising to about  1,000 million in 1975-76.  These!decisions had been incorporated in the 1970 public expenditure White;Paper (Cmnd. 4578).   Since then unemployment had risen andlindustry had been working below capacity, and in those circumstances!!some additions to expenditure had been agreed. But they had been!concentrated as far as possible in the short-term.  As a result the!costings in the 1971 PESC report, although rising at the same annual!rate of 2-6 per cent as those given in Cmnd. 4578, were at a higher;level throughout. Further decisions and commitments incurred since!the report was prepared, e.g. on regional policy, together with revisedgestimates of debt interest and the public expenditure cost of entering the European Economic Communities (e.c.), had added furthersums, bringing the increase over the Cmnd. 4578 level to the figures]indicated in line 2 of table A of CP (71) 68. The latest assessment of the medium-term economic prospect showed that, provided thaiproductive potential continued on the past trend and that the!economy was so managed that unemployment could safely be*reduced somewhat below the present level, the resources available!in the medium-term future should suffice to meet the public expenditure requirements, including these extra commitments, tcjensure that the burden of taxation would be no heavier in real term!than at present, to maintain a satisfactory balance of payment surplus!and to accommodate an adequate level of private investment. There
were, however, further proposals for additional expenditure, e.g. for steel investment, defence, overseas aid, education and health, theannual cost of which would rise to  545 million by 1975-76. Inthe case of steel the problem was aggravated by the fact that the exactextent of the extra outlay would not be clear until the current enquiry was completed later in the year. The report also noted proposalsfor unqualified improvements in social security. In the case ofeducation, the Cabinet had already, at their last meeting, agreed to anincrease in the primary school building programme. If the total ofpublic expenditure was expanded to any material extent, it wouldnot be possible to avoid increasing the real burden of taxation. In1971-72 all the claims represented by existing commitments could be accomodated solely because the full potential capacity of the economy was not being realised. But there was a risk that the satisfaction of existing decisions and commitments on public expenditure, together with increased pressure of other types of demand at the time, might require a reduction in the growth of public expenditure in 1973-74, perhaps even in 1972-73; and preparations should be made in good time to achieve this. For the period as awhole, he proposed that the public expenditure programme should beso planned and managed as to conform with the costings tabulated inthe report, together with the other existing commitments noted in cp (71) 68 and the cost of entry into the e.c.. This would requirepublic expenditure to be held within the expenditure totals specifiedin paragraph 13 (1) of CP (71) 68, ranging from  23,600 million for1971-72 to  24,950 million for 1975-76. He suggested that Ministersproposing additional expenditure should report to the Cabinet within three weeks whether or to what extent they could accommodate thecost of their proposals within their own programmes as defined bythese expenditure totals. When these further reports were available the Cabinet should consider instructions to officials to prepare proposals for reallocating the annual totals of public expenditure tothe individual programmes, for consideration by the Cabinet inSeptember.In discussion it was suggested that it was difficult to take firm decisions about public expenditure limits without a clearer indication of the likely growth of resources available to finance the expenditure.Moreover, public opinion tended to judge the severity of taxation interms of tax rates rather than the real burden. If revenue increased as a result of the buoyancy of the tax system, it was arguable that,even if it was right for the greater part of this additional yield to beused to reduce tax rates, some portion of it might be regarded as available to finance further developments of high priority in the social services. On the other hand, although any forward economicassessment was open to a considerable margin of error, the effectiveb*136611-4
control of public expenditure required some overall annual limits tobe defined as a policy aim, against which the Cabinet could decide what action should be taken on individual proposals. Overallincreases had in fact been conceded since the publication of similarlimits in Cmnd. 4578. If, however, further increases were made now,the economic assessment indicated that this would entail an increasein the real burden of taxation, in the sense of the proportion of totalpersonal incomes taken in tax. Tax rates needed to be varied to take account of inflation; and room must be left for this, particularly inthe case of the income tax threshold which was already beginning to affect quite low incomes. If public expenditure were further increased, the Government might subsequently find themselvescompelled to curtail Departmental programmes abruptly, as had proved necessary on earlier occasions; and it was imperative to anticipate this situation..In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It was arguable that the Government should not subscribe to the &quot; rights &quot; issue by British Petroleum (BP) but should leave theCompany to find finance from the market. To increase theGovernments stake in the Company now would seem inconsistent with the general policy being adopted towards nationalised industries.The opportunities open to the Company in Alaska, however, were very great; and the Company believed that, if the Government, asa 49 per cent shareholder, was not prepared to contribute to a&quot; rights &quot; issue, this would affect the willingness of the market to subscribe additional funds. The size of the proposed issue hadalready been reduced in discussions between the Government andthe Company. A Government subscription to the issue would inany event have a negligible effect on demand; and it would not therefore affect the judgment of the extent to which public expenditure on goods and services could be allowed to increase.(b) The costs of entry to the e.c. indicated in CP (71) 68 wereestimates of the public expenditure cost of the United kingdom contribution to the e.c. budget (net of receipts) and the United iKingdom contribution to the European Investment Bank and the sEuropean Coal and Steel Community.   Public opinion might find ?it difficult, however, to reconcile these figures with the balance of Ipayments costs which would appear in the forthcoming White Paper gabout our accession to the e.c.; and further consideration should Jbe given to this presentational question..&apos; &apos; I(c) There appeared to be other anomalies in the choice of the jitems included in the definition of public expenditure. For example, Ithe levies imposed on industry to finance the industrial training boards Iwere similar in effect to taxation; and it was arguable that a J
Government subscription to a &quot; rights &quot; issue by BP was a capitaltransaction which ought not to be included in the annual accounts.On the other hand receipts from, for example, estate duty, which were also of a capital nature, were included on the other side of the account. It would be desirable to re-examine the whole presentation of public expenditure in order to give a clearer and more consistentpicture to the public.(d) It was argued that, in planning public expenditure, account should be taken of the possibility that savings might improve in response to the Governments general policies. National savings had recently shown a significant improvement; and the proposal, in the reform of personal taxation, that an initial slice of investment incomeshould be exempt from surcharge should also help. If the publicwere prepared to save voluntarily, this was preferable to compulsorysaving through taxation. On the other hand, the present propensityto. save might be partly due to the sense of insecurity engendered byrising unemployment; and, if this were so, the tendency might be reversed when employment improved. It would be desirable toprepare a strong publicity campaign for savings, in preparation forsuch an eventuality. It was important, however, to avoid simplypromoting one form of savings at the expense of another.(e) Some Departments which had put forward additionalproposals for expenditure felt that the scope for finding offsetting savings within the same programme would prove to be very limited.In considering the possibility of savings in programmes of otherDepartments, however, account should be taken of the extent towhich those Departmental Ministers had themselves deliberatelyrefrained from putting forward additional proposals, or had madesavings, in order to keep within the limits previously prescribed.(/) With prices rising at their present rate it was probablyunrealistic to assume that annual upratings of supplementary benefitcould be avoided. As regards national insurance benefits, it had been difficult in 1971 to maintain a full two-year interval betweenupratings; and by the beginning of 1973 there might be considerable political pressure to advance the effective date of the 1973uprating. This would be particularly significant because of there organisation of the tax structure at present planned to take effect in 1973-74. One of the major difficulties in the past had been thelong gap, between the announcement of increases in national insurance benefits and their implementation. It would be desirableto examine further the possibility of reducing this time-lag.ig) Possible measures for relieving family poverty were atpresent under review. It had previously been agreed that  15 million should be made available from the contingency reserve for thispurpose.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the broad proposition that the overall level of public expenditure must remain consistent with the Governments policy on taxation and that commitments should not be allowed to increase to the point where there was a risk that policy might subsequentlyhave to be reversed. The Cabinet accordingly accepted the need to define overall annual totals for public expenditure, as set out inparagraph 13 (1) of CP (71) 68, provided that these were treated asa policy aim. The Cabinet noted that it might be necessary toreduce the rates of increase in public expenditure in 1973-74 and perhaps in 1972-73, if pressure of demand in the economy becameexcessive; and also that it might be necessary in due course to accommodate provision for additional steel investment by reductionselsewhere. As a next step the Chancellor of the Exchequer should hold bilateral discussions during the next three weeks with theMinisters now proposing additional expenditure, in order to establishwhether or to what extent they could accommodate the cost of their proposals within their own programmes. Thereafter he should arrange for the outcome of these discussions to be reported to theCabinet, together with any proposals which he might have to makein the light of that report for the conduct of the.proposed widerreview directed to producing further offsetting reductions from other programmes. He should also give further consideration to the suggestions made in discussion that additional information shouldbe placed before the Cabinet about the assumptions concerning thegrowth of gross national product and tax revenue which lay behindhis general economic assessment; and that the public presentation of public expenditure forecasts should be modified to avoid anomaliesin the treatment of different kinds of expenditure. The Secretaryof State for Social Services should give further consideration in due course to ways of reducing the time-lag between the announcementand implementation of changes in social security benefits.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed, subject to the possible need for reconsideration ifthe pressure of demand should become excessive oradditional expenditure on steel investment had to be accomodated, that public expenditure programmes should be planned and managed with the aim ofconforming with the overall annual totals set out inparagraph 13 (1) of CP (71) 68.
(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to discuss urgently with all Ministers proposingadditional expenditure whether or to what extentsuch proposals could be accommodated by savingswithin their own respective programmes and toreport the outcome of these discussions to theCabinet;(ii) to circulate to the Cabinet, in the light of thediscussions referred to in (i) above, his proposalsfor the conduct of the proposed wider reviewdirected to finding further offsetting savings from public expenditure programmes as a whole.The Lord Privy Seal said that in their Election Manifesto theGovernment had recognised the importance of voluntary social service and had pledged themselves to its active support. A group of Ministers from the Departments concerned under his chairmanshiphad considered means of fulfilling this pledge. The matter had alsobeen considered by the Committee on Social Services, who had agreed that the Government should give positive encouragement to voluntary social service. Direct grants paid to voluntary associationshad amounted in the previous year to some  2-6 million, exclusive of capital expenditure in connection with the Youth Service; andfurther expenditure was incurred through local authorities and theNational Health Service. Direct grant expenditure was planned torise by about  1 million a year by 1975-76; but this was not a sufficiently positive commitment to justify a claim that theGovernment had redeemed their pledges and had recognised theneeds and opportunities in the field of voluntary social service. Thiswould require both improved organisation and more generousfinancial provision. In CP (71) 72 he therefore proposed that theCabinet should allocate a total of  4 million over the years 1972-73to 1975-76 for projects to promote the purposes of voluntary social service, leading to an annual addition of about  1^ million to plannedGovernment expenditure by the end of the quinquennium. the detailed allocation of the expenditure to objectives and Departmentalexpenditure programmes had still to be worked out. The Manifestohad also committed the Government to encourage the flow of privatefunds to charities, including voluntary social service; and he hopedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer would soon feel able to offer some improvement in tax arrangements for voluntary bodies, whoneeded to have resources of their own as well as help from public funds.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposedcommitment of an additional  4 million in support of voluntary
social service merited sympathetic examination. The encouragement of voluntary service and community self-help was in full accord withthe Government^ philosophy.   The sums involved were relativelymodest; but they could yield benefits greater than their size might suggest and could be of considerable political advantage in terms ofthe Governments wider policies. The promotion of voluntary effortalso offered a means of helping to satisfy public expectations of asteadily rising standard of social services, which otherwise could bemet only at an unacceptable cost to the taxpayer.  A considerable&quot;amount of support, however, was already given to voluntary organisations from public funds; and it would be undesirable toraise hopes that these contributions would be increased beyond the;amount which the Government was prepared to make available. Injorder to reach a judgment on priority needs and on the most effective?method of meeting them, specific proposals for deploying thjtadditional funds would need to be worked out in conjunction with!the Departmental Ministers concerned with different aspects oilvoluntary social service, who would need to be satisfied, in relation;!to their own objectives, of the merits of diverting these extra!resources into voluntary social service and to consider how far thelsums in question could be met from provision already planned undeiTtheir respective public expenditure programmes. This should be donejurgently, in order that any decision to provide increased support tbjvoluntary social service might, if possible, be announced in the course;!of July. 11The Cabinet- J(4) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the]Departmental Ministers concerned with different aspect!of voluntary social service and the Chief SecretaryTreasury, to prepare detailed proposals for additional expenditure of  4 million in support of voluntary social service over the period 1972-73 to 1975-76 and to mallan early report to the Cabinet indicating the extent tjwhich the Ministers concerned were prepared to metheir shares within their existing public expenditufprogrammes, and suggesting the terms in which such aincrease, if then approved, might be announced.&apos;Cabinet Office,30 June, 1971.
