It was understood that Mr. Speaker would be likely to rule that afternoonthat a prima facie case had not been made out. Nevertheless, he had indicated that, in his opinion, the whole issue of the procedures inrelation to Parliamentary Questions needed to be examined; and thiswas a view to which the Government should subscribe on merits, sincethe existing procedures were clearly unsatisfactory in several respects.The most appropriate type of inquiry for this purpose would be an ad hoc Select Committee, of which the Lord President should takethe chair.The, role of civil servants, which had been challenged as a resultof the Press disclosure, would be bound to be investigated by theSelect Committee; and, although there should be no question of theCpmmittee&apos;s being permitted to range over the whole question of the relationship between Ministers and civil servants, they could probably not be precluded from considering the propriety of such practices inrelation to Parliamentary Questions as had been the subject of theDepartmental memorandum in question. Even so, it would benecessary to maintain firmly that, although the manner in which theDepartmental instruction in this case had been conveyed had perhapsbeen unfortunate, it did not call in question the professional integrity of, the, public service. The traditional political neutrality of civil, servants connoted impartiality as between one Government andanother Government of a different Party complexion. It did notconnote impartiality as between the Government of the day and theOpposition; and any Government was entitled to expect the publicservice to put itself at the disposal of Ministers, without politicalreservations, in order to secure the effective presentation of their policies.confidential136638-13 A 21. The Cabinet considered the arrangements to be made inconnection with the Opposition^ desire to debate the agreement on fisheries policy within the European Economic Communitieswhich1 had recently been concluded by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. There was general agreement that we should not onthis account defer our signature of the Treaty of Accession to the communities, which should be practicable by mid-January, but thatit would nevertheless be desirable that the debate on the fisheriesagreement should, if possible, precede signature of the Treaty.

The Indian Government had said that they intended to setMinute 3       Up an independent government of Bangla Desh in East Pakistan andthat they had no territorial ambitions in West Pakistan. It was not clear, however, whether this latter assurance was intended to extend to. Kashmir. In any event it was to be expected that Indian troops would have to remain in Bangla Desh for some time to keep order;and this could complicate the question of our eventual recognition ofthe new State which seemed to hope for membership of theCommonwealth.  The United Nations remained in deadlock, sinceany Resolution tabled in the Security Council calling for thewithdrawal of the combatants was bound to attract the veto of one member or another.  We ourselves had so far judged it prudent to abstain from voting in the hope of being able to make a more practical intervention at a later stage. Meanwhile, our objective must,i    be to try to ensure that the remnants of the Pakistan Army were&apos; evacuated from the East Wing alive and to preserve the West Wingof Pakistan intact.   Our attitude towards the supply of arms wasthat no British interest would be served by breaking existing contractsbut that the issue of licences to export arms and military equipment would be kept under close supervision.The Gulf The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePrevious commotion following the Iranian seizure of the Gulf Islands ofReference: Abu Musa and The Tunbs seemed to be subsiding.

The&apos; Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState i for ^Social Services (CP (71 153) and the Chancellor of theExch^qtie^^tCP (71) 154) on the uprating of National insurance benefits: ^ &apos;!-!&apos; ; , The Secretary of State for Social Services said that pressure was already mounting for the next uprating of National Insurance benefits to take place well before its expected date of October 1973; and theOpposition were likely to commit themselves to the principle of annual uprating, for which there were demands from both sides ofthe Housei It was desirable to take and announce early decisions onthe principle of annual upratings and on the date from which thenext uprating should take effect, since the increasing political pressure. 3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that theExecutive of the National Union of Mineworkers had decided tocall a national strike of their members from 9 January, 1972, in furtherance of their pay claim. Moreover, little progress had beenmade in the pay negotiations in respect of the manual workers in the gas and electricity industries. If no settlement was reached in anyof these negotiations before the end of the year, there was a risk ofsimultaneous industrial action in all three industries, which could give rise to serious disruption of services. It was important, however,in relation to the Governments policy of seeking to reduce the levelof pay Settlements as a counter to inflation that a firm stand shouldbe maintained by the managements of the undertakings concerned.$4 ^^$$$8$$-tne level of unemployment, the rate of increase on a&quot;seasonal basis seemed likely to have been rather slower than hitherto;and the December return, including Northern Ireland, might thereforestill be a little; below 1 million. But this level was likely to be reached in January. -.1 IThe Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that the ministerial Committee on Emergencies should satisfy themselves thatthe contingency plans for the coal, gas and electricity industries wereup-to-date and took account, as far as practicable, of the possibility ofsimultaneous industrial action in more than one of these industries.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should considerwhether any action could be taken, perhaps in consultation with the confederation of British Industry to ensure that employers gaveMinisters as much advance warning as possible of large-scaleredundancies in different parts of the country.: The Cabinet-I&apos; !

-would soon reduce the Governmenfs room for manoeuvre. In hisvibw, it would not be possible to postpone a further increase in benefits beyond the autumn of 1972; and it would be right to prepare the way for an increase at that time by announcing now that annual reviews had been adopted as a general policy. Biennial reviewsno longer carried conviction as honouring the Governmenfscommitment to protect the purchasing power of benefits. ByFebruary or March 1972 the purchasing power of the national insurance pension would probably have fallen below its value at thetime of the 1967 and 1969 increases; and there was general anxiety about the effect on the level of prices over the next two years of our entry into the European Communities and the introduction of value-added tax (VAT). It was already the practice to increasesupplementary benefit rates annually; and an annual uprating ofNational Insurance benefits would obviate the difference in treatment between pensioners and those receiving supplementary benefit which inevitably followed from differing time scales for their respectivereviews. He therefore proposed that the next uprating of national insurance benefits should take place in the autumn of 1972 and thatlupratings should thereafter be made annually in the autumn. Annualliipratings would admittedly represent a continuing additional cost,even though most of it would fall on contributions; but it was notrlecbssary to take a decision at this stage on the amount of the uprating. Annual reviews of National Insurance benefits would alsobe liable to entail similar treatment for public service and armed forces pensioners.; v \ the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not seekingat this stage to argue against the principle of annual upratings; butan uprating in the autumn of 1972 created special difficulties. First,when pensions were increased the Pay As You Earn code numbersof pensioners had to be altered. The Inland Revenue were currentlyrecoding in preparation for tax unification and could notsimultaneously undertake the recoding made necessary by a pensions increase during 1972-73. It followed that, if there were an upratingin 1972, pensioners would have to be relieved of liability for tax onthe additional amount of their pensions in 1972-73, regardless of their total income. There was continual pressure for special tax treatment for pensioners; and to waive the tax for that year would create an undesirable precedent. Second, Parliament had debated as recently as the previous week the Governmenfs plans for public expenditure,as disclosed in Cmnd. 4829, which explicitly referred to biennialuptatirigs. The announcement of a decision now to adopt annualupratings would therefore appear as a hasty measure, demonstratingIthe Governmenfs lack of confidence in their policies. nevertheless he recognised the difficulties of making no increase in national insurance benefits until the autumn of 1973; and he therefore proposed that the next uprating should take place in April -1973. Itwould: then take effect shortly before our entry into the european communities and at much the same time as the introduction of VAT.If upratings were thereafter to take place annually, they should bemade in April.
Iri discussion, the following main points were made (a) It was argued that the next uprating would have to take place before the end of 1972. If it was not made until the spring of 1973,the value of the pension would be liable to be seriously eroded; andthe Governments action would be strongly criticised as showing acallous indifference to those in need. If it were not possible for the inland Revenue to carry out the recoding made necessary by a pensionincrease in 1972, the additional income tax due from pensioners wouldhave to be sacrificed. The waiver of tax in circumstances such as thiswas not without precedent. An uprating in the spring in any casepresented special difficulties. It had to be announced before thepreceding winter; and such an announcement invariably gave rise to pressure for the increases to be made immediately. Instead ofgaining credit for the improvement, the Government would then beput in the position of appearing deliberately to defer it.(b) It was generally agreed that National Insurance benefits should in future be uprated annually rather than biennially. Having; /taken, this/decision, the Government should announce it as soon as\ 1 possible and before their action appeared to be in response to public&quot;i pressure.   In particular, it was believed that the Opposition were;   planning a campaign for annual upratings, beginning in the following week- and it was therefore desirable that any announcement of theGovernments intentions should be made during the current week., If National Insurance benefits were uprated annually, public serviceand Armed Forces pensioners should receive similar treatment; andan opportunity for this purpose existed in the Superannuation bill now before Parliament.  An undertaking had been given that the qualifying age at which increases to such pensioners were payablewould be reduced from 60 to 55 on the occasion of the next increases in these pensions.(c) It Was suggested that the next uprating could take place inthe spring of 1972 or that at least some addition could be made tothe National Insurance benefits at that date with a view to futureupfatings taking place annually in the spring. But the processesinvolved in so early an uprating might not be able to be completed in, the time now available, quite apart from the general disadvantageswhich attended a spring uprating.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the uprating of National Insurance benefits should in future take place annually and that the next uprating couldnot be deferred beyond the autumn of 1972. It was desirable that animmediate announcement should be made of the governments intentions; but before a final decision was reached it was necessary!;tp&apos; - consider - whether the next uprating should take place in theautumn of 1972 or in the spring of that year. In the latter event the possibility of increasing supplementary benefit rates at the sametime should also be considered. It did not necessarily follow that thedate chpsen j for the 1972 uprating should be the date at whichupratirig should take place in subsequent years; but it was desirableto consider that question now, since it might affect the terms in whichthe Government announced their decision. The annual uprating of,   -I, . ;   CONFIDENTIALit
National Insurance benefits would entail similar treatment for publici service and Armed Forces pensioners; and the timing of an increasein those pensions should also be considered. The Lord President, thei Secretary of State for Social Services, the Lord Privy Seal and theChief Secretary, Treasury, should urgently consider these matters inorder that a final decision might be reached on Thursday, 16December.The Cabinet  - -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Payment of,UnemploymentBenefitDuringPeriods of ,Teriiporaryi -y ;,Suspensionfrom WorkCONFIDENTIAL-:; -5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (71) 155) on the payment ofunemployment benefit during periods of temporary suspension from work..:;JUJ: TVze Secretary of State for Social Services said that, after-consultation with the Secretaries of State for Employment and for trade and Industry, he had made a commencement Order in theprevious May, bringing into operation from 1 January, 1972, a rulewhich would stop payment of flat-rate unemployment benefit for thefirst six days of any period of temporary suspension from work. since then he had received representations from many quarters, includingthe. Trades Union Congress, against the rule. In particular, both sides of the textile industry had urged him to exempt textile workers on the grounds that short-time working was a more or less permanent feature of the industry and that the employers could not afford inpresent conditions of trade to agree to the guaranteed week payments which he had suggested as the remedy when unemployment benefitwas withdrawn. The employers and the unions were now in dispute over the question; and this was their first dispute for a very long time.It had been argued that the payment of guaranteed week payments would cause a number of textile and machine-tool firms to becomebankrupt and would therefore create further unemployment. Butthis argument was doubtfully valid, since it seemed unlikely that theworkers would press their demands for guaranteed week payments to this extent. In dealing with representations of this kind he had hitherto held firmly to the line that the rule must come into operation in order to bring to an end an unjustifiable subsidy to ailing industries from the National Insurance Fund, which was not created for thatpurpose; and there was little doubt that, on merits, this was still the; right course. Moreover, at present levels of short-time working thenet saving on benefit expenditure resulting from the implementationr ofi the rule would be at a rate of  6 million a year; and there wouldalso i be an economy of about 300 staff in the Department ofEmployment. Nevertheless, he had thought it right in the light of the! current level of unemployment, particularly in the textile industry, tobring the issue before his colleagues. If there were to be a concession,difficulties of definition would make it impracticable to confine it to
particular industries; and it would be necessary to make an Order,which would not be subject to either an Affirmative or a negative resolution, revoking the commencement Order entirely. Thereafter,however, it would be possible to make a new commencement Orderoperating from a later date whenever it was considered appropriate to do so.The Home and Social Affairs Committee had considered theissue at their meeting on 8 December and had concluded that, withoutprejudice to the merits of imposing the six-day suspension rule atsome future date, it should not be introduced on 1 January, 1972.The Committee had asked him to bring the issue before them again in a year&apos;s time, unless it seemed to him right to do so sooner. Atthe Prime Minister^ request, he now sought the Cabinefs approvalof the Committee&apos;s recommendation.In disciissiori it was suggested that it was undesirable that theGovernment should abandon the date of commencement at such short notice. If the rule were not now imposed, it would be difficult tointroduce it at a later stage, particularly if the level of unemploymenthad not been significantly reduced in the meantime. On the otherhand; th^rj werdioverriding political objections to bringing the ruleinto,;operation:on 1 January. In particular it would be liable to expose the Government to bitter criticism on the grounds that theywere deliberately denying relief and assistance to those who were already suffering serious hardship.In further discussion it was argued that, if it were decided thatthe rule should riot be imposed on 1 January, 1972, an alternativedate: of introduction should be decided and announced now. Thiswould also discourage employers from supposing that the introductionof; guaranteed week payments could be postponed indefinitely. Onthe other hand; when the appointed day arrived the government might, again&apos;find that circumstances made it desirable to postpone the imposition of the rule. It would therefore be preferable tomaintain room for manoeuvre in this respect.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the six-day suspension rule should not beintroduced on 1 January, 1972, and considered that, on balance, itwas preferable not to try to fix a date at this stage for its eventualimposition. The Secretary of State for Social Services, in consultationwith the Lord President and the Chief Whip, should therefore arrange to introduce an Order revoking the commencement Order entirely.As agreed by the Home and Social Affairs Committee he should bringthe issue before the Committee again in a year&apos;s time, unless it seemed to him right to do so sooner.The Cabinet-VY- ;;;Took;;4btp, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing. ;   ] ,;  up pf their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for. *,   Social Services to proceed accordingly.:  Cabinet Office,14 December, 1971.&apos;      &apos;1&apos; ! ! -     CONFIDENTIAL
