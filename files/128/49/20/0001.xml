CM 20 (71)secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the Easter Recess.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePakistani Army appeared to be in control at least of the major citiesof Dacca and Chittagong. Despite the statement of the PrimeMinister of India, Mrs. Gandhi, that India would not intervene, therewere reliable reports that the dissidents were being supplied witharms from India; their resistance to the Government forces might thus be expected to continue for some time. The Prime minister had sent a message to the President of Pakistan, GeneralYahya Khan, urging him to discuss the situation with the EastPakistani leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This seemed to offer the best hope of restoring calm, although the fact that Sheikh Mujibhad been charged with treason was an obvious difficulty. All Britishsubjects who wanted to leave East Pakistan had now done so; some400 had decided to remain.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thesecurity situation in Ceylon was causing serious concern. Bands ofdissident students had raided police stations and attempted to destroy bridges. The Prime Minister of Ceylon, Mrs. Bandaranaike,had asked us for small arms and ammunition for use by the police;and these were being supplied. There were grounds for fearing thatinsurgency might be increasing; and she had now asked also forgrenades, which were less obviously described as a legitimate policeweapon. This request was under consideration.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in a recentstatement the President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, had spoken of withdrawing 100,000 United States troops from Vietnam by theend of the year. This constituted a rather smaller number than had earlier been expected.The Cabinet-Took note  of the statements  by  the Foreign  and.Commonwealth Secretary.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that our]emissaries, led by Lord Goodman, had returned from their visit tlSalisbury to meet Mr. Smith and his representatives and had reportedthat the discussions had been reasonably encouraging.   Progress!towards agreement between the two sides on some important]peripheral matters had been made; but on the fundamental issuethere was still considerable divergence of views. A number of new;ideas on the content of a settlement had been put to the Rhodesiaiifrepresentatives;   and   their   comments   on   these   wouldcommunicated to us in writing within the next week or two.

confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment said that earlierhopes that the offer by the British Railways Board (BRB) of a9 per cent wage increase would be accepted and that industrial action on the railways would be avoided had not been realised,largely as a consequence of the size of the improved pay offer madeby the Ford Motor Company, which it must now be expected wouldbe followed by VauxhallS. Despite the note of optimism in press reports that morning that the further discussions now proceeding between the Board and the three railway unions would lead to anearly settlement, previous experience suggested that, in default ofsome marginal improvement in the BRB&apos;s offer, the union leadersmight lose control of the situation. Industrial action on a widerscale might then develop; and the Board might respond by refusing to allow men who would not work normally to take up duty at all.The final result might then be a complete stoppage. While theGovernment should not prompt the BRB to raise their offer, if theBoard&apos;s further discussions with the unions indicated that asettlement could be secured on the basis of an increase of, say,9i, per cent, it might be wise to acquiesce.concerned, it might cost us a further  30 million a year. Theagreement would be bound to lead to higher oil costs throughout europe.The Prime Minister said that during his recent visit to Bonnthe Federal German Chancellor, Herr Brandt, had raised the questionof oil supplies and had indicated that the Federal government wished to increase German participation in the international oilbusiness. In particular they were anxious to join the IranianConsortium and hoped that British Petroleum could help to make this possible.In a brief discussion it was agreed that the Federal german governments readiness to become more fully involved in theinternational oil business was to be welcomed and that we should give further thought to the best means of assisting them to do so.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, to consider the means by which british petroleum might assist the Federal German Governmentto join the Iranian Consortium.
ElectricitySupplyIndustry Pay ofElectricalPowerEngineersPreviousReference:CM (70) 45thConclusions,Minute 3The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the electrical Power Engineers Association (EPEA) were due to meetthe Electricity Council on 15 April for further discussion of their claim for improved pay scales. There was a threat of industrial action in the absence of any improvement in the CounciPs presentoffer of 9 per cent plus A\ per cent for pay restructuring. A minorimprovement in the CounciFs offer to secure a settlement might be acceptable, provided that it did not embarrass the British Railways IBoard in their negotiations. IThe Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe effects of the industrial action on the railways and the threat offindustrial action in the electricity supply industry would need to be Ikept under continuing review during the Easter Recess. The ;Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should keep in close touch with the:jcontinuing pay negotiations between the BRB, the Electricity council and the unions concerned; and, if either Board reported 1that a fractional increase in the percentage offers would secure ajsettlement, the Cabinet agreed that, in consultation with theflSecretary of State for Employment, they should be authorised toffagree. Suggestions made in current reports by the British .Broadcasting Corporation on the BRB&apos;s discussions with the Irailway unions that a significant improvement in the Board&apos;s offermight be forthcoming had been unhelpful to the successful conclusion of negotiations; and the Lord President of the Councfflshould consider whether that point could be taken up with theaCorporation. The Secretary of State for Employment shouldjlcirculate, for the information of the Cabinet, a note indicating thdflrelative pay improvements which had been conceded or were undeljdiscussion in public sector pay negotiations, both in absolute andiralpercentage terms, as a background for Ministers&apos; consideration of 1cases such as the police and the probation service, where speci$JjBcircumstances e.g. recruiting difficulties or a need for expansion qfjithe service in question might suggest the need to change existinJBpay relativities.The Cabinet- 9(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretaries of Statefor the Environment and for Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to circulate a memorandum for the information of the Cabinet of the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up. j
CM 20 (71)confidential . The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal(CP (71) 45) and by the Lord Chancellor (CP (70) 48) on Civil service non-Industrial Manpower.The Lord Privy Seal said that on 22 December, 1970, theCabinet had decided to reduce the number of non-industrial civilservants in post at 1 April, 1971, below 500,000, if necessary byarbitrary action. They had also decided to restrict the number as nearly as possible to 500,000 by 1 April, 1972, by eliminatingunnecessary functions in Departments.With the help and co-operation of Ministers the first aim wasbeing realised. But, in spite of economies achieved by improvingefficiency, numbers would rise towards a figure of 510,000 beforethe end of the year; and there would be no chance of restricting thetotal to 500,000 at 1 April, 1972, unless some further action wastaken forthwith. In the light of the Governments publiccommitment to reduce manpower in the public service this prospectwas not politically acceptable. He would be putting before hiscolleagues in due course proposals for more rational criteria formeasuring and controlling Civil Service numbers; but, meanwhile,immediate action was required. He recognised the difficulties caused to Ministers by a departure from the systematic approach whichhad so far been adopted. Nevertheless, if the object were to beachieved, he could see no alternative to proposing that a 2 per centarbitrary reduction should be made on staff ceilings at 1 April, 1972,in order to ensure that the figure of 500,000 would not be exceededat that date. A decision to this effect should be announcedimmediately.The Lord Chancellor said that a 2 per cent reduction in thestaff of the Courts would cause serious delays in the hearing of cases and would result in a decline in the standard of the administrationof justice which would give rise to strong criticism. A similarreduction in the staff of the Land Registry, whose work was determined by the volume of sales of land, would also lead to delays in house and land purchases which would be resented by publicopinion. The pledge to reduce the size of the Civil Service, like other pledges, should be regarded as a commitment to be honouredover the lifetime of the Parliament rather than by arbitrary methodsduring a single year. He could not therefore agree to an arbitraryreduction in the staff of the Courts or of the Land Registry withoutfurther examination of the means by which the proposed total reduction in non-industrial numbers might be achieved with sufficient
discrimination in favour of those policy objectives which should begiven priority. 1In discussion the following main points were made: v(a) The level of certain staffs, such as the Prison Service andsome social services staff, depended on factors which were outsidethe control of the Government. Other staff, such as those engage!on immediate tax changes had had to be increased in the short term1althougn in some cases the ultimate result would be a saving of stafkIn other cases, arbitrary reductions would impair efficiency arid!even lead to a breakdown in services. In short, a reduction of2 per cent without regard to the needs of particular departments would be uneven and capricious in its effect.(b) Some Departments had already reduced their staffs morethan others; and if the question was to be approached systematically,!this should be taken into account in assessing the need for further,,reductions. On the other hand, if the reduction was to be arbitraryit should preferably fall on all alike without exceptions. J1(c) It was unrealistic and prejudicial to efficiency to regard thltotal of non-industrial civil servants as the sole criterion by which to judge the Governments progress in improving the efficiency ofthe public service. Considerable bodies of staff who were classified as non-industrial civil servants were not so regarded by public)opinion. On the other hand temporary staff were excluded from the!calculation. More rational criteria should be devised for the]measurement of staff numbers, in order that the Government should!be seen to be dealing effectively with the real substance of thproblem.(d) Numbers could be reduced more quickly if improved^superannuation and redundancy terms could be brought more,rapidly into effect. In addition, while many measures recommended;in the report of the Committee on the Civil Service (the FultonReport) should improve efficiency and eventually yield stallreductions, others were tending to require additional staff for their;implementation.M(e) The Governments pledge to contain and to reduce the;number of non-industrial civil servants was of great politic!importance. The general public would not accept, for example, thathe size of the Civil Service could not be reduced following the,recent reorganisation of Central Government. To defer genuhljreductions at this stage would only make the ultimate attainment of the  Governments objective more difficult.IThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thCabinet, while endorsing the political importance of reducing t&apos;size of the Civil Service, felt that an arbitrary 2 per cent reductio
confidential. The Prime Minister expressed his thanks to his colleagues for their efforts towards the progress which the Government hadbeen able to achieve since the Christmas Recess. The cabinet would particularly wish to congratulate the Lord President of theCouncil and the Chief Whip on the manner in which they hadensured the despatch of a very heavy load of legislative business.Cabinet Office,8 April, 1972.would take insufficient account of the different needs of individual departments and the varying degrees in which their efficiency wouldbe affected. It was generally accepted, however, that there was room for a reduction in numbers by the more effective use of staff andthe elimination of unnecessary administrative procedures. In the1 first few months of the Governments life Ministers had necessarilybeen concentrating on policy issues; but they might now profitablyturn their personal attention increasingly to the management-problems of their Departments. He would discuss the matter further with the Lord Privy Seal, taking account of the points raised in discussion, including the need to arrive at rational criteria for staffmeasurement; and the Lord Privy Seal would thereafter examinewith the individual Ministers concerned how reductions could beachieved in each Department without impairing their service to thepublic.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
