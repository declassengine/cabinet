2b*-confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week. In the House of lords the Committee Stage of the Industrial Relations Bill would begin on26 April.2. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Legislation Committee had approved the draft Pensions (Increase) Bill, subject to the resolution of a point of policy concerning the computation of the amount ofthe increase in respect of the period from 1969 to 1971. The periodof two years on which the review of increases in the cost of livingwas based ended on 1 April, 1971; but for administrative reasons it would not be possible to start paying the increases which would beauthorised by the Bill until 1 September, 1971. The increase in thecost of living likely to occur between those dates would diminish the value of the payments; and the Government would therefore be liable to be accused of failing to honour their pledge that the purchasing power of public service pensions would be preserved.After consultation with his colleagues principally concerned, he had rejected the possibility of back-dating or of annual reviews as a means of dealing with this problem; and he had reached theconclusion that the proper course was for the Bill to provide thatthe calculation of the increases should include a projection of theincrease in the cost of living between 1 April and 1 September, basednot on any element of economic judgment but on the average increase over the two years of the review period. Unless action was taken on those lines, he feared that the measure, instead of reflecting credit on the Government, would be regarded as niggardly. The projectedincrease in the cost of living was likely to be less than the actualincrease and less than that on which the increase in national insurance benefits had been calculated.In discussion it was agreed that it would be wrong to dealwith the problem of back-dating or by annual reviews. It was argued, however, that to base the increase in pensions on theprojection proposed would endanger the Governments efforts to contain wage inflation by appearing to be inconsistent with theprinciple, which the Government had striven to maintain, that wage increases should not anticipate future increases in the cost of living.On the other hand the proposal did not involve the anticipation oflikely cost of living increases subsequent to the date of payment; itmerely recognised increases which had taken place before that date.Both for this reason and because the arithmetical projection was likely to involve a smaller increase than would in the event be found
actually to have taken place, the proposal was hardly likely to be exploited by trade unions in wage negotiations. Moreover, the issueof public service pensions was politically emotive; and public opinion\was not likely to see any inconsistency between the just treatmentof pensioners and the containment of excessive wage claims. It was jarguable, however, whether it was necessary that the basis on which &apos;the increase to be paid-on 1 September was calculated need be;specifically explained in presenting the measure to the public. It \was not disclosed for purposes of the uprating of National InsuranceIbenefits; and it should be possible simply to assert that the sum in Iquestion had been fixed with due regard to all the circumstances, jincluding the delay which would arise in the actual payment of the jincreases. The sum might also be better described as an &quot; updated&quot; 1amount rather than as involving a &quot; projection&quot;.   It was not 1desirable that the pattern now proposed should be regarded as alprecedent for future pensions increase measures; it would in any event be otiose if an improvement in the administrative procedures Iinvolved made it possible for the increases to be paid immediately \at the end of the two-year review period.IThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the iCabinet agreed that the increases to be paid on 1 September, 1971,1should be on the basis proposed by the Lord Privy Seal. The White IPaper which was to be published at the same time as the Bill should jrefer to the amount of the increase as having been decided with due I regard to all the circumstances, including the lapse of time between 11 April and 1 September; and it should not refer in precise terms 1to any &quot; projection &quot; of the increase in the cost of living. The Lord IPrivy Seal, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and 1the Secretary of State for Employment should revise the Bill and 1the White Paper accordingly. Thereafter, the Bill could be 1introduced at a time to be decided in consultation with the Lord 1President. Consideration should now be given to means of ensuring 1that on future occasions increases might be paid immediately at the 1end of the review period in order that any erosion of their value 1might be avoided.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing ]up of their discussion.Disclosure ofInformationVehicle andGeneralInsuranceCompanyCONFIDENTIAL!3.  The Cabinet discussed the action to be taken in the House!of Commons following the information given on the previous day 1by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade I
secret. The Cabinet were informed of certain action which wasbeing taken to intensify security in the Houses of Parliament as theresult of a recent incident in which a Member of the House ofCommons had been involved.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePakistani Army seemed now to be in control of most of the EastWing of Pakistan; but reports suggested that there might still be some resistance in the most easterly area of the Wing. TheGovernment were sending more troops to the East Wing; but theirlines of communication were becoming increasingly difficult. Theindependence of the so-called State of Bangla Desh had beenproclaimed in a village near the Indian border; and it must beassumed that the Government of India were privy to the plan tomake the proclamation and might be tempted to recognise the new state. The situation continued to be very confused; and hideousatrocities were being committed on boths sides.   Nevertheless, it-2B* 2and Industry (Mr. Ridley) to Mr. R. Carter, mp, concerning theunauthorised and premature disclosure in a memorandum by anofficial of the Department of certain information about the affairs of the Vehicle and General Insurance Company. It seemed probablethat a Private Notice Question by Mr. Carter that afternoon wouldbe disallowed. The Cabinet agreed that a statement should nevertheless be made in the House of Commons by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry to the effect that the matter wasbeing investigated at the instance of the Director of public prosecutions. The statement should be prepared in consultation withthe Attorney-General; and care should be taken, in dealing withany questions about future safeguards for confidential information in the possession of the Department, not to prejudice any criminal proceedings which might result from the current investigations.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tomake a statement accordingly in the House of commons that afternoon.
CeylonPreviousReference:CM (71) 20thConclusions,Minute 2Middle east previous reference :CM (71) 12thConclusions,Minute 2would be legitimate for us to continue to take the line that theGovernment of Pakistan were in generally effective control of theterritory; and there could be no question of our consideringrecognition of Bangla Desh at this stage.In a brief discussion it was suggested that some Members of 5Parliament might be critical of the attitude adopted by the government towards developments in Pakistan and that the jforthcoming arrival of a Pakistani cricket team might furtherstimulate such criticism.IThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesituation would have to be kept under close review but that it wouldbe preferable for Ministers not to make any public statementsrelating to the tour of the cricket team at this stage.The Cabinet i1. Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-1wealth Secretary and of the Prime Minister^ summing M.P of their discussion.IThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that reports!from Ceylon indicated that the insurgents were still operating injvery large numbers and were causing serious difficulties for thelGovernment.   Some 30-50 police stations had been destroyed;!bridges had been blown up; and further damage had been done to 1property.   The Government had arrested a number of suspects, kincluding some Members of the Ceylonese Parliament; but they were ifinding it difficult to regain control of the situation because of the:incompetence and poor equipment of the Army. In response to anfappeal from the Prime Minister of Ceylon, Mrs. Bandaranaike, welhad supplied some ammunition, together with six helicopters which!we had acquired for use by the Ceylonese authorities.   Mrs.!Bandaranaike had appealed also to the Soviet Government, who had fsent helicopters and MiG fighters, which were reported already to)be operating in Ceylon. It had been right for us to respond to the!appeal for help from a Commonwealth Government; but in view offthe confused nature of the situation and of the involvement of!Soviet forces any further requests for assistance would need;!particularly careful consideration. mMThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thelGovernment of Egypt, Libya and Syria had announced that they fwould form a federation in the autumn. First indications suggested!that this would probably be little more than a nominal association;!but by taking even that step the Government of Egypt seemed tdSjbe putting themselves in a position in which their partners couldf
Sierra Leone&quot;previous reference:[(71) 19thConclusions,tinute 2rish republic the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported that theGovernment of Sierra Leone had declared that country to be are public. All the indications were that they had proceeded, and intended to proceed, legally; and it seemed unlikely that anyparticular difficulty would be encountered in making arrangements to give effect to the change of status.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that following the attack by the Irish Republican Army on Royal Navy launches,of which the Cabinet would be aware, he had instructed her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Dublin to suggest to the Government ofthe Irish Republic that they should offer to pay compensation ratherthan wait for a British demand to be made. The Ambassador had reported that the Government of the Irish Republic had reactedpositively to this suggestion.The Cabinet 2.   Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.dustrialritish RailI -feviouseference:[(71) 20thaclusions,lute 6CONFIDENTIAL6. The Secretary of State for Employment said that two of thethree unions concerned had accepted the latest wage increase offered by the British Railways Board (BRB); but the Executive Committeeof the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) had divided 12 against12 on the offer and their General Secretary, Sir Sidney Greene, wastherefore making arrangements to consult the full membership of theunion. The existing agreement between the union and the BRBwas valid until 3 May; and Sir Sidney Greene was proposing to summon another meeting of his Executive before then, when it was expected that the offer would be accepted.veto their actions. This was of particular relevance to trieArab/Israel dispute in view of the fact that Syria had never acceptedSecurity Council Resolution 242 of 1967. One of the motives ofthe Egyptian Government in purporting to move towards federationmight have been to indicate to the Government of Israel that therewas now only limited time within which a settlement of the disputecould be achieved. Meanwhile, reports had been received of thediscussion of a possible agreement between the Governments of israel and the United Arab Republic to permit the reopening of the suez canal.
British Overseas The Secretary of State for Employment said that at a very late ICorporation sta^e t*iere nac* Deen a failure to reach agreement between the British 1Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and the Association offMerchant Navy Airline Officers about the pay of flight engineers.!This had resulted in the continued grounding of boac&apos;s Boeing-7471aircraft. The union was now holding a referendum of its members, which would take three weeks; a settlement would have to await I1its outcome. Underlying the present dispute was the fear on the part of the flight engineers that they would become redundant in jBOAC and that their places would be taken by pilots, as was Jbecoming increasingly frequent in foreign airlines. This apprehension Iwas likely to cause continuing trouble for some time ahead. 1The Prime Minister said that the next round of public sector pay Jnegotiations would shortly be starting; and he would accordingly!arrange for early consideration of the general policy, first in the;Economic Strategy Committee and as soon as possible thereafter by;the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for Employment.LegislativeProgramme1971-72 SessionPreviousReference:CM (71) 9thConclusions,Minute 5secret;7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (71) 51) on the legislative programme for the 1971-72 Session.The Lord President said that, in the light of the discussion in ICabinet on 4 and 9 February, 1971, the Ministerial Committee on future Legislation had considered proposals made by Departments!for legislation during the 1971-72 Session. The resulting programme!was heavy; and, on the assumption that we joined the European!Communities, it would place a severe strain on the legislative!capacity of Parliament.  In addition to the two Bills which would!be required in connection with entry into Europe, the programme!included major Bills on Value Added Tax, Local Government^Reform (separate Bills for England and Wales) and Reform ohHousing Finance (with a separate Bill for Scotland).  It had beenssuggested that there would be advantage in taking Reform of LocalGovernment (Scotland) during the 1971-72 Session instead of leaving!it until 1972-73 as had been earlier proposed; but, if so, the Bill could&quot;!only be accommodated if some other major Scottish Bill werelsacrificed.
In discussion there was general acceptance of the proposals.The following main points were made:(a) The Governmenfs proposals for local government reform in Scotland commanded a wide measure of acceptance; only in a fewareas were they controversial. It had always been planned to legislate in the 1972-73 Session, which would leave ample time for thenecessary consultations and would make it possible for the boundaries of the new authorities to be fixed in the Bill. Legislation in 1971-72would reduce the pressure on the Government to make changes. Butit would also imply that the consultations would be more hurriedand that the boundaries would have to be left for future settlement.On balance it seemed better to adhere to the existing timetable,particularly since this would not prevent the Government frombringing forward, during the present Parliament, their proposals forgiving the Scottish people a greater say in their own affairs.. (b) There might be some embarrassment if the proposed Billon Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Scotland) were introduced before parallel legislation was possible in relation to England andWales, although off-shore fishing was more important in Scotland.The issues might be further complicated if we joined the european communities.(c) There might be advantage in expanding the Monopolies andMergers Bill to comprehend Restrictive Trade Practices, ifDepartmental resources would permit this and all the proposals could be accommodated in a single measure.(d) If the National Health Service Charges Bill could been acted during the present Session, the economies which the cabinet had decided to effect would be more easily achieved. On the otherhand to introduce so controversial a measure late in the Sessionmight prejudice the passage of other Bills. Moreover, it was desirablethat the Cabinet should have a further opportunity of consideringthe issues of policy involved.(e) The Employment Medical Advisory Service Bill would makerelatively little demand on drafting resources, since it should bepossible to use clauses prepared for the previous Administration.Moreover, its introduction would be generally welcome; and underrevised proposals the manpower required could be found within theDepartment&apos;s ceiling.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the proposals in CP (71) 51, subject to the points which had been made. There should be further consideration of the
desirability of deferring the Bill on Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries:(Scotland) until parallel legislation for England and Wales waspossible, and of the possibility of including legislation on restrictive!trade practices in the Monopolies and Mergers Bill.The Cabinet 1. Approved the proposals in CP (71) 51, subject to the points?made in discussion.2.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry about the structure of thlsteel industry (CP (71) 38), to which were attached the draft of proposed Parliamentary statement and a note of the Governmentpolitical commitments on the subject.The Prime Minister said that, as agreed by the Cabinet on 3March, a small group of the Ministers most closely concerned, undelhis chairmanship, had given further.xonsideration to the proposal by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in CP (71) 38 that the basic steel-making responsibility of the British Steel Corporatici(BSC) should not be split.   They had endorsed the Secretary JJState&apos;s conclusions; and, if the Cabinet agreed, the Secretary of Stallwould announce them on 27 April.  They were that the necessafmodernisation of the industry would require substantial investmeiiin new, large, integrated plant, together with the closure of many Ithe existing smaller works in order to reduce costs; and that tlfinancing and management of this major programme of reorganisatiflcould be satisfactorily dealt with only on a national scale. It was clethat the bulk of Britain&apos;s crude steel-making capacity would nef
Cabinet Office, S.W.122 April, 1971to be kept as a single management unit if British steel was to beinternationally competitive in modern conditions. The bsc&apos;s presentsize was in fact no greater than that of its major foreign competitors.The proposed announcement would not pre-judge, however, the levelof basic capacity to be retained by the BSC or, indeed, its futuremanagement structure. These would be matters for furtherconsideration in the light of the Secretary of State&apos;s current reviewof BSC finance and development, as would also the appropriateboundary of the bsc&apos;s other activities. When that review was completed, probably by the autumn, it should be possible to take decisions about the requirement for a major new steelworks and itslocation. A number of other specific, but less major, decisions could probably be taken when the first stage of the review was completed,in about a month&apos;s time. The reorganisation of BSC managementwould also be a matter for consideration in the context of the review.The view that the bsc&apos;s present responsibility for basic steel-makingshould be maintained was shared by informed opinion throughoutthe steel industry; and an early announcement would improvemorale and provide the industry with a greater sense of stability,thus generating a better climate in which to secure the necessaryreorganisation of the bsc&apos;s management and control. The draft statement annexed to CP (71) 38 kept open the possibility of recruiting private and foreign capital and made it clear that theGovernment would welcome new steelworks developments in theprivate sector. This should be well received by the industry andthe Government^ supporters, even though the prospects of attractingprivate investment into basic steel-making were limited when the unit size of new plant was likely to be upwards of 10 million tonsand the Opposition maintained their present policy towards theindustry. There might be opportunities, however, for developingand financing new plant in partnership with major European steel-makers. In basic steel-making we should have to rely on the stimulusof external competition, which would be intensified if we joined theEuropean Economic Community; domestic competition with theprivate sector in finished products would also be enhanced by certainadjustments now being contemplated in the boundary between thetwo sectors.The Cabinet 1.  Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.,    2.   Approved the proposals in CP (71) 38.
