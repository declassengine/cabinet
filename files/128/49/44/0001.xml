SECRET*1. The Prime Minister said that the President of the UnitedStates had announced on the previous evening a wide range of neweconomic measures. In the field of prices and incomes policy, thePresident had said that he was ordering a freeze on all prices and wages for a period of 90 days. He did not however have power toenforce this measure and had indicated that he was relying on voluntary co-operation to make it work. Second, he was proposing to stimulate the expansion of the economy by substantial tax reduc-tions. These, however, were to be offset by economies inGovernment expenditure, including a considerable reduction inforeign economic aid. Third, he was imposing a surcharge of 10 percent on goods imported into the United States, in spite of the factthat the United States Government themselves had still not takenall the action to which they were committed under the kennedy round to reduce discrimination against foreign imports under theAmerican Selling Price policy and the Buy American Act. Fourth, hehad suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold and had calledfor1 a reform of the international monetary system. If the Londonexchange market had been allowed to remain open after this announcement, there would have been a large inflow of unwanteddollars. Instructions had therefore been given to close the market;and, in view of the continuing uncertainty, it would remain closed on17 August. The immediate need was to obtain some further clarifica-tion of the intentions of the United States Government, in order thatwe could decide our broad objectives and the manner in which theycoijld best be achieved. It was unlikely, however, that the Londonexchange market could remain closed for more than three days or so. This allowed very little time which to examine the complexissues involved; and we should have to consider what course to adoptif a settlement had not been reached before the market needed tobe reopened.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Volcker, the under-Secretary of the United States Treasury for Monetary Affairs,had arrived in London for a meeting with British, French, Germanand Italian officials. In a discussion between himself andMr. Volcker before the Cabinefs meeting, Mr. Volcker had said that president Nixon was not prepared to recommend to Congress anincrease in the official dollar price of gold. Mr. Volcker had giventhe impression that this was a firm position. He had also indicated that, before the import surcharge was removed, the United StatesGovernment would want not only to see the establishment of asatisfactory pattern of exchange parities but also to have assurances about the removal of unfair trading practices. He had confirmed,however, that the United States had no complaint against the UnitedKingdom on this score. In reply to a suggestion that, once theexchange parity problem had been settled, it would be unfair tomaihtain the surcharge against countries whose trade practices werenot disputed he had said that it was theoretically possible that the* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex.&apos;;SECJRET141771 12 a2InternationalMonetarySituation
surcharge might be lifted against some countries and not others butthat no decision had yet been taken on the way in which it wouldbe removed.In the middle of the holiday season it had been extremely difficultto ascertain the reactions of other European countries. If possible,however, it was hoped to arrange a meeting between ourselves andthe French, German and Italian officials after the meeting withMr. Volcker. At that stage, however, it was unlikely that. theseofficials would be able to express firm views on behalf of their governments. Meanwhile Mr. Schweitzer, the Managing Director ofthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), had arranged an immediatemeeting of the IMF Executive Board; and it was understood that hewould propose that there should be meetings of the IMF Board andof the Ministers of the Group of Ten in Washington in the course ofthe next few days. From our point of view there would be advantage in a meeting of the Ministers of the Group of Ten; and it would alsobe desirable first to have discussions at Ministerial level between. ourselves and the member countries of the European EconomicCommunities (e.c.). It was in the general interest of the UnitedKingdom that the benefit which we had gained from the recentchanges in other exchange rates should not be removed by a revalua-tion of sterling in relation to the dollar. Although our presentcurrent balance of payments was satisfactory, it was at presentbenefiting from the fact that the United Kingdom economy was working below capacity. Having regard to the burden which wouldbe placed on our balance of payments in due course by the cost of entry into the e.c., it was not in our interest to adopt any course which would impair the existing surplus; and it was to be hoped thatEuropean countries would recognise this. !In discussion it was pointed out that the United States Govern-ment appeared to be seeking the necessary adjustment of the dollarexchange parity by means of changes in the parities of other currencies. But, since the German, Dutch and Swiss currencies had recently been adjusted, the United States action seemed to bedirected mainly at Japan; and it was unreasonable that a surchargeshould be placed on imports from all her trading partners in orderto achieve this objective, particularly when, as in our own case, therewas no cause for complaint on the score of our trading practices.The United States Government might, however, have other objectivesas well, such as an improvement in the terms of their offset agreementwith the Federal Republic of Germany. Since it was probablyunrealistic to expect agreed parity changes to be effected very quickly,there was a risk of growing confrontation between Europe and theUnited States; and the scope of the discussion could become extendedbeyond the international monetary system to other issues, such asthe sharing of the European defence burden.. In the meantime thetrade surcharge would have a serious effect on our exports to theUnited States, probably reducing them by $400 million or more.This could have undesirable effects on employment in our exportingindustries; in particular, the surcharge might call in question once again the continuance of the Rolls-Royce RB211 engine project.
Even if a satisfactory pattern of exchange parities could be deter-mined fairly soon, Mr. Volcker had indicated that the United StatesGovernment would also require assurances on the removal of unfairtrade practices; and in any case they would be tempted to maintainthe surcharge until after the Presidential Election in 1972. our action when exchange markets reopened would have to take accountof the views of other European countries, which were not yetsufficiently known. It seemed impracticable to enforce a completeembargo on the inflow of dollars without detriment to ordinary com-mercial transactions. The alternative would be to allow the sterlingexchange rate to rise above its present limits, either by widening theexisting margins or by allowing the rate to float. There weredrawbacks, however, in allowing the rate to rise. The federal republic had found already that their export industries were beingadversely affected by the appreciation in the value of the Deutsche-nmrk. In our case, if the effect of an appreciated exchange rate were added to that of the trade surcharge, the effect on our exports couldbe very damaging.In further discussion it was suggested that in the long run thedifficulties confronting the United States might only be solved byan increase in the official dollar price of gold. There were several reasons, however, why the United States Government were unwilling to seek Congressional approval of this course. The argument thatit would tend to benefit the Soviet Union and South Africa wouldprobably not be conclusive in itself. In addition, however, theUnited States Government maintained that, if a change were oncemade in the official price, it would increase the expectation of further changes and thus impair the stability of the international monetary system. The most compelling reason was probably that it would be aserious blow to the political prestige of the United States Govern-ment; and, now that President Nixon had stated categorically thathe was not prepared to take this step, it was unlikely that it could bebrought about, at least in the short term.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the United Kingdom should support the demandwhich was expected to come from the Managing Director of theIMF for a meeting of Ministers of the Group of Ten and that weshould also seek to have discussions beforehand at Ministerial levelwith our future partners in the European Communities. He would consider further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the light6f;. Mr.1 Schweitzer&apos;s message when it was received, how best theseaims could be secured. On the substantive issues the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should be guided by the views which had been expressed in discussion. In particular, he should seek to avoid achange in the parity of sterling with the dollar, on the grounds thatany impartial assessment of the relative price levels involved, of theprospects for our balance of payments and of our trading practices in general provided no justification for the setback to our exportswhich the United States action1 would otherwise involve. Theposition to be adopted by the United Kingdom in the further inter-national discussions could only be finally determined, however, in
the light of the outcome of the discussions with other european countries.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.northern ireland previous reference:CM (71) 43rd!Conclusions,Minute 3SECRET2.

The Prime Minister reviewed the course of recent exchangeswith the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mintoff, and the discussions which had taken place within NATO on the response to be made tohis; demands. On 13 August the Government of Malta haddemanded acceptance by us of their proposals as the basis for detailed negotiations, coupled with an advance unconditionalpayment of  2 million, both to be conceded by the night of Wednesday-day, 18 August; if we were to decline, they would regard both theBritish and NATO arrangements as terminated. Over the weekendwe had tried to concert with our allies in NATO a message fromthe Prime Minister designed to leave open the possibility of further negotiations (for which the Secretary of State for Defence was readyto go to Malta) without conceding the demand for an unconditionalcash advance. Although it had been our hope to secure NATOagreement on such a reply before the Maltese Parliament met atmidday on 16 August, divergences of opinion within NATO about an unconditional advance of funds had delayed the settlement of an agreed text reflecting the substance of our own views; and agreement had only just been reached.In discussion Ministers agreed that it was impossible to judge the extent to which the reply might prompt new demands from theGovernment of Malta.   If it were delivered forthwith it might provoke a further message from Mr. Mintoff designed to exploit the idivergences of opinion within NATO, particularly as regards the iunconditional advance payment, of which he was already aware.It was agreed that it would be most advantageous if the HighCommissioner were not instructed to deliver the agreed reply to 1
Mr. Mintoff until midday on 17, August. In the meantime it was believed possible that certain other members of the. NATO Alliance(the United States and Germany) might take the initiative in providing the Maltese Government with an unconditional advanceof funds. Such an initiative need: not necessarily affect our own position. For our part, however, we should stand firmly upon ourown basic proposal, which had been endorsed by NATO as awhole.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toarrange for instructions to be sent to our High Commis-sioner in Valletta after midday on 17 August to deliverto Mr. Mintoff the agreed text of the Prime Minister^message.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to hold himself in readiness to visit Malta, if Mr. Mintoff responded to:   ;   ;;      the offer for immediate further discussion contained inic,      the Prime Ministers message.Cabinet Office,i 17 August, 1971.
