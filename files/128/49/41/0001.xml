NationalHealthServicePay ofDesignatedand GeneralGrades1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP (71) 89) by theSecretary of State for the Home Department on the pay of designatedand general grades in the National Health Service (NHS).The Home Secretary said that the pay of the 45,000Administrative and Clerical Staff in the NHS had for nine years been based on agreed relativities with the non-industrial Civil Service;and each increase in Civil Service pay had been reflected threemonths later in a comparable award to NHS staffs. The NHSnegotiating committee was due to meet on the following day; andthe Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations had therefore considered whether it would be right to adhere to the accepted practice, which would require an offer approaching10 per cent from 1 April, in line with the recent awards, based on pay research, to non-industrial civil servants in comparable gradesor whether the Government should break with past practice andrestrict the offer within the range of 7 -8  per cent which was their objective for public sector pay settlements in the second half of1971. Although there was not, in the case of the NHS, a clearwritten commitment corresponding to that recently given to thenon-industrial Civil Service, an offer of less than 9^-10 per cent would breach the accepted procedures and would risk an immediatebreakdown in the negotiations; this might result in an arbitration,the outcome of which might be incompatible with the government&apos;s policy. On the other hand, an offer approaching 10 per cent madeas late as July could have awkward repercussions on other currentpay negotiations and might appear to breach the government&apos;s policy at a time when, following the Chancellor of the Exchequersstatement of 19 July, the unions would be watching closely theGovernments resolution in their efforts to reduce the level of pay settlements. The Ministerial Committee had agreed that there wasno middle course between, on the one hand, adhering to therelativities established for the NHS for the past 9 years, whichwould imply making an opening offer of at least % per cent, being prepared to settle at up to 10 per cent and defending this as an award to enable lost ground to be recovered and, on the otherhand, making an offer in the range of per cent, which would represent a clean break with the past and would have to be justified as being necessary in the national interest.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that negotiations on the 1971 pay settlements for the NHS must be regarded as having started in April, when an offer of 9 - 9 per cent, which hadbeen agreed interdepartmentally, had been made to the secretarialgrades. This offer was related to the central pay increase awardedto Civil Service grades, including secretarial grades, whose pay wasnot subject to pay research this year. At the time when that offer was made the corresponding Civil Service awards based on pay research had yet to be settled; and negotiations for the linked NHSdesignated and general grades were in effect adjourned pending theCivil Service pay research settlements. At that time, therefore, ithad been generally assumed by both parties to the negotiations that the agreed relativities with the non-industrial Civil Service
were still recognised and would be observed. It would be indefensible to seek now to change the basis of settling NHS pay inrespect of the 1971 settlement; and, if the Government did so, theymust expect to be faced with arbitration, militancy by the gradesconcerned and charges of bad faith, which would attract greaterpublic attention than a prompt settlement based on the hithertoaccepted relativities. The Government were, of course, fully entitledto give notice that they would not recognise these relativities forthe future, even though this might not be wise: the present system had operated in general to restrain the level of pay increases overthe years and any alternative system might well prove more costlyin the long term.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that, although the nhs negotiations properly formed part of the earlier round of pay increases, they would in fact be taking place at the end of July whenother offers in negotiations which formed part of the current roundwere being limited to a maximum of 8^ per cent. These included the negotiations with the industrial Civil Service, which it was hoped to settle below 8  per cent, and those with local authority staffs inwhich agreement had provisionally been reached on an average increase of 8^ per cent. If the NHS were now offered 10 per cent,there would be considerable risk that the unions concerned would seek to reopen that provisional settlement. Moreover, the cabinet had only recently accepted that the economic measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 19 July, together with the confederation of British Industry&apos;s proposals for price restraint by its members, should be regarded as the occasion for intensifying,rather than relaxing, the attempt to reduce the level of pay settlements. In these circumstances the Government should not contemplate a settlement exceeding 8  per cent in a field for whichthey were directly responsible, particularly since there was no formal commitment to adhere to the previous links between NHSand Civil Service pay. The fact that the unions had claimed a30 per cent increase for the NHS suggested that, for their part, theydid not regard these links as binding.It was argued on the other hand that the Government had atleast a strong moral obligation to observe existing procedures for settling NHS pay, which had consistently followed that of the CivilService whether the awards in question had been generous or the reverse. It would seem particularly unfair to break the links in a yearwhen a settlement, based on pay research, for the majority of those affected should allow them to make good their arrears in relation tothe comparable levels of pay elsewhere. It should be perfectlypossible, as in the case of the Civil Service, to present the NHSsettlement as an award designed to make up lost ground anddictated by the need to observe agreed procedures. If, on theother hand, the Government were to breach those procedures andto restrict the offer to 7^-8^ per cent after negotiations had begunon the established basis, they would be bound to face charges of bad faith and an arbitration award which might be even higher than a negotiated settlement. Moreover, by continuing to observe the accepted procedures the Government could make a virtue of their
consistency, particularly since in some cases, for example the scientific Civil Service, they had relied on the agreed proceduresto justify very restricted offers. Since the principal union involvedin the NHS negotiations was the National Union of LocalGovernment Officers, who would be fully aware of the distinctionbetween a settlement for the NHS according to accepted pay linksand the quite different basis of settling the pay of local authoritystaffs, there should be no adverse repercussions on the provisionalsettlement already reached for the latter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thearguments had suggested that, although there was no writtencommitment to the existing basis of settling NHS pay, the 1971negotiations had in fact begun on the footing of an existing pay linkand it appeared that the impression had been given that the pay ofthe designated and general grades would also be based on theirpreviously accepted relativities with the Civil Service. If so, theGovernment might well be exposed to a charge of bad faith if they now sought to break these relativities in the current round of negotiations. The Ministerial Steering Committee on pay negotiations should therefore reconsider the position urgently in thelight of this new information. In the event of disagreement aboutthe offer which should now be authorised, the Cabinet would considerthe matter again at their meeting on the following day. The questionof maintaining the links between NHS and Civil Service pay forthe future would be a matter for the Committee to consider as partof their general examination of existing pay links and procedures.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the HomeSecretary to arrange for the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations to proceed accordingly.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (71) 90) on non-industrial manpower in the Civil Service.The Lord Privy Seal said that his discussions with departmental ministers about the savings which could be made in Civil service non-industrial manpower had so far resulted in undertakings toreduce numbers by nearly 4,000, the most significant contributionshaying been made by the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury.This, however, was less than half the planning target of a 2 per cent reduction accepted by the Cabinet; and on this basis the numberof non-industrial civil servants would rise to over 506,000 by theend of the current financial year, an increase of nearly 10,000 sincethe General Election in 1970. He hoped to be able to reducethe number below 500,000 again on 1 April, 1972; and the removalof the Civil Aviation Authority from the definition of the CivilService would contribute to this end. Nevertheless, it was clear from his consultations with Ministers that, in their view,implementation of essential policies made some rise in total numbers inevitable.   There were particular difficulties in some
Departments, especially those concerned with the high level ofunemployment. If numbers were not to rise to 529,000 by April1975, early decisions would have to be taken on a number of services whose cessation or transfer outside the Civil Service would lead to a reduction in the total strength of the Service. Wheredecisions could not be taken by October a considered judgment onthe prospects was needed to assist future planning. He intended tomake proposals for improvements in the presentation of staffrequirements by the end of September. Although no form of presentation could fully conceal a rise in numbers or, indeed,disguise the true significance of the transfer of work from the CivilService, he would seek to put the numbers employed by government Departments in a more correct perspective as a small part of the total manpower employed by the public sector; and hewould try to direct attention away from the mere aggregate of,: civil servants in total to the relative numbers engaged in differentcategories of work, in particular distinguishing between headquarters staff and those employed on executive work and between those employed on civil activities and defence work.In discussion it was emphasised that regard must be paid to theactual needs of Departments in relation to the situations which theyfaced. For example the high level of unemployment would impose a continuing additional strain upon the staff of the Department ofHealth and Social Security, who were already under heavy pressure on account of other commitments. Subject to considerations of thiskind, there should be broad parity of treatment as between departments; but in present circumstances it would not be realisticto seek to present staff reductions as being attributable mainly to areduction in the level of Governmental activity.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the reductions in staff forecast by departmental ministers were insufficient to prevent a rise in numbers of non-industrial civil servants before the end of the financial year andthat the Lord Privy Seal would make proposals by the end of;September for a new system of presenting manpower requirements.They agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should continue his discussions with a view to ensuring a reduction of the total number below 500,000on 1 April, 1972, assuming that the Civil Aviation Authority was thenremoved from the definition of the Civil Service. They also agreedthat firm decisions should be taken before the end of October on proposals for the transfer of work outside the Civil Service or theabandonment or reduction of Departmental functions and that, for those cases in which decisions could not be reached by that time,precise assessments of the prospects of making significant changes should be made.The Cabinet-Took  note,  with  approval,  of the  Prime  Ministers &apos;]summing up of their discussion.
