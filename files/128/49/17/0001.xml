The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that the Tupamaros had released the Uruguayan attorney general, Senor Berro Oribe, who had reported that he had seenHM Ambassador, Mr. Jackson, within the past few days and thathe was well and in good spirits. But there were still no signs thathis captors were contemplating his early release.Sierra Leone The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that reports from Freetown indicated that there had been an attempt tooverthrow the Government of Sierra Leone. The situation was stillsomewhat confused; but it appeared that the Prime Minister ofSierra Leone, Dr. Stevens, had successfully reasserted his authority.Ilndo-ChinaIPreviouspreference:KM (71) HthConclusions,i. Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Communistforces were now exerting great pressure on the area of LuangPrabang, the Royal capital in the northern part of Laos. We hadbeen asked by the Laotian Government to reconvene the geneva conference on Indo-China; but the Soviet Union remained unwilling to participate. In the southern part of the country the south vietnamese forces were withdrawing under heavy attack from the communists; but according to United States reports they had firsteffected a significant disruption of Communist supply lines.The Cabinet-Took  note of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.1-     132977-2SECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week. They tendered theircongratulations to the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaryof State for Employment and the Chief Whip on the successfulpassage of the Industrial Relations Bill through the Commons.
Oil SuppliesPreviousReference:CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute 3   &apos;3. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said thatreports from Tripoli indicated that agreement between the LibyanGovernment and the oil companies was probably near. But,although the Libyan Government had modified their original terms to some extent, the agreement was likely to prove very expensivefor us in terms of both the additional cost to the balance ofpayments, which in the first year might be of the order of  70 million,and the risk that it might provoke the reopening of the settlement which had recently been concluded with other oil-producing countries.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe increasing cost of oil would have serious consequences for our economy. Urgent consideration should therefore be given to the examination of possible means of defending ourselves against further unreasonable price increases, including the possibility thatthe Governments of consuming countries might combine to resistunreasonable demands by the suppliers.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.SECRETIndustrialAffairsBritish Rail4. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the british railways Board were standing firm on their present offer of a wage increase of 9 per cent despite the five to four decision of theExecutive Committee of the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen to ban overtime after midnight on 4 April.There was good reason to believe that the other unions involved were prepared to settle for 9 per cent. Discussions between theBoard and the unions were continuing; but, if the overtime ban didtake place, the Government should publicly condemn it.MotorIndustryPreviousReference:CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute 6The Secretary of State for Employment said that the Ford strikewas now in its eighth week and there was still no sign of a changeof attitude by either party. There might be a meeting of Ford&apos;national Joint Negotiating Committee on the following day; but thiswas not yet certain. PAYE refunds of income tax to the strikershad now ended. The Vauxhall management, who faced a similarindustrial dispute, appeared to be waiting for the outcome at Ford&apos;sand had so far tabled an offer which corresponded to the Ford offer.There was a serious risk, however, that the Vauxhall management,
secret. The Prime Minister said that, following the LockheedCorporation^ rejection of our original proposal for joint develop-ment of the RB 211 engine, our representatives had put forward anew proposal in negotiations in the United States. Under this latestoffer we would finance all further development of the engine up to42,000 lb. thrust and the Lockheed Corporation would accept a price increase designed to ensure that we should receive  97 million more-2b* 2who were determined at all costs to avoid a strike, would undermineFord&apos;s negotiating position by offering more than Ford. He was doing his best to dissuade VauxhalFs from such a course.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that social security benefits were at present being paid on behalf of Fordstrikers&apos; families at the rate of  80,000 a week. The special officeswhich had been set up in certain districts for the payment of these benefits were directed less to assisting the strikers than to mitigatingthe inconvenience which the normal recipients of social benefits mainly the sick and elderly would otherwise experience.The Secretary of State for Employment said that a three-manCommittee of Settlement had been appointed to resolve the PostOffice dispute. Both sides had agreed that in the event of a failure to agree in the Committee they would accept the ruling of theChairman, Sir Henry Hardman.The Secretary of State for Employment said that settlementshad been reached on pay increases for manual workers in theelectricity and gas industries, the former On the basis ofthe Wilberforce Report and the latter on the basis of a 10 per cent increase, together with a lead-in bonus similar to that granted tothe electricity workers. Sir Henry Jones, Chairman of the gas council, had done well to obtain agreement in the gas industry belowthe settlement in the electricity industry.The Prime Minister said that, since the present round of public sector wage claims was nearly completed and a new round wasabout to begin, it would be appropriate to give further consideration in the near future to the Governments economic strategy. Down-ward pressure on wages and salaries settlements must be firmlymaintained; and the latest proposals for an increase in the Londonallowance paid to the Civil Service should be examined in this light.
than under the original contract. Total receipts should then offsetproduction costs, as hitherto estimated. On this basis Lockheecfscounter-proposals on engine price (equivalent to additional receipts of  32 million or  42 million) fell far short of our requirements. TheCorporation were also seeking to impose other unacceptableconditions about the price of future engines and spares and the size and terms of an order for the TriStar by British European Airways.Our negotiators had also sought to obtain a warrantyguaranteeing reimbursement of all our expenditure if the TriStarproject failed for other than technical reasons. Lockheed had made it clear from the outset, however, that they were unable to offer anyguarantee of this kind. On the other hand the United States Secretaryof the Treasury had informed HM Ambassador in Washington thathe would be prepared to advise President Nixon to ask Congress toauthorise a warranty if we reached a settlement with Lockheed on price and other outstanding questions. This offer, however, couldnot be regarded as wholly satisfactory, since there could be no certainty that Congress would grant the necessary authority to thePresident. Even so, a clear statement of intent from the United states administration would be difficult to dismiss, since we should then beill placed to justify a subsequent breakdown of the negotiations onthe grounds of inability to obtain any form of warranty.In these circumstances the Secretary of State for Defence and the attorney-General had gone to Washington in order to ascertain more precisely how far we could rely on the warranty arrangementsproffered by the United States Administration and to explore thepossibility of reducing the difference on the engine price. Onthe understanding that Rolls-Royce&apos;s estimate of excess production costs had now been reduced to  80 million, the Secretary of State hadbeen authorised to reduce our demand to this figure in terms of unitengine price. The Rolls-Royce Board had subsequently advised,however, that excess production costs would be  91 million. TheSecretary of State nevertheless sought authority to maintain ourdemand at the level of  80 million, on the understanding that anyfurther concession would be considered only if Lockheed wereprepared to increase their own offer to  50 million or more and toabandon their unacceptable requirements on other points.In discussion it was emphasised that, in agreeing to defray alldevelopment costs (at least  100 million) and to accept an engineprice involving a significant loss on production, we had moved a longway from our original position. It would be very difficult to justifythe further concession which would be involved in accepting a price which would yield additional receipts of less than  80 million.
secret . The Cabinet considered a Note by the Home Secretary(CP (71) 34), reporting the main conclusions reached by the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment onthe Roskill Commission^ recommendations concerning the timing and site of the Third London Airport (TLA).The Secretary of State for the Environment said that, subject toa reservation by Treasury Ministers, the Committee had endorsed the Roskill Commission^ recommendation that planning should proceed forthwith with the aim of bringing the TLA into operation in 1980. Treasury Ministers, while accepting that the airport wouldbe needed in the early 1980s, wished to keep open the possibility thatthe date could be deferred by imposing a tax on air travel in orderto retard the growth of traffic. A majority of the Committee had concluded that for both environmental and political reasons it wouldbe impossible to choose an inland site for the TLA and that, despiteits economic disadvantages, Foulness must therefore be selected.In further discussion it was recognised that the negotiations might fail and that the RB 211 project would be cancelled. If so, itwould be necessary to have regard to the public presentation of theGovernment^ case, particularly in relation to areas such as Derbyand Glasgow where local employment would be liable to be severely affected. We should seek to avoid a final break taking place at the weekend in order that the necessary announcement might be madefirst to Parliament. It would be desirable to ensure that the UnitedStates President had been made personally aware of our position before any final breakdown in the negotiations took place.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the negotiating instructions given to the Secretary of State for Defence and the attorney-General.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Defence should beauthorised to offer an engine price to Lockheed whichwould yield receipts of  80 million in addition to thoseobtainable under the original contract, notwithstanding that on the latest Rolls-Royce estimate this would stillinvolve a significant loss on production; but that heshould make no further concession without seeking freshinstructions.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, however, considered ithat Thurleigh would not be so objectionable from an environmental Jpoint of view as Cublington and would be sufficiently attractive to 1the airlines to ensure transfer of services from Heathrow and other 1existing airports, so reducing the level of noise in the Heathrow area. IIf the Cabinet confirmed the choice of Foulness, it would be necessary to take an early decision about the relocation of the 1Shoeburyness gunnery range. The existing proposal to resite the frange at Pembrey had produced strong public opposition in Wales; Iand the Secretary of State for Wales considered that it should be Irejected. It would therefore be desirable to reach a conclusion on.Ithis issue before any public announcement was made of the JGovernments decisions on the TLA.1The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he 1recognised that, if the Government were to choose Thurleigh, much 1of the public opposition which at present was focusing on Cublington Iwould be transferred to Thurleigh. He would not therefore press his iopposition to Foulness. But it should be recognised that it would be 1substantially more difficult to divert traffic to Foulness from existing Iairports and that, if pressure had to be put on foreign airlines for this 1purpose, there might be retaliation against our own airlines, with!consequent damage to their overseas earnings.In discussion it was suggested that it would be desirable tollexamine the case for some taxation of civil air traffic; but such a istudy should not lead to the postponement of an announcement that Hthe aim would be to bring the TLA into operation in 1980.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that Sthe Cabinet agreed that the TLA should be sited at Foulness and 1should be brought into operation in 1980.   Further consideration!should be given to the possibility of encouraging private capital to Iparticipate in the development of the TLA and of combining the. 1airport with a major new port development. The Secretary of State!for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Trade and]Industry should consider whether existing controls over the growth!of traffic at municipal airports were adequate.  The Committee onjRegional Policy should now seek to reach a conclusion on the!relocation of the Shoeburyness range; and, in doing so, they should!take fully into account the employment needs of the Development;!Areas. As soon as a decision on this issue had been taken the HomelSecretary, in consultation with the Lord President, the Secretaries offState for the Environment and for Trade and Industry and the otherfMinisters concerned, should determine the form and timing of the]announcement of the Governments decisions on the TLA and onlthe range.    Meanwhile there must be no premature public!disclosure of the Cabinets conclusions.
confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP (71) 36) on the date of rent increases under the reform of housing finance.The Minister for Housing and Construction said that theCabinet, when approving the proposals for the reform of housing finance, had stipulated that rent increases in the public sector shouldbe hmited to an average of 50p a week in any year, with a maximum of 75p for any one dwelling; and it had been assumed in the public expenditure Review that increases of this order would be effectivethroughout 1972-73. It was now clear, however, that the necessaryBill could not become law before the summer of 1972 and that theearliest date from which local authorities and others could be compelled to increase their rents was 1 October, 1972. If no further action was taken, therefore, the savings in public expenditure fromthis source, so far as England and Wales were concerned, would beThe Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to considerthe possibility of encouraging participation by private capital in the development of the Third London Airportand of combining the airport with major port develop-ment.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment and theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry to examine whether existing controls over the growth of traffic atmunicipal airports were adequate.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the Committeeon Regional Policy and the Environment to reach anearly conclusion on the relocation of the ShoeburynessGunnery Range and thereafter to decide in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council and the other ministers concerned, the form and timing of the simultaneous announcement of the Government^decisions on the Third London Airport and on theresiting of the Range.
reduced by  60 million in 1972-73 and by lesser amounts in thefollowing years.  He had accordingly sought, in consultation withthe  Chief  Secretary,  Treasury,  means   of  encouraging localauthorities to raise their rents at an earlier stage.  The majority of authorities in England and Wales could be relied upon to co-operate!with the Government; but some sanction was necessary to deal with!those who would not.  He therefore proposed that the Bill should!provide that, in so far as fair rent levels permitted, every authority!should be required to raise its rents by  1 a week in October 19721unless it had already raised them by an appropriate amount in thelpreceding 12 months. Thus, an authority which had raised its rents!by 25p in October 1971 would need only to make a further incrcaieof 50p in October 1972. The position in Scotland was more difficult 1because the majority of authorities could not be relied upon tolco-operate with the Government.   A different solution could hadopted for Scotland without embarrassment; but, if the effect was!to defer rent increases, there would be pressure for similar deferment Iin England and Wales.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a much higher Iproportion of houses were owned by local authorities in Scotland!than in England and Wales; and rent levels were a sensitive political 1issue. The local authorities would not voluntarily increase -rents!The proposals approved by the Cabinet in October 1970 had been!acceptable to him because the progression to true rents was to take!place in reasonable steps of 50p a week. But the increases which!would result from the formula now proposed would amount in somelcases to 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the present rates; and theyfwould have a marked effect on the cost of living, which would!particularly affect tenants with incomes in the  25- 30 a week range!So sharp an increase would imperil the Governments policy of]raising rents to realistic levels.In discussion anxiety was expressed about the effect of the&apos;Jproposals on the Governments policy of gradually reducing the rate:Jof wage increases. It would be impossible to restrict wage increases!to  2 a week or so once it was known that the Government werqjto require rent increases averaging  la week; and they would be;accused of speaking with two voices. On the other hand the earlier!announcement of the Governments housing policy had not in fact!prevented substantial progress being made towards reducing wagfisettlements; and the  1 a week increase now proposed was no more?than the sum of increases which would otherwise have been spreatover a longer period.   The problem was essentially one dipresentation; and the relevant provisions should be expressed iiterms of a withdrawal of subsidy rather than directly in terms of arj
132977-2c*increase of rent. Realisation of the savings forecast in the public expenditure review was essential if the Government were to havefreedom of manoeuvre in the taxation field. But a limit, perhaps 1.25p, should be set to the increase which might be imposed onany one dwelling in order to prevent authorities from exploiting theposition for political purposes.Rents in Scotland had long been much lower than in Englandand Wales. This strengthened the case for increasing them; but it also implied that any increase would appear proportionately larger than in England. If rents in Scotland were to be raised to a realistic level, this must be done gradually over a period of years.It might admittedly be difficult to justify different courses in the twocountries; but Scottish rents presented a separate problem, to whicha separate solution must be found.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed the proposals in CP (71) 36 so far as England andWales were concerned, subject to the imposition of a limit on theincrease which might be applied to any one dwelling. In view ofthe political importance of the matter they would wish to see theterms of any public statement. The Secretary of State for Scotland,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, should give further consideration in the light of their discussion to the provision to be made for raising rents in Scotland.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved the proposals in CP (71) 36 in relation to Englandand Wales, subject to the imposition of a limit on theincrease in the rent of any individual dwelling.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to circulate the draft text of any public statement on thissubject.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor the Environment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to the staging of rent increases in Scotland.
UnemploymentBenefit lotOccupationalPensionersPreviousReference :CM (71) 13thConclusions,Minute 3SteelIndustryBritishSteelCorporationPricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 29thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum CP (71) 37 by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry about steel prices.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that therehad been a progressive deterioration in the finances of the british steel Corporation (BSC); and a substantial increase in steel prices was now needed. The BSC wished to raise prices by an average of14 per cent, to yield additional revenue of  165 million in a full year.But, taking account of the serious implications of such an increase for steel users and for the Governments policy of reducing wagedemands, together with the potential damage to our competitive position of raising domestic prices to a level equal to the highest steel prices in the European Economic Community, he recommendedrestricting the average increase to 10 per cent. This would obligethe Corporation to discharge surplus labour and to close obsolescentplant faster in order to achieve cost savings. But it was unlikelythat the whole of the shortfall could be offset in that way; and the 8. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the eligibility of occupational pensioners for unemployment benefit. They had before them memoranda by the Secretary of State for Social Services(CP (71) 27 and 33).The Secretary of State for Social Services reminded the Cabinetthat he proposed to include in the Bill to give effect to the social security Review for 1971 a provision restricting the eligibility ofcertain occupational pensioners for unemployment benefit. Menover 60 with occupational pensions of  30 a week or more wouldnot qualify for unemployment benefit or contribution credits unless they had satisfied a test of six months further work since retirement.The benefit payable to those over 60 with occupational pensionsabove  18 a week would be reduced on a sliding scale. In order tohelp those who would lose contribution credits he proposed to allownon-employed people over 60 to pay a non-employed person&apos;contribution each week voluntarily instead of compulsorily. Sincethe Cabinet had last discussed the matter he had consulted theGovernments supporters in the House of Commons who had aspecial interest in the issues involved. Although a few saw some difficulty in his proposals, most of those whom he had consultedagreed that they should be carried through.The Cabinet- rApproved the proposals about unemployment benefit foroccupational pensioners contained in paragraph 10 of cp (71) 27.
Corporation^ borrowings from the National Loans Fund (NLF)might rise by some  20 million. Both for this reason and becausethe Government ought not to override the bsc&apos;s commercial judgment and so accept responsibility themselves for any failure bythe Corporation to pay its way, the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy had considered it preferable to raise steel prices bythe full 14 per cent. On the other hand the Iron and SteelConsumers Council (ISCC) had on their own initiative alreadyexamined the bsc&apos;s proposals and were expected to argue that theincrease should be restricted to 7 per cent, primarily on the groundthat the market could not sustain a heavier increase. The council had not yet considered the distribution of the increases between steel products; but in face of their recommendation it would now bedifficult for the Government to allow an average increase of 14 percent without provoking the resignation of the Chairman and some members of the Council. He was accordingly reinforced in his viewthat the increase should be restricted to 10 per cent.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that to allow the bsc the full 14 per cent price increase which they sought would beto place an indefensible degree of reliance upon the judgment of a management which had demonstrably failed to deal with theindustry&apos;s financial and other problems. A 14 per cent increase wastwice the amount which the ISCC felt the market would bear; andit would have ramifications throughout the economy, imposingparticularly heavy increases on the shipbuilding and food processingindustries.   The Government should therefore restrict the average increase to no more than 10 per cent and should hold theCorporation to the requirement to break even in 1971-72 as adiscipline to cut their costs, to reduce overmanning and to accelerate the closure of old plant.  On the other hand it was unrealistic to suppose that, if the BSC were allowed only a 10 per cent increase,they would be able to reduce costs soon enough to avoid, first, ahigher call on borrowings from the NLF and, second, a further price increase later in the year if they were still to break even.   If theGovernment had no confidence in the bsc&apos;s commercial judgmentand efficiency, they should change the Corporation^ managementrather than overrule it and thereby accept responsibility for theconsequences. But a new management could not be installed rapidly;and the first essential was to complete the re-examination of theCorporation^ affairs which the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry had already put in hand.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould arrange for a small group of Ministers under his chairmanshipto give further consideration to the issues raised by CP (71) 37 andby the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal in CP (71) 38 that the basic iron
and steel making capacity of the BSC should not be split. TheCabinet would resume their discussion at a future meeting.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Coal PricesPreviousReference:CM (70) 34thConclusions,Minute 5Iconfidential!10.   The Lord President of the Council said that the Ministerial committee I on Economic Policy had recently considered proposals!to increase coal prices.   Some increase was essential in order tolprevent the accumulated deficit of the National Coal Board (NCB)1from rising further in 1971-72.  There were two possible courses:first, to increase prices sufficiently to enable the Board on present estimates to break even on all coal, using the expected profit from]opencast operations to cross-subsidise deep-mined coal; and, second,to increase prices sufficiently for the NCB to break even on deep-mined coal.   The latter course, which would require increases off6 per cent on industrial and domestic coal, 11 per cent on coking,coal and 13 per cent on smokeless fuels, offered a better prospect of Iavoiding a further price increase in the autumn.   Subject to thejstatutory consultations with the Consumers Council, the industrial!and coking coal increases would come into force in April; but those!for domestic users which would be at the same level whichever!course was chosen would not come into effect until July, when anjuprating of supplementary benefit allowances would have been!announced and consumers would have had the advantage of two!months&apos; summer price reductions based on present price levels. committee had therefore agreed to recommend the second course,!subject only to further consideration by the Secretary of State for!Trade and Industry, in consultation with the Secretary of State for!Scotland and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, of the price differentialwhich it was proposed to charge on Scottish coal. This point coullbe dealt with separately between the Ministers concerned and neetjfnot delay the implementation of the price increases.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals for coal price increases which halfbeen agreed by the Economic Policy Committee aniloutlined by the Lord President of the Council.
