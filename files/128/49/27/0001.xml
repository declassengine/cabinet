SubjectEuropean Economic Community
SECRET*The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the outcome ofhis discussions with the French President, M. Pompidou, in Paris on20 and 21 May.He had been impressed by the warmth of the welcome whichhad been extended to him; and he was now satisfied that PresidentPompidou, sensing the change in the balance of power both inEurope and in the world as a whole, wished to put an end to themisunderstandings of the last 20 years between Britain and Franceand to effect a genuine reconciliation between the two countries.Agreement had been reached without difficulty on the futured development of Europe and on the more effective international rolewhich could be discharged by an enlarged European economic community (e.c.). President Pompidou had explicitly welcomed the moral and political contribution which Britain could make tothis process. There had been little discussion of European defence policy; and it had been accepted that this was a matter to, be pursued at a later stage, after Britain had entered the e.c.. For themoment it had been recognised that, for historical reasons, Franceand Britain pursued rather different policies in relation to the defenceof Europe, particularly in view of the British relationship with theUnited States in the nuclear context.In discussion of the institutions of the Community he and president Pompidou had agreed that, notwithstanding the valuablepart to be played by the European Commission, important decisions should continue to be reserved to the Council of Ministers and thatthe processes of harmonising national policies should not be allowedto override essential national interests. We were therefore nowcommitted to accept the &quot; Luxembourg formula &quot;, which requiredthat, whenever the vital national interests of any one or more members were at stake, decisions should in practice be taken by unanimous agreement; and it should not be necessary to attachundue importance to the fact that the formulation of this principle was expressed in rather different terms by the French Governmentand by the Five respectively.As we had expected, President Pompidou had expressed concern that the primacy of the French language in the transaction of theCommunity&apos;s affairs should not be endangered when Britain became a member. But he had been satisfied with an assurance that wewere taking steps to ensure that all members of the British staffsengaged in the business of the Community would be able to speakFrench as their working language; and he had welcomed our suggestion that steps should now be taken to promote an increasein cultural exchanges between Britain and France.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET132993-4b*
As regards the future of sterling, it had emerged that the realbasis of President Pompidou&apos;s anxiety was the link between sterling and the dollar for the purpose of the guarantee given to sterlingholders under the Basle arrangements. But he had accepted thaithis was a matter which could not be settled in the immediate futurpand must be further pursued in the context of the measures totaken to effect greater harmonisation of the monetary policies pfethe member countries of the Community during the years ahead;would be for consideration, when the Basle arrangements fell duelfor further renewal in 1973, whether it would be desirable to renew!them and, if so, in what form. President Pompidou had at no stage!raised the issue of non-discrimination (between the e.c. and!the Sterling Area) in British controls over capital movements.There had been considerable discussion about the future oflassociated States when the time came to renew the Yaounde!Convention. President Pompidou had appreciated that his ownfconcern to protect the rights of the existing associated States must!be harmonised with our concern to safeguard the interests of future!associates under a new Convention, particularly of those who!depended largely on exports to the enlarged Community of sugar!and other primary products. It was clear that on this issue there!was a substantial identity of interest between France and Britain;!and once we were members of the Community it would be possible!for us to exploit this fact in order to ensure that the interests of those&apos;associated States who would look to us for protection would beladequately safeguarded. For tactical reasons, however, it would!obviously be necessary to avoid emphasising this too explicitly inlpublic at the present stage.Agreement had also been reached upon the need to negotiate!suitable arrangements for those members of the European FreejTrade Area who were not applying for membership of the enlarged!Community; and on the importance of creating conditions, including!anew corpus of European company law, to facilitate the growth olcompanies with a genuinely European identity.President Pompidou was concerned to ensure that Community^policies were developed to protect key sectors of industry fromffltakeover by interests outside the Community; and to a\oidlcompetitive over-bidding by member States to attract foreign ainvestment for regional development.Finally the discussions had surveyed the outstanding issues infljthe detailed negotiations for British accession to the e.c.. He hadjimade clear that the British Government accepted without reserve^the system of Community finance which had already been adoptedaand were prepared to work out transitional arrangements based on;the framework recently proposed by the French Government. Hellhad added that the British Government considered that a gross M
contribution equivalent to about 6 per cent of the total community budget in the first year of United Kingdom membership wouldprovide a reasonable settlement. President Pompidou had repliedthat 11J per cent seemed more reasonable but that in the detailed negotiations in Brussels the French delegation would not press for astarting figure which constituted a serious burden for the Britishbalance of payments, taking into account the other costs of UnitedKingdom membership and the need to repay debt. PresidentPompidou also accepted that a period of &quot; correctives &quot; should beprovided after the end of the five-year transitional period and before we took on the full obligations of the definitive Community system.As regards the Fisheries Regulation President Pompidouhad accepted that, for political reasons, it would be necessary forthe British Government to secure some modification of the existingproposal; he had been concerned only to emphasise that in Francealso the issue was politically sensitive and to request that we should therefore avoid drawing undue attention to any concession whichwe obtained. He had been equally appreciative of the political importance to the British Government of achieving satisfactory arrangements for New Zealand. It had been agreed in principle that,whatever the precise form of these arrangements, they should provide for a review at the end of five year; and this should go farin practice to ensure New Zealand some degree of permanent accessfor her products to the Community market. The problem had beenremitted, on this basis, for further consideration in the negotiations in Brussels. It had emerged that cheese would be a more sensitiveitem than butter in terms of the French interests involved.As a result of these exchanges he and President Pompidou had felt able to state publicly that it was both possible and desirable toreach agreement on the main issues in the enlargement negotiationsduring June. This was a very satisfactory outcome, which reflectedan undoubted conviction on the part of President Pompidou that thetime had come to admit Britain to the e.c.. This was probably dueto some extent to the increasing concern with which the FrenchGovernment viewed recent developments in the Federal german republic, not least the recent decision to allow the Deutschmark tofloat at the expense of considerable embarrassment to France.In discussion the Cabinet congratulated the Prime Minister onthe success of his discussions with the French President. It would now be necessary to adopt a more positive policy as regardsthe presentation of the issues involved to public opinion, especially to the younger generation; and further consideration should be givento the best means of ensuring this.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24 May, 1971.
