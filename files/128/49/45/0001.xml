InternationalMonetarySituationPreviousReference :CM (71) 44thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET*1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since theCabinet had last considered the economic measures announced on15 August by the President of the United States, he had discussed the implications of those measures with the Finance Ministers of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) after their meeting in brussels on 19 and 20 August.   Although the Finance Ministers&apos;meeting had been reported by the Press as a failure, it would in facthave been remarkable if they had been able to reach agreement ona new policy so rapidly, given, in particular, the differing positions of the French and German Governments on the choice between fixedand floating exchange rates.  If the proposal before them for theadoption of fixed parities between their own currencies and a common policy of floating against the dollar had been agreed, it would hardlyhave been possible for him to avoid accepting in principle an invitation to associate sterling with such arrangements; and this could have led to public differences with the Community about theappropriate sterling parity with e.c. currencies. As it was, however,his meeting with the Finance Ministers had been particularlyvaluable in establishing good working relations with them and inmaking it possible for us thereafter to keep in touch with them asregards both current developments in the monetary situation and&quot;their discussions of longer-term problems in this field. developments in London since the e.c. meeting included the floating of sterlingwheh markets reopened on 23 August; the control measures, made effective from 31 August, to reduce the opportunities for non-residentsto earn interest on new holdings of sterling; and a decision to reduceBank Rate that morning from 6 to 5 per cent. A change in bank rate was expected by the money market; and, if it had not beenmade, the sterling rate against the dollar would clearly have risenfurther. The optimistic report on prospects for the balance of pay-ments up to the end of 1972 published that morning by the NationalInstitute of Economic and Social Research was another factoraffecting the timing of the change. The decision on Bank Rate wasnot inconsistent with the needs of the domestic economy althoughit had not been taken with these primarily in view.   So far, theinternational monetary situation was not generally unfavourable toour trading prospects; the sterling appreciation against the dollarof some two and a half per cent was less than that of the e.c. and japanese currencies.Several further international meetings on the monetary situation were now in prospect. The Deputies of the Group of Ten would meet in Paris on 3 September; he was himself to meet the FrenchFinance Minister on 7 September; Japanese Ministers were to visitWashington on 9 September; the e.c. Finance Ministers would bere-assembling on 13 September; Ministers of the Group of Tenwere to meet in London on 15 September; and later in the monththere were the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; meeting in Nassauand the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Meeting in Washington.While it was our objective to achieve an early agreement on arestoration of fixed currency parities and the removal of the United* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex.
States import surcharge in the interest of restoring equilibrium tothe world&apos;s money markets and removing obstacles to international trade, it seemed at the moment unlikely that the forthcoming meet-ings of the Group of Ten or the IMF would result in any early agreement on a pattern of currency parities or the longer-term basis for regulating the international monetary system.In discussion the following main points were made (a) While there might be a case for not pressing for any earlyre-alignment of fixed currency parities and the likely effect of domesticeconomic expansion on our balance of payments might suggest thatre-alignment in 6 months&apos; time rather than earlier would better serve the interests of our international trade, it was generally consideredthat it would be preferable to seek a return to fixed rates at an earlydate. Any agreement that might be reached was likely to include provisions for wider margins of fluctuation around the new paritiesand for greater flexibility generally in the monetary system.(b) Studies were in hand of the best means of influencing theJapanese Government to accept a realistic revaluation of the yenagainst the dollar. It was not yet clear whether, in allowing theyen to float at a level of some 6\ per cent above its previous dollarparity, the Japanese Government were merely making a minimumconcession to United States&apos; demands or were preparing the way fora larger adjustment.; (c) A reduction in mortgage rates consequent on the changein Bank Rate would depend on the building societies&apos; assessment oftheir continued ability to attract and to retain investors&apos; deposits.Any consideration of the possibility of encouraging them to reduce their rates would have to take account of the risk that a contractionof their resources for the financing of house purchase could have a damaging effect on housing policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to congratulate the Chancellor of the exchequer on the skill with which he had dealt with a complex and difficult situation. The Cabinet agreed that the action so far taken had succeeded in demonstrating that the Government were well in controlof the situation, were working closely with our future partners inEurope and were taking the steps necessary to protect our trading interests. It had been calculated that the effect of the United States&apos;measures could be a loss in our exports to that country amountingtq  150 million in a full year, while a diversion of Japanese exportsto Europe could cost us a further  75 million. These figures, whichexcluded the effect of any revaluation of sterling, indicated theimportance of securing the early removal of the United States importsurcharge. But it would probably be an illusion to suppose thatthis would be easily or rapidly achieved.!    The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of. the Prime-Minister^ summing!! up of their discussion.
secret oversea Affairs 2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reviewed eventsMalta since the last discussion of Malta in Cabinet on 16 August, 1971.Previous        The Secretary of State for Defence had visited Malta from 19-21Reference:      August for detailed discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta,CM (71) 44th   Mr. Mintoff. This meeting had at least dissuaded Mr. Mintoff fromConclusions,    taking precipitate action whilst his demands were considered furtherMinute 3       within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).   the response to our efforts to persuade our NATO allies to match ourown contribution to Malta had enabled us to raise the total of the collective offer to  8  million per annum.  This, however, was stillfar short of Mr. Mintoff&apos;s demand for  18 million (coupled with hisapparent but erroneous belief that NATO was in fact already preparedto offer up to about  13 million). Latterly, the Governments of theFederal German Republic and of Italy had indicated to us thatthey would be prepared to contribute a further  J million each ifthis was matched by an equal British contribution.  If we agreed,this  would raise the collective NATO offer to  9i million..    This would still not approach Mr. Mintoffs demand.   Because ofour NATO allies&apos; views, however, it might be wise to increase ourown contribution on the lines proposed. A complicating factor was mr. Mintoffs potential recourse to Libya, which he had just visited.Any Libyan financial aid to Malta, however, would probably be&apos;        made: conditional upon the removal of the British military presencefrom jthe Island; and it was doubtful whether such terms would be acceptable even to the Malta Labour Party. The immediate questioni was whether or not we should try to persuade Mr. Mintoff that theSecretary of State for Defence, on his return from holiday in mid-September, should pay another visit to Malta in order to review thesituation.  If Mr. Mintoff was not prepared to wait until then, theMinister of State for Defence might be our spokesman.  In eitherevent our objective must be to keep discussions in play and to restrainMr. Mintoff from precipitate action.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it would be premature to increase our offerat the present stage, since this might merely encourage Mr. Mintoffto believe that still further concessions could be extracted from us.The position would be different if it later transpired that a smalladdition might secure a reasonable agreement. In order to keepthe negotiations in being Mr. Mintoff should be informed that inour view it would be in the interests of both Governments for either the Secretary of State or the Minister of State for Defence to visitMalta in order to review the situation following the discussions in nato. But we should avoid any implication at this stage that theterms of our offer might be improved; and we should also notencourage Mr. Mintoff to suppose that NATO was likely to beprepared to offer anything like the amount of money which he himself had in mind.The Cabinet-j   i.   Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and the Minister of State for Defence to,   act accordingly.
Berlin The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theprovisions of the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin which was nowawaiting signature were reasonably satisfactory. Basically, they represented a recognition of the realities of the present situation. The! most important features of the Agreement were that the Soviet union would assume responsibility for ensuring the smooth flow of civiliantraffic between Western Germany and the City of Berlin; that provision was made for discussions between the Governments ofthe Federal Republic and of East Germany about improved arrange-ments for inter-city contacts; and that the Federal Government wouldterminate certain of their political activities in Berlin. The maindisadvantages in these arrangements were the acceptance of thede facto division of the City of Berlin and the implicit recognitionof the East German Government. Before the parties could proceedto signature of the text (which had been arranged for 2 September)it would be necessary to resolve a dispute arising from a discrepancybetween the respective translations made by the Governments ofthe Federal Republic and of East Germany. Whereas the federal republic^ text stated that &quot; Berlin will continue not to be a part ofthe Federal Republic &quot;, the East German text qualified this by adding&quot; now or in the future &quot;. The Federal Republic had asked us notto sign the Agreement until this discrepancy was resolved; and wej must clearly accede to their request.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed this conclusion. As regards the Agreementitself, however, it would be premature to over-emphasise its value tothe West. The Soviet Government were in fact doing no morethan undertaking to observe, as regards access to the city, obligationsby which they had been bound since 1945, whereas the western powers had effectively conceded recognition of the East GermanGovernment. The provision in the Agreement for the establishment&apos; of a Soviet Consulate-General in West Berlin was also a disagreeableconcession. The essence of the matter was whether or not the soviet union would now abide by their undertakings and cease toexacerbate the Berlin situation.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.India/Pakistan        The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that althoughPrevious        the Government of Pakistan were ready to accept the proposal that reference:     United Nations observers should be stationed on both sides of the cm (71) 43rd  border between India and East Pakistan, the Government of IndiaConclusions, , remained wholly opposed to this suggestion. They were no doubtMinute 2       prompted in part by a refusal to be equated with Pakistan; but theirattitude probably derived also from the fact that they were determined to conceal their support for the Bangladesh guerillas, who were! now thought to number some 20,000 and had achieved a numberof damaging incursions in East Pakistan.   Meanwhile, however,the flow of refugees into India continued; it was estimated that ithad now reached a total of H million. The only means of reversing
this movement which seemed to offer any prospect of success wasto post United Nations observers on both sides of the border; andwei must therefore persist in our efforts to persuade the indian government to accept them.As regards the situation within East Pakistan, President YahyaKhan had just appointed an experienced and capable civilianadministrator as Governor of the Wing in succession to the military governor.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement.northern ireland previous reference :CM (71) 44thConclusions,SECRET- &apos; 3.
