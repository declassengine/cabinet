CM 24 (71)confidential.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatMr. Patrick Cargill, who had been visiting Pakistan on behalf of theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, had toldour High Commissioner in Islamabad that the economic situation ofthe country was likely to be even more serious than had been expected. Nevertheless, President Yahya Khan continued tomaintain that his Government had matters under control, that thearmy were distributing supplies of food and that the fears of afamine were exaggerated. He was also insisting that all relief supplies from outside the country should be distributed by Pakistaniauthorities; and he had declined for the time being the offer of theSecretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, to provideUnited Nations assistance. The Presidents economic adviser,Mr. M. M. Ahmad, intended to discuss the matter with U Thant in new York in the near future; and since he would be passing throughLondon on his return journey on 17 May, this would provide us withan opportunity to review the situation with him.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported that he had attended a meeting of the Council of the Central Treaty organisation in Ankara. Although Turkey was at the time under martial law,there was no indication that this was bearing heavily upon thepeople; and he had been much impressed by the qualities of the newTurkish Prime Minister, Professor Erim, and the Minister forForeign Affairs, Mr. Olcay.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a serious financial crisis appeared to be imminent in the Bahamas. The localGovernment were reluctant to face up to their responsibilities; andthe Governor had been instructed to impress upon them the need to adopt sound financial policies. The Prime Minister of the bahamas, Mr. Pindling, would probably be visiting London early inJune in the course of a journey to a number of European countries;if so, the opportunity would be taken to speak to him in the same sense.secret        .:W&apos;^.\      &apos;] B*
ChinaPreviousReference:CM (71) 1stConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there wasno truth in the recent report in The Times that if the People&apos;republic of China acquired membership of the United Nations, thiswould involve the surrender by the United Kingdom and France oftheir permanent seats in the Security Council.EuropeanEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (71) 15thConclusions,Minute 2secret3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe had consideredthe main issues likely to arise at the Ministerial meeting withrepresentatives of the European Economic Community (e.c.) whichthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would be attending in brussels on 11-12 May.On Community finance all the members of the Committee exceptFrance were now supporting a German proposal that our contributions to the enlarged Community&apos;s budget should increase by equal steps from 7 per cent of the total in the first year of our membership to 19 per cent in the fifth year. It was not yet clear whether the French Government would move sufficiently from theextreme position which they had previously adopted to enable an agreed Community reply to our own existing proposals to be presented to us on 11-12 May. The Committee had agreed,however, that, if the Community put forward proposals pointing toa gradual increase in our contributions from less than 10 per cent ofthe budget in the first year to a level of up to 20 per cent in the fifthyear, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would indicate thatwe would regard these as a basis for negotiation.On New Zealand it was clear that we were likely to face greatdifficulty in persuading the Community to agree to sufficientlygenerous terms to satisfy both the New Zealand Government andBritish public opinion. We had never given the New zealand government reason to hope that agreement might be reached on thebasis of our existing proposal that there should be guaranteed accessfor the present quantities of New Zealand&apos;s butter and cheeseexports to this country throughout the first five years of our membership. We had envisaged, instead, that New Zealand&apos;s export earnings from sales of dairy products to the enlarged community should be maintained at their present level throughout this period,a gradual reduction in quantities being matched by a gradualincrease in prices. We also hoped to establish that the position should be reviewed before the end of the five-year transitional period in order that subsequent arrangements for safeguarding New
ZealancTs vital interests might be made. So far, however, france had insisted that the enlarged Community should have no special responsibility towards New Zealand after the end of the transitional period; and even the other members of the Community envisageda gradual reduction in guaranteed access for New Zealand&apos;s butter and cheese exports to 62 per cent of their present level by the end ofthe transitional period, without any compensating increase in prices to maintain earnings. The Committee had concluded that we should consult the New Zealand Government further before moving from our existing position and should try to reach some understanding with them about a possible compromise settlement. The Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster had accordingly asked the New ZealandHigh Commissioner in London to convey an appropriate message to his Government. It was unlikely that the Community would beable to put agreed counter-proposals to us on 11-12 May. But if,contrary to our expectation, France moved sufficiently towards theposition of the other members to make this possible, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster would indicate, subject to the outcome ofthe consultations with the New Zealand Government, that we didnot rule out the possibility of some gradual reduction in the quantities of New Zealand dairy products for which guaranteedaccess would be provided during the transitional period, providedthat it was agreed that the subsequent arrangements would be thesubject of a review at the appropriate point., In seeking an agreement with the Community on exports of sugar from developing Commonwealth countries we could adopt oneof two alternative approaches. We could either try to obtain a firmguarantee for a specified quantity of exports, in which case we&apos; were unlikely to secure agreement to an amount exceeding I million tons,compared with present exports of 1-37 million tons to the UnitedKingdom from the countries concerned; or we could seek to secure an undertaking that the future sugar policy of the enlarged community would ensure that the developing commonwealth countries would enjoy comparable advantages to those which they received under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. It was difficultto judge which of these two possible approaches was likely to yieldthe better result for the developing Commonwealth countries. If theCommunity would agree to give a firm moral commitment in theform of a suitably worded undertaking, we might be able, after our accession, to ensure that provision was made for maintaining in full the present sugar exports of the Commonwealth countries concerned.Nevertheless, the sugar producers themselves might prefer to have adefinite quantitative guarantee. The Committee had concluded thatin these circumstances further consultations should be held with the secret-1 ..i V:   , b* 2
Commonwealth countries concerned before we reached any final agreement with the Community. If, therefore, the Community putproposals to us on 11-12 May, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster would not go beyond welcoming them as a constructivecontribution to the negotiations (if this seemed appropriate) and indicating that we should need to consult commonwealth governments before we could give a considered reply.Finally, the Committee had decided that we should seek to reach a compromise agreement with the Community on 11-12 May on thequestion of transitional arrangements for agriculture. This wouldinvolve us in granting the full margin of Community preference onour agricultural imports from other member countries immediatelywe joined the e.c., in return for concessions by the Community onthe length of the period for our adaptation to their price levels andon arrangements for horticulture and for the treatment of certainagricultural exports to this country from third countries.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The French Government still seemed inclined to throw doubt on our acceptance of the Community&apos;s &quot; ressources propres &quot; system,under which, at the end of whatever transitional period was agreed,90 per cent of our receipts from customs duties and agriculturallevies, together with the yield of up to 1 per cent of Value added tax, would automatically accrue to the budget of the enlarged community. We had to recognise that the application of the&quot; ressources propres &quot; system to ourselves would almost certainly involve us in meeting a significantly higher share of the budget thanthe figure of approximately 20 per cent now under consideration forour contribution in the fifth year. On the other hand we couldemphasise in public presentation in this country that the european commission had estimated that by 1980 such changes would havetaken place in the structure of the budget that we could expect to recover 10-15 per cent of the budget in the form of Communityexpenditure on regional and industrial policy, etc., thus substantiallyreducing the net burden on our resources and balance of payments.(b) We must make every effort to carry the Governments ofNew Zealand and of the developing Commonwealth sugar-producing countries with us in seeking compromise solutions to the problems which were of particular concern to them. Both these issues were ofgreat political sensitivity; and it would become considerably moredifficult to secure Parliamentary approval for any agreementproviding for our accession to the e.c. if these countries were notprepared to acknowledge that their vital interests had been adequately safeguarded.(c) There was mounting concern in Parliament about the damage which might be inflicted on our in-shore fishing industry if
CM 24 (71)we accepted without modification the Community&apos;s CommonFisheries Policy. It might be tactically wise not to begin negotiationswith the Community on this question until after the major issueshad been resolved. But it was clearly essential that we should obtainsatisfaction on the fisheries regulations before Parliament was askedto approve any accession agreement. Norway had recently putforward proposals to the Community which might set a helpfulprecedent for us.(d) There was also concern in Parliament that the adoption ofthe Community regulations on the movement of labour would resultin more favourable treatment being accorded to immigrants into thiscountry from other parts of the enlarged Community than fromother member countries of the Commonwealth.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the conclusions reached by the ministerial committee on the Approach to Europe about the negotiating limits which the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should observe atthe Ministerial meeting in Brussels on 11-12 May.The Cabinet then considered certain other aspects of thenegotiations.*The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had for sometime been considering the possibility of arranging to visit Paris fora meeting with the President of France in order to try to reach an understanding which would open the way to a successful conclusionof our negotiations for entry into the European economic community. It was possible, though by no means certain, that firmarrangements for such a meeting would be made and announcedbefore the Cabinet next met. Meanwhile, there must be nopremature public disclosure of the fact that the possibility of hismeeting President Pompidou was under consideration.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to be guided in his negotiations at the Ministerial meeting in brussels on 11-12 May by the conclusions reached by the ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe at their meeting on 3 May.
InternationalMonetarySituationCONFIDENTIAL4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet ofrecent developments in the international monetary situation, as aresult of which the authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany,the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria had suspendeddealings in the United States dollar.reorganisation of theNationalHealthServicePreviousReference:CM (71) 19thConclusions,Minute 6Appointmentof HealthAuthoritiesCONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (71) 56) about the appointment of health authorities in the reorganisation of the National Health Service.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he hadrevised his earlier proposals for membership  of area health authorities (AHAs), in the light of the views expressed in the cabinet&apos;s discussion on 1 April.   He still thought it important toemphasise the management function of AHAs rather than to give them  a  merely  representative  role.    The  authorities  should accordingly be small; and he proposed that, in general, each should consist of 14 members in addition to the chairman.  (In some ares which included substantial medical and dental teaching facilities afew additional members would be needed.) He now proposed that three of the members of each AHA should be appointed by thecorresponding local authority and that one member (two where thearea included a teaching district) should be appointed by theuniversity providing medical and dental teaching facilities. The localauthority  representation  would  have  managerial,  as  well asrepresentational, value in view of the local authorities&apos; responsibilities for the personal social services, education and environmental health \services. The remaining members, apart from the chairman, should jbe appointed, as he had orginally proposed, by the regional health Iauthorities (RHAs); but an undertaking would be given that they \would include at least two doctors and one nurse or midwife. The government   would   thus   ensure   a   degree   of   professionalrepresentation, without having to accept that the professionalmembers should be directly appointed by the professions themselves.These changes would not entirely satisfy the local authority interests; put they went as far as was consistent with securing soundmanagement.  The Committee on Social Services had approved his proposals for the purposes of consultation; and, if the Cabinet Iagreed, he proposed to enter into discussion with the interests concerned on the basis of a consultative document, a draft of whichwas annexed to his memorandum.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that local authority!representation was not in issue in Scotland, since it was proposedthat all the members of the single tier of authorities which was;envisaged should be appointed by the Secretary of State.
:      CM 24 (71)The Secretary of State for Wales said that confidentialconsultations which he had undertaken in Wales had indicatedconsiderable support for the concept of small authorities, whosemembership would be determined primarily by considerations ofmanagerial competence. It had not been suggested that more thana few members should be directly appointed by the local authority concerned; and the professions did not appear to be disposed to claim the right to appoint members direct, so long as the membership included as many individuals with professional qualifications as local authority representatives. Public reaction,however, might be less favourable than this private consultationmight suggest.In discussion, it was maintained that the local authorities were likely to be strongly opposed to these proposals, since they wouldcomprise a smaller degree of local authority representation thanthose of the previous Administration and would fall far short of thelevel of local authority participation advocated by the conservative party when in Opposition. A high degree of co-operation amongthe local authority interests had now been created in the context oflocal government reform. But this goodwill would be liable to been dangered by an apparent refusal by the Government to recognise the just claims of the local authorities in relation to the national health Service; and the Opposition would be likely to use theoccasion to cast doubt on the sincerity of the Governments professedattitude to local government responsibilities. It was questionable whether it was worth forfeiting the current goodwill of the localauthority interests for the sake of a benefit which, at best, must bespeculative, since appointment by RHAs offered no guarantee of ensuring a higher degree of managerial competence than appointmentby local authorities. Indeed, if efficiency was to be the determiningconsideration, it would be best secured by central government control, the AHAs being assigned a purely advisory function. Inany event the members of the AHAs should be regarded as directorsrather than executive managers.On the other hand, experience had indicated that the needs of sound management were likely to be better secured if the RHAs hadfreedom of choice in appointing members of the AHAs. Membersof local authorities might have a valuable part to play; butappointment by the local authorities themselves was not likely to result in the most competent managers being in fact appointed.Although the local authority interests might well consider that thethree representatives now proposed were too few in a system havinglocal representation as its object, they might take a less critical view
if it was clearly understood that the AHAs were not intended to be representative in character. In any event there was no question ofa final decision on membership having to be taken at this stage;all that was at issue was the basis upon which the interests concerned should be consulted. It might be wise, therefore, that the consultative document, while making it clear that there would be some degreeof local authority representation, should not specify any particularnumber of representatives. This, however, should not be regardedas necessarily committing the Government to accept the appointmentof more than three such members.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the proposals in CP (71) 56 were acceptable as abasis for consultation. The consultative document, however, shouldmake it clear that the AHAs would include some members appointedby local authority but should not specify their number. Subject tothis proviso, the Secretary of State for Social Services should now proceed to consult the interests affected; and the necessary consultations should also proceed in Scotland and Wales.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Home Secretary&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited the secretaries of State for Social Services, for Scotland and for Wales tobe guided accordingly.IndustrialAffairsPost OfficePreviousReference:CM (71) 23rdConciusions,Minute 3Probation andAfter-CareService       -1PreviousReference:CM (71) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL6.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that theCommittee of Settlement under Sir Henry Hardman which had considered the pay claim of the Union of Post Office Workers(UPW) had recommended a pay increase of 9 per cent, subject tocertain conditions. This was no greater than the Post Office board had been ready to concede, on certain conditions about productivity,before the Committee was appointed.   The Committee membernominated by the UPW had written a dissenting report; but this would have no practical effect, since the agreed procedure provided for the findings of the majority, or of the Chairman alone in the \event of disagreement, to prevail and to be binding upon both partiesto the dispute.i i ; The Home Secretary said that, in accordance with the Cabinefs conclusion on 29 April, he had presented revised proposals on the 1pay of the probation service to the Ministerial Steering Committee Ion Pay Negotiations. The Committee had agreed that the offer to Jbe made should consist of an average increase of 8\ per cent in
Cabinet Office,6 May, 1971.basic pay scales, together with an allowance of some  70 a year for officers in the main grade at all scale points except the threelowest, in recognition of their special responsibilities. negotiations were now in train on this basis.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that he would shortly be bringing forward proposals for dealing with two sets of impendingnegotiations, on the findings of pay research in respect of some330,000 non-industrial civil servants and on the pay of the industrial civil Service.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Employment and the Lord Privy Seal.
