Rolls-RoycePreviousReference:CM (71) 7thConclusionsSECRET2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thepresent cease-fire was due to end on 5 February. Various steps hadbeen taken both in the context of the four-Power discussions and elsewhere in the United Nations to try to persuade the Governmentof the United Arab Republic to agree to an extension of the cease-fire. As a result they had just announced that they would beprepared to &quot; withhold fire &quot; for a further month, during which time it was to be hoped that the mission of the Special Representative ofthe United Nations Secretary-General, Dr. Jarring, would make some progress.132950-3b*secret. The Cabinet considered the latest developments inconnection with Rolls-Royce Limited. They were informed thatdealings in the company&apos;s shares had been suspended when the stock exchange opened that morning and that the company would shortly be issuing their statement indicating their intention to ask the trustees of the Debenture Holders to appoint a Receiver andManager.The Cabinet discussed the draft of a statement which, in thesecircumstances, the Minister of Aviation Supply would need to makein the House of Commons that afternoon. Certain amendments were agreed, the most important of which was designed to ensurethat, even if the Government undertook to explore with the Receiverthe future of the RB 211-22 engine, they would not thereby incurany commitment in respect of the liabilities which would arise, underthe existing contract for the engine between Rolls-Royce andLockheeds, when the company themselves gave effect to their decision not to proceed with that contract.The Cabinet also considered and approved the arrangements forinforming certain foreign Governments of the situation and fordealing with any request for an emergency debate in Parliament. Itwas agreed that the Bill to enable the Government to acquire certainassets of the company should be introduced early in the following week.
Indo-ChinaPreviousReference:CM (71) 5thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, following the recent offensive by the North Vietnamese which he had reportedto Cabinet on 28 January, ground forces of the Vietnam Govern-ment, with United States air support, had entered Cambodia. Thesituation in Laos was still somewhat obscure. Our only special responsibility for events in the area derived from ourco-chairmanship, with the Soviet Union, of the Geneva Conference;and we had indicated our willingness to preside over a resumedconference should one be reconvened. In this context it was perhapssignificant that the Soviet Ambassador, no doubt in reference toreported developments in Laos and Cambodia, had asked to bereceived later that morning.The Cabinet (1) Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.Negotiationswith theEuropeanEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (70) 47thConclusions,Minute 1The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, although no agreement had been reached on the central issue of finance, his recent meeting with the representatives of the countries of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) and of the Commission had resulted in a useful clarification of views and in progress on someof the other outstanding problems. In particular, an understandinghad been reached on the inclusion of Hong Kong in the Community&apos;sgeneralised preference arrangements and on the future tradingrelationship between the Commonwealth Asian countries and theCommunity. The Community&apos;s intentions had been explained to the brussels representatives of the Commonwealth countries concerned.Provisional agreement had also been reached on the timetable for industrial tariff reductions within the enlarged Community. Asregards our initial financial contribution, there were signs that theCommission now accepted that the figure of 21-5 per cent, putforward as one of their alternative proposals in replying to our ownoffer of an initial 3 per cent, was not a basis for negotiation. they recognised that for us the problem was one of foreign exchangerather than budgetary costs. One or two of the smaller EECmembers were thought to be considering a settlement in the region of an initial 5 per cent. Even the French Foreign Minister, in private discussions, appeared to have accepted that 21-5 per centwas not realistic and had mentioned a figure of 10 per cent. He had also suggested that our request for provision for a review of the eventual level of our contribution could perhaps be abandoned onthe grounds that it would in any case be open to us to pursue sucha request within the terms of the Treaty at the end of the transitional period.

The Secretary of State for Defence said that the disturbances in Northern Ireland on the previous night had revealednew tactics on the part of the rioters which seemed to be designedto fragment the resources of the security forces. He had thereforearranged for the immediate despatch of an additional battalion andan armoured car squadron from this country.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Defence.confidential. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thepresent state of negotiations between the oil companies and the oil-producing countries gave cause for concern. The demands whichthe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were now putting forward, if met in full, would add  150 million to theforeign exchange cost of our oil supplies. They would also giveOPEC power to fix prices unilaterally and would open the way to&quot; leapfrogging &quot; demands for later price increases. There was no sign of disunity in OPEC, apart from the Government of Libya whowere adopting an even more extreme position. The OPEC demands were accompanied by a threat to withhold all supplies for a weekand to introduce legislation to annul the present concessionary rightsof the oil companies with the aim of replacing the present arrangements by Government-to-Government agreements, in whichthe role of the oil companies would be subsidiary.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that wewere giving the maximum diplomatic support to the oil companies.The Cabinet-Took note.SECRET132950-3 B* 2The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that his recent discussions with the Italian Minister of the Treasury, Signor FerrariAggradi, had revealed that the latter, although sympathetic to ouraims, had not realised that our offer of an opening 3 per centcontribution was a realistic proposal and not merely an initial bidfor negotiating purposes. From recent conversations between representatives of the Bank of England and the Bank of Italyit appeared that Signor Guido Carli, the Governor of the Bank ofItaly, shared the same misapprehension. The facts of the situation had now been fully explained both to Signor Ferrari Aggradi and to signor Carli.The Cabinet-(2) Took note.
CM 8 (71)confidential industrial 6.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that he IAffairs expected to receive during the forthcoming weekend advance notice!of the report by the Committee of Inquiry into the electricity supplypay dispute (the Wilberforce Inquiry). The report would probablybe published on 9 or 10 February.The management of the Ford Motor Company had taken a firm stand in their pay dispute.  They had apparently not expected Iso sharp a response from their employees; but the workers&apos; reactionhad appeared to strengthen their resolve.   The strike mightaccordingly be a long one.  As regards the Post Office pay dispute Ihe had the impression that public opinion might soon begin to favour a new initiative towards achieving a settlement.  It might at  least be necessary for the Government to re-emphasise the fact that Iarbitration was open to the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW).   jThe Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that the facting Chairman of the Post Office Board would meet the General secretary of the UPW informally in the near future; and it would fbe preferable to defer consideration of any further government action until that meeting had taken place. In his view publicopinion remained in favour of the stand taken by the Post Office Iand the Government in the pay dispute.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the government offices concerned with the payment of State retirement pensions and social security benefits were having difficulty in supporting theburden of extra work caused by the absence of postal services but were continuing to make commendable efforts to deal with thesituation. Large sums of money were being paid to UPW strikers&apos;families in supplementary benefits, largely because, unlike employeesgenerally in the private sector, Post Office workers were not paidsignificantly in arrears.In accordance with the Cabinefs previous decision on thesubject the Government had made no advance on the last pay offer of 8 per cent for non-industrial civil servants, since any suchincreased offer might have undermined the Post Office position. Asa result the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council were virtuallycertain to decide to proceed to arbitration on their pay claim.The Cabinet were further informed that it would be necessary todecide in about 10 days&apos; time the pay offer to be made to schoolteachers in England and Wales and that there was a risk of industrial action on the railways by the members of the Associated Society of locomotive Engineers and Firemen over a pay claim which had been
confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP (71) 11) about Local Govern-ment Reorganisation. They also had before them memoranda bythe Secretary of State for the Environment (CP (71) 10) and theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP (71) 6), covering draft white papers on Local Government Reorganisation in England and scotland respectively, and a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Wales (CP (71) 7) covering the draft of a consultative document on the reform of local government in Wales.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Sub-Committeeon the Reorganisation of Local Government (RE (G)) and the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment (RE)had considered proposals for the reorganisation of local governmentin England, Wales and Scotland. The outcome of their discussions were set out in the three draft documents before the Cabinet. TheRE Committee had agreed that the proposals were acceptable and discussed that week with British Rail but on which the managementhad made no offer. It was suggested that the example set by theGovernment in public sector pay disputes had already begun to havean effect in stiffening private sector employers&apos; resistance to largepay claims and in encouraging moderate trade unionists to acceptreasonable settlements.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment would shortly need to consider the implications of thereport of the Wilberforce Inquiry and to discuss what new form ofmachinery for inquiry or arbitration could be devised for futuredisputes, given that they would probably not be able to repeat thearrangement for dealing with the electricity supply dispute. For themoment no further statement about the Post Office pay dispute should be made.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations to consider assoon as possible the implications of the forthcoming report of the Court of Inquiry into the electricity supplypay dispute; and to examine the possible need to createnew machinery for inquiry or arbitration for future paydisputes.
should be commended to the Cabinet for endorsement as the basis for consultation with the local authorities. They had recommendedthat the White Papers and the consultative document should bepublished as proposed. In the course of discussion the three sets of proposals had been progressively assimilated. All involved theretention of a two-tier system of counties (&quot; regions &quot; in Scotland)and districts, with a substantial reduction in the total numberof authorities. There were still considerable differences in detailbetween the three countries, but the Ministers concerned regardedthese as acceptable. Any proposals for reorganisation, however,would be controversial. As regards England the Government mightbe criticised for not being sufficiently radical and for abandoning the concept of unitary authorities recommended in the 1969 reportof the Royal Commission on Local Government (the Redcliffe-MaudCommission). The most vehement opposition could be expected from the existing county boroughs and certain Scottish cities, whichwould lose to the counties certain of their major functions, notablyeducation, the personal social services, tranport and highways and planning. There would also be pressure generally to transfercertain functions from the counties to the proposed new districts,particularly in England, where their position would appear to be rather weaker than in Scotland and Wales. The proposals alsoenvisaged that the new county and district authorities would be wholly independent of each other. This would complicate the devolution of detailed financial control from central Government.There were very strong arguments, to which the RE Committee hadattached great importance, for completing local government reorganisation in England and Wales by April 1974. This wasfeasible. But it would imply that the Local Government boundary commission would need to start work on the new pattern of county districts in England while the Bill was still before Parliament; thatconsultation with local authorities would need to be kept within a vigorous timetable; and that there would be only limited scope fordiscussion of the district pattern in Parliament when the boundary commission had made their recommendations. These measures would undoubtedly be matters of controversy. Nevertheless, allthe Ministers concerned had agreed that the proposals were right inprinciple and that, in spite of the difficulties, it was important thatreorganisation in England and Wales should be completed by april 1974.In discussion the following principal points were made:(a) Although there would be local objection to particularelements in the proposals for the reorganisation of local governmentin England, they would be welcome to the local authorities asa whole.   The preservation of a two-tier system and most of the
historic counties would be particularly welcome in comparison withthe Redcliffe-Maud proposals, which had been largely accepted bythe previous Administration. Opposition from the county boroughswhich would not be included in the proposed metropolitan areas was inevitable; but even they might in some cases prefer these proposals to those of the previous Government.(b) The proposals for Scotland were broadly in line with thoseput forward by the previous Conservative Administration in 1963and with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment in Scotland (the Wheatley Commission). Certainvariations from the Wheatley pattern, however, had been proposed.These would make the proposals both more flexible and more acceptable.(c) In Wales local government reorganisation had been underconsideration since 1961. There had been previous White Papers in1967 and 1970. The new two-tier system would result largely fromthe amalgamation of existing counties, some of which would becomeindividual districts. In the circumstances it was proposed to allow the districts to retain certain minor functions which in Englandwould be exercised by the counties. Cardiff, the capital city, would retain responsibility for local planning. The present proposals were likely to be generally acceptable; but controversy would be inevitable over reorganisation in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.(d) In the proposed metropolitan areas in England it had proved possible to place responsibility for housing, education andthe social services at the same (district) level. Elsewhere, however,the districts would be too small to undertake responsibility for education and the personal social services. It was not possible to eliminate the existing separation of these services from responsibilityfor housing if viable district authorities were to be maintained.Further consideration, however, might need to be given to the advisability of providing the counties with certain residual housingpowers.(e) It might be possible to provide workable arrangements forthe equalisation of rate support grant and housing account surplusesand the allocation of capital programmes within county areas. but even if arbitration or a measure of continued control by ministers were unavoidable if the districts were to be independent of the counties, this would be preferable to a hierarchical structure.(/) There would be great advantages in completing localgovernment reorganisation by April 1974, in England and Wales,although the opposition which would be aroused by some of themeasures necessary to enable this to be done should not be under-
estimated. It would also be an advantage if the elections for theprincipal authorities could be held early in the spring of 1973.(g) It was difficult to justify continuation of the aldermanicsystem. But its abolition would arouse disproportionate controversy;and it might, therefore, be appropriate, as the RE Committee had recommended, to leave the matter open at this stage.(h) It was desirable, however, to adopt a more positive attitude as regards the provision of new complaints machinery, in spite ofthe opposition of the local authorities associations.(/) It would be inappropriate to transfer responsibility for foodhygiene and slaughterhouses to the upper-tier authorities in wales and Scotland, although it was to be assigned to the upper tier inEngland.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals for the reorganisation of localgovernment in England, Wales and Scotland as a basis for consultation with the local authorities. They should be revised,however, in order to take account of the desire of the Cabinet fora more positive approach to the need for new complaints machinery.The Secretary of State for the Environment should also revise the text of paragraphs 12 and 13 of the White Paper for England inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Social Services. Anyfurther suggestions for amendments or any points which individual ministers wished to raise should be drawn urgently to the attentionof the Secretary of State concerned. The Cabinet had accepted thatthere were strong arguments for completing reorganisation inEngland and Wales by April 1974, in spite of the special measureswhich this would entail. They would wish, however, to give furtherconsideration at their next meeting to the implications of includingthe necessary Bills in the 1971-72 legislative programme, to the advisability of making specific commitments about the legislativetimetable at this stage and to the arrangements for publishing theWhite Papers and the Consultative Document.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of Statefor Wales to revise the draft White Papers and Consulta-tive Document in the light of the points made in discussion and of any others which might be put to them.
SECRET8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (71) 15) on legislative priorities for the1971-72 Session.The Lord President said that the White Paper on the Reform ofLocal Government in England and the Consultative Documentsetting out prospects for Wales, in the form in which they were before the Cabinet, would virtually commit the Government to legislate during the 1971-72 Session. Before entering into such a commitment the Cabinet should consider the legislative priorities asbetween the major Bills indicated in CP (71) 15 as probablecandidates for that Session. On the assumption that the negotiationsfor our accession to the European Communities were successful,legislation for this purpose would need to be passed before the endof 1972. The Ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europehad concluded that this should comprise two Bills, one confined tothe constitutional provisions, which would have its Committee Stageon the Floor of the House, the other containing the detailed provisions. This would be a formidable undertaking. In additiona further major Bill would be required to deal with the fiscalconsequences of accession. The two Local Government Bills wouldbe very long: and Parliament would wish to examine them in detail.The National Insurance Bill, proposals for which the Cabinet had yet to consider, would also be a long and complicated measure. Inaddition a Bill on Housing Finance would be required if theGovernment were to realise the savings for which they had takencredit in the recent review of public expenditure.There was a strong case for each of these Bills. But in totalthey represented a heavier load of major legislation than could be passed in a single Session. Given that other Bills would certainly berequired, it would probably be necessary to defer two of theproposed major Bills until the following Session. There was noobjection to the Government committing themselves to legislation on local government reform in England and Wales provided that the(3) Subject to Conclusion 2 above and to the outcome of their further consideration of the legislative programme forthe 1971-72 Session, approved the drafts attached to cp (71) 10, 6 and 7.(4) Agreed to resume consideration of the references in the draft white Papers and Consultative Document to thelegislative timetable.
Cabinet realised that other Bills would have to be deferred to make room for it. Otherwise, it would be preferable to amend the white paper and the Consultative Document in order to keep the optionsopen.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If legislation to reorganise the National Health Servicecould be introduced at the very beginning of the 1972-73 Session,this should be in time to permit transfer of the local health functionsfrom local authorities to the Service on 1 April, 1974. To introduce the Bill in the House of Lords during the 1971-72 Session wouldnot be a satisfactory alternative.(b) Early action to reorganise local government was essential inorder to end present uncertainties. Moreover, unless reorganisationwere completed by 1 April, 1974, there was a danger that it wouldbecome an issue in the next General Election.(c) There was no prospect of introducing legislation for our accession to the European Communities until early 1972, althoughit was planned to start drafting in May 1971. It might be possibleto draw the Bill containing the detailed provisions sufficiently tightlyto restrict the range of discussion; but some of these provisions would be controversial even among those Members of Parliamentwho accepted the principle of accession.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume their consideration of legislative priorities atan early meeting, at which they would also consider the proposals by the Secretary of State for Social Services for a new national insurance scheme.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up and agreed to resume their discussion at an early date.Cabinet Office,5 February, 1971.
