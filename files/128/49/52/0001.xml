The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the queen&apos;s recent visit to Turkey had been an outstanding success,marked especially by the warmth of the welcome which the Turkishpeople had given Her Majesty.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with great pleasure, of the statement by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary about The Queen&apos;visit to Turkey.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theUnited States Government had clearly resented the decision of theUnited Nations General Assembly to recognise the Peking regimeas the rightful and sole Government of China and to exclude Taiwanfrom the Organisation; and they were momentarily inclined to blame some of their friends and allies for giving them insufficientsupport in their efforts to prevent this outcome. We must hopethat any adverse effect on our own relations with the United states would be; only temporary. In the process of negotiations on thestatus of our Diplomatic Mission the Peking Government might now ask us to concede that Taiwan was a province of the People&apos;republic. Our answer would require careful thought. In fact itmust.,remain our view that the precise status of Taiwan wasUndecided. We had never in the past recognised the TaiwanGovernment as such or conceded that it represented the Governmentof China; and our consular officers there were accredited only tothe municipal authorities, not to the Government.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that GeneralGrivas was now reported to have returned to Cyprus and to bedisseminating: propaganda attacking President Makarios&apos; Govern-ment. Renewed strife in Cyprus seemed likely. A deterioration inthe situation might have serious implications for our installationsthere, both inside and outside the Sovereign Base Areas, which were of very considerable importance to us.The Cabinet-(2)  Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-j    wealth Secretary.136638-parliamentary i. The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation of the affairs contribution which his colleagues had made to the high level of the debate on our accession to the European Communities.hThe Lord President said that he would inform the ministers concerned as soon as the arrangements for the Debate on the address in the House of Commons had been agreed.
Employmentof Aliensin GreatBritainPreviousReference:CM (71) 43rdConclusions,Minute 7The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the proposals in paragraphs 5 and 6 of CP (71)120. They should be announced as soon as possible after theconclusion of the European debate in Parliament. It would bedesirable to emphasise the Governments intention to improve thetraining arrangements for the industry and the facilities providedby the official employment services; and it would be wise to be ready,in addition, to deal with any questions which might be raised aboutthe employment of Irish labour in the industry.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up and invited the Secretary of State for Employment toproceed accordingly.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary j,of State for Employment (CP(71)120) on the employment of aliens Jin the catering industry in Great Britain.The Secretary of State for Employment said that, following the 1main decisions earlier in the year on the restriction of the employmentof aliens, he had discussed the application of this restriction to the 1catering industry with both sides of the industry.   Whereas the 1employers&apos; organisations generally were opposed to restrictions, Ithe trade unions considered that no permits at all should be issued Ifor aliens. In these circumstances he considered that we should now Iproceed to introduce a quota but should do so gradually in order fto give the industry time to recruit and to train more indigenous 1labour.  He proposed that there should be 5,500 permits for the 1hotel and catering industry in 1972 and 3,500 in 1973.  The quota would apply to unskilled and semi-skilled male aliens from countries \other than those which were members of the European Economic ICommunities (e.c.), together with Denmark and Norway.   He ibelieved that these quotas would exercise an appreciable effect on !the industry.   They were acceptable to the other Departments jchiefly concerned in the employment of alien seasonal workers. Ifthese proposals were endorsed by the Cabinet, he intended to announce them at the earliest opportunity after the House ofCommons decision on entry into the European Communities.  At Ithe same time he would announce that as from 1 January, 1972,no further permits for unskilled and semi-skilled men from countries :(other than Denmark or Norway) which were not members of the 1EEC would be issued for work in industry and commerce. I
The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement and invited the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,28 October. 1971.4. The Prime Minister said that he had considered further theform and content of the document to be published by the government about the organisation of Government research and development inthe light of the points made in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion andof the Governments commitment to consult the scientific communityabout their conclusions on this matter. As a result he proposed thatthe Government should now publish a Green Paper which wouldcomprise, subject to editorial amendment where necessary, the texts of the report by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) and thereport by the Chairman of the Council for Scientific Policy (theDainton report); would indicate the similarity of the approachadopted by both reports to the principle of the customer/contractorrelationship; would endorse that principle in the context ofGovernment research and development, on the basis of the proposals in the CPRS report; and would offer consultation with the scientificcommunity about those proposals, subject to a definite time limit for completion of the necessary discussions. The Lord Privy Sealshould arrange for the Ministerial Committee on Science and technology to approve the text of a Green Paper on this basis, whichshould be circulated to the Cabinet before it was published. TheCommittee should also consider how the results of the current studies of certain research programmes in the Department of Trade andIndustry and other Departments would best be dealt with in relationto the Green Paper and the subsequent consultations with the scientific community. The Governments final conclusions on thewhole range of issues involved might thereafter be published as a white Paper.
