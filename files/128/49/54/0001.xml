odesia&apos;iousference:(71) 49thnclusions,ute 3*The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP(71) 127 and 128) setting out the mainoutstanding problems affecting the next stage of negotiations withthe Rhodesian regime.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the sequence of visits paid by Lord Goodman and officials to Salisburyin recent months, of which the Cabinet had been kept informed, hadbeen publicly presented as preliminary to any substantive negotia-tions; but in fact considerable progress had been made in devisingthe framework of a settlement. The 1969 Rhodesian Constitutioncontained many features which were not reconcilable with the five principles; but the Rhodesian leader, Mr. Smith, had agreed tomake several important changes in the event of a settlement. Hehad agreed to replace the income tax regulator, under which thetotal number of African seats in Parliament was determined by the african percentage contribution to the total yield of income tax(an arrangement which could have been manipulated at will bythe Rhodesiap authorities) and to replace it by a more defensiblesystem based, on... individual income, property and educationalqualifications, Whereby the number of African seats in parliament would rise proportionately to the number of Africans registered onthe electoral rolls. He had also agreed to accept a Parliamentaryblocking mechanism, which would prevent retrogressive legislation in respect of African representation. When parity of representationbetween the white and non-white races v/as reached onward progress to majority rule would be effected by the creation of six, eight or tenCommon Roll seats. Mr. Smith had also accepted that, once paritywas reached, the Africans would be given the opportunity toabanddti the system whereby half their representatives were chosen by indirect election in favour of direct election of all their members of Parliament. He proposed that, when parity was achieved, a Commission should be appointed to advise whether anybetter system of proceeding to majority rule could be devised at thattime; but he had accepted that, in default of a two-thirds majority in the Rhodesian Parliament (which at parity would entail the affirmative votes of at least 17 of the 50 African representatives),the new Common Roll seats which were envisaged would then be created, thus leading to an African majority. These were allconsiderable gains. Such an electoral system would inevitably be criticised by those who advocated &quot; one man, one vote &quot; and, morerealistically, by those who, while accepting that it provided forunimpeded,progress to majority rule, regarded the pace of advanceas too slow. Given such imponderables as the effect of the aid programme on African educational levels, it was impossible to assessaccurately how long it would take to attain an African majorityunder these proposals; but the range of probabilities lay in the region of 30-40 years. Probably the main outstanding difficultyconcerned the framing of a justiciable Declaration of Rights, whichcould be crucial in relation to the fourth principle (&quot; progress towards vending racial discrimination&quot;).   Mr. Smith had accepted
the need for the Declaration to be justiciable; but he had argued that education and land should be excluded subjects, i.e. that legislation which increased discrimination in these matters shouldnot be open to challenge in the courts. Mr. Smith maintained that,in view of the relatively primitive conditions of African life in rhodesia, separate educational and land reservation systems werejustified. As regards the discriminatory provisions in existing legislation on these subjects, Mr. Smith was prepared to accept theestablishment of an independent Commission to make recom-mendations on the best means of making progress towards endingsuch discrimination. But, since the Commission^ role would bemerely advisory, critics of a settlement would be able to argue thatit would not represent an adequate discharge of the fourth principle.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary continued that in his view further visits to Salisbury by emissaries would not be fruitful;the only way to ascertain the final position of the Rhodesian regime and to determine whether a settlement was possible was for him to visit Rhodesia himself. There were reasonable prospects that hecould reach agreement on the number of Common Roll seats in thefRhodesian Parliament, on an increased allotment of land to trieAfricans and on a postponement of any contentious action to evictAfricans from land which they might be occupying in contravention of the Land Tenure Act. As for the Declaration of Rights, he hoped to Obtain acceptance of changes which would constitute a defensibledischarge of the fourth principle. Bearing in mind the danger thatany agreement might be frustrated by second thoughts on Mr. Smith&apos;part, under pressure from his Right-wing colleagues, he sought the cabinet&apos;s authority to initial the text of an agreement if a documentcould be prepared which, in his view and that of the attorney general, who would be accompanying him, was compatible with theFive Principles.In discussion it was agreed that, under the direction of theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the leadership of LordGoodman, the British emissaries had made considerable progress in persuading Mr. Smith that he would have to make substantial concessions if it were to be possible for us to reach a settlement with him. As a result the proposed constitutional arrangements were broadly satisfactory, although it would be important to secure thelargest possible number of Common Roll seats and to ensurethat: substantial funds provided under the proposed development programme were devoted to the development of African education,since this could be expected to have a direct bearing on the rate of progress towards African enfranchisement and Parliamentaryrepresentation. Serious concern was expressed, however, about the adequacy of the proposed Declaration of Rights as redrafted by the rhodesian representatives. Even if some of its most objectionablefeatures were amended, particularly those relating to racial discrimination, its terms were unlikely to withstand expert legalscrutiny as a guarantee of the normal liberties of the individual.Nevertheless, it was recognised that we had to accept the 1969Constitution as the basis for negotiation with the Rhodesian regime;
and it was a considerable achievement that Mr. Smith had been persuaded to accept a justiciable Declaration of Rights at all. Ifhe could agree to the removal of the clauses excepting from its provisions: matters concerning education and the occupation and useof land, we should have gone some way to restore the statusguaranteed to the Africans by the 1961 Constitution, which had been framed on the lines of the Constitutions of other newly independent commonwealth countries and had been acceptable to the Parliamentof the day, On the other hand the situation of the African populationhad deteriorated since 1961; and, while it was essential to securearrangements which would adequately prevent the intensification of discrimination in future legislation, it was also necessary, in orderto meet the requirements of the Fourth Principle, to makedemonstrable provision for the removal of existing forms of discrimination. The proposed independent Review Commissionoffered some prospect of securing the repeal or amendment of offensive legislation. But the Commission would have no executive powers; and the Rhodesian regime would be committed only tohaving&quot; serious regard &quot; to its findings. Many of the government&apos;s supporters; would find it impossible to endorse any settlement whichspecifically excluded discrimination in the fields of education and land, from the provisions of the Declaration of Rights. TheGovernment were pledged to the removal of discrimination in thiscountry; and their standing would be seriously damaged if they appeared to be conniving at a settlement which sanctioned the perpetuation of discrimination in Rhodesia.; In further discussion it was agreed that it would not be possibleto secure the acceptance of Parliament, the general public and international opinion to any settlement which did not conform clearlyto the Five Principles and that failure to provide for the elimination of discrimination in the fields of land and education would constitute a breach of the Fourth Principle. Moreover, the United nations would be unlikely to accept any settlement which did not providefor immediate African rule. We could not be expected to subscribe to so extreme a position. But the fact that it would probablyrepresent the reaction of the United Nations made it all the moreimportant for us to ensure, if possible, that the settlement was whollydefensible in terms of the Five Principles in order that we might beable to maintain that, since the rebellion had been brought to an endby our negotiations, no threat to the peace existed and theResolutions requiring economic sanctions to be maintained againstthe Rhodesian regime were therefore no longer applicable. Weshould hope to persuade our friends on the Security Council that theterms of the settlement were reasonable; and it should be possibleto counter criticism by indicating that the prospects of the AfricanRhodesians would be considerably improved by its terms. We shouldalso hop^ eventually to be able to point to a successful Test ofAcceptability to prove this point. Nevertheless, it was clear that further progress towards a settlement could not be made byemissaries and that the Governments supporters would expect a senior Minister to attempt to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.   It would therefore be right for the Foreign and
Commonwealth Secretary to visit Salisbury as he proposed. But itwould have to be accepted that, if we continued to insist on thecomplete satisfaction of the Five Principles, it might prove impossibleto negotiate a settlement at this juncture. Public opinion was notprepared for a breakdown in the discussions; and there would beawkward implications in Parliamentary terms. There was also a real danger that, if it were seen by the European Rhodesians that negotiations had finally broken down, extremist opinion might become predominant and the outlook for the African Rhodesianswould once again deteriorate. At the same time we should come under great pressure from some sections of domestic opinion toabandon our responsibilities for Rhodesia; and this in turn could put us in breach of our international obligations. Nevertheless,failure to conclude an agreement would be preferable to theacceptance of a settlement which would be indefensible on merits,less than honourable and probably unacceptable to RhodesianAfrican opinion.&apos; . The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be right for the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary to visit Rhodesia personally at this point.If he could secure from the Rhodesian regime the improvements in;i the proposed terms of agreement to which the Cabinet had indicated that they attached great importance, in particular those designed toshow clearly that the Fourth Principle was being honoured, especiallyin the matters of education and the occupation and use of land, hewas authorised to initial an agreement on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. But, if he had any doubt whether the terms of theproposed settlement were compatible with the honourable dischargeof our obligations, he should avoid commitment and should returnto llondon in order to enable the Cabinet to give further considerationto the matter. The Cabinet would, of course, welcome as frequentreports as the communications at his disposal made possible; andthey wished him good fortune.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign andi      Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordingly in his negotiations with the Rhodesian regime.1;   Cabinet Office,9 November, 1971.
