secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it wasnecessary to consider what action would be appropriate following the execution by the Sudanese Government of the leaders of therecent abortive coup, including the two individuals who had been removed from the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC)aircraft when it had been forcibly obliged to land in Libya. He had thought it right to send a personal message to President Nimeri ofthe Sudan, asking for clemency to be exercised in favour of the two men; and, although they had subsequently been executed, the factthat our intervention on their behalf had become public knowledgewould do no harm. Meanwhile, President Nimeri&apos;s regime seemedto be effectively back in power; and this would probably be to our advantage, since they were at least committed to an anti-Communistpolicy.But, although there was therefore no scope for further action with the Sudanese Government in connection with these events, it seemed desirable that we should find some way of making knownour displeasure to the Libyan Government, who had acted in an unprecedented and intolerable way in forcing a British civil aircraft to land in their territory. Our position for taking legal action,however, was not very strong. The Libyan Government were not a party to the International Air Services Transport Agreement; and ouroverflying rights in relation to Libya were based on a bilateral agreement which had been initialled but not yet ratified by the libyan authorities. Any action which we might take against Libyanaircraft would be bound to provoke retaliation, which would mostprobably take the form of withholding rights which were ofconsiderable value to us. In particular, there were currently 33BOAC overflights of Libya each week; and the Royal Air Force alsorelied on being able to use this route. Moreover, trade with Libyawas developing well and offered very attractive prospects. on balance, it might be appropriate that no further contracts for armssales should be completed with the Libyan Government for the timebeing and no further licences should be granted under existing contracts. But for purposes of public presentation it might suffice toindicate merely that we were reviewing our relations with the LibyanGovernment. He was consulting the United Kingdom permanent representative at the United Nations about possible action there.This might take the form of a letter to the Secretary-General,U Thant, indicating that we should wish to table a Motion fordiscussion in the appropriate forum. It should be possible, forexample at the General Assembly, to make good use of a protest-11b*1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. It was proposed thatthe House should rise on Thursday, 5 August, and should reassembleon Tuesday, 19 October. The House of Lords might need to returna few days earlier.
made by the Libyan Government at the time of the removal in 1970by the Israeli authorities of two Algerian passengers from a BOACaircraft.In discussion it was generally accepted that, although the actions Iof both the Libyan and Sudanese Governments were repugnant to us, Ithere would be no advantage in our reacting to them too Idemonstratively. To do so would inevitably put our own considerable 1interests at risk. Additional credit arrangements which had recently gbeen approved for the Sudan should accordingly be allowed to stand, jInvestigation had shown that both the pilot of the aircraft and the civil aviation authorities in Malta had acted properly; but it would Jbe of interest to Ministers to receive a clear account of the incident, Iindicating exactly what decisions the pilot had found it necessary Ito take. It would also be appropriate to initiate action in the United INations designed to draw world attention to the irresponsible \behaviour of the Libyan Government and to the need for international civil aviation arrangements to be observed in theinterests of all.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the action which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary proposed to take.The Cabinet-(1) Took note.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to circulate to his colleagues an account of his Departmentsinvestigation into the incident.SECRETMalta 3.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in previous        accordance with a decision of the Defence and Oversea PolicyReference:     Committee  our  Ambassador  to   the  North  Atlantic  TreatyCM (71) 40th   Organisation (NATO) was putting forward to the North AtlanticConclusions,    Council a proposal under which Malta would be paid, asMinute 4       &quot; compensation &quot; for a continued British military presence and the exclusion of forces of the Warsaw Pact Powers, an annual sum of 6^ million, of which the United Kingdom would be prepared tocontribute  1^ million.   Such an arrangement would be more advantageous to the Government of Malta than the payment of theresidue of our aid liabilities under existing agreements.   It wouldalso cost us more, because the economic aid which Mr. Mintoff, thePrime Minister of Malta, rejected would have to be diverted to othercountries if we were to fulfil our present undertakings on the total amount of our aid programme.   Nevertheless, it appeared frompreliminary soundings that NATO&apos;s response to this proposal was likely to be cool. The United States Government had indicated thatthey would not be able to contribute cash for the purpose; and othercountries also appeared likely to find objections to our proposal,which entailed sharing the costs between member countries in thesame ratio as other items approved for inclusion in the NATO
SECRET*4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that hehad hoped that the considerable progress which had been made byLord Goodman towards finding the basis for a settlement with the* Previously circulated in a Confidential AnnexMilitary Budget. He would be considering, in conjunction with theSecretary of State for Defence, whether another offer, more likely tobe acceptable to NATO while being regarded as reasonable bymoderate public opinion both here and in Malta, could be formulated.In discussion it was suggested that the argument for devising an improved offer to Mr. Mintoff was by no means self-evident. Thepresent level of aid to Malta was generous, by some standardsexcessively so; and there seemed little justification for an offer whichcould be used by Mr. Mintoff to demonstrate that he could extractfrom us more favourable terms than his Nationalist predecessor,Dr. Bprg Olivier, had succeeded in obtaining, since this would merelyprovide him with material for consolidating his present marginalParliamentary majority. Moreover, if the NATO countries werenot prepared jointly to shoulder a financial burden to deny the useof Malta to Warsaw Pact forces, there was no obvious reason why weshould regard it as part of our responsibility as a member of NATOto bear the whole of the cost ourselves. Against these arguments itwas pointed out that the aim of devising an amended offer would be primarily tactical, in that there was very little prospect thatMr. Mintoff would accept the  6^ million offer even if NATOendorsed it. Mr. Mintoffs political position vis-a-vis the Nationalistswas considered by our High Commissioner in Malta to be stronger than his Parliamentary majority of one might suggest; and it was important therefore to break with him, if we had to, on a basis which showed his attitude to be demonstrably unreasonable. Acomplication was the widespread public belief, both here and in malta, that the baseline for negotiations was an aid commitment of 5 million a year, whereas in fact our total outstanding liability underthe Financial Agreement until March 1974 was less than  10 million.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to decide on the terms of any amended proposalfor payments to the Malta Government. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for defence should jointly consider the situation in the light of the receptionaccorded by the North Atlantic Council to our earlier offer; andthey should then put their proposals to the Cabinet for consideration in the following week.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theSecretary of State for Defence to circulate proposalsaccordingly.
confidential. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the arbitration award on the Post Office Engineering Union pay claim was disquieting. The Post Office Arbitration Tribunal, under thechairmanship of the new chairman of the Civil Service arbitration tribunal, Mr. Mustill, had awarded an increase of 11 per cent,compared with a claim for 13 per cent and an offer of 1\ per cent,in each case excluding an additional 2 per cent already agreed inrespect of productivity. The award, which had evidently been basedon comparability with Civil Service rates and a rise in the level ofthe retail price index by 10 per cent over the last 12 months, wouldbe liable to have a damaging effect on the Governments efforts toreduce the level of wage increases. The arbitration had taken place under the Post Office&apos;s own agreed arbitration procedures and it hadnot therefore been possible for the Office of Manpower EconomicsIndustrialAffairsPay of post OfficeEngineersRhodesian regime would have proved sufficient to justify his makinga personal visit to Salisbury in the hope of settling outstanding points;and reporting appropriately to Parliament before the Recess.Unfortunately, it had become clear from the last message from the rhodesian leader, Mr. Smith, that the discrepancy between our respective positions was still too wide for this to be possible; andhe proposed therefore to conduct the next stage of the negotiations on the basis of a rather more deliberate timetable. He had just sent a message to Mr. Smith indicating that it was essential, before anypersonal meeting could be arranged, to make more progress on the outstanding points, in particular the cardinal point of progress fromparity to majority rule, and offering a further visit by Lord Goodmanto Salisbury if Mr. Smith showed any inclination to reconsider hisposition. It might thereafter be appropriate for him to go to rhodesia himself in the autumn, immediately after the parliamentary debate on our application for membership of the european communities.In a brief discussion it was suggested that there might be tacticaladvantage in deferring any Parliamentary debate on Rhodesia untilthe matter of our entry into the Communities had been disposed of.It was also recognised that in any event the passage of an Orderrenewing the application of sanctions, which would be due in mid-November, would be attended by difficulties which should not beunderestimated.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that negotiations with the Rhodesian regime shouldbe continued in the manner outlined by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and that the best time for his visit to salisbury, if the development of the negotiations warranted it, mightbe between the end of the debate on our entry into the european economic Communities and the date on which the Sanctions order would be due for renewal.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
Probation andAfter CareServicePreviousReference:CM (71) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6to advise the Tribunal. He was considering what guidance could usefully and properly be given to the members of arbitral bodiesabout those factors in wage claims which involved the national economic interest.The Home Secretary said that, since the Cabinet had last discussed the pay of the Probation Service, the Probation officers had, at their annual conference, rejected an offer on the basispreviously approved by Ministers. In addition, the local authoritysocial workers had received a further pay increase of the order of8  per cent. Taking into account both the Government^ agreed policy to expand the Probation Service and the reduced attractivenessof the Probation Service as compared with the local authority social service, the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations had now agreed in principle that the pay of the two services should be linked, in order to avoid further &quot; leapfrogging &quot; of pay claims. TheCommittee had agreed a pay scale which would follow the new localauthority social workers&apos; scale with the exception of the four highestpoints, in respect of which a more generous offer had already beenmade which would have to be honoured. This new offer, whichwould have effect from 1 April, 1971, for a period of 15 months,would be linked with a thorough and objective inquiry into therelative responsibilities and conditions of service of the ProbationOfficers and the local authority social workers, with a view to determining what link there should be in the future between the pay of the two services. The inquiry would be carried out with the help of the Office of Manpower Economics. He had put these proposals to the employers&apos; representatives on the previous day; and they had agreed to try to secure their acceptance by the Probation Officers.,   The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment and the Home Secretary.SECRETUpp*r 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofc,yde : State for Trade and Industry (CP (71) 95) about the possibility ofShipbuilders    creating a new enterprise based on the facilities of Upper ClydePrevious        Shipbuilders Ltd. (UCS).Reference :CM (71) 31st The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he had conclusions now received the conclusions and recommendations of the AdvisoryGroup set up to advise him on possible ways of reconstructing those parts of UCS which were potentially viable. Although the group had originally been doubtful of the prospects of viability of any newenterprise based on the facilities of the company, they had nowconcluded, after taking advice from shipbuilding experts, that alimited enterprise based on the Govan and Linthouse yards could beprofitable, provided that certain conditions were satisfied, notablyfull co-operation between the trades unions and the management.They recommended the immediate disposal of the other yards and thetransfer of the remaining UCS orders, which on examination had
proved to be modest, to the new enterprise. It was estimated that about  9 million would be needed to launch the new undertaking.In view of the weakness of the present order book and the generallylow level of world demand for new ships, the Group did not expect that private equity capital could be attracted; and they consideredthat the Government should provide the necessary funds in the hopethat the enterprise could be transferred to private ownership after its viability had been established. No great reliance, however,could be placed on the latter possibility; and it was likely that public support for the new enterprise would be needed for an indefinite period, contrary to the Governmenfs general industrial policy. Onthe other hand a refusal of Government support would have painfulsocial consequences and would be difficult to defend in the light ofthe hopes which the Government had previously expressed. If it proved possible to implement the Group&apos;s proposal, the newenterprise would provide some 2,500 jobs compared with 8,600currently provided by UCS. The shipbuilders on the Lower Clydecould provide work for a further 1,000; and, together with Yarrow(Shipbuilders), they might be able to offer additional employment if more naval orders were in prospect, although this seemed unlikely.If, as appeared possible, the Scotstoun yard was repurchased by its former owners, this might provide work for a further 500 men.With some reluctance, he proposed that the Government should accept the Advisory Group&apos;s proposals and should be prepared tosupport the establishment of a shipbuilding enterprise in the Govanand Linthouse yards, including an investment of up to  10 million of public funds, provided that satisfactory undertakings could beobtained from the trades unions. Meanwhile, the two yards shouldbe kept in operation through the Liquidator; but, if satisfactoryagreements with the unions were not reached by 30 November,operations should not continue beyond the end of 1971. If necessary,an indemnity should be given to the Liquidator against loss on threecontracts which might provide work for the yards in the interim period; working capital for this purpose should also be advanced to the Liquidator; and guarantees of completion should be given tothe purchasers. If the Liquidator was not able to continue on this basis for the whole period, it might be necessary to introduce some alternative caretaker management. Any necessary funds would bedrawn from the Civil Contingencies Fund. Estimates wouldthereafter need to be submitted to Parliament; and if a continuingoperation was involved, legislation would need to be introduced assoon as practicable. Since the formal application for a winding-uporder was now being submitted and the court would rule on it later in the week, an early statement to Parliament, a draft of which was appended to CP (71) 95, would be necessary.In discussion it was pointed out that until recently the AdvisoryGroup had had serious reservations about the possibility of creatingany viable enterprise from the facilities of UCS. Although they were now more confident on the basis of the technical advice which theyhad received, the evidence which had led to this change of view wasnot yet available to the Cabinet, who had before them only theAdvisory Group&apos;s conclusions and recommendations.  The creation
of a new enterprise based on public funds, without any real certainty that it could be sold off later, was contrary to the governments general industrial policy and would be unwelcome to manyGovernment supporters. No provision had been made in the public expenditure forecasts for the initial expenditure or for any further contributions which might prove necessary later. Moreover, theconditions regarding trade union co-operation would be difficult eitherto obtain or to enforce. On the other hand it was argued that theannouncement of the winding-up order would provoke considerableunrest in Scotland; and some militant action might be taken. Theworkers had been misled, both by their shop stewards and by theUCS management, into believing that UCS had been rounding the corner. Since the Government had said that they hoped to promote a reconstruction of the company and the Advisory Group had now suggested a possible way of achieving this, it would be necessary atleast to make the attempt, provided that the conditions laid downby the Group could be satisfied. The presentation of theGovernments response to the Advisory Group&apos;s recommendations,however, would be of critical importance. There was no reason whythe Government should adopt a defensive posture in this matter. Onthe contrary they should make it clear that, while they accepted the basic principle of the report, the Advisory Group had emphasised that the proposed reconstruction was subject to a number of necessary prior conditions; and it was now for those concerned inScotland to see that those conditions were complied with. In the firstinstance, for example, the Government might offer to subscribe only part of the capital, leaving the remainder to be found by private interests in Scotland.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The full report from the Advisory Group was not yet available. It should do no more than provide detailed argumentssubstantiating the conclusions and recommendations; but it was expected to be highly critical of certain individuals concerned withthe management of the company. The Advisory Group would onlybe prepared to submit the full report if they were assured that itwould not be published. On the other hand there would be considerable pressure for its publication. But, since the essence ofthe Group&apos;s findings was contained in the summary of conclusions and recommendations, these might be regarded as constituting thereport for practical purposes; and the more comprehensive documentshould be treated as merely supplementary material given in confidence by the Group to the Secretary of State. Even so, it wouldbe desirable to take the necessary steps to ensure that the publishedreport would enjoy the full protection of Parliamentary privilege. Ifpossible, however, this should not prevent its being made available tothe Press at the same time as the Secretary of State made his statement in Parliament.(b) The Advisory Group suggested that other shipbuilders onthe Clyde could employ the substantial numbers of additional men if further orders were placed by the Ministry of Defence. the constraints on the defence budget, however, made it unlikely thatany relief could be provided in this way, although the possibility of
defence orders being placed from abroad need not be excluded. Itwould be unfortunate if hope were held out in a published documentthat work might be made available, when this could not be provided in practice. The Advisory Group might be asked to consider, in thesecircumstances, whether the reference in their conclusions to thepossibility of defence orders could be omitted., (c) Some members of the Advisory Group had expressedwillingness to play a part in implementing their proposal. They had felt that, if it was clear that UCS would not continue, there was agood chance that they could persuade the workers to co-operate inthe new arrangement.(d) It was an established convention that legislation should beintroduced to authorise expenditure on any continuing activity; andin principle this convention should be maintained. It would be undesirable, however, to enter into any firm commitment to introduce legislation until it was clear that the necessary conditions for thecreation of the new enterprise would be fulfilled. Any interimexpenditure financed from the Civil Contingencies Fund should therefore be for clearly defined objects and should be subject to adefinite and early terminal date.(e) In any public statement it should be made clear that theposition of the creditors would be properly safeguarded and that theLiquidator would be acting under the direction of the court. any arrangement to continue work in the yards would be subject to his agreement.(/) Further consideration might be given to the possibility of announcing some expansion of retraining facilities in order to helpthose made redundant. The statement should also make it clear thatredundancies would be phased over a period.(g) Further consideration should also be given to the need tomake appropriate reference to foreign orders which had been placed with UCS and had not yet been completed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a new enterprise should be established on thelines proposed by the Advisory Group, provided that the conditionsspecified by the Group could be complied with. But the public announcement of this decision would need to take full account ofthe presentational points which had been mentioned in discussion.The draft Parliamentary statement annexed to CP (71) 95 should therefore be examined and revised accordingly by a group ofMinisters consisting of the Lord President, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the chief secretary, Treasury, the Solicitor General and the Lord Advocate.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Approved the  recommendations  in  paragraph  11 of cp (71) 95.
(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry :(i) In consultation with the Lord President and the LawOfficers, to arrange for the conclusions andrecommendations of the Advisory Group to bepublished in such manner as would ensure thatthey enjoyed the full protection of parliamentary privilege.(ii) To announce, in terms agreed by the group ofMinisters indicated by the Prime Minister inhis summing up, the Governments willingness topromote a new enterprise on the lines suggestedby the Advisory Group, provided that the necessaryconditions were satisfied.SECRET7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP (71) 93), to which was attached amemorandum by the Minister for Aerospace, about the Rolls-RoyceRB211 engine.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry recalled that theGovernment had arranged to finance Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. tocontinue work on the RB211 engine for the Lockheed TriStaraircraft until 8 August, when the contract between the firm andLockheed would come into force provided that by then the UnitedStates Administration had been authorised by Congress to guarantee the necessary additional credit for Lockheed and had assured us thatthey were satisfied of Lockheed&apos;s ability to complete the TriStarproject. We had also stipulated that the airlines should by then have confirmed their orders to buy TriStars on the new terms. TheUnited States Congress, however, would go into Recess on 6 August;and the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC) had considered the three situations with which we might then be faced.If, before rising, Congress had authorised the guarantee, the airlineshad confirmed their orders for the TriStar and the United StatesGovernment were able to give us the assurance which we had soughtthat Lockheed&apos;s would have the funds necessary to complete theaircraft, the Governments conditions would be fully met and production of the RB211 would accordingly continue under thenew contract. If, on the other hand, the United States Congresstook a clear decision before the Recess to reject the United states administration^ guarantee proposals, the airlines would be unlikely to confirm their orders and it would be impossible for the UnitedStates Administration to satisfy the conditions which we hadprescribed. The Committee had agreed that in that event productionof the RB 211 engine should stop. The third, and perhaps most likely,situation was that Congress would have taken no firm decision eitherway by 8 August. The Committee had agreed that, on thishypothesis and provided that we were advised that there werereasonable prospects of our conditions being met when Congressreassembled in the autumn, work on the RB 211 should continue andwe should be prepared, if necessary, to continue financing Rolls-Royce(1971) until the end of October at a cost estimated at a further  30million. While it would no doubt be necessary before Parliamentrose to give the House of Commons some indication of the position,it might be desirable for tactical reasons to avoid announcing our willingness to continue financing the RB 211 after 8 August until asSECRET11 c*
late as possible, since such an announcement would weaken the pressure on the United States Congress to deal promptly with theguarantee legislation. One possibility might be for the Lord Presidentof the Council to explain the position briefly to Parliament in thecourse of the debate on the Motion for the summer adjournment on August. But no final decision need be reached on this point oron the content of the statement until the course of events in theUnited States became clearer.In reaching their conclusion, EPC had taken account of thedisturbing rise since the spring in the estimated cost of completing the project. They had felt that this reflected seriously on the judgment of the company&apos;s management and that it indicated the needfor very early consideration of the possibility of making changes inthe company&apos;s direction and ensuring a more regular and reliablesupply of information to the Government.In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by EPC. It was suggested, however, that it would bedesirable to seek to put greater pressure on the United States congress to come to a clear decision on the guarantee legislation before risingon 6 August. We might, for example, let it be known that we would need to consider reducing work on the RB211 to a care andmaintenance basis pending a firm decision. This might help to accelerate a decision by Congress. On the other hand we shouldnot in fact be able to carry out such a threat without risk ofbankrupting Lockheed. Moreover, in order to preserve the contract between Rolls-Royce (1971) and Lockheed after 8 August, theexisting &quot; trigger&quot; clause would require amendment; and this amendment could not be concealed from the United States authorities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusions reached by EPC. They also agreed on the importance of taking early steps to strengthen the directionof Rolls-Royce (1971) and to improve the quality and flow ofinformation from the company to the Government. The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should consider how we might bestrepresent to the United States Administration our concern about thedelaying tactics being adopted in the United States Congress on an issue of major industrial importance to both countries and our anxiety to secure a speedy decision.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.NationalHealthServicePay ofDesignatedand GeneralGradesPreviousReference:CM (71) 41stConclusions,Minute 1CONFIDENTIAL8. The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had reconsidered the position inrelation to the pay claim of the National Health Service (NHS)Designated and General grades in the light of the fact that an offeramounting in total to 9-9 per cent had already been made to the nhs Secretarial grades. The Committee had been able to confirm that the offer made to the Secretarial grades had been based on the previously accepted relationship with the Civil Service; but they had
riot been able to agree about the implications of this offer for the designated and General grades.In discussion, although there was recognition of the risk that asettlement at 9-9 per cent, together with other settlements of morethan 10 per cent which were currently being negotiated, would damage the Governments strategy for reducing the level of pay settlements in the public sector, the general view was that it was essential that the Government should not be seen to act unfairly bybreaking the established link with the Civil Service. If all possible steps were taken to ensure that the settlement was presented as no more than a &quot;catching up&quot; operation from the 1970-71 round ofsettlements, the public impact could be minimised. If, however, the link was to be retained on this occasion, it was questionable whether9 - 9 per cent was the minimum increase which could be held to be consistent with that decision. Moreover, the fact that the commitment to relativity with the Civil Service had been accepted without reference to Ministers in the case of the Secretarial gradeswas a causeior some concern; in future, no increase in pay of morethan 5 per cent, and no proposal to increase pay for the second time within a 12-month period, should be authorised without Ministerialapproval.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed, on balance, that there was an obligation on theGovernment to maintain the pay link between the Civil Service andthe NHS administrative and clerical staffs on this occasion. But theoffer to be made to the Staff Side should be at the minimum levelconsistent with the maintenance of the link. The Secretary of Statefor Social Services should consult urgently with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment, with aview to reaching agreement on the precise level of the offer to bemade on this basis. In future no pay increase of more than 5 percent, and no second increase within 12 months, should be authorisedwithout Ministerial approval.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,28 My, 1971
