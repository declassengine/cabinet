SubjectEconomic situation
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reviewed the economic situation in the light of the mid-July economic forecasts,taking into account the favourable public response to the recentinitiative by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) to promoteprice restraint by their members in the ensuing 12 months providedthat the Government would take action to stimulate more rapideconomic growth.. At the time of the Budget it had been expected that output would rise by rather more than 3 per cent between the first half of 1971and the first half of 1972. On the basis of the latest forecast, however,the increase would be rather greater; but the base from which itwas calculated would be lower than had been assumed in March.It had then been expected that in the first six months of 1971 output would be lower by one half of 1 per cent than in the preceding sixmonths, whereas it had actually been reduced by as much as \\ percent. The continuing rise in unemployment, although partly theresult of the efforts of employers to reduce overmanning, alsoreflected the low level of economic activity and provided further evidence that demand was running at a lower level than had been estimated at the time of the Budget. If no further stimulus wereadministered to the economy before the next Budget, unemployment would be likely to rise beyond the levels previously forecast; andindustrial investment also would remain sluggish. On the other hand,the depressed level of demand and the resultant reduction in the levelof imports, together with alterations in exchange rates by certain other countries, had exercised a beneficial effect on the balance ofpayments. The current account surplus in the first half of 1971had been running at an annual rate of  600 million, double the rate which the National Institute for Economic and Social Research hadforecast for the whole year. As a result it would be possible to repayin August the outstanding balance of  256 million of our borrowingsfrom the International Monetary Fund in June, 1968; and the present administration would then have repaid, since taking office in theprevious summer, a total of  1,044 million of international debt,leaving only the  417 million borrowed in 1969-70 still to be repaid.Other favourable factors to be taken into account were theGovernments success in first containing and then beginning to reducethe level of wage settlements, together with the institution of voluntary price restraint by manufacturing industry which it was proposed, in accordance with the Cabinets decision at their previous meeting, to match in the nationalised industries. All these factors,combined with the need to promote an atmosphere of greaterconfidence in the period of preparation for our accession to theEuropean Communities, suggested that it might now be opportuneto take further measures to stimulate demand.The action which he envisaged for this purpose could besummarised as follows. First, he proposed to make two changes in capital investment allowances. The first-year allowance of 60 percent would be increased to 80 per cent in respect of capitalexpenditure incurred in the two years ending 1 August, 1973; and free depreciation on immobile plant and machinery for firms in! SECRET-9 b*
development areas would be extended to the service industries, 1! instead of being limited to manufacturing industry. The latter change Iwould be permanent and would thus end the present discrimination Iagainst service industries. Second, he proposed to remove the Iremaining restrictions on hire purchase transactions, as recommended Iby the Crowther Commission on Consumer Credit, although the \existing powers to regulate such transactions would be retained for Ithe time being while the current consultations with financial jinstitutions about alternative methods of credit control were in iprogress. Third, he proposed to reduce by Order each of four rates jof Purchase Tax by 2/ llths, or approximately 18 per cent. He had 1chosen this course because the alternative of invoking the &quot;regulator&quot; would entail making a standard reduction in rates of duty which Iwould have to include tobacco, wines and spirits and motor spirits; jand this would be inappropriate. The reduction in Purchase Tax ]should arguably be concentrated at the upper end of the range of 1rates, since this would constitute a natural transitional step in the ;replacement of the tax by the proposed Value-added Tax. But the Iimpact would be less widespread; and the absence of any change in ;lthe lower rates of the tax would be liable to be regarded by public ?opinion as inequitable. The reduction in Purchase Tax would cost \ 110 million in the current year and  235 million in a full year; the changes in capital allowances, which would come into initial effect &apos;in 1972-73, would cost  41 million in that year and  147 million in i1973-74. Any calculation of the effect on the level of demand must !take account not only of these proposals, together with the recent decision to spend an additional  100 million in infrastructure works jin 1971-72 and 1972-73, but also of the prospect of a greater degree ;of price restraint, which would itself be offset by any reduction in jthe rate of increase in money incomes. In the aggregate, however, joutput might rise between the first half of 1971 and the first half ?of 1972 by about 4  per cent, compared with the 3 per cent previously !estimated. This prospect should suffice to assure the CBI that the \Government were seeking to respond to their appeal for voluntary Jundertakings on price restraint; and it might also induce the Trades ]Union Congress to adopt a more constructive attitude in relation to Iclaims for increased wages. subject to the Cabinefs approval, he proposed to announce these measures in the House of Commons that afternoon.IIn discussion the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer Iwere generally welcomed; they combined boldness with equity in 1the degree which was required in present circumstances to give a 1stimulus to the economy and to business confidence. Although the 1proposed changes in capital allowances might be criticised as 1narrowing the differential advantages for firms in development areas, such criticism should be countered by emphasising that much of the Ibenefit of higher investment by firms in other parts of the country Iwould accrue to suppliers of plant and machinery who were in many 1cases located in development areas. Moreover, the concession Iof an improved first-year allowance for a limited period seemed 1unlikely to influence any firm to transfer a project for investment in aa development area to some other part of the country. The jGovernmenfs decision to increase expenditure on infrastructure 11
measures by  100 million was also directed wholly to the advantageof the assisted areas.In the public presentation of the proposed changes in purchase tax it would be desirable to explain why a reduction of the fourrates of tax had been judged preferable to the use of the &quot; regulator &quot;,which had been widely expected. It would also be important to stress the effect which these proposals, in combination with voluntaryprice restraint, should exert on the level of prices; and it should bemade clear that the Government expected that traders in general would arrange immediately for the reduced rates of Purchase Tax tobe reflected in retail prices and that the food industry in particularwould subscribe fully to price restraint, about which it appeared atpresent to be hesitant. In presenting the decision that the nationalised industries should also observe price restraint, the Government shouldacknowledge that the industries themselves would benefit not only from such restraint on the part of their suppliers but also from thelower level of wage settlements which they should be able to secure.In any reference to the Trades Union Congress, however, it mightbe unwise to dwell too heavily on the extent to which the governmenth oped that organised labour would respond to the measures topromote more rapid economic growth, since this might put the moderate Trade Union leaders at a tactical disadvantage in relationto their more militant colleagues.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposals and agreed that they should be announced in the House of Commons that afternoon. A copy of the statement should be put in the PrintedPaper Office of the House of Lords, in accordance with normal practice for statements of a Budgetary nature. While it would be right to present these further measures as designed to strengthenconfidence and to stimulate faster economic growth and to indicatethat they provided the conditions which both the CBI and the TradesUnion Congress considered necessary for acceptance of voluntaryprice restraint and greater moderation in wage demands, theGovernments decisions were not dependent on, and should not be directly linked with, the response of either side of industry. In orderto maintain Britain&apos;s competitive standing as a nation and to reinforce our industrial strength against the day when we entered theEuropean Communities the Government could not afford to relaxtheir efforts to defeat cost-inflation; and the present measures shouldbe presented consistently with that over-riding objective.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce, in astatement in the House of Commons that afternoon, themeasures which he proposed to take to stimulate a more rapid rate of economic growth.
