Oversea affairs vietnam(previous reference:CC (65) 8thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, in the lightof the latest intensification of hostilities in South Vietnam, he hadbeen in personal touch with the President of the United States,President Johnson, and had reaffirmed that we were ready, in our capacity as co-Chairman of the 1954 Geneva Conference onVietnam, to put our good offices at the disposal of the parties to thedispute at the appropriate moment. It was clear, however, that thesituation had not yet developed to the point at which the UnitedStates Government might wish to avail themselves of this offer.housing programme(previous reference:CC (65) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C (65) 17) and by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C (65) 21) about the housing programme for England and Wales.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thepublic housing programme was based on approvals given during the calendar year. During 1964, 144,000 approvals were given; and therewere strong grounds for increasing the figure for 1965 to 156,000.The Government were pledged to increase the building of new houses both for rent and for sale. So far, however, houses for renthad lagged behind; and these should now have priority both on social grounds and because the Governments proposals for rent control would be liable to be ineffective unless much larger numbersof rented houses were available. Only public authorities, however,were willing to build houses of this kind on any significant scale;and hitherto they had tended to concentrate on slum clearance andthe relief of overcrowding and had been allowed to build relatively little to meet general housing needs. They should now be allowedto do more in this respect.Moreover, a rising programme of public housing was necessaryin order to promote the greater use of industrialised building, whichcould only be achieved by organising large forward orders.Productive capacity in this respect was probably available to theextent of some 50,000 dwellings a year or four times the numberbuilt in the previous year; and the proposed increase in the public housing programme should be within the capacity of the buildingindustry provided that the additional 12,000 houses were built byindustrialised methods. Private house building was admittedly likelyto increase at the same time; but, if it appeared to be rising to an excessive level, it would be necessary to devise further means of ensuring a proper balance within the housing programme as a whole.The impact on the Budget of the expanded programme of publicCC 9 (65)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
housing now proposed would depend on the outcome of the reviewof housing subsidies, on which it should be possible to introduce legislation in the 1965-66 Session. On the basis of the existingsubsidies the increase in the public housing programme by 12,000houses a year would entail no additional expenditure for the first twoyears and, thereafter, an addition of only  400,000 a year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cabinet&apos;s approval of his proposals for the long-term programming of public expenditure (CC (65) 5th Conclusions, Item 3) had provided for housing investment of  506 million in 1964-65. This comprisedexpenditure by local authorities and new towns in England andWales on a &quot;work done&quot; basis equivalent to 130,000 houses. Thecorresponding figures in the &quot; basic programme &quot; for 1969-70 were 557 million and 145,000 houses. Approvals at the rate of 156,000houses a year, if maintained, would therefore quickly raise the annual rate of expenditure to the equivalent of 11,000 houses (approximately 33 million at present prices) above the rate hitherto envisaged for1969-70. This would be tantamount to pre-empting for housing alarge part of the sum which was intended to be available for allocation between the various claimants for &quot; additional&quot;programmes of public expenditure in the general review in July.Moreover, if expenditure on public housing were increased withoutcompensating reductions elsewhere, this additional outlay wouldhave to be financed by increased borrowing when the houses were started; and this, rather than the impact on the subsidies to beprovided by the Exchequer, was the crucial financial issue. It alsoseemed optimistic to assume that the construction industries couldaccommodate the proposed increase in building in addition to the enlarged expenditure envisaged in other fields, such as hospital building; while any proposal to reduce house building in the private sector would not be easily reconciled with the measures which were contemplated to make house purchase easier. Finally, it was essentialto bear in mind the psychological impact of successive increases in public expenditure on our friends and allies abroad, whosewillingness to continue to finance our balance of payments deficitwould depend essentially on the extent to which we could convince them that we were planning to live within our means. For all these reasons there should be no increase in public housing approvals for1965 above the figure of 144,000 houses, at least until the comprehensive review of public sector expenditure programmes inJuly.Discussion showed a division of opinion in the Cabinet. On theone hand it was maintained that housing, especially the building ofhouses for rent, could claim priority, on both social and economic grounds, over other claims on our resources, particularly in view ofthe extent to which successive Conservative Governments, excepttowards the end of the last Administration, had made inadequateprovision for public housing programmes. Moreover, in the longer term the necessary increase of housing could only be achieved by agreater use of industrialised building; and the main reason why theindustrial capacity which could be employed for this purpose wasnot being brought into use was the fact that public authorities,
despite an encouraging tendency to form consortia for housebuilding, were not in a position to undertake the large-scaleprogrammes which were necessary if this form of construction wasto prove economical. The expansion of the housing programme onthe lines now proposed would therefore provide the necessarystimulus to the construction industries to modernise their methods and to take full advantage of technological developments; and theresults should be beneficial not only in relation to the housing programme in this country but also in terms of the export ofprefabricated housing and component parts, for which a considerablepotential market existed.On the other hand it was claimed that the areas of greatestdemand for housing were precisely those where resources were already scarce; and this fact, coupled with the rise in private housebuilding, which must be expected to continue in the absence of restraint, would aggravate the overloading of the construction industries and intensify the inflationary pressures. It was clearlynecessary to secure a greater use of industrialised building; but this could be achieved if we could induce local authorities to apply these methods to the houses in the existing programme instead ofconfining ourselves to an attempt to promote them in relation to the programmes of future years. Moreover, while the proposed increasein public housing would have virtually no immediate impact on theExchequer and only a relatively small effect in later years, it would impose a heavy additional burden on public expenditure in the widersense; and it should therefore be considered in relation to the restof the long-term plan of public sector expenditure. In Scotland thesituation was different in the sense that the main problem was an inadequate level of private house building; but Scottish opinion would expect to share equally with England and Wales anyexpansion of the public housing programme.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,before reaching a final decision, the Cabinet would need to be more fully informed about several aspects of the issues involved. Inparticular, they would need to know what steps might be taken to limit private house building, if necessary; and how far additional resources might be released by these means and perhaps by an intensification of the ban on the building of new offices and other non-essential premises. It would also be necessary to define the areasin which it was proposed that additions to existing public housing programmes should be permitted and to explore the means by whichthe Government could ensure that these additional allocations wouldbe implemented by industrialised, rather than conventional buildingmethods. The location of the additional housing should be shown to be related to the areas where building resources were unemployed and the need for new houses was most urgent. The manpowerimplications of the extended programme should also be examined.While the proposals would then need to be considered further inthe light of other claims on our financial and economic resources, adecision should be taken as rapidly as possible and should not
necessarily wait till July, when any additional approvals would begranted too late in the year to enable building to make much progress before it was handicapped by bad weather.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofPublic Building and Works, to consider how theadditional information, indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion, might most conveniently be made available as rapidly as possible.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C (65) 17 and 21 in thelight of the results of the action to be taken under conclusion (1) above.Aid to Zambia 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations and the Minister of overseas development (C. (65) 20) about aid to Zambia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Government ofZambia claimed that the financial settlement reached when theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved had beenunjust, particularly as regards the allocation of the former federal public Debt, and that they had accepted it only in return foran undertaking that they would receive substantial aid from theUnited Kingdom. No such undertaking had in fact been given; butthe Government of Zambia undoubtedly believed that it had.At present there was no case on economic grounds for providingaid for Zambia; but there were strong political arguments in favourof doing so. President Kaunda was well-disposed to the West; but some elements in his Government favoured a reorientation ofZambian policy towards the Soviet Union and Communist Chinaand any development of this nature would represent a serious threat to our position in Central Africa. In particular, the expatriate civilservants on whom the administration of the country depended would leave or be displaced; and our stake in the Zambian copper industry would be in jeopardy. For these reasons it would be desirable thatwe should offer the Government of Zambia, in full and final settlement of their claim, aid amounting to  10 million over a periodof five years. The purposes to which this sum should be devoted andthe rate at which it should be spent would need to be decided inconsultation with the Zambian authorities. But it should be regardedas including our contribution to the contingency planning which theGovernment of Zambia were undertaking against the possibility that economic sanctions might be applied by the Government of SouthernRhodesia in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence bythe Colony; and it should also comprise both the defence aid which itwas in our own interests to provide to Zambia and the assistance which would be required if the expatriate civil servants were to be persuaded to remain in Zambia.
Defence White 5. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of paper State for Defence (C. (65) 19), to which was appended a proof copyof the Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1965.CC 9 (65)The Minister of Overseas Development supported this proposal.The offer of a smaller sum for a shorter period, coupled withan undertaking to review the situation thereafter, might well prove a more expensive form of settlement in the longer term; and it wouldnot enable us to reach a final settlement on the Zambian claims inconnection with the dissolution of the Federation. The proposedpayment of  10 million could be accommodated, defence aid apart,within the approved aid programme as a whole over the next fiveyears.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it was not in disputethat the Government of Zambia possessed ample resources and hadno claim to aid on economic grounds. In these circumstances it wouldbe difficult to justify to international opinion the offer of so large asum as  10 million, especially at a time when we were heavily dependent on other countries for assistance in financing our ownbalance of payments deficit. Moreover, there could be no certainty that the payment of  10 million would not be followed by furtherrequests from Zambia for additional aid. It would be preferable,therefore, to confine our immediate offer to the amount likely to be needed in the next 12 months perhaps  2 million for aid in relationto defence and the Zambian public service and to undertake to review the position in a year&apos;s time. We should then be better able to judge the political future of Zambia and the extent to whichthe country was still exposed to the threat of economic pressure bySouthern Rhodesia.In discussion it was generally agreed that, although there was no economic justification for providing aid to Zambia, the political arguments in favour of doing so were decisive and that, in order to achieve our political objectives, there was a strong case for offering 10 million over five years. So far as possible this sum shouldbe regarded as discharging, in addition to our other commitments,any claim which the Government of Zambia might make forassistance in refinancing in 1970-72 certain railway loans. It wassuggested that, if the payment of  10 million were presented primarily in terms of military aid, there might be less risk that it would attractadverse criticism from other countries. This suggestion, however,should be considered further in the light of the possible effect on president Kaunda&apos;s position and on relations between Zambia and southern Rhodesia.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to the points made in their discussion,the Government of Zambia should be offered a sum of 10 million in defence and economic aid over the next fiveyears.
In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, as was emphasised in its introductory paragraphs, the White Paperrepresented only an interim statement of the Governments defence policy, which would be further reviewed in the light of a series of detailed studies which were now in train. Although defence expenditure remained at a very high figure in absolute terms andmight rise still further before it could be effectively curtailed, theEstimates for 1965-66, which reflected a reduction of  55 million onthe cost of the programme which the Government had inherited fromthe previous Administration, represented an initial step in thisdirection; and the main purpose of the studies now in hand wouldbe to try to ascertain the further means by which, in the next fewyears, defence expenditure might be reduced to approximately thepresent level in real terms.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Statement on the defence estimates, 1965, appended to C (65) 19.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th February, 1965.
