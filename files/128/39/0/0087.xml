FairfieldsShipyard(previous reference:CC (65) 69thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that negotiations had now been completed in principle for the acquisition,jointly by the Government and Lord Thomson of Fleet, of the shipyard assets of the Fairfields Shipbuilding and EngineeringCompany. Certain details relating to the precise amount of equity capital still remained for discussion. Mr. Stewart had been invited tobe chairman of the company and the managing director would bethe manager of the adjoining shipyard. The Board would include representatives of the Government, the Scottish Trades UnionCongress and neighbouring shipbuilding and shipowning firms. Assoon as the detailed arrangements were completed a paper wouldbe circulated to the Cabinet.Meanwhile Reardon-Smith still maintained their order for two ships but could not continue to do so much longer in the absenceof an assurance that the yard would remain in operation until theywere completed. He would therefore make a statement in the Houseof Commons that afternoon on the effective completion of thenegotiations.In discussion it was suggested that the financial basis on whichthe new company was being formed might, having regard to the tax loss on the previous company, be relatively beneficial toLord Thomson. It was however pointed out that this advantage would accrue to any firm acquiring the assets and that the financial arrangements represented a satisfactory balance of financial contribution and interest by both sides.The point was also made that it would be important that theGovernment should have the power not only to appoint but alsoto dismiss the Chairman.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the first secretary of State.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 70thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson)said that the day of the ultimatum for breaking off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom which had been agreed at therecent meeting of Foreign Ministers of African States at theOrganisation for African Unity (OAU) had now expired. In theevent only four States, Guinea, Congo (Brazzaville), Tanzania andGhana had actually carried out the resolution and broken offrelations. A number of other States might, however, only havedeferred their decision to do so in the light of the agreement tohold a further meeting of the OAU on 21st December and muchCC 71 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
would depend on the outcome of the Prime Ministers forthcomingstatement to the General Assembly of the United Nations and ofthe discussion which was likely to be held in the Security Councilon a resolution which would make mandatory the imposition ofeconomic sanctions on Rhodesia.Meanwhile there had been substantial progress in obtaining the voluntary agreement of the countries primarily concerned not to buy Rhodesian goods. Germany as well as the Benelux countries had now banned imports of tobacco; and the ban on tobacco would now affect 90 per cent of the Rhodesian crop.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministers primarily concerned had had further discussion the previous evening on theimposition of an oil embargo jointly with the United States and onthe proposed joint agreement with the United States on an airliftto Zambia. Although there were dangers in embarking on an oil embargo before we had completed arrangements for Zambia, atelegram had been sent to the Prime Minister informing him ofMinisters&apos; agreement that, if he considered it desirable, an Order inCouncil should be made banning oil imports into Rhodesia. Althoughthe scale of the United States offer on the airlift was regarded asinadequate, and it was hoped that the President of the United states would agree to increase it, it could nevertheless be accepted, sinceonce the United States Government were committed on a limited scale, they would increase their support if necessary. It would be forthe Prime Minister to decide in the light of his discussions at theUnited Nations and with the President on the timing of any announcement.It must be recognised that, while this decision was important tothe Governments policy in relation to Rhodesia, it neverthelessincurred serious risks that in the upshot supplies of fuel and power from Rhodesia to Zambia might be cut off v/ith consequent serious damage to our copper supplies.In discussion the following points were made:(a) A ship carrying a cargo of Rhodesian sugar was reported as having left Hamburg for Antwerp in consequence of the refusal ofthe Federal German Government to allow it to be bought inGermany. The precise position was however obscure and all necessary steps should be taken to ensure that a market was not found forthis cargo.(b) The consequences of the severance of diplomatic relationswith certain African countries, both for our general policy and inparticular for the continuation of our aid, should be further considered by Ministers. There was general agreement that in doing so we should avoid any precipitate action which might furtherexacerbate relations.(c) The change of the Cabinets decision to suspend the paymentof United Kingdom pensions to pensioners living in Rhodesia, savewhere payment was desirable on humanitarian grounds, had beentaken at short notice by the Ministers primarily concerned with the rhodesian situation, in the light of developments both in Rhodesia
Space policy review(previous reference:CC (65) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of aviation (C (65) 180) on the Space Policy Review.The Minister of Aviation said that the Ministerial Committeeon Joint Research and Development had concluded that in spite ofthe political difficulties we should seek to terminate our commitment to the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO).Continued expenditure could not be justified on economic ortechnological grounds and there was a risk that, if the Organisationbecame more deeply committed to present programmes, theirsubsequent abandonment would do greater damage to the cause ofEuropean collaboration. It was, however, important that we should seek to terminate our commitment in the manner best calculated to minimise the political damage of withdrawal. We should thereforegive no abrupt notice of withdrawal at the meeting of the ELDOCouncil to be held on 20th December and should not announce thatour contribution would be terminated at the end of March 1966. Weshould support the proposal for a European Space Review whichmight prove the best means of persuading the other members ofELDO that the present programmes should be terminated. this might mean that we should have to be prepared to contribute toELDO until the end of 1966, though we would hope that the outcome of the Space Review would enable us to terminate our commitment earlier.On the assumption that we would extricate ourselves fromELDO, most members of the Committee had been in favour of proceeding with the BLACK ARROW programme, at a cost ofabout  5 million a year over the next five years. To withdraw fromELDO and at the same time to proceed with a national launcherproject would, however, create a bad impression in Europe and cc 71 (65)and in the United Kingdom and because it had proved quite impracticable to make effective arrangements in Rhodesia to distinguish between cases which involved hardship and others.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the First Secretary of Stateand the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Agriculture, to arrange for officials to investigate urgently the measures which might benecessary to prevent the cargo of Rhodesian sugar fromfinding a market.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of overseas Development to circulate to the Defence and oversea Policy Committee a joint memorandum on theconsequences for our policy and for the provision of aid of the severance of diplomatic relations with certainAfrican States.
would not accord with the recommendations of the Report of theCommittee of Enquiry into the Aircraft Industry (plowden committee). The Joint Research and Development Committee had therefore recommended that we should examine the possibility of inviting the participation in the BLACK AJRROW programme ofany of our ELDO partners who might wish to take part in it. Thisproposal had been examined by officials since the meeting of theCommittee, but it appeared that there was no real scope for international participation in the development or production of black ARROW itself. There might, however, be possioilities for international collaboration in relation to the space programme as awhole in which BLACK ARROW could play a part, though thiswould require further examination. No final decision should thereforebe taken on the BLACK ARROW programme at the present stage,but it should be endorsed in principle subject to further study of thepossibility of European collaboration.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he welcomed thedecision to terminate our commitment to ELDO. We were onlycommitted until the end of the present year and in order to avoid further nugatory expenditure it was important that a firm decisionbe taken now that we should not contribute beyond the end ofMarch 1966. If there were to be a European Space Review thisshould be completed by that date. As regards BLACK ARROW itv/as accepted that this could not be justified on economic or military grounds. This was largely a prestige project and expenditure on itwould be disproportionate to any advantage to be derived from continuing work in this field of space research. Moreover, it was admitted that to continue with a national launcher programme when we withdrew from ELDO would be open to political objections. Weshould therefore not continue the BLACK ARROW programme.In discussion it was generally agreed that our continuedparticipation in ELDO could not be justified. It was suggested that inorder to avoid further nugatory expenditure we should announce our decision to withdraw forthwith and that this would do less damage to our position in Europe than to attempt at this stage to concealour ultimate intentions from our ELDO partners. The general view was, however, that time would be required to convince the othermembers of ELDO that the present programmes must be abandoned;we should also need to take into account the effect of such action onthe Australian Government in connection with the use of Woomera.The proposed European Space Review might be a means of achievingour objective, but this would require further consideration. the review might take too long and might also result in proposals forfurther expensive projects. The review might also result inembarrassment to the European Space Research Organisation whichmight be unwilling to join in such a review with ELDO, partly becausethe membership of the two organisations was different.As regards the BLACK ARROW programme it was suggestedthat this would involve heavy expenditure which could more usefully be devoted to projects of social value in the United Kingdom. On theother hand it was argued that it would be damaging to our wider
commercial policy(previous reference:CC (65) 69thConclusions,Minute 7)Imports ofBroilerChickensfromDenmark5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food (C (65) 179) on imports of broiler chickens from denmark.The Minister of Agriculture said that in 1964 and the first partof 1965 imports of broiler chickens from Denmark had increased substantially and the National Farmers&apos; Union, together with theNational Association of Poultry Keepers, had made an applicationfor the imposition of an anti-dumping duty. It had been agreed by ministers that this was a clear case of dumping and that theimports constituted a threat of material injury to the UnitedKingdom industry but that we should try to persuade the Danes to limit their exports to us to 6,500 tons a year, as compared with separately of 13,000 tons during the first half of 1965 and 7,500 tons in1964 and with an average of only 1,000 tons over the previousfour years. In that event we were prepared not to impose an anti-dumping duty. The Danes so far had refused to agree to anyCC 71 (65)technological interests if the United Kingdom were to withdraw fromthe field of space research even although the money spent might wellnot always bring an economic return. It would, however, be necessaryto examine the proposed expenditure on BLACK ARROW inrelation to other claims on the Governmenfs resources.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that we should work towardsterminating our commitment to ELDO at the earliest practicabledate, taking account of the need to minimise the political damageof withdrawal. Officials should give further consideration to theline to be taken by the United Kingdom representatives at themeeting of the ELDO Council on 20th December, including thearguments for and against the proposal for a European SpaceReview. It was also agreed that no immediate decision should betaken on the BLAXK ARROW programme though the cabinet were favourably disposed towards it in principle; this should befurther considered both as regards the merits of the programmeitself and in relation to the possibility of international co-operation.Expenditure on the programme would need to be considered bythe Committee on Public Expenditure.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that we should work towards terminating our commitment to ELDO as soon as was practicable,taking into account the need to minimise the politicaldamage of withdrawal.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to arrange for furtherconsideration of the BLACK ARROW programme in the context of the possibilities of European co-operation inspace activities.
limit lower than 8,000 tons. Any figure higher than 6,500 tons was however unacceptable. Our poultry industry was not subsidised andhad suffered serious economic difficulties at certain times whichhad been accentuated by the Danish dumping. The national economic Plan had provided for a substantial expansion of poultry meat production to meet increasing consumption; and it would bedifficult to persuade the industry that it was reasonable to embark on such an expansion unless the Government showed that theywere determined to protect it against unfair competition. Importsfrom Denmark were by no means negligible, being worth some 2 million a year. We had made many agricultural concessions toDenmark, including the recent revision of the Bacon MarketSharing Agreement. It would be quite wrong for us to make anyfurther concessions to them on this issue.The President of the Board of Trade said that the only question now remaining for decision was whether we should accept a limit of 8,000 tons as against our own suggestion of6,500 tons. There was serious difficulty in refusing to accept the danish figure. The Board of Trade had to be satisfied that the continuation of the Danish imports would materially injure theUnited Kingdom industry. It was difficult to contend that importsof 8,000 tons, or less than 3 per cent of domestic production,definitely restricted to this level, could cause material injury(especially while admitting that a level of 6,500 tons would not).There was, therefore, no legal basis for imposing an anti-dumpingduty. Moreover, if the Danish Government took the matter to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) it was quite possible that other countries would take the view that there wasno case for imposing an anti-dumping duty.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was undesirable to create difficulties in our general political relations with Denmark by making an issue of thisrelatively small point. As against this, the Danish Government had recognised that they were on very weak ground in this matter andwere expecting us to drive a hard bargain.(b) Although the imports from Denmark were a small proportion of our total supplies, they could have significant effect upon the state of the United Kingdom market, particularly atperiods of over supply.(c) It would be difficult to explain to our own farmers theacceptance of a continued high level of imports from Denmarkwhen the trade had only been built up to a significant level bydumping. The concessions which had been made to the irish republic in connection with the Irish Free Trade Agreement would cause some difficulty with the United Kingdom agricultural industryand we should avoid a further source of friction immediately beforethe annual Farm Price Review.(d) The present balance of trade between us was in favour of denmark and they had cut down their purchases of United Kingdomcoal in order to import coal at subsidised prices from eastern europe.
The ScottishEconomy1965-70:Draft WhitePaper6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (C (65) 181) to which was attached a draft White Paper on the Scottish Economy 1965-70.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the draft white paper had been approved by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development. The size of the forestry planting programme, which was the only remaining point of substance thenoutstanding, had now been settled. Parliament had originally beeninformed that it was hoped to publish the White Paper inDecember. It should however include a statement of the extensionof the present development regions to cover almost the whole ofScotland together with some broad indication of the inducementsfor the location of industry but the final text could not be settleduntil Ministers had reached a decision on the scheme for investment grants. Publication before January was therefore impracticable.The First Secretary of State said that unexpected difficulties had emerged in the consideration of the new scheme of investment incentives but it was hoped that a decision could be taken on it byearly in January. It would therefore be preferable to delay thepublication of the White Paper and amend it in accordance withthe decision, since there were objections to making any incompleteannouncement about regional incentives.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultationwith the First Secretary of State and the President ofthe Board of Trade, to give further consideration to the drafting of the sections on regional incentives for industry in Scotland in the light of the government&apos;s decision on the new scheme of investment incentives.CC 71 (65)The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat there was no major issue of principle involved in a choice between the two figures. The Cabinet on balance agreed that weshould tell the Danish Government that we were not prepared toaccept an undertaking to limit exports to a figure higher than6,500 tons and that, if they were not prepared to agree, an anti-dumping duty would be imposed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Danish Government should be informedthat, unless they agreed to restrict exports of broilerchickens to 6,500 tons a year evenly phased over theyear, an anti-dumping duty would be imposed.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe Danish Government to be so informed and in theabsence of their agreement to proceed with theimposition of a duty.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, to give furtherconsideration to the date of publication of the white paper in the light of Conclusion (1).(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2), approved the draft white Paper on the Scottish Economy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th December, 1965.
