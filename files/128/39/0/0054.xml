Oversea affairs vietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 35thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister said that the Joint parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, Mr. HaroldDavies, m p, had now returned from his visit to Hanoi, in the courseof which he had established contact with the authorities in north vietnam. There was no indication that, as a result of these discussions,the Government of North Vietnam would necessarily be more willingthan hitherto to receive the Commonwealth Mission on Vietnam.But Mr. Davies had succeeded in enlightening them about thepurposes of the Mission and the Western attitude towards the conflictin Vietnam; and from this point of view his visit to Hanoi had been well worth while.Disarmament The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, (Mr. Thomson) said thatthe Soviet Government, after maintaining an attitude of disinteresttowards the discussions on disarmament in Geneva, had suddenlyindicated that they would be prepared to resume negotiations in this context.In discussion there was general agreement that this was an encouraging development in itself and might also foreshadow a moreaccommodating attitude on the part of the Soviet Government inrelation to other issues, including the problem of Vietnam. But the motives which might have prompted this sudden change in the Sovietattitude would need to be examined; and further consideration shouldbe given to its possible implications in relation to the various proposalswhich had been put forward to restrict the dissemination of nuclear weapons, including the Multilateral Nuclear Force and our ownproject for an Atlantic Nuclear Force.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Thomson) to arrange for further consideration to begiven, on the lines indicated in their discussion, to thepossible implications of the recent offer by the SovietGovernment to renew their participation in the negotiations on disarmament in Geneva.public expenditure(previous reference:CC(65) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (65) 101) submitting the Report of a group ofMinisters who had examined public expenditure programmes up to1969-70. The Cabinet also had before them two Notes by theSecretary of the Cabinet (C (65) 97 and 98) to which were appendedcopies of the departmental memoranda which had been consideredby the Ministerial Group and a report by the Public expenditure survey Committee on public expenditure to 1969-70.6572-3CC 38 (65)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the task of the ministerial group had been to recommend how best to implement the decision by the Cabinet on 28th January, 1965 (CC (65) 5thConclusions, Minute 3) that the planning of public expenditure shouldbe based on an average annual rate of increase of 4  per cent a year at constant prices from 1964-65 to 1969-70. They had assumed thatthe provision for defence would not exceed  2,000 million at 1964prices and that the basic civil programmes, representing the orderlydevelopment of existing policies, would be as already approved bythe Cabinet. The question for decision, therefore, was the amount ofadditional expenditure over and above the basic programmes, whichcould be contemplated within the limit of 4  per cent per annum and the manner in which it should be allocated between Departments.After making an allowance of only  100 to  150 million for contingencies, the group had concluded that additional expenditureof  240 million in 1969-70 represented the maximum sum which couldbe contemplated in respect of the seven main programmes of civil expenditure. On this basis there would be a 33 per cent increase in expenditure on these programmes in the five year period in question,compared with a 21 per cent increase in gross domestic product anda 17 per cent increase in personal consumption. It was reasonable to permit a higher proportionate increase in public sector expenditure,which had been excessively restricted under the conservative administration. But this greater outlay would have to be met by anincrease in revenue; and public opinion could be expected to besensitive to this point. Within the margin of  240 million for additionalprogrammes in 1969-70 the group had recommended that housingshould receive the largest allocation ( 110 million), followed bybenefits and assistance ( 60 million) and smaller sums for education,health and police. No additional provision was proposed in the caseof roads, where the basic programme already envisaged a very rapid increase, or in overseas aid, where balance of payments considerationsimposed a particularly cautious policy.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Decisions on the level of public expenditure were neededboth in order to supplement other elements in the National EconomicPlan and in order to reinforce confidence, at home and abroad, inthe Governments economic policies. The latter consideration was particularly important in the short term.(b) The five year programme for public expenditure would be reviewed each year and would be carried forward by a further twelvemonths at each review. There would therefore be regular opportunities to revise the scale of provision now under consideration. Moreover,expenditure did not always exhaust the whole of approved allocations;and revenue also might prove to be more buoyant than could atpresent be expected. There might therefore be some margin for afurther increase in expenditure in later years; and the programmesnow before the Cabinet should not be regarded, or publiclypresented, as restricting public expenditure within a rigid frameworkwhich would not be susceptible to subsequent modification. On theother hand the assumptions about the growth of the economy which
6572-3were being considered for adoption in the National Plan were themselves optimistic; and there could be no certainty that the 25per cent growth assumed by the Plan for the period 1964-65 to1969-70 could be reached. Moreover in the next two years the claims on resources would probably rise more rapidly than productivity,although thereafter the position might be reversed. It was for thisreason that the Ministerial group had rightly proposed not only a limitation on additional programmes in 1969-70 but also aproportionately more severe limitation on those programmes in1966-67.(c) The additional programmes included certain types ofexpenditure, particularly in relation to benefits and assistance, whichwere of the nature of transfer payments. It.was arguable that such payments should not be treated as falling in the same economiccategory as direct Government expenditure on goods and services.On the other hand they were properly brought within the scope ofthe present survey since they involved, no less than direct government expenditure, claims on resources which would have to be met byone means or another. Even so, it would be important that a concept of Government expenditure which included transfer payments shouldnot be regarded as inhibiting the Government from any subsequentdecision which they might see fit to take to promote the redistribution of income by fiscal means.(d) In certain cases the arbitrary distinction between thepublic sector and the private sector, whereby expenditurein relation to the former formed part of the total estimateof expenditure before the Cabinet while expenditure inrelation to the latter was excluded, was misleading and dangerous. In the case of housing, for example, it appeared to beassumed that private sector housing could not be controlled and thatthere would therefore be no means of ensuring that it would notexceed the 250,000 houses which the Ministerial group had envisagedas the target for 1970. If so, however, public sector housing, for whicha target of the same size was suggested, would have to be reducedto the extent to which private sector housing exceeded its allocation.This would be uneconomic, in so far as private sector housing wasmarginally more expensive in terms of unit subsidy than public sector housing. Moreover, it was wrong in principle that the public sectorshould become little more than the residuary legatee of unregulatedvariations in the private sector. But if, for these reasons, it became necessary to establish some degree of physical control over private sector housebuilding, this would not be easily be reconciled with theGovernments policy of encouraging house ownership by theprovision of tax reliefs and mortgage finance on favourable terms;and, since legislation would be required in order to establish thecontrol, there would also be some risk of forestalling in the interval before its enactment.(e) The same principle could be argued to be at stake in thesocial services. Here, too, much of the provision made in the private sector by way of insurance against the various types of personal
accident or misfortune involved a potential charge on resources; and here too, therefore, there was some risk that the corresponding provision made by the Exchequer would take second place to thedemands of the private sector and that an effective control of public expenditure would limit national schemes of social security whileprivate schemes developed without restraint.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the A\ per cent limitation on public expenditure must clearly be maintained, even though the precise scope of the field might bearguable. It was essential, however, that the public expenditure programme should not be treated as a residual and the establishmentof control over private sector expenditure, where necessary, must be a corollary of the control of public expenditure. This was particularlytrue of building, where it would be desirable to re-examine the means by which a physical control of housebuilding and all forms of less essential building in the private sector, apart from industrial premises,could be introduced.The Cabinet next considered the allocation of individual programmes proposed in C (65) 101.education the Secretary of State for Education said that, if his additional programme were restricted to the proposed figure of  35 million in1969-70, the consequences would be severe. Even his original programme had been unable to provide for any substantial progress towards the introduction of new comprehensive schools or additionalnursery schools or an increase in student grants. The reductions now envisaged would imply that new school building would be restricted to the mere provision of places for the 200,000 additionalschoolchildren each year; and the programme of replacement of sub-standard school buildings, on which the previous administration had been spending  30 million a year, would come to a virtualstandstill. In addition the universities would be denied the means ofof financing the expansion which was required in order to accommodate the increase in student numbers; and promisingdevelopments, such as the North-East Technological University,would be unable to proceed. The University of the Air, together withthe reform of the Public Schools, might have to be deferredindefinitely.In discussion the following points were made:(/) It might still be possible to establish the University of theAir if it were financed from advertisment revenue from a fourthtelevision channel.(g) Even on the basis of a reduced additional programme,expenditure on school building would be  84 million in each of thenext two years and  98 million thereafter, compared with only 45-50 million a year under the previous Administration.(h) The reduced programme proposed by the Ministerial group should be adequate in Scotland.
health the Minister of Health said that he was reluctantly prepared toaccept that no provision should be made for removing charges fordental treatment, dentures and spectacles. Even so, however, theadditional programme proposed for health and welfare ( 8 million in 1966-67,  25 million in 1969-70) was wholly inadequate to meetthe needs of the Health Service. Nevertheless, in view of the restriction on all forms of public expenditure, he would not seek to argue fora higher allocation, provided that the distribution of the total sumbetween England and Wales and Scotland was reserved for furtherconsideration.Benefits and assistance the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that the ministerial group had recommended that wage-related short term benefits should be introduced in October, 1966, and that flat-ratebenefits should be increased at the same time. But this would be impracticable; and it would be wiser, in any event, to postpone any increase in flat-rate benefit until April, 1967, at the earliest. Moreover,it would be desirable to couple with the scheme for wage-related benefits an improvement in benefits under the Industrial Injuriesscheme. The expenditure involved under these heads could probablybe met from within the basic programme. More important, however,was the recommendation by the Ministerial group that the income guarantee scheme should not be introduced in 1966, even in the more modest form now envisaged, costing some  100 million. It had beenmade clear in the Labour Party&apos;s Election Manifesto that this scheme would be introduced at an early date; and no qualification had beenattached to this undertaking. But, if the recommendation of the groupwere accepted, it was unlikely to be introduced at any time in thenext five years if, indeed, at all.In discussion the following main points were made:(/&apos;) The whole of the cost of the wage-related short term benefits would be met by additional contributions, which should suffice to finance, in addition, a considerable part of the other increases in benefits.(/&apos;) There were limits, however, to the extent to which it wouldbe practicable to increase contributions. Employees tended to regard them as merely taxation in another form; and increases in theemployers&apos; contribution resulted in increases in industrial costs.(k) It was doubtful whether it would be possible to postpone anincrease in flat-rate benefits until 1967. There might, indeed, be advantage in making smaller and more frequent adjustments, perhapsrelated to the cost of living, rather than continuing to resist the pressure of public opinion until it became necessary to concede a major improvement in a single operation.(/) The Income Guarantee scheme had originally been intendedto replace flat-rate benefits and to concentrate benefits on those who
were genuinely in need. It had been assumed, therefore, that it would show a substantial saving as compared with increases in fiat-ratebenefits. It now seemed uncertain, however, whether this saving couldbe achieved unless widows and the chronic sick were penalised interms of normal benefits. If so, it might be desirable to re-examinethe financing of the Income Guarantee scheme.(m) In any event the Income Guarantee scheme, in the form inwhich it was now emerging, seemed likely to prove less attractivethan had originally been hoped, inasmuch as it would appear to belittle more than an improved form of National Assistance.(/?) The Labour Party&apos;s Election Manifesto had undertaken toincrease benefits in line with increases in the money earnings of thecommunity. On the other hand it would be possible to increasebenefits only in line with increases in real earnings or in private consumption. This should yield substantial savings in the basic programme for benefits, which was based on the assumption thatrates of benefit would rise in line with total national income.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet would need to be further informed before theycould take a decision on the complex and important issues involved.It would be desirable for these issues to be examined by a small group of Ministers, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, who should submit a report as rapidly as possible. Theyshould consider alternative means of using the financial provisionfor benefits envisaged in the basic and additional programmesproposed in C (65) 101; they should indicate what combinations ofthe Income Guarantee scheme and increases in flat-rate benefits mightbe possible within the limits of this provision, both in 1966-67 andin later years; and they should examine how far increases in contributions might reasonably be invoked to meet the increased cost of benefits and assistance.Police and PrisonsThe Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that he wouldreluctantly accept the proposed additional programme of only  10million in 1969-70, although this would imply that it would be possibleto make only a very limited start on schemes for paying prisonersindustrial rates of wages.RoadsThe Minister of Transport said that he, too, would reluctantlyaccept the recommendation that no additional programme shouldbe provided for roads, although the work which he had envisagedunder this programme was so important that it might be necessaryto make adjustments in the basic programme in order to accommodateit to some extent.In the discussion the following main points were made:(o) Expenditure on roads had been rising very rapidly in recentyears; and the basic programme provided for a further large increase.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th July, 1965.It could be argued that it was desirable to reduce this programme,which had been largely inherited from the previous Administration,in order to provide an increased allocation for other services.(p) On the other hand we were still spending proportionatelyless on roads than nearly all other highly developed countries.Improved roads were fundamental to regional development; and theeconomic return on the investment would be substantial.(q) The construction costs of new major roads appeared to berising rapidly; and there might be a case for an inquiry into the causes,which could not be wholly explained by the fact that land prices were also rising sharply and new roads were being built to higher standards.(r) Expenditure on roads in Wales was now falling; and it mightbe desirable to reconsider the allocation for Wales in view of theimportance of adequate roads to the economic development of the principality.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider the means by which the desirability of establishing control overhouse-building and less essential building in the private sector might be further examined.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, theSecretary of State for Wales, the Secretary of State for education and Science, the Minister of Housing, theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance and theChief Secretary, Treasury, to consider, in the light ofthe discussion, alternative policies in relation to benefits and assistance within the financial limits of the basic and additional programmes proposed in C (65) 101; and toreport their findings as rapidly as possible.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to consider, in the light ofthe discussion, the desirability of promoting an inquiry into the rising costs of road construction.(4) Agreed to resume their examination of public expenditure at a subsequent meeting.
