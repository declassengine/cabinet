SubjectRhodesia
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 58thConclusions)The Prime Minister said that he had now had further discussions with the Chief Justice of Rhodesia, Sir Hugh Beadle,about the critical developments in the Rhodesian situation. Itappeared that the Rhodesian Cabinet were still divided on the issueof making an immediate unilateral declaration of independence(u.d.i.). But the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, seemedto remain of the private opinion that the proposed RoyalCommission should be appointed, although his public statements were necessarily couched in different terms.Sir Hugh Beadle had stated that, as far as he was concerned as Chairman designate of the Royal Commission, it would not be acceptable that the Commission should be asked to carry out itstask unless the current state of emergency in Rhodesia were at leastsufficiently mitigated in its operation to enable political opinion tobe freely expressed, since otherwise the Commission would be unable adequately to ascertain the views of the people of rhodesia  a whole. Moreover, his present view was that the commission would be unlikely to reach the conclusion that independence on thebasis of the 1961 Constitution was acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole, having regard to the present extent of opposition to this proposal among the African population of rhodesia.In these circumstances, the Cabinet would wish to consider howfar it might be possible to accept the suggestion of the rhodesian government that, if the Royal Commission were to reportunanimously that independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitutionwas in fact shown to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as awhole, the United Kingdom Government should undertake to commend this report to Parliament. There were some grounds for believing that the Opposition would be prepared to endorse such anundertaking; and, while this would reinforce the Government if theywere to decide in favour of this course, it also suggested that, ifthe Government refused to give such an undertaking and a u.d.i.followed as a result, the Government would be open to criticismfor having failed to take the one step which might have averted it.In those circumstances there might be a sharp division of political opinion in this country, which would gravely embarrass theGovernment in their subsequent measures to deal with a u.d.i.It had been suggested in the Cabinefs previous discussion thatwe might ascertain from Mr. Smith whether, if the United KingdomGovernment gave an undertaking to commend to Parliament a unanimous report by the Royal Commission to the effect that the1961 Constitution was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as awhole as a basis for independence, the Rhodesian Governmentwould give a comparable undertaking that they would accept acontrary finding by the Royal Commission. It was for considerationhow far such an undertaking on our part might be regarded asprejudicing the sovereign right of Parliament. Moreover, in theadmittedly unlikely&apos; event of a unanimous report in favour of the
contention of the Rhodesian Government, it would be very embarrassing for the United Kingdom Government to have to commend the report to Parliament if in the meantime the rhodesian Government had adopted repressive policies repugnantto public opinion in this country. On the other hand, itmight be worth accepting these risks if the Rhodesian Governmentwere prepared to accept the greater risk that the Commission would find against them. At least the possibility might be further explored on a hypothetical basis and on the strength of a clear understanding that, if we reached agreement with the rhodesian government in this sense, they would raise no further objections tothe Commission beginning its task forthwith.As regards the question whether the two Governments should require the Commission to submit an interim report on the procedures which they intended to adopt in order to ascertain theviews of the people of Rhodesia as a whole, the discussions with sir Hugh Beadle suggested that this question could probably beleft to the discretion of the majority of the Commission.In discussion it was suggested that in view of the strength ofthe argument in favour of our agreeing to commend to Parliament a unanimous report by the Royal Commission and in view of the apparent imminence of a u.d.i., the wiser course might be to avoid the delay that would ensue from any attempt to ascertain whetherthe Rhodesian Government would give a corresponding undertaking.It was the general view, however, that we should not offerunilaterally to accept a unanimous report by the Royal Commission.Moreover, even if we were prepared to take this course, it mightmerely result in the strengthening of extremist opinion in rhodesia and encourage the Rhodesian Government to demand an even higher price for their agreement that the Royal Commission shouldbe allowed to start its work.In further discussion it was argued that a conditionalundertaking by the United Kingdom Government to accept a unanimous report in favour of independence on the basis of the1961 Constitution, even if it incorporated, as was essential, a reservation of the sovereign rights of Parliament, would be liable tobe interpreted as implying that we had abandoned the first four ofthe five principles on which we had hitherto insisted as a conditionof granting independent to Rhodesia. This would be regarded as a breach of faith and would be strongly opposed both by a considerablesection of public opinion in the United Kingdom and by a large majority at the United Nations. Moreover, the mere avoidance ofa u.d.i. was not in itself a sufficient aim of policy; and, if we werecontent to do no more than maintain the constitutional status quo,we might so seriously alienate African opinion as to give rise to serious problems of public security in various parts of Africa. At thevery least, therefore, the Rhodesian Government should be askedto give a commitment that, if the Royal Commission submitted an unfavourable report from the Rhodesian point of view, they would agree that a Royal Commission should then be asked to devise an acceptable constitution which would be based on the five principles
enunciated in our statement of 9th October, 1965. Moreover, theRoyal Commission should be required to make an interim reporton the method they proposed for ascertaining public opinion in rhodesia; and this should be submitted to Parliament before it was accepted by the Government.On the other hand, there was much support for the view thatan undertaking on our part in the terms proposed was virtuallyinherent in the decision already taken by the Government to agree toappoint a Royal Commission as a method of ascertaining the acceptability of the 1961 Constitution as a basis for independence.Moreover, there was considerable political force in the argument that, if the Government failed to give the assurance that they wouldcommend to Parliament a unanimous report by the Commissionwhen there were grounds for believing that such an undertakingmight prevent a u.d.i., both Parliamentary and public opinion inthe United Kingdom would be strongly critical of the government if a u.d.i. thereafter took place. It must be accepted that, if suchan assurance were given and the Royal Commission subsequentlyreported in favour of independence on the basis of the 1961Constitution, the Government would be committed to taking thenecessary legislative action, save in the event of such a break-downin public order in Rhodesia as to present a totally new situation;but there were such clear indications of substantial opposition in rhodesia to independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitutionthat it seemed inconceivable that the Royal Commission couldreport that this was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as awhole. We might therefore reasonably expect that, by giving anundertaking to accept the report, we should not only secure afurther delay of some months, which would make it extremely unlikely that the Rhodesian Government would then be in a positionto declare a u.d.i., but also fundamentally modify the politicalclimate in Rhodesia by demonstrating the falsity of the argument in favour of independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitution. Itwould then be possible to pursue the question of constitutional advance in more advantageous circumstances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the Rhodesian Government should now be asked whether, if the United Kingdom government undertook to commend to Parliament whose sovereign rights mustbe preserved a unanimous report by the Royal Commission to theeffect that the 1961 Constitution was acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole as a basis for independence, the rhodesian government would give a corresponding undertaking that, if theRoyal Commission submitted a unanimous report to the effect thatthe 1961 Constitution was not so acceptable, they would abandon their claim in this respect and would agree that a Royal commission should then proceed to devise a new Constitution for Rhodesia whichwould be based on the five principles enunciated in the UnitedKingdom Governments statement of the 9th October and wouldbe acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole as a basis for
independence. A question of this nature should serve to test thebona fides of the Rhodesian Government, without finally committing the United Kingdom Cabinet, who would have a further opportunityto consider their attitude in the light of the Rhodesian reply. the rhodesian Government should also be asked to assure us that, ifwe gave such an undertaking, they for their part would not seek to attach any further conditions to the establishment of the RoyalCommission but would agree that it should embark on its taskforthwith. As regards an interim report by the Commission, itwould be undesirable, on balance, to press our view beyond thesuggestion made by Sir Hugh Beadle, namely that the matter shouldbe left to the majority discretion of the Commission.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would send a further message to the Prime Minister of Rhodesia in the senseindicated in his summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th November, 1965.
