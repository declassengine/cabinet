1 2X K)Sir winston churchill(previous reference:CC (65) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter fromLady Churchill, expressing, on behalf of herself and her family, herdeep appreciation of the message of sympathy which the cabinet had sent to her on the death of Sir Winston Churchill.SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, who had visited London for the funeral ofSir Winston Churchill, had called on him in the afternoon of Saturday,30th January. Mr. Smith had clearly indicated that he regarded therespective views of the Governments of the United Kingdom and southern Rhodesia as now virtually irreconcilable and that his mainconcern henceforward would be to seek some occasion on which hecould plausibly maintain that provocative action by a third partyjustified Southern Rhodesia in making a unilateral declaration of independence. In the meantime he would endeavour, by implementing the existing procedure for amendment of the Constitution by meansof a two-thirds majority in the Legislature, to alter the existing constitution in an increasingly illiberal direction and so enable hisGovernment to consolidate their position while ostensibly observingthe letter of the Constitution. Mr. Smith had seen no merit in makinga further attempt to ascertain whether the African population ofSouthern Rhodesia were genuinely anxious to embrace independence on the basis of the existing Constitution, on the ground that the african peoples were so unsophisticated and inarticulate that it wouldbe unrealistic to seek to establish their views by any of the normalmeans of testing popular opinion. He had also shown that he resentedour public statement of the constitutional and economic consequences which would be liable to follow any unilateral declaration of independence by Southern Rhodesia and that he was activelyconsidering what counter-measures he could adopt in that eventuality.In particular, he appeared to have in mind the action which theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia might take to disrupt the copperindustry in Zambia. It was therefore incumbent upon us to examine,as a matter of urgency, possible means of maintaining supplies ofcoal and power to the copper mines if these were denied by SouthernRhodesia and to consider by what methods we might most effectivelyexert economic pressure on Southern Rhodesia if it became necessary, in response to the pressure of international public opinion,to institute a virtual economic blockade of the Colony. At the sametime we should make one further attempt to re-establish contact withthe Government of Southern Rhodesia; and, since Mr. Smith had now rejected our proposal that a Parliamentary mission should visit the Colony and had indicated that discussions should preferably beCC 6 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
conducted at Governmental level, it would be appropriate that asmall mission, consisting of senior members of the Government,should now be despatched to Southern Rhodesia, on the understandingthat they would be allowed right of access not only to the european community but to any representative spokesman of African opinionwho was not in prison on a criminal charge. The Lord chancellor and the Commonwealth Secretary might appropriately constitute a mission of this kind; and they might be accompanied by arepresentative of the Ministry of Overseas Development on theunderstanding that negotiations between the United Kingdom and southern Rhodesia about financial and technical assistance might now be resumed, although their progress would inevitably, in thecircumstances, be slow.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, as a matterof urgency, for an examination of possible means wherebywe might ensure the continued supply of coal and powerto the copper mines of Zambia, if these were denied bySouthern Rhodesia and of the various ways in which we might, if necessary, exert economic pressure against theColony.(2) Agreed in principle that a Ministerial mission, consisting ofthe Lord Chancellor and the Commonwealth Secretary,should visit Southern Rhodesia in the near future.Cigarette 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of advertising     Health (C (65) 9) on cigarette advertising.The Minister of Health said that the current publicity about thedanger of smoking cigarettes would be reinforced by an early announcement of a decision, foreshadowed by Labour Partyspokesmen before the election, to prohibit the advertising of cigaretteson television. The prohibition would be imposed by the Postmaster-General in the exercise of his powers to issue directions to theIndependent Television Authority. Measures in relation to othertobacco goods and to other advertising media were underconsideration; but the Home Affairs Committee had agreed that itwould be desirable to take this particular step without delay. It was proposed that an announcement should be made in reply to a parliamentary Question on 1st February; and the independent television Authority and the Tobacco Advisory Board would beinformed in confidence beforehand.In discussion it was suggested that public concern about lungcancer had subsided to some extent and that it might be desirable to stimulate further public discussion of the problem before taking the relatively drastic step of prohibiting cigarette advertising on television.On the other hand both the public and the industry appeared to beexpecting some action by the Government in the near future; and interest in the subject would be revived by current Governmentadvertising on public transport and on television on the danger of
commonwealth immigration(previous reference:CC (64) 6thConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (65) 12) about Commonwealth immigration.; The Home Secretary said that, despite the control overCommonwealth immigration which had been established in 1962,coloured Commonwealth citizens were now entering the country more rapidly than was consistent with their absorption into the community.The net intake during 1964 was 62,000, nearly 9 per cent higher thanin 1960 when there had been no control. The demand for vouchersfor employment, as an entitlement to admission, greatly exceeded the supply; and there was now substantial evasion of the control. Thepossibility of reducing the number of vouchers was being consideredsmoking cigarettes. Moreover the prohibition would not take effect for about three months after the announcement, because it was thought reasonable to allow time for existing contracts and stocks of advertising films to run out; and it would be unfortunate if the cessation of advertising were postponed still further. It would be important to lay emphasis on the need to restrain young people fromacquiring the habit of smoking rather than to persuade older people to abandon it; and it would be necessary to stress the powerfulinfluence which television advertising could exert on young people byassociating cigarette smoking with attributes which they tended toadmire. The impact of the proposed statement should be increased byquoting the rising number of deaths from lung cancer rather thanthe number of deaths which it was possible to attribute to cigarettesmoking.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasagreed that, despite the possible effect on the yield of the tobaccoduties, cigarette advertising on television should be prohibited andthat an announcement to that effect should be made in reply to a parliamentary Question in the following week. In order to reinforce the impact on young people it would be useful to take some furtherinitiative in the campaign in schools against smoking; and it wouldbe desirable to stimulate discussion in the Press in advance of theannouncement.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (65) 9, subject to furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, of the statistics to be quoted in the statement in order to illustrate the danger of cigarette smoking.(2) Invited the Lord President to consider how the interest of thePress in the problem of lung cancer might most effectivelybe stimulated in advance of the proposed announcement.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science toconsider whether any further steps could be taken in schools to reinforce the campaign against cigarettesmoking.
by the Commonwealth Immigration Committee; but in the meantimesteps should be taken to reduce the scale of evasion. This might notbe achieved without further legislation which would requireCommonwealth citizens to deposit identifying particulars with the immigration authorities and to register with the police and wouldempower the Home Secretary to repatriate without criminal proceedings a Commonwealth citizen who had outstayed the period for which he had been admitted. The Committee had been of theopinion, however, that in the first instance an attempt should bemade to reduce evasion by making fuller use of the existing legal powers; and it was proposed that a Parliamentary statement to this effect should be made in the terms of the draft annexed to C (65) 12.The Lord President said that, in addition, the Committee would shortly consider complementary proposals about the means by which commonwealth immigrants could more effectively be integrated inthe community as a whole.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the consultations withother Commonwealth Governments on the subject of immigration,which had been initiated by the Government on assuming office, hadnot proved fruitful. Those Governments should, however, be informedbeforehand of the terms of the statement to be made by the HomeSecretary.Discussion showed general agreement that a statement should bemade on the lines proposed. The following main points were made:(a) Housing was the most serious aspect of the problem created by uncontrolled immigration. From this point of view no measures topromote the integration of immigrants in the community could be effective until the level of immigration had been substantially reduced.(b) The possibility of enabling our High Commissioners in other commonwealth countries to check the credentials of emigrants more effectively was already being examined.(c) Members of the immigrant communities themselves mightbe enlisted in the police forces in order to strengthen the control ofevasion.id) The statement should emphasise the considerable scale onwhich evasion was currently taking place.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Home Secretary should make a parliamentary statement about Commonwealth immigration on the lines indicated in the draft annexed to C (65) 12.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to give further consideration tothe wording of the draft statement, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned and in the light of the points madein discussion.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, to arrange for commonwealth and Colonial Governments respectively to be informed of the statement shortly before it was madein Parliament.
i7 UDefenceEconomies:Aircraft6. The Prime Minister said that the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee had now concluded their examination of the defenceaircraft programme. He proposed, subject to the Cabinefs approval,to announce the resultant decisions in the course of the parliamentary debate on the following day on a Motion of Censure by theOpposition.The Committee had had to consider, first, the heavy cost of the commitments which the Government had inherited from the previous administration; second, the most realistic means of meeting our defence requirements in the years ahead; and, third, the impact of changes in policy on the aircraft industry, particularly in relation tothe degree of dependence on other countries which we could contemplate.The Committee had concluded that the P-1154 should be cancelled. Even on present estimates of cost, which all experiencesuggested would rise still further, this aircraft would be more expensive than the United States Phantom. Moreover, it was not likely to be available by the date when it would be required; and,even if the project were maintained, it would be necessary to buyforeign aircraft for an interim period at heavy cost. In place of theP-1154 it was proposed to buy a limited number of United StatesPhantom aircraft and, at the same time, to develop the P-l 127. It waspossible that orders for the P-l 127 would be placed by other countriesin Europe.It was proposed to adopt the Comet as a replacement for theShackleton II. It was also proposed that the HS-681 should be cancelled. This project was still in an early stage of development; but even on initial estimates of cost the United States C-130, which wouldadequately meet the operational requirements involved, would onlycost one-third as much per aircraft. Moreover, the C-130 was fully developed and available immediately. Here again, therefore, an interim purchase would be avoided. The impact of this decision onMessrs. Short and Harlands, who were sub-contractors for theHS-681, could not be mitigated by further uneconomic orders, e.g.,for additional Belfast aircraft; but the possibility of providingalternative employment at Messrs. Short and Harlands&apos; works,e.g., on Phantom assembly, would be urgently examined.The TSR-2 presented the most difficult problem. This aircraft had originally been estimated to cost a total of  325 million (including 90 million in respect of research and development), i.e., an average cost for 158 aircraft of  2-1 million. This estimate had now risen toa total of  750 million or approximately  5 million per aircraft, anincrease which illustrated the uneconomic character of themanufacture of military aircraft in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless,cancellation of the TSR-2 would clearly create both political andindustrial problems, particularly as regards the resultant redundancyamong the design teams. The Committee had therefore considered a compromise solution, whereby only 50 TSR.-2s wouid be orderedtogether with an equivalent number of the United States TFX aircraft.
But this had been shown to be both uneconomic and impracticablefrom the operational point of view. It would be less unrealistic to substitute the TFX completely for the TSR-2, particularly since,although substantial dollar expenditure would be involved, theUnited States Government had offered us generous financial terms which would substantially alleviate the burden on our balance ofpayments. Both aircraft, however, were still subject to considerableuncertainties. The TSR-2 was facing a number of production problems which were not yet solved; and it was not certain whether the TFXMark I would be superseded by the TFX Mark II, the cost and capabilities of which were not known. In these circumstances theCommittee had been forced to the conclusion that research anddevelopment in relation to the TSR-2 should be allowed to continue for a further few months at a cost of  4 million a month, and that thefinal decision should then be taken in the light of the additionaltechnical information about both aircraft which would become available during the interval, the more detailed assessment of theeconomic implications of cancelling the TSR-2 which would now beput in hand and the results of the comprehensive review of our defence requirements which was already in train. In any event, however, itwould be essential that the future of the aircraft industry should be reviewed in order that it need no longer be dependent on a small number of very expensive military aircraft but might be redeployedon a more economic basis. From this point of view the possibility ofinitiating research and development projects in co-operation withother countries, particularly the United States, France and perhapsGermany, should be investigated.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he recognised the force of the arguments which had led the Committee torecommend that the decision on the TSR-2 should be postponed fora short period, the delay should not be allowed to involve us in a virtual commitment to complete this aircraft since it would then become impossible to achieve our objective of reducing the defence budget to  2,000 million at 1964 prices in 1969-70. In that event thebasis on which the Cabinet had recently decided to deal with public sector expenditure over the next few years would be undermined.Moreover, it was clearly necessary, on broader economic grounds, toreduce substantially the size of the United Kingdom aircraft industry.In discussion it was suggested that the cancellation of all three aircraft might impose an unacceptable burden on the balance ofpayments and inflict irreparable damage on the valuable exportcapability of the United Kingdom aircraft industry. Moreover, anumber of advanced technologists, who were at present employedin the design teams, might be compelled to seek alternative work inother countries. On the other hand the substitution of the TFX forthe TSR-2 would not only provide a very substantial relief to theExchequer but would also save resources to the value of some 1,300 million, which, if efficiently redeployed, should enable us to offset the dollar expenditure involved. On balance, however, it wasagreed that it would be desirable to defer a final decision in respectof the TSR-2 for a limited period in order to provide time in which
CC 6 (65)HigherEducationit would be possible to assess more accurately the relative merits ofthe TSR-2 and the TFX and to consider in more detail the alternativeresearch and development projects by means of which an economicaircraft industry could be maintained in the United Kingdom in the longer term.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Comet should be adopted as a replacementfor the Shackleton II.(2) Agreed that the P-1154 and the HS-681 should be cancelled.(3) Agreed that a decision on the TSR-2 should be deferred fora limited period.(4) Took note that in this interval the comparative costs and capabilities of the TSR-2 and the TFX would be examined in relation to our defence requirements and to theeconomic implications of cancelling the TSR-2.(5) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Defence, to inform the United States Government oftheir conclusions.(6) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce these decisions in the course of a Parliamentary debate on thefollowing day.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C (65) 11) about the developmentof higher education.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that his predecessor had proposed to the Ministerial Committee on social services that an early announcement should be made that theGovernment had decided not to create additional universities in thenext 10 years or to promote further institutions to university status,with the possible exception of an institution in the north-east ofEngland; that the expansion of higher technical education shouldbe promoted by encouraging the development of technologicaldepartments of existing universities and of the three specialisedinstitutions, Imperial College, the Manchester College of Science and technology and Strathclyde University, rather than by the creationof a special category of Special Institutions for Scientific and technological Education and Research (SISTERs); that the objective of providing 390,000 places in higher education by 1973-74 was accepted; and that, as recommended by the Committee on higher education (the Robbins Committee), 122,000 of these places wouldbe provided in colleges of education (111,000 in England and Wales)and 50,000 in technical colleges.  A decision to allocate the secret
non-university places in this proportion would involve comparatively little fresh investment before 1970. Some members of the Committeeon Social Services had thought that it was unwise to commit theGovernment to more than the general objective of providing 390,000places in higher education until the study of public expenditure overthe next five years had been completed. But it was important to announce the decisions about universities and SISTERs withoutdelay in order to put an end to uncertainty about the governments intentions; and it would be desirable to announce the proposal toprovide 122,000 places in colleges of education at the same time partly in order to offset the negative impact of the first two decisions andpartly in order to anticipate a recommendation which was expectedto be made shortly by the National Advisory Council for the training and Supply of Teachers that the objective of 111,000 places in training colleges in England and Wales should be replaced by one of 120,000.Moreover, the acceptance of the objective of 122,000 places was theleast the Government could undertake in view of the promise inThe Queen&apos;s Speech to give &quot; particular priority to increasing thesupply of teachers&quot; and of the fact that even that figure would not enable classes to be reduced to a reasonable size by 1970.In discussion attention was drawn to the difficulty of consideringindividual proposals for additional expenditure in isolation and inadvance of the review of public expenditure as a whole in the period1964-65 to 1969-70. The resources available to meet the demands ofcivil departments in this period would depend on the extent to whichit proved possible to contain defence expenditure within the figure of 2,000 million proposed in the Annex to C (65) 10; and it would thenbe for the Government to consider the priorities to be establishedwithin the amounts available. It should not be assumed that theymust accept the priorities and objectives adopted by the previous administration, particularly where that Administration had not made provision for attaining the objectives in question. In view of these considerations, of possible demands for a further expansion of the universities and for the replacement of obsolete school buildings andof the risk of pressure to increase the number of places in technical colleges as well as in colleges of education, it might be wiser to confine the announcement to the decision on new universities and SISTERsand to indicate that the expansion of colleges of education would haveto be further considered when the Governments review of theircommitments was complete and it was possible to judge the share ofthe national resources which should be allocated to education.On the other hand, while pressure was to be expected for theexpansion of higher education of all kinds, there was a good case for giving priority to colleges of education, since ultimately botheducation and economic expansion depended on an increase in thenumber of teachers in the schools. Moreover, there was reason tothink that the cost of expanding the colleges of education could be accomodated within the 30 per cent increase in educationalexpenditure which the Cabinet had accepted as an appropriateassumption on which to prepare the basic Departmental programme(CC (65) 5th Conclusions, Minute 3).
In discussion of the draft statement appended to C (65) 11 thefollowing points were made:(a) As a matter of presentation emphasis should be laid not onthe Governments acceptance of the objectives adopted by the previous administration but on the fact that, whereas that Administration hadnot allocated resources to the achievement of the objectives, thepresent Government intended to do so.(b) In the paragraph referring to colleges of advanced technologya reference to the Heriot-Watt College should be substituted for the reference to Central Institutions in Scotland.(c) At the end of the last paragraph the words &quot; with particular reference to the need to increase the supply of scientists andtechnologists &quot; should be added.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, since it would be inconvenient to defer an announcement of theGovernments intentions until the completion of the review of public expenditure in the period 1964-65 to 1969-70, the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science should consider, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, how the proposed expenditure on the expansion of colleges of education could be accommodated, together with his other commitments, within his Departments basic programme, on theassumption that the increase in expenditure on education would beno more than 30 per cent during the five years in question. If this couldbe achieved, the Cabinet were prepared to authorise the Secretaryof State for Education and Science to make a statement on the lines proposed in the Annex to C (65) 11, subject to further considerationof the drafting in the light of their discussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science toconsider, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,how the proposed expenditure on the expansion of colleges of education could be accommodated, together with other commitments in the field of education, within a 30 percent increase in educational expenditure in the period1964-65 to 1969-70.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above and to consideration of thepoints made in their discussion, approved the proposed statement on higher education annexed to C (65) 11.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st February, 1965.
