Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 59thConclusions)GeneralEnablingBill1. The Prime Minister said that a message had been sent toMr. Smith, the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, on the lines agreed bythe Cabinet on the previous day. He had also spoken to Mr. Smithon the telephone earlier that morning and had suggested that the outstanding points could now be resolved and that a senior minister might go at once to Salisbury to sign an agreement setting up theRoyal Commission. Mr. Smith had raised no new points but hadnevertheless maintained that the positions of the two governments were irreconcilable. He had admitted, however, that the PrimeMinister had done everything possible to promote agreement andthat, if Rhodesia now declared her independence, no responsibility would rest on the United Kingdom Government. It had been announced that Mr. Smith would broadcast at 11.15 a.m.; and it seemed almost certain that he would then make an illegaldeclaration of independence (i.d.i.) a term which was preferable toa unilateral declaration of independence and should henceforward beadopted to describe an act of this kind.He proposed to make a statement in the House of commons that afternoon and, in the event of an i.d.i., would broadcast to thecountry in the evening. It would also be necessary to publish as soonas possible after an i.d.i. a White Paper containing the correspondence and records relating to the discussions with the rhodesian Government since September 1964.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the attorney general (C (65) 149) on the question whether Orders in council under the Enabling Bill should be subject to the Negative or to the affirmative Resolution procedure.The Prime Minister said that the Government should be seen to be taking the necessary measures to deal with an i.d.i., includingthe enactment of the Enabling Bill, as quickly as possible. There didnot appear, however, to be any measures which would have to betaken under the Bill before the beginning of the following week.In particular, the dismissal of the Rhodesian Ministers and thefinancial and economic measures which were contemplated, with the relatively minor exception of the exclusion of Rhodesia from theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement, could all be effected under existing powers. It might therefore be preferable, while giving notice of introduction of the Enabling Bill forthwith, to defer its SecondReading until Monday, 15th November, if this would improve itschances of passing through all stages in both Houses on that day. Itwas important that the Rhodesian question should not, if possible,become a party political issue.As regards the form of the Bill the Opposition Leaders had pressed strongly for the Affirmative Resolution procedure. this could not be accepted, since it was essential that the Orders to bemade under the Bill should take effect immediately. It might be
RhodesianSterlingBalancespossible, however, to adopt a modified Affirmative resolution procedure, by which the Orders would come into effect immediatelybut would lapse at the end of a specified period, say, 28 days, unless they had by then received Parliamentary approval. If this procedurewere to be adopted, it would be essential that the Opposition Leadersshould give an undertaking not to misuse it by insisting on a debate on each Order issued under the Bill.In discussion it was agreed that- the only urgent measure whichwould need to be taken under the Enabling Bill was the suspension of the Rhodesian Legislature; but no serious risk would be involvedif this were deferred until the beginning of the following week. It wassuggested that, if the passage of the Bill were delayed until15th November, this might give time for opposition to the government&apos;s policy to begin to find a focus of expression,particularly in the House of Lords. On the other hand there wouldbe great advantage in securing, so far as possible, the support of theOpposition for the Bill; and a delay until 15th November might be important in this respect. The modified Affirmative resolution procedure might be tolerable, provided that satisfactory assuranceswere received from the Opposition to the effect that, e.g., Ordersissued under the Bill would be debated together and not separately.Even under the Negative Resolution procedure it would be possiblefor the Opposition to challenge each Order if they wished to do so.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thedecision on the date on which the Enabling Bill should be introduced in Parliament and on the form it should take would depend largely on the willingness of the Opposition to ensure its passage unopposed.He therefore suggested that, together with the Lord President andthe Chief Whip, he should discuss the matter with the opposition leaders later in the day.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister, together with the lord president of the Council and the Chief Whip, would arrange to discuss the Enabling Bill with the opposition leaders.(3) Subject to the outcome of the discussions to be arrangedunder Conclusion (2) above, agreed that the EnablingBill should be introduced in Parliament on 15th november and that it should embody the modified affirmative resolution procedure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was concerned about the effect on sterling if the Government blocked the reserve bank of Rhodesia&apos;s sterling balances in London. If the UnitedKingdom appeared to be restricting sterling balances for political reasons, this could affect the attitude of other holders of sterling and could diminish confidence in the pound. This result might beminimised if the action were taken under the Enabling Bill ratherthan under the Exchange Control Act, since it would then be more clearly demonstrated that we were treating Rhodesia as a special case.
The Cabinet-Action inthe united nations(4) Agreed that the blocking of Rhodesia&apos;s sterling balancesshould be dealt with on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister.The Prime Minister said that it was agreed that, in the event ofan i.d.i., we should at once call for a meeting of the Security Council,ft would be appropriate that the Foreign Secretary should himselfgo to New York in order to lead the United Kingdom delegation.There would undoubtedly be pressure in the United Nations formilitary action against Rhodesia. This would be ineffective unless a major Power participated; but there was a risk that the soviet union might offer to do so. We must therefore seek to divert theUnited Nations from military action by emphasising our conviction that economic measures, if firmly applied, could bring the rebellionto an end. It must be accepted that the economic measures whichwe proposed to take might not in themselves be sufficient to achieve this purpose; and we should therefore consider the possibility of an oil embargo, to be implemented on the authority of the united nations. This might well involve restricting oil supplies to countriesadjacent to Rhodesia, such as South Africa and the Portugueseterritories; and measures would also have to be taken to counter theeffects on Zambia. It would be desirable to give further considerationto this question and to the possibility of promoting related actionthrough the trade unions in the United Kingdom and theInternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that, in the event of an i.d.i., we should call for ameeting of the Security Council and invited the foreign secretary to represent the United Kingdom in the debate.(6) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to consider further the possibility ofa United Nations oil embargo against Rhodesia.Illegal The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet at 11.18 a.m. that declaration of  news       just rjeen recejved that the Rhodesian Government had announced an illegal declaration of independence. The Defence and oversea Policy Committee would now review the action to be takenby the Government, reporting to the Cabinet as necessary. AllCC 60 (65)The Prime Minister said that it would be possible to maintainthe counter argument that we should be taking action to prevent ausurping authority from having access to funds which belonged notto them but to Rhodesia; and such action, so far from underminingconfidence in sterling, might reassure other holders of sterling balances who might be threatened by revolt or illegal pressure within their own territories. Nevertheless, it would be advisable that thematter should be further considered and that, pending a decision,the blocking of Rhodesia&apos;s sterling balances should not be amongthe initial measures to be taken in the event of an i.d.i.
members of the Government should acknowledge, in any public speeches which they might make about Rhodesia, the seriousness ofthe position which was now developing; but Governmental commentshould be restrained and responsible and it would be important toavoid any statement which might impart party political bias or anysuspicion of racial prejudice into the situation. All members of theCabinet should advise their junior Ministers accordingly.The Cabinet (7) Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Parliamentary 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business me fjQUSe 0f Commons in the following week. It was recognised thatthese arrangements must be provisional and subject to amendment in the light of the Parliamentary action which might be required bythe illegal declaration of independence by the former Government of rhodesia.Earnings-related short-term benefits(previous reference:CC(65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C (65) 145) recording the outcome of her consultations on earnings-related short-term benefits with theTrades Union Congress (TUC) and other bodies.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance recalled that,following the Cabinets previous discussion of the scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits proposed in C(65) 112, she hadbeen invited to open consultations on her proposals, including thoserelated to injury benefit, with the TUC, the Confederation of BritishIndustries (CBI) and other interested bodies.In addition to the TUC and CBI, she had consulted representa-tives of the actuarial profession, insurance interests and PensionFunds. In addition, local authority and other public sector interestshad been consulted through the Official Committee on occupational pensions. While some features of her proposals had been criticised,her consultations had confirmed her in the view that the scheme proposed was the best that could be achieved as an interim measure in advance of the general review of social security benefits and havingregard to the limitations imposed by finance and considerations of practical administration.Those &quot; contracted out&quot; of the present graduated pension scheme would pay graduated contributions and qualify for graduated pensions like anyone else; but their flat rate contribution and their pension on account of their occupational pension rights would beabated by a fixed amount. Her consultations had shown a generalrecognition that a change in the present arrangements for contracting out was inevitable and that her proposals offered a sensible wayof overcoming not only the immediate problem of introducingearnings-related short-term benefits but also the obstacles offered bythe present arrangements to future developments in the pension field.
There were overriding objections to charging the contracted out a small graduated contribution for earnings-related short-term benefits only, without making the other changes which she proposed.Besides eliminating the inequities in the present arrangements and enabling widows of those &quot; contracted out &quot; to qualify for a graduated widow&apos;s pension, the changes could be presented as anessential step towards a dynamic earnings-related pension scheme.Some concern had been expressed, particularly in the public sector,about the consequential changes that would need to be made in occupational pension schemes and their related terms of service. Butthis was essentially a matter for employer-employee negotiation andsuch considerations should not dictate the form of the national scheme.The Cabinet had already approved the inclusion of an earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance in the scheme; she now sought approval for the other proposals outlined in C (65) 112. Very early decisions were needed if the necessary legislative and administrativepreparations were to be completed in time to enable the new schemeto be in operation from October 1966.In discussion it was pointed out that the change proposed inthe arrangements for contracting out would make it possiblesubsequently to increase the rate of the graduated pension and tointroduce an element of dynamism and thus to improve the returnoffered by the graduated scheme, the inadequacy of which was its most criticised defect. The low wage earner who was contracted out would pay less and at the same time be given cover for earnings-related short-term benefits and widow&apos;s pension. On the other hand the change would not increase Exchequer support of the scheme. nor would it of itself make contracting out less attractive; butoccupational pension schemes were valued by those who werecovered by them.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The changes proposed would lead to extra costs in the public sector, which would in some cases fall on the Exchequer.(b) The existence of arrangements for sick pay in this sector,together with the low incidence of unemployment and the provisions for adjusting occupational pension against national insurance pension would also imply that employees in the public services and nationalised industries would be adversely affected and would inmany cases be paying more without receiving additional benefit.Amendment of occupational schemes and their related terms ofemployment would involve long and difficult negotiations whichmight not be completed before the Bill took effect.(c) The provisions of the National Insurance scheme, whichwere of general application, could not be tailored to fit particularoccupational schemes; nor could employees in the public sector beexcepted from the new provisions for earnings-related short-term benefits because of their low risk of unemployment and provision
for sick pay. The question of adapting occupational schemes to ensurethat the new National Insurance provisions did not adversely affectemployees in the public sector was essentially a matter for employer/employee negotiation; and some delay in completion of these negotiations would not seriously affect pension entitlement.(d) Because of the very large numbers in the public sector whowould be affected it was difficult to reach conclusions on the national insurance proposals without knowledge of the extent to which theirdisadvantageous effects in that sector could be offset bycomplementary changes in the occupational pension arrangements.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion said that,while it was important not to delay the drafting of the legislation, theCabinet would need to consider more fully, before reaching a finaldecision, the implications of the proposals in C (65) 145 for individualsemployed in the public sector and the extent to which changes inpension provision in that sector might be negotiated to ensure thatemployees were not adversely affected.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to give further consideration tothe implications for individuals employed in the public sector of the arrangements for contracting out of theNational Insurance scheme proposed in C (65) 145 andthe extent to which those arrangements might need tobe modified in this regard.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C (65) 145 in the lightof the result of the further inquiries to be undertaken inaccordance with Conclusion (1) above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th November, 1965.
