2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it was proposed that Bank Rate should be reduced that day from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. This reduction appeared desirable on several grounds.It would lighten the very heavy burden which current interest ratesimposed upon the Exchequer in relation to the service of the public debt; it would contribute, for the same reason although to a lesser extent, to an easing of the current strain on the balance of payments;and, by arresting the rising tendency of interest rates, it should help to increase the supply of finance for house building, both by localauthorities and by private enterprise. Above all, however, a reductionin Bank Rate from a level which was normally associated with acritical monetary situation would provide the Government with greater room for manoeuvre in dealing with possible future developments as regards the balance of payments; and, by indicatingtheir confidence in their economic policies, it would demonstrate thatthey retained, not only economically but politically, the power ofinitiative.On the other hand a reduction would entail a considerabledegree of risk; and, if it were interpreted as an indication ofrecklessness rather than confidence, the consequences for sterlingcould be very grave. In these circumstances it was essential thatthe change should be accompanied by some parallel measure whichwould indicate that the Government did not contemplate any significant relaxation of credit control. A large part of the field inquestion had already been covered by the recent request to certainfinancial institutions to restrict to 5 per cent the increase in creditduring the year ending March 1966. Other institutions, however,particularly those concerned with the financing of hire purchasetransactions, were not subject to this discipline; and it would bedesirable to ensure that they, too, should be brought within the scopeof credit control. The simplest method of achieving this purpose would be to tighten somewhat further the existing controls on hire purchase. It was, therefore, proposed that, simultaneously with thereduction in Bank Rate, the existing provisions of these controlsshould be amended to increase from 20 per cent to 25 per cent the initial deposit: required in the case of hire purchase agreements inrelation to cars and motor-cycles and from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Whitsun Recess.Mrs. Renee Short, M.P., had tabled a 10-Minute-Rule motion on 15th June for leave to introduce a Bill to amend the lawon abortion. In discussion it was agreed that, if this Motion were opposed and there were a division in the House of Commons, theGovernment^ supporters should be free to vote according to their personal convictions.
the deposit required in the case of agreements in relation to otherconsumer durable goods. In the interests of those setting up house for the first time, however, the existing rates of deposit in relationto cookers, water-heaters, furniture and bedding would remain unchanged.In discussion some doubts were expressed about both the timing and the substance of the changes proposed. There had recently beena renewal of pressure on sterling in the exchange markets; and this did not appear to provide a secure psychological foundation for areduction in Bank Rate. Moreover, the intensification of hire purchase control would be liable to aggravate the tendency, whichwas already apparent, for industrial production to hesitate; and tothat extent industry would be even less well adapted to withstand the impact of a subsequent increase in Bank Rate, if this should againbecome necessary on other grounds. For these reasons it might be preferable to confine the change to the reduction in Bank Rate alone and to dispense with the proposed adjustment of hire purchasecontrol the more so since public opinion would find it difficult tocomprehend these diverse measures as inter-related elements in asingle operation.On the other hand it could be argued that, although it had been impossible to contemplate a reduction in Bank Rate until our reserves of foreign exchange had been fortified by the recent additionaldrawing from the International Monetary Fund, its perpetuation ata level of 7 per cent was indefensible as soon as the reserves hadbeen reinforced in this manner; and any apparent indicationthereafter of the Governments lack of confidence in the economy would serve to reduce, rather than to increase, international confidence in sterling. It was now desirable, therefore, to reduce theRate as rapidly as possible; and the fact that, even after the proposed reduction, it would still be at a high level should enable us to rebutany suggestion by other Governments that we were now able toliberalise our policies in other respects, e.g., by removing the balanceof the surcharge on imports. The justification of the accompanyingmeasures in relation to hire purchase control was, admittedly,presentational to some extent, at least in so far as their effect wouldbe liable to be offset by the easing of interest rates which should follow the reduction in Bank Rate. But, if international confidence in sterling was to be preserved, it was essential to demonstrate that wehad established effective control over the supply of credit; and themeasures proposed, by supplementing the earlier request to financial institutions to limit the expansion of credit, should make clear our purpose in this respect. Moreover, it would be consistent with theGovernments political convictions to seek to control credit bydiscriminatory quantitative methods rather than by the indiscriminateuse of the purely monetary mechanism; and, if it subsequentlyappeared that the intensification of hire purchase control wasexerting an unduly depressive effect on industrial production, thereshould be no difficulty in employing appropriate fiscal methods torectify this situation.
&amp; U UOversea Affairs 3. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in theDominican Dominican Republic had been partly stabilised; but the basicRepublic problem which had led to the conflict had not yet been resolved. the reference- United States troops were being gradually withdrawn as forcesCC(65) 3ist became available from member countries of the Organisation of conclusions, American States; and the cease-fire arrangements had been prolongedMinute 2) indefinitely. But it would take time to bring to fruition the efforts which were now being made to form a Government which would be broadly acceptable to the parties to the dispute.Cambodia The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he proposed(Previous        to publish that afternoon a White Paper substantiating our attempts^f^c?c^, to promote an international conference on the future of Cambodia.CC(65) 26thConclusions This would make it clear, among other things, that, while we were minute 2) ready to join with the Soviet Government in convening a conference for this purpose, the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of Chinamight refuse to be represented and that there would also be difficultyin reaching agreement on the manner in which the regimes in Northand South Vietnam should be represented.CC 32 (65)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,despite the doubts expressed by some Ministers, the Cabinet were on balance in favour of the proposed changes in Bank Rate and hire purchase control. These would therefore be effected by the Bank ofEngland and the Board of Trade during the morning; and it wouldbe desirable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make an appropriate announcement in the House of Commons in the afternoon, explaining the reasons for which this combination of measures had been approved.The Cabinet (1) Took note that Bank Rate would be reduced from 7 per cent to 6 per cent.(2) Approved the proposal that the control over hire purchasetransactions should be amended to increase from 20 percent to 25 per cent the initial deposit required in the caseof hire purchase agreements in relation to cars and motor-cycles and from 10 per cent to 15 per cent the initial deposit required in the case of agreements inrelation to other consumer durable goods, with theexception of cookers, water heaters, furniture andbedding.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would makea statement in the House of Commons that afternoon,explaining the reasons for which these changes werebeing made concurrently as inter-related elements in asingle operation.
Vietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to make astatement on Vietnam that afternoon in the House of Commons.This would indicate that it remained our purpose to seek to reach agreement on arrangements for a conference to bring the presentconflict to an end. This could most appropriately be achieved byreconvening the Geneva Conference, of which he and the soviet foreign Minister were co-chairmen; but the Soviet Government had so far declined to join with us in taking action to this end. We were therefore examining alternative means of achieving this objective,including the possibility of making appropriate use of the recentdeclaration on the situation by 17 non-aligned countries includingcertain members of the Commonwealth. It would be our hope thatsuch a conference might be either preceded or accompanied by acease-fire arrangement, that it would lead to agreement on the neutrality of Vietnam, that foreign troops would be withdrawn andthat the peoples of North and South Vietnam would then be leftto work out together their future relationship, in the context of a systematic plan of regional development.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of these statements by theForeign Secretary.ComputerIndustryComputers forGovernmentDepartments(previous reference:CC(65) 28thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (65) 78) about the choice of a computer for theScottish Departments, together with memoranda by the Minister of technology (C (65) 79) and the President of the Board of Trade(C (65) 80) about general policy in relation to the purchase of computers by the Government.Computer for the Scottish departments the Prime Minister said that the choice of a computer for theScottish Departments presented a special problem, if only becauseof the urgency, and might have to be settled by reference to rather different criteria from those which should determine theGovernments general policy on the procurement of computers.The First Secretary of State said that, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, he had given further consideration to thesuggestion that the United Kingdom companies interested in this contract should be given a second opportunity to tender. The revisedoffers had been carefully evaluated; but even the most favourabletender, which had been submitted by English Electric LEO (EEL),was not competitive with the tender submitted by InternationalBusiness Machines Limited (IBM) as regards either price (where the margin of difference was some 10 per cent) or date of operationaleffectiveness. In these circumstances the contract should be placed with IBM.The Minister of Technology said that the decision as regardsthe computer for the Scottish Departments should not be taken
without regard to our general policy for creating a thriving and competitive United Kingdom computer industry. Some measure ofpreference for the United Kingdom industry was essential if the forward policies of his Department were to bear fruit in the longer term; but the choice of an IBM machine for what would become, ineffect, the Scottish computer centre would inevitably prejudge the issues involved.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It had been ascertained that it should be possible, by special measures, to ensure that the EEL computer would be in operation by the middle of May, rather than the beginning of September 1966.Although this date allowed no margin for unforeseen difficulties, it made the EEL machine more nearly competitive with its IBMcounterpart.(b) On the other hand the EEL computer had been rejected atthe outset as inadequate in every respect; and the only subsequentchange in the situation was a small reduction in its price. It would still be more expensive and less effective than the IBM machine.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat it appeared to be too late in this particular case to prefer anytender to that submitted by IBM, having regard to the specialcircumstances of a project which had been started as long ago as1962. This decision, however, should be without prejudice to future policy in general.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 78.Government procurement policy for computersThe Minister of Technology said that the Governments policiesas regards the procurement of computers must be consistent withtheir declared intention to create a thriving computer industry. Itwas clear that United Kingdom manufacturers of computers werenot yet able to compete with the United States subsidiary companiesestablished in this country, such as IBM, at least as regards thelarger and more complex types of machine. If the Governmentadopted a policy of invariably accepting the lowest tender, UnitedStates interests would gradually establish a monopoly of UnitedKingdom orders and there would be no prospect of creating aneconomic United Kingdom industry. It was, therefore, essential thatthe Government should announce that they intended to give a preference to United Kingdom firms in placing contracts, unless:(i) No United Kingdom machine could satisfy the requirement.(ii) The project for which the computer was required wouldbe delayed by 12 months or more.(iii) There was a disparity of 25 per cent or more in price.
The President of the Board of Trade said that he agreed that assistance should be given to the United Kingdom computer industry. But the industry should not be defined for this purpose by reference to the nationality of the shareholders of the firms concerned, especially since this would be contrary to the interestsof the development areas, in which the United States subsidiary companies had been established. Moreover, although a degree ofpreference in favour of United Kingdom firms might be conceded, itwould be an error to announce publicly a policy of discriminationwhich might constitute a breach of our international obligations andprovoke reactions by other countries which would be damaging toour balance of payments.In discussion the following main points were made:(c) A substantial preference for United Kingdom firms in theallocation of Government contracts for computers would workagainst our long-term aim of making the industry fully competitive.This would be better achieved by promoting mergers of the mainfirms concerned in order to secure the economies of large-scale production.(d) It might be desirable to discuss with other commonwealth countries the scope for meeting their needs for computers from theUnited Kingdom; and it would be preferable, therefore, to refrain from any public announcement of policy until after the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.(e) The United States computer industry was supported by thepolicy of the United States Government in giving a substantialpreference to domestic producers; and this enabled their firms concerned to quote lower prices elsewhere. It would be desirable toascertain whether the prices charged by such firms were the samein the United States and in the United Kingdom.(/) The United States subsidiary firms established in the UnitedKingdom exported a substantial number of computers; and information should be obtained on the extent to which this offsettheir imports of components.(g) The nationalised industries might be persuaded to combinetheir requirements with those of Government Departments; but theycould not be directed to do so.(h) The period of one year which was suggestd in C (65) 79 asbeing the measure of acceptable delay in deciding whether a tenderby a United Kingdom company should be accepted should be interpreted as applying to the period at the end of which the computer would be not merely installed but also in effectiveoperation.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was agreed in principle that special measures should betaken to develop a thriving computer industry and that these should include a measure of preference for the United Kingdom industryin the procurement of computers by the Government, although theprice margin should perhaps be rather less than the 25 per centproposed in C (65) 79. The Minister of Technology should thereforeascertain from all Government Departments details of their future
requirements of computers with a view to arranging centralisedpurchasing of these machines by his Department. If, as a result, theUnited Kingdom industry was offered the prospect of a larger volumeof orders, this might well enable the firms concerned to submit more competitive quotations. But, if necessary, a measure of discrimina-tion should be adopted. It would also be desirable to considerwhether direct assistance to the industry might be a preferablealternative to an arrangement based on a preference. In either event it would be necessary to decide how far discrimination might bebased, e.g., on the extent to which the firms concerned carried out their research in this country or on the extent to which they importedcomponents. Any public statement of the Governments policy should await the Cabinets further consideration of these issues.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Technology to circulate a further memorandum on assistance to the computer industry onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.The procurement of a computer for the Royal Aircraft Establishment(RAE), FarnboroughThe Minister of Aviation said that it was now urgently necessaryto secure a new computer for the RAE. He proposed to invitetenders on a non-discriminatory basis; but this would not necessarilyimply a decision to accept the lowest tender if this were notsubmitted by a United Kingdom firm. That decision would dependon other considerations.In discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable to dispense with tenders from other than United Kingdom firms. Thegeneral view, however, was that it was desirable to invite tendersfrom as wide a field as possible in order to gauge the extent to which united Kingdom firms were not yet competitive.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Aviation to invite tenders for the computer for the Royal Aircraft Establishment,Farnborough, from all firms interested.FutureGovernmentBusiness5. The Prime Minister said that a number of Ministers had it in mind to publish White Papers in the near future. It might bedesirable that these should now be examined in terms of both policyand timing, in order that the publication of successive instalmentsof the Governments policies should be arranged in as orderly and effective manner as possible.The Cabinet Took note that the Lord President would arrange to review,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, the forwardprogramme of publication of Departmental White Papers.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd June, 1965.
