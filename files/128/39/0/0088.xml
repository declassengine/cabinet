OverseaAffairsPrimeMinistersVisit to new York,washington and Ottawa2. The Prime Minister said that, as the Cabinet would be aware,a number of the African delegations had boycotted his address to theUnited Nations. We knew that in so doing some of the delegates hadacted contrary to the views of their Heads of State.In his discussions in Washington he had found that the positionof the United States Government over Rhodesia had changed andthe President had assured him of full United States support. It had therefore been possible to reach agreement quickly on the impositionof the oil embargo against Rhodesia.He had also discussed the question of nuclear sharingby Germany and had expressed the view that the right machinery had now been established in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) and that the first step would be for the Federal GermanGovernment to explain what they wanted. It was clear that the project for a Multilateral Force was now dead and that if any allied nuclear force were required this should be based on our proposal for an atlantic Nuclear Force. It might not now be necessary for any suchforce to be constituted and the Federal German Government mightbe satisfied with the consultative arrangements which were being developed in NATO. The President had made it clear that it would befor the European countries to consider what they required and theUnited States Government would not seek to impose a solution on them.He had given a full account of our thinking on the defence review and had made it clear that we wished to take account ofUnited States views and had reached no decisions in advance of receiving them. The United States reaction had been encouraging andMr. McNamara, the United States Secretary of Defense, had beensympathetic to the idea that the United Kingdom should play a largerrole in relation to Africa, where we had a position and responsibilities which the United States did not possess, than in Asia and the far east. Mr. McNamara had expressed the view that some reduction inUnited Kingdom forces in Germany might be possible and had indicated that he had certain ideas about reducing the foreign exchange burden of the Allied forces stationed in Germany. It would now be for the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee to considerthe next stage in the Defence Review in preparation for the more detailed discussions which the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Defence would have with the United States and other AlliedGovernments towards the end of January. The Cabinet would ofcourse be kept informed.For the United States Government, Vietnam was of overriding importance and the President had made it clear that he was mostconcerned to secure a peaceful settlement. The United StatesGovernment had the full support of their public opinion for aSECRET 3CC 72 (65)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons before the Recess.
vigorous prosecution of the war and they could not themselves takerepeated initiatives to secure negotiations since to do so would weakentheir position. They would, however, welcome any initiative whichthe United Kingdom, as providing the Co-Chairman of the geneva conference, could take to promote negotiations. The President had given him this assurance both in private and at a full meeting withadvisers present.In discussion of the Asian Development Bank he had explainedthat we could not increase our contribution within our total aidceiling unless the United States Government were prepared to help uselsewhere. Mr. George Ball, of the United States State Department,had agreed to consider whether an arrangement on these lines couldbe devised whereby the United States Government might, for instance,take over some of our aid responsibilities in Africa. Mr. McGeorgeBundy had also indicated that the Ford Foundation, of which he wasabout to become President might be able to help. This matter might best be pursued by the Treasury Representative in Washington.After his visit to Washington he had had friendly discussions in ottawa with the Canadian Government. It was most satisfactory thatthe Canadian Government had since offered four C-130 planes for theair lift to Zambia.In discussion reference was made to the peace overture whichSignor La Pira, the former Mayor of Florence, had claimed to havereceived in Hanoi. It was pointed out that this had been made public by the Italian Government and not by the United States Government.Little reliance could be placed on Signor La Pira&apos;s report and his claimhad been repudiated by the North Vietnamese authorities.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Overseas Development, to arrange forfurther discussions with the United States Government on united States help over the aid programme in order toenable the United Kingdom to increase its contribution tothe Asian Development Bank.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 71stConclusions,Minute 3)3. In relation to Rhodesia, the Cabinet first discussed themeasures necessary to further the oil embargo. The following points were made:(a) If a blockade of Beira to enforce the embargo proved necessary, this could not be carried out by United Kingdom naval forces alone. HMS Eagle had in fact been withdrawn, but it wouldnot be advantageous to make this public in the course of theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons. An unqualifiedassurance could not be given that, whatever the circumstances,Parliament would be recalled if it became necessary to institute a blockade during the Recess.
(b) The response of Portuguese Government to the measureswhich had been taken to impose economic sanctions and an oil embargo on Rhodesia had been as forthcoming as could reasonably be expected and this attitude would no doubt be maintained as longas the Portuguese Government recognised that we were determined to bring about the downfall of the illegal regime. It would be necessaryto make use of Beira airport if the airlift to Zambia were to beincreased to the necessary level, owing to the limitations of theDar-es-Salaam airport and of the route via the Congo.(c) The necessary steps should be taken to ensure that suppliesof oil from South Africa did not reach Rhodesia via the Bechuanalandrailway.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the First Secretary of State and theCommonwealth Secretary, to seek the agreement of thePortuguese Government to the use of Beira airport for theairlift to Zambia.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with the first secretary of State and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs, to consider what measures could be taken toprevent supplies of oil from South Africa reachingRhodesia via the Bechuanaland railway.The Cabinet then discussed the terms on which the rebellionmight be brought to an end and the possible stages of constitutional advance thereafter.There was general agreement that the Government could notnegotiate directly with Mr. Smith and the illegal regime, nor couldthey accept the resumption of negotiations at the point which these had reached before the illegal declaration of independence. On theother hand, it would be undesirable to impose terms which could berepresented as the equivalent of unconditional surrender. This would only harden the determination of the European population as a whole to resist to the end, would prolong the conflict and further andgravely exacerbate race relations throughout Africa. It might therefore be acceptable that the Governor of Rhodesia should beprepared to have discussions with any persons in Rhodesia who were concerned to see a restoration of constitutional government. Acondition of agreement would be that control of the armed forces and the police in Rhodesia should be transferred to the Governor andit would probably be necessary to envisage a period of UnitedKingdom constitutional control for a number of years, during which time there might be an initial period of direct rule, and then a gradualtransition to self-government with majority rule, before eventualindependence-. The terms which would be acceptable to theGovernment required further consideration, however, and it wouldbe impolitic to make any detailed statement on this issue at thepresent time.
The Cabinet (3) Took note that the Prime Minister would have regard to thepoints raised in discussion in his statement that afternoon in the House of Commons.FairfieldsShipyard(previous reference:CC (65) 71stConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (65) 183) about developments in the negotiationsfor the purchase of the assets of Fairfields shipyard.The First Secretary of State said that, since the cabinets discussion on 16th December, further difficulties had arisen in thenegotiations with private interests about the formation of a jointcompany for the purchase of the assets of Fairfields shipyard. On16th December, immediately before he was about to make astatement in the House of Commons, he had learned that LordThomson was no longer able to proceed on the financial basis so fardiscussed. It was therefore no longer possible to proceed on the basisof a fifty-fifty partnership between the Government and any singleprivate interest; and the best alternative was to promote a syndicateof private interests, each of which would put up a relatively modeststake. On this basis both Mr. Stewart and Lord Thomson wereprepared to proceed and Sir Isaac Wolfson might also be prepared to subscribe a reasonable share of the equity capital. In addition oneunion had already agreed to subscribe  50,000 and another had agreedto take part, probably for the same amount. Discussions were continuing with other interests and there seemed a reasonable prospect that up to   - million of private equity capital could besecured over the next two or three weeks. Immediately, however, itwas not possible to rely on more than  -  million being available.Expert advice was that Fairfields would make losses in the next two or three years because of the terms of the contracts which hadbeen concluded for the ships to be completed in this period; butthereafter it should make a profit, provided that the shipbuilding industry generally continued to be prosperous. If, in practice, it proved possible altogether to abolish restrictive practices in the yard,a profit might be made at an earlier stage. The fact that the tradeunions mainly concerned were prepared to invest in the new company was a dramatic indication of their readiness to support efforts toincrease the efficiency of operation in the yard.The participation of Lord Thomson and probably of other private interests was dependent on Mr. Stewart becoming Chairmanof the company and a suitable management being installed.Mr. Stewart himself was only prepared to come in on the basis of afifty-fifty partnership between the Government and private capital. Ifsufficient private capital could not be obtained, the Governmentwould be faced with the alternative of complete nationalisation or of allowing the shipyard to close. To nationalise this particular yardwithout getting the new and dynamic management which was required, and in the face of manifest opposition from the shipbuilding industry, would entail unacceptable risks but negotiations with private interests and the Trade Unions should be continued with the aim of
raising    million of equity capital, which would be matched by asimilar sum from the Government together with  4- million of loancapital from the Government. If necessary, however, the Governmentshould be prepared to go ahead on the basis of a  4- million of privateequity capital matched by a similar sum from the Governmenttogether with  1 million of loan capital subscribed by the Government.It would be essential to reach agreement with private interests before christmas, since Reardon Smith were not prepared to continue their contracts with the yard for more than a further week without firmassurances of completion; nor was the Receiver prepared to continue for more than a further week.In view of the prolonged uncertainty there would be advantage inmaking a statement that the Government were assured of sufficient support from private interests and the trade unions to justify taking over the shipyard as soon as assurances had been obtained that 4j million of private capital would be forthcoming.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there would be serious disadvantage in the Government continuing with this venture. It wasimprobable that the new company would make a prolit for aconsiderable time and perhaps it never would. The private interests which subscribed to the new company would at least have theadvantage of a share of the tax losses of Fairfields, totalling nearly 2 million, which they could use to offset tax payable on profits at alater date, but there was no reasonable hope on a realistic assessment of obtaining a proper return on the public money which would be invested. In these circumstances the best course was to allow the yardto close and the labour to be absorbed by other firms in the area.In discussion anxiety was expressed about the probable return on the capital invested by the Government in the yard and the risk that pressure would be brought to place Government contracts withthe yard at prices higher than could be secured elsewhere in order tosupport a company in which the Government had a major financialstake, as had happened in respect of Short Brothers and HarlandLimited. It might well be that the private interests concerned wereprepared to place limited amounts of capital in the enterprise in thehope that the Government would be forced to protect their owninvestment in this way. There could be no certainty that restrictive practices would, in fact, be abolished in the yard at a reasonable costin terms of wage rates; and investment by certain national tradeunions in the enterprise gave no assurance of co-operation at the locallevel. There was, moreover, objection to encouraging trade unions to invest their funds in a project which was, by any judgment, extremelyrisky.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be a mistake toabandon the efforts to form a joint company with private capital atthe present stage. The discussions with the trade unions at both the regional arid national level had shown that they were prepared to envisage the removal in the Fairfields yard of the restrictive practices which had gravely hampered United Kingdom shipbuilding and &quot;it
would be unfortunate to allow the shipyard to close at the verymoment when the trade unions had indicated their own readiness to invest money in the enterprise. It would be a serious blow to the shipbuilding industry if the yard were to close and the Reardon Smithcontracts were to be placed, as seemed likely, with Japaneseshipbuilding yards.It was suggested in consequence that even if  \ million of private capital could not be secured on satisfactory terms it would still bedesirable for the Government to acquire the company, but the general view was that it would be undesirable for ownership of the company to be vested wholly in the Government. If, therefore, sufficient private capital could not be secured before Christmas, the Government should announce that all efforts to secure a joint enterprise with private capital had failed and that there was no alternative but to allow the yard to close.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the general view of the Cabinet was that further efforts shouldbe made to reach an agreement which would keep the yard going through a combination of Government and private capital. Theproposal that  f million of equity capital should be subscribed bythe Government with a similar amount by private interests, includingthe trade unions, was much to be preferred to a scheme involvingonly  \ million each of private and Government equity capital witha corresponding increase in the provision of loan capital by theGovernment. On balance, however, the Cabinet considered that, ifnecessary, the Government should proceed with the acquisition ofthe assets of Fairfields provided they had secured the participation of \ million of private equity capital. If this could not be securedbefore Christmas, the Cabinet were opposed to nationalisation evenif this meant that the yard closed. As soon as assurances had beenreceived about the subscription of  \ million of private equity capital, it would be desirable to remove uncertainty by anannouncement that the Government had received sufficientassurances of support to enable the assets of Fairfields shipyard tobe acquired but negotiations should be continued even after suchan announcement with a view to increasing the participation ofprivate capital in the venture up to    million.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to continue negotiations forthe acquisition of the assets of Fairfields shipyard on thebasis indicated in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to make an announcement about the acquisition of the yard as soon as there wasassurance of the participation of  ^ million of privateequity capital in the new company.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st December, 1965.
