Review ofPublicExpenditure(previous reference:CC(65) 38thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (65) 101), to which was appended the report of a group of Ministers who had examinedpublic expenditure programmes up to 1969-70.Overseas and the  Minister of Overseas Development said that there were considerable objections to the recommendation that overseas aid should be confined to the basic programme of  216 million in1966-67 and  229 million in 1969-70. In the first place the basic programme was an arbitrary figure and bore no relation to the levelof expenditure which would logically follow from the Governmentspresent policies in foreign and Commonwealth affairs or to the moralcommitments which had been accepted both by the previousAdministrations and by the present Government since they took office. Moreover, it was based on the assumption that expenditure in1964-65 had been  181 million, whereas it had, in fact, approached 190 million and, even so, had been restrained only by the reluctance of recipients to draw on loans at a time when the interestrate was high. In 1965-66 actual expenditure seemed likely to be 212 million considerably more than the basic programme for thatyear. Against this background the lowest figure which it seemedpractical to envisage for 1966-67 was  250 million; and to restrictexpenditure in that year to the proposed figure of  216 million would involve major changes in policy.It was true that formal commitments for 1966-67 totalled only 195 million; but this was misleading in that formal commitmentshad been literally defined and therefore took no account of other obligations which were not the subject of contracted engagements,but were none the less morally binding on us. For example, our undertaking to provide budgetary support for Malawi must behonoured, although no precise figure had yet been fixed for 1966-67.The same was true of our non-project aid to India, which wasreviewed annually but could not be discontinued without gravedamage to the Indian economy. Our formal commitments on technical aid for 1966-67 totalled only  22 million; but the present level of assistance was over  32 million a year and this allowednothing for the expanded technical aid policy which had already beenagreed. Similarly, the figure for formal commitments contained no provision for needs which we must clearly continue to meet, e.g., aid to Tanzania and Uganda; assistance for land settlement in Kenya;support for Turkey and Jordan, etc. In addition the Ministry of overseas Development were being pressed to refinance Argentinecommercial debts amounting to  5J,- million a year in order to averta serious deterioration in our trade with that country; and it wouldbe equally important that we should contribute to the refinancing ofthe Indian debt in order to encourage others to make similarcontributions. It was for these reasons that a decision to limitoverseas aid to a maximum of  216 million in 1966-67 would entailmajor changes in c-ur overseas policy generally.6572-4
As regards 1969-70 it was essential that there should be some increase over the level of expenditure of  250 million in 1966-67 inorder to help to finance additional projects such as the compensatoryfinance scheme for developing countries; a further contributionto the International Development Association; and additionalrefinancing of debt.An increase in overseas aid admittedly imposed a further strain on the balance of payments. But there was no agreement on itsextent. Moreover, it could be reduced if the programme were soadministered that a large part of the additional aid was spent directly or indirectly on United Kingdom goods; and in this way it couldcreate a subsequent demand for our products which would help to enlarge our export earnings. Finally, it was essential to maintain our aid to the developing countries in order to reduce the risk of a world-wide economic recession, while continuing to relate the aid programme to the National Economic Plan in order to avoid makingexcessive demands on resources which were particularly scarce interms of our own needs.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The group of Ministers who had examined the programmes of public sector expenditure had recognised the great difficulties involved in confining expenditure on aid in 1966-67 to the basic programme for that year in view of the commitments of policy whichthe Government had incurred in this field, partly by inheritance fromprevious Administrations.(b) Aid to our Colonial territories, totalling  30^ million in1966-67, was provided for under the Overseas Development and services Bill; and any reduction in this allocation would be liable tohave serious political consequences.(c) If aid in 1966-67 was confined to the basic programme, theallocation to foreign countries, as distinct from other members ofthe Commonwealth, would be likely to suffer the severestproportionate reduction; and this would seriously weaken our influence abroad.(d) The basic programme proposed for 1969-70 would representa smaller proportion of the estimated national income in that year than the corresponding ratio in 1965-66.(e) The aid programme comprised a very large number of countries; and it might be preferable to concentrate aid on those where it was most important.(/) On the other hand the programme did not comprise alloverseas aid. In particular, it excluded overseas military aid, whichwas currently costing  31 million. If savings could be made in this context, it might be possible to envisage additional expenditure on other types of aid.(g) The foreign exchange element in the cost of the aid programme might be reduced by increasing the proportion of tiedaid; by encouraging recipient countries to obtain a greater proportionof their ordinary imports from Britain; and by giving more of our
aid in kind rather than in cash. It might be worth examining whether,by these and similar means, a total aid programme of  250 million,rising to  270 million, could be financed on the basis of an increasein the foreign exchange cost which would be limited to  10 million in 1966-67 and  15 million in 1969-70.(h) On the other hand the present position of our balance ofpayments constituted a very strong argument against any increase at all in the foreign exchange content of the aid programme. nor would it be practicable to contemplate any increase in the budgetarycost of the programme without seeking some compensatory economy in other departmental programmes.(/&quot;) The restricted programmes of public expenditure which theCabinet had considered at their previous meeting would inevitablyentail disappointing to some extent the expectations entertained bydomestic public opinion in relation to the development of, e.g.,schools and hospitals. It was difficult to maintain, therefore, thatour moral commitments to countries overseas should have any greaterpriority.(/&apos;) Moreover, international opinion would be liable to reactunfavourably to an increase in the aid programme at a time when we were borrowing heavily abroad in order to finance our balanceof payments deficit.(k) Although it was unnecessary to abandon the intention ofincreasing aid to a level of 1 per cent of the national income, an objective which the Government were committed to achieving indue course, it would be unrealistic to declare at this point that we intended to realise it by 1969-70.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet should defer a final decision on the size of the aid programme until they had completed their review of public sector expenditure as a whole.housing the Minister of Housing said that, in general, the programmesrecommended in C (65) 101 were reasonable and defensible. It wouldbe important to establish the target of 500,000 houses in terms of&quot; work done &quot; in 1970 and to seek to ensure that in the years tothat date the public sector programme would rise to about half thetotal while private sector housebuilding would remain at about itspresent level. It should not be unduly difficult to realise the objective of 500,000 houses, provided that substantially more use was madeof system building. But if, as was possible, there was a substantialfall in private sector building in 1966-67 it would be necessary to reconsider the recommendation that there should be no additional programme for the public sector in that year.As regards subsidies, the proposal that there should be no additional expenditure in 1966-67 was acceptable, provided that thepolicy implications were fully appreciated. This decision would not affect the introduction of cheap housing finance for local authorities,
since, even if the scheme for this purpose were announced in October1965 (as was intended), expenditure would not be incurred in thefollowing year. It would be necessary, however, to postpone theintroduction of the proposed arrangements to provide assistance for private mortgages. On the other hand there would be advantages ina measure of deferment in this connection, since no satisfactory scheme had yet been devised and it was undesirable to stimulatedemand for private houses in a period in which we should be seeking to increase the public sector&apos;s share of the housing programme.Moreover, the introduction of a scheme to subsidise privatemortgages at this juncture might further diminish international confidence in the Governments economic policies.In discussion the following main points were made:(/) The possibility of providing assistance to local authoritiesbut not to private house owners at the same time had not previously been contemplated.(m) If, as was possible, the building societies increased theirlending rate to 7 per cent in the autumn of 1965, it might become more difficult to defend the postponement of the introduction ofcheaper terms for private house owners.(n) Local authorities obtained a proportion of their financefrom the Public Works Loan Board at favourable rates of interest;and they might be taking advantage of this facility to ease the termson which they provided loans for private house purchase. This might provoke criticism from the building societies, if the assistance to private mortgages which they were expecting the Government toprovide were postponed.(o) The establishment of a National Housing Finance Corpora-tion or a National Mortgage Corporation might make it easier to implement the Governments policy of assisting private mortgages.(p) The National Economic Plan was being drawn up on theassumption of a target of 500,000 houses a year by 1970.(q) The resources released by any reduction in privatehousebuilding should not be taken up entirely by public housing but might appropriately be used to expand other public constructionprogrammes.(r) An increase in the housing programme would create ademand for additional school building, for which the education programme discussed by the Cabinet at their previous meeting made no provision.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet could not reach final decisions on the programmes of public sector expenditure until they had considered the alternative proposals in relation to benefits and assistance which they had commissionedat their previous discussion. When these proposals were before themthey would be able to review the field of public sector expenditure as a whole and to decide whether to accept the prioritiesrecommended in C (65) 101 or whether to modify them in any waywithin the limit of the assumed average annual rate of increase of
Aid 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of thei.rof Tf?e&apos;&apos; Cabinet (C (65) 105) to which was attached a draft text of a projectedDraft White      ,,,, .    -Paper White Paper on the Aid Programme.The Minister of Overseas Development said that the white paper was not intended to describe any major changes in policy orto prejudge the future level of aid. It was essentially a record ofstewardship, i.e.. a statement of the work which had been done by her Ministry since its establishment and an indication of theprinciples on which it was reorganising the administration of aid.Those sections of an earlier draft which had referred to the objective of an aid programme which would eventually amount to 1 per cent of the gross national product had been eliminated in order to meetthe apprehensions of the First Secretary of State and the Chancellorof the Exchequer about the possible impact of the White Paper on international confidence in sterling; and the references to the limitations imposed on the programme by the exigencies of our balance of payments had been sufficiently strengthened to dispose of any reasonable doubts about our determination to confine our aid to a realistic level. The Government were firmly committed by successive statements in Parliament to publishing the White paper before the Recess; and postponement would inevitably provokeembarrassing public speculation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the substance of the White Paper might now be acceptable, its publication in thenear future could be damaging in terms of international confidence in sterling. For these reasons he felt strongly, in agreement with theFirst Secretary of State, that it would be preferable that it shouldnot be published until September, when it would coincide broadlywith the National Economic Plan and would therefore be seen inbetter perspective in relation to the many other competing claims on our resources.Discussion showed considerable support for the publication ofthe White Paper before the Recess. Considerable importance was attached in both Commonwealth and foreign countries to themaintenance of our aid programme; and the text, as now redrafted,should no longer give rise to misapprehension about the future levelof oversea expenditure which we could afford. Moreover, there wouldbe advantage in publishing the White Paper at approximately thesame time as the forthcoming White Paper on our immigration policy, in order to correct any misapprehension that the Governmentwere indifferent to their moral obligations to peoples overseas.CC 39 (65)4^ per cent at constant prices over the period 1964-65 to 1969-70,which the Cabinet had endorsed in January.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of public sector expenditure at an early date.
In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The draft should be examined in parallel with the draft ofthe proposed White Paper on Immigration in order to ensure thatthere was no inconsistency between them as regards their respectivetreatment of such questions as oversea students.(b) Section XIII on &quot; The role of private investment&quot; shouldbe reconsidered in order to emphasise the limitations on our ability to support a continuing substantial flow of such investment.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion was in favour of publication of the White paper before the Recess, subject to the further examination of the text inthe light of the points made in discussion. The exact date of publication should be determined in accordance with the timetable for the publication of other White Papers in contemplation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that a White Paper on the aid programme should be published before the summer recess.(2) Invited the Minister of Overseas Development, in consulta-tion with the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Home Secretary, to give furtherconsideration to the draft in the light of the points madein discussion.(3) Took note that the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Minister of Overseas Development,would determine the exact date of publication in the lightof the proposed timetable for the publication offorthcoming White Papers.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th July, 1965.
