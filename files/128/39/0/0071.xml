Oversea affairs rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)*2. The First Secretary of State said that the reports receivedfrom Salisbury showed that the situation was extremely discouraging.Discussions about the proposed treaty between the United Kingdomand Rhodesia suggested that it was most unlikely that it could beaccepted as meeting the requirement for a guarantee againstretrogressive amendment of the Constitution, let alone satisfying theother four of the five principles put forward by the United KingdomGovernment. Certain proposals had been put forward, not by theGovernment of Rhodesia, but by others in whom we could have confidence, about constitutional changes. The purpose of the attorney-General going to Rhodesia had been to advise on these aswell as on the question of a treaty. The Prime Minister of Rhodesiahad described these proposals as offering &quot; a ray of hope &quot; but it seemed doubtful at present whether as they stood they would be acceptable either to the Rhodesian Government or to the Africannationalist leaders or would meet our own requirements.The leaders of the two African nationalist parties, Mr. Nkomoand the Rev. Sithole, had been brought to Salisbury for discussions with the Prime Minister, though they had made complaints aboutthe manner in which they had been treated by the rhodesian government in the course of this visit. The Prime Minister had seenthem on the previous day but the outcome of the meeting was mostdisappointing. Neither showed any disposition to join forces or even to meet jointly with the Prime Minister. Both took the view that theUnited Kingdom should be prepared to use force and suspend theConstitution and were not ready to consider any constitutional changes which would be realistic at this stage. Nor were theyinterested in any programme of administrative training for Africancivil servants. This proposal had also been put to the Prime Ministerof Rhodesia who had claimed that his Government were doing allthat was required in this field. It had however been agreed that theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Overseas Development, should discuss the matter with the appropriate authorities in Rhodesia.Information had also been received about a private discussionof Heads of Delegations at the meeting of the Organisation of AfricanUnity at Accra. This was to the effect that they were suspicious ofthe possibility of an agreement between the United Kingdom andRhodesian Governments, that they unanimously agreed that nothingshort of universal suffrage would be acceptable and that in the eventof negotiated independence falling short of this they would refusePreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET6706-2a ICC 55 (65)Parliament 1.

to recognise the new Government, encourage and assist the formationof a Government in exile, and bring the maximum pressure to bearon the United Kingdom. It was stated that they also believed that ifthe status quo proved to be the outcome of the current talks, the effectiveness of United Nations action would depend on the successof efforts to sponsor a Government in exile and &quot; create a warlikesituation constituting a real threat to peace &quot;.The position was therefore most unpromising but the PrimeMinister would be having further discussions with a wide range ofthose concerned, including possibly a further meeting with the african nationalist leaders, and was considering certain possibilities for further action, so that the picture might change. While we mustprepare for the worst, it was essential that nothing should be done or said at this stage which would prejudice the outcome of the PrimeMinisters efforts and that the utmost secrecy should be preserved onthe course of the discussions.The Cabinet Took note of the First Secretary of State&apos;s statement.Earnings-related short-termBenefitsWidow&apos;allowance(previous reference:CC(65) 54thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 138), to which was appended amemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance on the priority to be accorded to earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that he hadbeen invited by the Cabinet at their previous meeting to arrange forthe Social Services Committee to consider the priority to be givento the proposals by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance for earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance and the implications of adecision to undertake such expenditure at the present time. TheSocial Services Committee had considered the matter in the light offurther information set out in the memorandum by the Ministerappended to his note. The Committee recognised that, within thelimits of total expenditure which had already been agreed for theMinistry, additional expenditure of  7 million a year mustcorrespondingly limit freedom of decision on subsequent proposalscreating extra expenditure in the Ministers field. They had none theless come to the conclusion that there were strong reasons of social policy for taking this opportunity to improve the provision for widows in a manner comparable to that proposed for the unemployed and sick.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Cabinet Approved C (65) 138.
The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:CC(65) 54thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament annexed to a noteby the Lord President of the Council (C (65) 135).The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that the ministerial Committee on the Reorganisation of the Docks had considered paragraph 14 in the draft Speech and had concluded thatit was not possible in the current stage of the development of policy to include a reference to any specific proposals. They had agreedupon a form of words, which, while committing the Government to legislation since this would in any event be required, left open itsextent and nature.The Lord President recalled that he had been invited to consider,in the light of the Cabinets discussion at their previous meeting, thedesirability of including a special reference to Wales. There was,however, no precedent for including a general reference to Wales,on the analogy of the reference to the special needs of Scotland, andthere appeared on this occasion to be no specific topic to which a reference could suitably be made. In the circumstances it appearedbetter not to add a reference to Wales. Certain changes in the reference to leasehold reform had been agreed in the light of the cabinets previous discussion.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In the proposed new paragraph on reorganisation of the docks it might be desirable, subject to consultation with the Ministerof Technology, to substitute for &quot; docks &quot;, where it first occurred,the word &quot; ports &quot;, as having an appropriately wider connotation.(b) The absence of a special reference to Wales would disappointWelsh sentiment in view of the customary reference to Scotland. Thelatter, however, was based on the existence in Scotland of a separatesystem of law, and could hardly be omitted.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet approved the revised form of the paragraph on there organisation of the docks, subject to further consideration, inconsultation with the Minister of Technology, of the substitution of&quot; ports&quot; for &quot; docks&quot; in the opening phrase. The Cabinetsconclusion on the previous item of their agenda would result in theretention of the reference to supplementary national insurance benefits, related to earnings, being extended to widows. On Wales,the balance of opinion was against creating a precedent for theinclusion of a merely conventional reference.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to consult theMinister of Technology on the proposed amendment ofthe new paragraph on the docks.(2) Subject to (1) above, approved the inclusion in the draft speech of a reference to the reorganisation of the docksin the terms proposed by the First Secretary of State.
(3) Agreed to the inclusion of a reference to widows inparagraph 25.(4) Agreed not to add to the draft Speech a special reference to wales.(5) Subject to (1) above, to the amendments agreed in discussion and to those agreed at their previous meeting, approved the draft text of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament annexed to C (65) 135.(6) Took note that the First Secretary of State would submit the text, as amended, to The Queen for Her approval.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th October, 1965
