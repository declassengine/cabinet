Oversea Affairs l. The Foreign Secretary said that he had visited the UnitedThe Foreign Nations Organisation in New York, and subsequently Washington,Secretary&apos;s Visit jn an(j Korea. Japan and Korea had recently signed a treaty^)vcrsc iswhich should improve the previously strained relations between themand should therefore act as a stabilising factor in Asia. In Korea theburden of military expenditure was very heavy and economic progress was less rapid than in North Korea. If this persisted, itsimplication for the stability of the country would be disquieting. in japan the British Trade Fair had been most successful and should lead to useful results. Japanese investment in Indonesia was on aconsiderable scale and in consequence there had been a danger thattheir earlier attempts at mediation over the Indonesian confrontationof Malaysia might tend to favour Indonesia: there now seemed lessdanger of this and he had made it clear that we should welcomeJapanese mediation if this would help to achieve a reasonable. In discussions on Rhodesia the Japanese Government had shown themselves understanding of our difficult position and supported our policy. He had discussed the situation in Vietnam notonly with the Japanese Government but also with leaders of the two main Socialist Opposition parties. They were critical of United states policy but did not want a Communist victory. They would welcome the kind of settlement which we advocated but, like ourselves, theyfaced the difficulty of finding means to induce the North Vietnameseto negotiate.In his discussions in Washington the United StatesGovernment had made it clear that they would not recognise or help the Rhodesian Government in the event of a unilateral declarationof independence (u.d.i.). They had, however, been cautious aboutfinancial or economic assistance for the United Kingdom to meetdifficulties which we might face in that event. They had also pointedout that they would only have legal power to stop United Statespurchases of Rhodesian tobacco if the United Nations tookenforcement action under Chapter VII of the Charter. This could lead to difficulties since it was important for our broader interests that United Nations action should be limited to the provisions of chapter VI.He had also discussed in Washington the related questions ofthe nuclear arrangements to be made in the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) and the possibility of a non-proliferationtreaty with the Soviet Union. The objective in NATO was to giveGermany a share in determining the nuclear policy of the Alliancesince Germany could not indefinitely be treated differently from theother principal NATO members. On the other hand the conclusionof a non-proliferation treaty with the Soviet Union would be of great value, not so much perhaps for itself, but as a starting point forfurther measures of agreement and as a framework within which itmight be possible to devise guarantees for the non-nuclear Powers.It was evident that there were different views on this issue withinthe United States Administration and some members felt that we
might be attaching too much importance to a non-proliferation treatyat the expense of the arrangements to be made in NATO. He had,however, argued that NATO must look afresh at this problem andthat it was right for the matter to be discussed in the first instancebetween ourselves and the United States Government. Much would depend on the real attitude of the Soviet Union, and if they genuinelywanted a treaty it should be possible to negotiate one. He hoped to learn more about the Soviet attitude during his visit to Moscow atthe end of November. It was perhaps significant that after a long period of delay in fixing a date for this, the Soviet Foreign minister in New York had at his first meeting readily agreed to do so. Atthe United Nations, there had been a widespread sense of relief thatthe difficulties over finance which had threatened the future of theOrganisation had now been overcome.In discussion it was suggested that a non-proliferation treatymight achieve little since none of the nuclear Powers, except perhapsChina, was likely to give nuclear weapons to non-nuclear Powers.The real problem was to prevent the non-nuclear Powers who wereequipped to do so, particularly Germany, India and Israel, frommanufacturing nuclear weapons. There seemed no possibility thatthe nuclear Powers would combine to take physical action to prevent this. If the non-nuclear Powers were to be dissuaded rather thanprevented from making nuclear weapons, they would requireassurances from the nuclear Powers which would guarantee their security. In the case of Germany it might prove difficult to give suchassurances through NATO and at the same time negotiate anon-proliferation treaty with the Soviet Union. Guarantees for Indiaand for Israel also presented great difficulty. It was, however, pointedout that while these difficulties admittedly existed the conclusion ofa non-proliferation treaty would create a more favourable atmospherewhich might facilitate the resolution of other matters now in dispute between the West and the Soviet Union. We should not thereforeat this stage disregard the potential importance of such a treaty.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1)2. The First Secretary of State said that the Prime Minister hadtaken with him a letter from The Queen to the Prime Minister of rhodesia. This had been delivered and the text would be publishedlater in the day.The Cabinet Took note.
Earnings-related short-term benefits(previous reference:CC(65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C (65) 137) on proposals forearnings-related short-term benefits.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance recalled thatthe Cabinet had previously asked that the priority to be accorded tothe introduction of an earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance should befurther considered. The argument on social grounds for improving the provision made in the early months of widowhood was evenstronger than the case for improving the provisions for theunemployed and sick. Provision of an earnings-related supplementfor the first six months of widowhood would cost  7 million a yearand could be met within the limit which had been agreed for totalexpenditure by her Ministry on the assumption that benefit rates would not rise faster than earnings and that the next general increasein such rates would not occur before June 1967. Extra expenditure ofthis order would make little difference to the possibility of effecting the major improvements which might emerge from the general reviewof social security payments, whether for widows generally, family allowances or National Assistance. Among possible smaller improve-ments, her proposals for supplementing widow&apos;s allowance stoodfirst in order of priority. If the Bill for the provision of earnings-related short-term benefits were published without any such provisionthere would be difficulty in resisting amendment and the proposalrecently put forward by the Opposition for a special payment onwidowhood made it all the more important that The Queen&apos;s Speechshould refer specifically to the inclusion of widow&apos;s allowance in theforthcoming legislation.In discussion it was argued that the further provision proposed for widows would pre-empt what was still available within the agreedtotal expenditure by the Ministry until 1968. Fuller considerationought therefore to be given to priorities and to the limitations whichextra expenditure on widow&apos;s allowance would impose on theGovernments freedom of decision in considering any subsequentproposals involving expenditure, including the extent and the timing of any general increase in benefit rates. It was not essential to makereference to the widow&apos;s allowance in The Queen&apos;s Speech, andit would therefore be preferable for priorities to be fully consideredby the Social Services Committee in accordance with the Cabinetsprevious decision. On the other hand it was pointed out that,while earnings-related unemployment benefit was being introducedprimarily on economic grounds, the decision to extend earnings-relationship to sickness benefit had been taken mainly on grounds of social policy: an earnings-related supplement for widowed motherswas the logical accompaniment and the case for it on social groundswas very strong. The difficulty of resisting any amendment made itseventual inclusion in the Bill almost inevitable and there were therefore strong presentational grounds for including a reference towidow&apos;s allowance in The Queen&apos;s Speech.
The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat, while the case on social grounds for improving the provisionfor widows was undoubtedly a strong one, the Cabinet on balancetook the view that in the first instance there should be a fullerappreciation by the Ministers primarily concerned of the priority tobe accorded to such provision in the field of the social services, andof the implications for other expenditure in this field of taking sucha decision at the present stage. This study should be undertaken bythe Social Services Committee which should report to the cabinet as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Social Services Committee to consider the priority to be accorded to earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance andthe implications of a decision to undertake such expenditure at the present time in accordance with the summing up by the First Secretary of State.The Queen&apos;s 4.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President of the speech on the Council (C (65) 135) to which was annexed the draft of The Queen&apos;sParHament      Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Lord President of the Council said that the draft was longer than was customary and should if possible be shortened.\.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The reference to the prospect of independence for a numberof Colonial territories should be deleted since it might prove embarrassing in relation to the reference which would have tobe inserted at a later stage to the position in Rhodesia. In drafting thelatter, further consideration should, however, then be given to thepossibility of including some reference to the prospect of independence for the territories in question.(b) In considering the presentation of the Governmentsmeasures relating to the economy and to the social services it wouldbe necessary to achieve an appropriate balance of priorities. certain amendments were proposed to that end.(c) The paragraph relating to action in respect of the docksshould be deferred for further consideration in the light of the views- of the Ministerial Committee on the Reorganisation of the Dockson the measures which should be taken during the forthcoming session.(d) A decision on the inclusion of supplementary national insurance benefits in the early stages of widowhood would have tobe deferred, having regard to the Cabinets conclusion on theprevious item of their agenda.(e) In the light of the decision of the Cabinet at their previous meeting to defer the introduction of legislation to strengthen the law
on Commonwealth immigration, the second half of paragraph 30was no longer appropriate. It was, however, desirable to include some reference to strengthening the control of such immigration.(/) Mention should be made of the Governments intention tobring forward proposals for the more effective co-ordination of inland transport.(g) It was suggested that there would be advantage in including,perhaps in paragraph 34, mention of the special need of Wales. Onthe other hand, the existing reference to Scotland was justified bythe different legislation necessitated by Scotland&apos;s different system oflaw and administration, whereas special legal provision for wales was with few exceptions unnecessary. In so far as Wales had separateregional needs these were covered by measures which ensured concern for regional interests generally. On this view a special mention of wales would be purely conventional and should preferably be avoided.(h) Certain textual amendments to the draft Speech were agreed.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet would wish to consider further the references to legislation on the docks and to supplementary national insurance benefits for widows, in the light of the consideration to be given tothese issues by the relevant Ministerial Committees. As regards a reference to Wales, the Cabinet might agree that this should be left for decision by the Lord President in the light of practice in previousQueen&apos;s Speeches.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to consider further at a subsequent meeting the references to legislation relating to the docks and to theprovision of supplementary national insurance benefits inthe early stages of widowhood.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to consider further in the light of the discussion the desirability of including a special reference to Wales.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) and to the amendmentsagreed in discussion, approved the draft text annexed toC (65) 135.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th October, 1965.
