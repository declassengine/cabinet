2. The Home Secretary said that the Government of the irish republic had recently renewed their long-standing request that theremains of Sir Roger Casement, which had been interred inPentonville Prison after his execution in 1916, should be returned tothe Republic. It had been established that, despite earlier misgivingsabout the legality of this proposal, there would not, in fact, be any legal objections to our acceding to it. On the other hand it was known that Sir Roger Casement had expressed a wish to be buried inNorthern Ireland. This would be wholly unacceptable to theGovernment of Northern Ireland; and it would therefore be essentialthat, as a condition of our agreeing to the proposal of the Govern-ment of the Irish Republic, they should give an undertaking that theremains would be reinterred in Republican territory and would notbe subsequently removed.In discussion&apos; the Cabinet were informed that both the foreign secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary endorsed the views ofthe Home Secretary.a 2N1. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now explored in greater detail the possibility of.gradually effecting a rappochementbetween the United Kingdom and the United Arab Republic(U.A.R.), on the understanding that our relations with theGovernment of Israel would not be impaired. As a result he was notunhopeful about the prospects; and the U.A.R. Government hadbeen informed that, if they wished discussions to continue, we mightbe prepared to send a Ministerial spokesman to Cairo for thispurpose. On the other hand they showed little signs of being willingto abate their attempts to undermine our position in Aden; and,domestically, President Nasser&apos;s regime appeared to be becoming increasingly precarious. In these circumstances we need not be undulyanxious to pursue our initiative; and it would now be for the U.A.R.Government to indicate whether they were interested in following upthe overtures which we had made.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the Indonesian government had recently reinforced their troops in Borneo on a veryconsiderable scale. We had therefore been obliged to despatch certain additional units to Borneo; and we might hope, as a result, to beable to continue to hold the position. Meanwhile, it appeared that president Sukarno&apos;s health had suffered a further deterioration andthat, in the contest for the succession which was now developing, theposition of the Communist elements in Indonesia was improving.Even if President Sukarno survived, it seemed probable thatCommunist influence would increase, although the faction controlled by the Army would probably be able to prevent it from completelydominating Indonesian policy.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the remains of Sir Roger Casement should bereturned to the Irish Republic, on the understanding thatthey would be finally reinterred in the territory of theRepublic.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would announce thisdecision in the House of Commons at an appropriate moment.Children&apos;service inGreaterLondon(previous reference:C.C. (64) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (65) 3) about the Children&apos;s Service in Greater London.The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had invited himto consult the local authorities concerned on the proposals to confer on the Greater London Council (G.L.C.) certain functions relating tothe children&apos;s service. The G.L.C. had agreed with the proposals,which they considered would enrich, rather than detract from, theduties of the boroughs. On the other hand the proposals were opposed, in some cases strongly, by the minority party of the G.L.C.,by about half the London boroughs, including several under thecontrol of the Labour Party, by the Association of municipal corporations and by the County Councils Association. Theopposition was based on the grounds that a two-tier system would be contrary to the principles of the Children Act, 1948, which vestedresponsibility for all work relating to deprived children in a singlecommittee in each local government area; that residential provisionought to be managed by the authority which had the care of thechildren concerned; that the training of child-care staff could bebetter organised through a joint organisation maintained by the boroughs to serve the health and welfare services; and that the headquarters staff which the G.L.C. would require could be obtainedonly by retaining staff at present due to be transferred to the boroughs. The first two of these objections were based on advicegiven by the senior professional advisers to the London boroughs andwould attract support from professional child-care organisations.Moreover, in so far as the case for legislation rested on the specialcircumstances of London, it could be argued by the opponents ofthe scheme that joint arrangements had been made by the boroughsto meet these circumstances. The situation would therefore offeropportunities for delaying tactics in Parliament, particularly inconnection with the allocation of the properties of the Middlesex and london County Councils. In addition there would be insufficienttime to negotiate afresh the allocation of properties among the boroughs; and this allocation would therefore have to be made byOrder without the agreement of the authorities concerned. In orderto allow time for this further stage the Bill, which was ready, wouldhave to be enacted by the beginning of March; and, even so, the time available for making the necessary practical arrangements would bevery short.In discussion it was suggested that, whereas informed opinion which was familiar with the problems of the children&apos;s service in
Tariffs 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C. (65) 1) about Post Office finance, to which was annexedthe draft of a White Paper on Post Office Tariffs.London supported the proposals, the opposition to them derivedlargely from bodies with no direct experience of running a children&apos;service and merely exemplified the common reluctance of localauthorities to surrender any powers which they already possessed. Onthe other hand the strength of this opposition and of its professionalsupport should not be under-estimated; and, although it might be unwise on general grounds to reverse arrangements resultingjfroma previous Governments decisions unless a large issue of policy orprinciple were at stake, no such issue appeared to be involved inthe present case and the administrative advantages to be gained bythe proposals in question were open to considerable doubt.Moreover, the Bill would present considerable opportunities for parliamentary obstruction, which might not only prevent itsenactment in time but also delay other Government measures of greater importance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet might still, on balance, consider that the proposals couldbe justified on their merits, they had previously taken the view thata Bill could be introduced only if it was substantially an agreedmeasure. It was apparent, however, that, so far from this being thecase, the Bill might well provide an occasion for the obstruction ofother Government measures. Since this risk was clearly unacceptable,the Government had no option but to abandon the Bill. They coulddefend this decision on the ground that the timing of the recentGeneral Election had not allowed them sufficient time in which to reorganise the service and that consultation with the interests concerned had not indicated that at this stage there would be general support for altering the arrangements on which the boroughs&apos; planshad so far been based. The Home Affairs Committee might consider,however, how far the decision might be made less unpalatable bythe issue of a general statement about the possibility of changes inthe structure of London government in the future and also, perhaps,about the importance of arrangements for close liaison between thevarious authorities who would henceforward share responsibility forthe children&apos;s service in Greater London.The Cabinet (1) Agreed not to proceed with legislation on the Children&apos;service in Greater London.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government tobring before the Home Affairs Committee the questionwhether a statement should be made on the related issueindicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion.
The Postmaster-General said that the financial target of the PostOffice was a return on net assets averaging 8 per cent over the fiveyears 1963-64 to 1967-68. At present, however, while the telecommunications services were paying their way, the postal services were heavily in deficit. Even on optimistic assumptions aboutthe annual increase in the gross domestic product and in the remuneration of staff over the next few years this deficit would entail,over the five-year period in question, an aggregate loss of 131 million. The difference between the two services derived partly from past decisions on prices and partly from their differingcharacter. The telecommunications services were rapidly expandingand technically progressive, whereas the scope for mechanisation inthe postal services was more limited and it was therefore moredifficult in their case to absorb rising costs in greater productivity.The Post Office had suffered in the past from insufficient investment,faulty pricing, a wages policy which had retarded recruitment and a gradual decline in the quality of its services. The long-term remedycould not be found in reducing services in quality or quantity, since this would not offer any hope of avoiding continually rising prices.Indeed, an increase in expenditure, primarily on investment, mightbe required in order to improve the standard of services. For these reasons it would be desirable to announce in the week beginning18th January increases in postal tariffs in the terms indicated in thedraft White Paper annexed to C. (65) 1. The yield of these increases in a full year should be some  37 million. This would fall short ofthe  45 million which would be required if the Post Office were to achieve in the remaining three years of the five-year period the target of an average return of 8 per cent on their net assets. But it would achieve the target in relation to those three years and would also make some contribution to the deficit in the first two years. Theproposed changes would add only about 0-07 of a point to thecost-of-living index; and a new charge of 4d. for the inland letterrate would still compare favourably both with the pre-war rate interms of current purchasing power and with current rates in othercountries in Western Europe. It would be important, however, to announce at the same time certain plans for the modernisation of post Office services in order to emphasise the positive aspect of theGovernments policies in the longer term.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It might be preferable to seek to offset cost increases bystimulating greater productivity than to appear to allow aGovernment Department to impose on the consumer price increases which, if proposed by private enterprise, would be regarded as evidence of inefficiency.(b) On the other hand the modernisation of the postal services would not in itself afford any prospect of solving the financial problem of the Post Office. In particular, the scope for mechanisationwas limited by the need to deliver letters and parcels by hand.(c) Moreover, it was important that the Government should beseen to adhere to the concept of an 8 per cent return on net assets asa financial target for the nationalised industries and, therefore, for
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C. (65) 2) on the proposed inquiry into trade unions and employers&apos; associations.The Minister of Labour recalled that he had been invited toconsider, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, whether theterms of reference for the proposed inquiry into trade unions andthe Post Office; and it would be unwise to create a possible precedent in this respect by appearing to be reluctant to accept price increases in a case where they were required in order to achieve this target.(d) The size of the proposed increase in rates was determinedpartly by the short-fall of revenue in the first two years of the five-year period, which had resulted from the failure of the previous administration to raise charges to an economic level. This should bemade clear in the announcement of the changes.(e) The proposed increase in parcel rates, which comparedunfavourably with rates offered by road haulage organisations, mightwell be reconsidered, particularly since its effect might be to discourage traffic rather than to increase revenue.(/) The Post Office should pursue as rapidly as possible allsuggestions for modernising their services (including the introductionof standard sizes for envelopes); but the proposal that a firm ofUnited States consultants should be engaged for this purpose shouldbe reconsidered.(g) The announcement of the increased charges at the present justice might be misinterpreted in relation to the Governmentscurrent efforts to encourage price restraint in general. It might therefore be desirable to defer the announcement for a time. On theother hand it might be unwise to contemplate more than a briefpostponement, since delay would merely exacerbate the problem. Buton any hypothesis about the timing of the announcement it mightbe appropriate to redraft the White Paper in such a way as to put the main emphasis on the measures to be taken in order to increase efficiency and productivity.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle, subject to Conclusion (2) below, theproposals in C. (65) 1 for increases in Post Office tariffs.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to review the proposed increases in parcel rates in the light of their discussion.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Postmaster-General, would give furtherconsideration to the timing of the announcement of theincreased tariffs.(4) Invited the Postmaster-General to revise the draft of theproposed White Paper in order to place greater emphasis on the measures to be taken in order to increase efficiency and productivity in Post Office services.
employers&apos; associations annexed to C. (64) 29 required amendment in order to make it clear that the inquiry would not be restricted to relations between the unions and the associations but would extend to industrial relations in general. The formula now proposedin C. (65) 2 was in more general terms and should suffice for thepurpose in view. Moreover, it omitted the specific reference toproductivity and efficiency in the earlier draft, to which the TradesUnion Congress (T.U.C.), although accepting that the topic would remain within the ambit of the inquiry, had seen objection. TheGeneral Council of the T.U.C. were expected to accept the revisedterms of reference at a meeting on 18th January; and it was proposedthat, subject to The Queen&apos;s approval, the establishment of theRoyal Commission and its terms of reference might be announced in a statement on economic measures which the Prime Minister had it in mind to make in the House of Commons on 19th January. Itwould be desirable that the chairman of the Royal commission should be a High Court judge.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Government of Northern Ireland had agreed that the inquiry should extend to Northern Ireland, on the ground that,although the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, did not apply to Ulster, theproblems which the Royal Commission would consider were common to all parts of the United Kingdom. Since, however, the subject matter of the inquiry was within the responsibility of the NorthernIreland Government, the statement on the appointment of the RoyalCommission should make it clear that they had agreed to theextension of the inquiry to Ulster. They had also expressed the hopethat the membership of the Royal Commission might include an individual with knowledge of Northern Ireland.(b) While there were sound arguments in favour of selecting a judge as chairman of the Royal Commission, the increasing demands on the services of the judiciary for non-judicial work might make itnecessary to increase their numbers.(c) More urgency might be imparted to the terms of referenceby substituting the phrase &quot;... accelerating the social and economicadvance of the nation . . .&quot; for the phrase &quot;... advancing the social and economic well-being of the nation . . .&quot;.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the drafting amendment suggested intheir discussion, the proposed terms of reference for theRoyal Commission on Trades Unions and Employers&apos;Associations.(2) Took note that, subject to The Queen&apos;s approval, the PrimeMinister might announce the appointment of the RoyalCommission in the House of Commons on 19th January.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour, in considering the membership of the Royal Commission, to take account ofthe interests of Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th January, 1965.
