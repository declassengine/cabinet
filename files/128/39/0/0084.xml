OverseaAffairsForeignSecretary&apos;visit to theSoviet Union1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that during his recent visit to Moscow he had discussed with the Soviet authorities the possibility of reaching agreement on a treaty to govern thenon-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Government were probably at one with us in desiring to negotiate a treaty for thispurpose: but they still adhered to their view that there could be noquestion of making progress to this end if, in the current discussionswithin the North Atlantic Alliance about future policy and organisation in relation to nuclear weapons, we allowed the federal german Government a greater degree of access to such weapons. Hehad made it clear, in reply, that there could be no grounds forapprehensions of this kind so long as no non-nuclear nation was ina position to exercise physical control over nuclear weapons withoutthe agreement of the nations which already possessed them; and since it was, and would remain, a cardinal objective of our policy toensure that this would continue to be so, the Soviet Government hadno reason to fear the outcome of the arrangements which we were seeking to promote within the Alliance in order to allow itsnon-nuclear members to play a greater part in the framing of itsnuclear policy. The Soviet authorities, however, had refused to accept this as disposing of their misgivings that the Federal GermanGovernment might gain a greater degree of physical access to nuclear weapons; and in these circumstances the best hope of making progress probably lay in a further attempt to allay Soviet fears byclarifying the text of the non-proliferation treaty and ensuring thatthe current discussions in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) were addressed primarily to ensuring a greater degree ofGerman participation in the consultative processes associated withnuclear policy rather than to conceding to them any increased share in the ownership or physical control of the related weapons.As regards other topics the Soviet representatives had disclaimedany role in relation to the conflict in Vietnam on the grounds thatthey were not authorised to undertake negotiations in order to bring this conflict to an end. But, although they continued to profess thatthe decision on this point rested with the Government of north vietnam, it was sufficiently clear that they themselves would wish tosee the war brought to an end but were inhibited from taking action for this purpose by fear of the reactions of the Government of thePeople&apos;s Republic of China. As regards the continuing tension between the Governments of India and Pakistan, the soviet authorities had made it clear that they did not intend to assume the role of arbiter; but they continued to be prepared to arrange ameeting at Tashkent between the Prime Minister of India and thePresident of Pakistan if this proved acceptable and would be likelyto be profitable. Their interpretation of the Rhodesian situation wasdistorted by their suspicion, which he had done his best to dispel,that we had connived at the illegal assumption of independence bythe present regime in Salisbury.In discussion it was suggested that the attitude of the federal german Government since the recent elections in Germany suggested
that they might no longer be so anxious as hitherto to promoteconcepts such as a Multilateral Nuclear Force (MLF) or an AtlanticNuclear Force (ANF) which might have been regarded as giving them some degree of control over nuclear weapons. There were also some indications that the earlier enthusiasm of the United StatesGovernment for the MLF had abated to some extent. In so far asit remained necessary, therefore, to continue to entertain conceptsof this kind, the ANF might henceforward be the main candidate for consideration; and it might prove possible to satisfy Germanaspirations by means of improved processes of consultation withoutconceding even the degree of physical participation in the operationof nuclear weapons which was implicit in the ANF. From this pointof view it was encouraging that the special committee of NATO,which the United States Secretary for Defense had proposed as a means of improving consultation about the nuclear policy of the alliance, had now been established. But, if this committee was to constitute in German eyes a satisfactory alternative to the ownership of nuclear weapons, it must enable the German Government to play a genuine, rather than a merely nominal, part in the discussions aboutthe use of nuclear weapons by the Alliance.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 67thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister said that, although the President ofZambia, President Kaunda, had refused to accept our offer to stationUnited Kingdom troops in Zambia on condition that no forces fromother countries were admitted without our consent, he remainedconcerned about the safety of the Kariba Dam and its associatedelectricity generating station; and it was in our own interests that hisanxiety should be allayed as far as possible. It might therefore bedesirable to seek to promote some form of Commonwealth force which could be deployed to protect the dam and the relatedinstallations. Since the installations were located on the Rhodesian^ide of the Zambesi River, it would be necessary that the force shouldbe deployed on both banks. We could not ourselves seek to negotiate with the illegal regime in Salisbury their agreement to the location of troops on the Rhodesian side of the river; but, in so far as theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development had originally financed the construction of the dam and the power station,they retained an official interest in it, which extended to the right of inspection. It might therefore be possible to arrange for the Bank tosponsor the proposed deployment of Commonwealth troops toprotect the dam.Meanwhile, the possibility of instituting an oil embargo against rhodesia was under discussion with the United States Government.But it would be useless to attempt, before these discussions were concluded, to divert individual cargoes of oil destined for Rhodesia,especially since oil supplies for Zambia were routed through rhodesia and any premature attempt to curtail the Rhodesian intake of oilwould therefore put the Zambian economy at risk and might also provide the illegal regime in Salisbury with an excuse to attackZambia in retaliation for our own action. We should thereforeconcentrate on  maintaining our other economic and financial
london transport(previous reference:CC(65) 63rdConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 168) and a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C (65) 171) on the financial position ofLondon Transport.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that at their meeting on 23rd November the Cabinet had asked the Sub-Committeeon Transport Policies to report as soon as possible on the prospects of finding solutions to the fundamental problems of london transport within a period of six months. The Sub-Committee had agreed on certain fundamental points which could form the basis of future policy for London transport. These were that public transport services in London must be maintained and improved; that this could only be done if there were more severe restrictions on the useof private vehicles in areas of severe congestion; that private vehicleswhich contributed to congestion should contribute financially to thedevelopment of public transport, either through additional charges for vehicles used in Central London or by a tax on employment in central London; and that the role and responsibility of the greater london Council should be reviewed. If the Cabinet endorsed these principles, it should be possible to work out a detailed policy within six months, provided that the matter was pressed forward withresolution.The Minister of Transport said that restraint on private traffic in Central London was essential and he believed that within sixCC 68 (65)measures against Rhodesia, while remaining prepared to indicate atthe appropriate moment the terms on which we might be prepared todeal with the situation which would arise when the rebellion came toan end. It was impossible to foresee at what moment and in what manner that situation would arise; but, so far as we could judge atpresent, the termination of the rebellion would need to be succeeded by a lengthy period of direct rule, which would gradually lead, by successive stages of increasing self-government, to ultimateindependence on the basis of majority rule.In discussion there was general agreement with these views,particularly as regards the importance of adopting measures tosafeguard the Kariba Dam, not merely in order to ensure the physicalsecurity of so valuable an asset but also in order to relieve the pressure which was at present being exerted on President Kaunda bythe more extreme leaders of African opinion to resort to an armed attack on Rhodesia as a means of bringing the rebellion to an end. Itmight be difficult, in the interim, to defend our failure to arrest ordivert, wherever possible, individual oil cargoes destined forRhodesia. But unilateral action in this field could only be sporadicand, therefore, ineffective; and the wisest course, on balance, wouldbe to concentrate on mobilising the maximum degree of internationalsupport for a comprehensive oil embargo. This would not be easilyachieved.
months specific proposals could be brought forward. But the proposals could not be put into effect for a further lengthy period, if only because legislation would be required for any fundamental changes.He therefore considered that an increase in fares on london transport should be made immediately. A further postponement would suggest to Londoners that, when the Governments policy hadbeen worked out in full, no increase in fares would be necessary. Thiswould be wholly misleading. Whatever measures were introduced,it was impossible for London Transport to be viable at the present level of fares, which had not been changed since July 1964. The rootcause of the financial difficulties was the loss of traffic at week-endsand in the evenings, and not a diminution of commuters into central london. It would be necessary for him to make a statement beforethe Parliamentary recess and this could most conveniently be madeon 9th December in the course of the debate on the Report on london Transport of the Select Committee on nationalised industries.In discussion there was general agreement that london transport fares would have to be increased before long. In favourof an immediate increase in fares it was pointed out that the longerthe delay, the less money would be raised by the fares increase during1966 and the greater would be the need for a subsidy; circumstanceslater in 1966 might be even less propitious for an increase in faresthan would be the case in January; and it was not likely that muchmore detail about the Governments policy on London Transportcould be given in February or April than in a statement now. Infavour of a delay in announcing an increase in fares it was argued that even the 10 per cent increase proposed by the Ministry ofTransport would cover only half the prospective deficit in 1966; that,since the Government were not yet in a position to know whatcontribution might be found from the sources of finance suggested inC (65) 168, there would have to be a continuing Exchequer subsidy for 1966, whether or not fares were increased; and that it would therefore be preferable to delay any decision on fares until it waspossible to associate it with specific decisions aimed at restrainingthe use of private vehicles in Central London and securing a financial contribution from their users in order to maintain and develop public transport.In further discussion there was general agreement with the approach set out in paragraph 12 of C (65) 168. The following points were also made:(a) Although road improvements could not wholly solve theproblem of congestion in Central London, they might make a significant contribution to easing it.(b) The simplest step which could be taken immediately to restrain the growth of private transport in London would be a largeextension of parking meters together with an increase in charges.But legislation would be needed for the money so raised to be usedfor purposes other than the provision of off-street parking. It wouldalso be necessary to recruit large numbers of additional trafficwardens. Moreover, the initiative in these matters rested with the
Greater London Council and the London Boroughs, not with theGovernment.(c) The introduction of a tax on employment in Central london would raise difficulties similar to those which had led to theabandonment of a payroll tax covering London and the South-east of England.(d) A restriction on the number of private cars coming intoCentral London would throw an additional strain on public transport at times when it was already seriously overloaded.(e) There was a case for regarding public transport in large cities, including London, as a social service and meeting a substantial part of the operating costs from sources other than fares.(/) London Transports proposals involved large percentage increases for certain fares and no increase for others. This might be criticised but any alteration in the proposals might well delaysubstantially the introduction of new fares.(g) British Railways had held fares on their London suburbanlines below those in the rest of the country, at a current cost of over 1 million a year. Moreover, they did not consider that they couldincrease passenger fares in the rest of the country until they werefree to increase the London suburban fares as well.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance the Cabinet considered that an increase in fares was inevitable and should be made sooner rather than later. In view ofthe criticism of the details of the fares increases it would be desirable for the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrange for theSub-Committee on Transport Policies to discuss the details thefollowing day. London Transport should not however be asked tomake changes in the proposed increases of a kind which would leadto a delay of more than a week or two in bringing the new fares intoeffect. Since the Cabinets acceptance of an increase in fares was,however, conditional on definite steps being taken by the government within a short period (preferably before the new fares came intooperation) to deal with the issues set out in C (65) 168, theSub-Committee on Transport Policies should report to the Cabinetin mid-January their conclusions on the way in which private traffic in Central London might be restrained and a financial contributionraised which could be used to assist the financial position of london transport. The report should also cover the Greater LondonCouncils responsibilities in this field. The report should dealspecifically with the extension of the parking meter system, a tax onoff-street parking in Central London, supplementary licence fees forvehicles using Central London in peak hours, and a tax on employment in the congested areas. The statement to be made bythe Minister of Transport in the House of Commons on 9th Decembershould be in general terms; it should not refer specifically to any ofthe proposed measures, since that would raise speculation; and itshould be considered first by the Sub-Committee on TransportPolicies.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that London Transport fares should be raised by anaverage of 10 per cent at the earliest convenient date.(2) Agreed that a full statement of the Governments policy inrelation to the problems of public and private transport in London should be made as early in 1966 as possible.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Sub-Committee on Transport Policies to considerthe possibility of modifying the structure of fare increases proposed by London Transport without substantiallydelaying the introduction of higher fares; and to considerthe text of the statement by the Minister of Transportannouncing the Governments decision.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Sub-Committee on Transport Policies to reportto the Cabinet in mid-January on specific measures to restrain private traffic in London and to raise a financial contribution for London Transport on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministets summing up of their discussion.Earnings-related short-term benefits(previous reference:CC (65) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 167) on contribution liability andcontracting out in relation to earnings-related short-term benefits.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that he hadbeen asked by the Cabinet to arrange for the Ministerial Committeeon the Social Services to consider the relative advantages of thealternative proposals for those contracted out of the graduated pension scheme. The Committee had agreed that there were only two courses available. The course proposed by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance went beyond what was essential for the financing of earnings-related short-term benefits, but sought to take advantage of that legislation to reform the existing arrangements for contracting out and, by bringing the contracted-outemployees into the graduated scheme, to remove the existinginequities and anomalies, to facilitate the financing of future benefit increases, and pave the way for a more radical reshaping of the graduated pension scheme. Because of its adverse effect on employees in the public sector, particularly those in the Civil Service and armed forces (whose occupational scheme was non-contributory), thiscourse could only be followed if, as a temporary expedient pendingthe completion of the major pensions review and the introductionof national superannuation, employees in the public sector were allowed to receive their occupational pension in full, together withthe graduated national insurance pension. The majority of theCommittee however took the view that, once a concession of this nature had been made, it would prove difficult to withdraw andwould prejudice subsequent negotiations on the relationship betweenoccupational schemes in the public sector and the national superannuation scheme. For this reason they did not favour theMinistets proposals to change the basis of contracting out. a minority of the Committee on the other hand considered that a
PublicExpenditurePlanning andControl: draft white paper . The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C (65) 169) to which was attached a draft White paper on the Planning and Control of Public Expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the main purpose ofthe White Paper was to explain the operation of the control and planning of public expenditure. Since they took office, the present6731-1concession made explicitly without prejudice to the subsequent negotiations would have little or no effect on their outcome becauseof the radical changes that would have to be made at that time, and accordingly supported the Minister&apos;s proposals.If the view of the majority of the Committee were accepted,then, on the basis that the principle of universality should apply to earnings-related short-term benefits as it applied to thecorresponding flat-rate benefits, the only course open was to charge the contracted-out the additional \ per cent graduated contributionrequired generally to finance earnings-related short-term benefits and to leave the contracting-out arrangements unchanged. Thiscourse would not avoid raising the issue of principle that contracted-out employees in the public sector would be paying for benefits which they would not receive, but the amounts involved would be quite small, and the majority of the Committee considered that this could be tolerated. A minority however took the view that, to cover the special case of the Armed Forces, a temporary concessionpermitting the receipt of occupational pension with graduatednational insurance pension would be necessary in the case of thiscourse also.In discussion it was pointed out that the National Insurance Actgave power to modify the general provisions of the Act in their application to the Armed Forces and that this power was exercisedunder the flat-rate scheme so as to modify the contribution paid bymembers of the Armed Forces for flat-rate short-term benefits. Sincethe special position of the Armed Forces was already recognised inthis way, there was a case for dealing similarly with their graduated contributions for earnings-related short-term benefits.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that those contracted out of the national insurancegraduated pension scheme should pay the graduated contributions required to finance earnings-related short-term benefits, but that the basis of contracting out should not be changed.(2) Subject to (I), approved the proposals in C (65) 112 forearnings-related short-term benefits.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance todetermine, in consultation with the Secretary of State for defence and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the extent towhich the contribution for earnings-related short-term benefits should, under regulations, be modified in its application to the Armed Forces.
Government had fixed a percentage increase for the growth of total public expenditure, and had allocated resources to the main blocks of expenditure within this total. This innovation had not been easy to achieve and the Government should rightly take credit for it.In discussion there was a general welcome for the proposal to publish the White Paper as a contribution to public unstanding of the machinery of control now operated by the Government and ofthe need to relate total expenditure in any one field to expenditure inother fields. It was, however, argued that it would be preferable to publish the White Paper at a later date, at about the same time asthe publication of the Estimates for 1966-67, in order both to setthose Estimates in perspective and to enable the Government toensure that there was no discrepancy between the two documents. Adecision on publication should, however, only be taken at the time.The point was also made that it would be preferable to omitAppendix 2 on the criteria for proposals for civil and technologicalprojects, since this was doubtfully relevant to the White Paper as awhole.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider in thelight of the discussion the publication of a White Paper onthe Control of Public Expenditure at approximately thesame time as the publication in February of the estimates for 1966-67.housing programme,1965-66(previous reference:CC(65) 43rdConclusions,Item 3)6. The Committee considered memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (65) 170) and by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (65) 172) on the housing programme.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that inJuly the Cabinet had agreed that the level of approvals for localauthority building in England and Wales should be 150,000 in 1965and 1966 rising to 170,000 by 1970. It was now clear that to keep thelevel of approvals at 150,000 for these two years would create serious problems. Great emphasis had been placed on the expansion in thepublic housing programme, and the new housing subsidies which hehad announced were designed to encourage local authorities to presson with their programmes. It was essential to permit the majorconurbations to extend their programmes because of the seriousovercrowding in these areas. The Government were seeking toencourage the adoption of industrialised building techniques and forthis the local authorities must be assured of a steadily growingprogramme over the next few years. Additional houses had also tobe provided for miners affected by the colliery closure programme.After allowing for the priority areas it would be impossible tomaintain approvals for the other areas even at the 1964 level withina total programme of 150,000 houses in 1965 and 1966 and this wouldbe extremely difficult to defend. It was possible to accommodate theadditional housing programme without straining the resources of thebuilding industry by the adoption of the right level of licensing for major private building projects.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the programme of150,000 houses for 1965 and 1966 had been agreed by the Cabinetin July as an integral part of the public expenditure programmes.The Minister of Housing was not asking for an increase in thehousing target for 1970 but he wished to approve more houses in theearlier part of this period and reach the target more quickly. Thiswould mean an increase in the total public expenditure programme in 1966-67 which would need to be met by additional taxation unless there were compensating economies in other deparmental programmes. The Cabinet had agreed in July that the public housing programme should be reviewed if it seemed likely that there would bea substantial fall in private house building. There had been atemporary fall in private house building but this trend had now beenreversed and it was agreed between Departments that there wouldprobably be an expansion of over 10 per cent in private house building in 1966. There was therefore no case for reopening the agreed programme. Since, however, the delay in putting in applications bylocal authorities until after the new housing subsidy had been announced might lead to difficulties in approving the full programmeof 150,000 houses before the end of 1965, any shortfall might reasonably be carried forward into 1966. The 1966 programme mightbe reviewed in three months&apos; time in the light of the economic andfinancial position then.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that officials had concluded that it would be possible, without straining the resourcesof the building industry, to license about  10 million worth of new work each month under the building licensing legislation. the ministerial Committee on Economic Development had agreed thatapprovals should be given at a somewhat lower rate in order to accommodate any increase that might be authorised in the public housing programme and resources would, therefore, be available forthe programme proposed by the Minister of Housing.In discussion it was pointed out that in July the Cabinet had considered the relative priorities of the various main programmes of public expenditure, both current and capital. If it were nowpossible to increase the total of public expenditure, the cabinet should consider whether an increase in the housing programme hadgreater priority than increases in the other programmes or, indeed,than a restoration of the deferments in capital expenditure whichhad been agreed by the Cabinet at the same time. Other proposalsfor additional expenditure had not been put forward because it hadbeen assumed that room could not be found for them within the agreed totals for 1966-67. It was recognised that it would be possibleto restrict more tightly the volume of new building work licensed inthe private sector, although it should be recognised that many of theprivate sector projects were urgent and of social importance. Ifnevertheless this were done it would be possible correspondingly toincrease public sector capital programmes. This would, however,involve the total of public expenditure rising above the limit of4J per cent per annum which had been agreed by the Cabinet.
7. The Minister of Labour said that since the Cabinefs last discussion the bakery firms and the Bakers&apos; Union had agreed thatthe wage claim put forward by the latter should be referred to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes. This agreement was on thebasis that the Board would consider the claim as a whole and therewould be no interim wage increase of 3\ per cent from 1st January,1966, as had originally been contemplated in the Cabinefs earlier discussion. The Union proposed to recall their Conference in Januaryor in February in order to consider the report of the Board as soonas this was available.Unfortunately, the effect of the settlement of this dispute mightwell be offset by a strike in the printing industry which might preventthe publication of a number of newspapers. This dispute arose fromrivalry between the two main unions concerned over the operation ofnew printing machinery.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet congratulated theMinister of Labour on his success in achieving a settlement of thedispute in the bakery industry.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th December, 1965.IndustrialDisputesBakeryIndustry andNewspaperIndustry(previous reference:CC(65) 67thConclusions,Minute 3)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet did not feel able at this stage to agree to an increase in thepublic housing programme in England and Wales. The Minister of housing should, for the time being, continue allocations on theassumption that the programme should total 300,000 houses in theyears 1965 and 1966 taken together. By the middle of January theMinister of Housing would have more information about the numberof applications received from local authorities following theintroduction of the new housing subsidies and more would be known about the economic and financial position as it was likely to develop in 1966. The Cabinet should then be able to consider the possibilityof an increase in the public housing programme and the case for extending other public sector capital programmes together with any necessary reduction in the scale of private sector construction work,on the basis that the annual increase of public expenditure would continue to be restricted to 41 per cent at constant prices.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being the Minister of Housing andLocal Government should approve local authorityapplications on the basis of a programme totalling300,000 houses for 1965 and 1966 combined.(2) Agreed to review the public sector capital programmes,including the housing programme, in the middle ofJanuary in the light of the economic and financial position at that time.
