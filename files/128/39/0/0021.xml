The Foreign Secretary said that the member countries ofthe European Free Trade Association were continuing to press usto announce, during February, some reduction in our importcharges. They were also tending to claim that our system of exportrebates, which had recently been announced, was contrary to the stockholm Convention and should be terminated as soon aspossible.In discussion there was general agreement that the exportrebates were intended to be permanent and that we could notconcede that they constituted a breach of our international obligations.The Foreign Secretary said that the recent assassination of thePrime Minister of Iran appeared to be the result of purely internaltensions and was not attributable to any external intervention.There was no reason to think that it would involve any change inthe general direction of Iranian policy.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that anothermilitary coup d&apos;etat had just taken place in South Vietnam andthat there was some reason to suppose that the new regime might beless disposed to co-operate with the United States Government.In discussion it was agreed that there appeared to be no actionwhich we ourselves could usefully take at this juncture; but we might ascertain informally from the United States government whether they saw any scope for us to intervene in our capacity asco-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference.The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, had now decided to attend the forthcoming funeral of Sir Winston churchill and that the President of Zambia, President Kaunda, might also bein London on that occasion. These visits might provide anopportunity for informal discussions about the problems ofSouthern Rhodesia.Public 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorExpenditure    of the Exchequer (C (65) 10) on the preparation of long-termprogrammes, of public expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the future level ofpublic expenditure had to be considered in relation to the expectedgrowth in gross domestic product although they need not necessarilySECRET6551-1 a 2NCC 5 (65)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the revised order of business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.The terms of an amendment to the Opposition Motion of censure, to be debated on Tuesday, 2nd February, were discussed.
keep in line. He had agreed, in consultation with the First Secretaryof State, that it should be assumed for industrial planning andpublic presentation that the gross domestic product would increase by 25 per cent between 1964 and 1970, but that a slightly lower rate of growth, namely, one of 22A per cent should be assumedfor the purpose of relating long-term programmes of public expenditure to prospective resources. They had felt it right toadopt a more optimistic forecast for industrial purposes toencourage faster growth, but to be more cautious in the planning of public expenditure so as not to commit the Government tospending the fruits of faster growth before they had been achieved.The programmes inherited from the previous Administration, whichenvisaged an annual increase in public expenditure of 5  per cent a year between 1964-65 and 1968-69, could not be accommodated within the assumed rate of increase in gross domestic product over that period without a substantial increase in tax rates over and above the buoyancy of the revenue and a significant restriction inthe growth of private consumption. This could jeopardise theGovernments policies for stimulating economic growth. The growth in public expenditure should therefore be limited to 4  per cent ayear thereby deferring the attainment of the level of expenditurecurrently envisaged for 1968-69 by one year.This would still involve a significantly faster increase in civil expenditure than in gross domestic product and would require some increase in tax rates and some restraint on private consumption. The achievement of even this lower rate of increase would depend essentially on the Governments ability to containdefence expenditure at the 1964-65 level of  2,000 million, at 1964prices; it was already obvious that this was unlikely to be achieved in the next financial year but it would be essential to reach this level as soon as possible thereafter and to hold it through to1969-70. This policy, if successful, would save  350 million a yearand, by accepting a reduction in the contingency margin from 300 million to  150 million it would be possible for the total sumavailable for civil expenditure to continue rising at the rateenvisaged in existing programmes. These programmes, however,were comprised of commitments entered into by the previous administration which did not necessarily reflect the priorities ofthe present Government. It was necessary, therefore, to review the programmes in order to distinguish between items of greater andlesser priority and to assess the possibilities of savings in those parts of the programmes that should continue. For this purposeeach Department should prepare a basic programme within thelimits and procedures laid down in the Appendix to his paper:these limits were designed to reflect very broadly the rates of expansion of expenditure which flowed inescapably from thedevelopment of policies which had already been announced. each department would also be entitled to submit an additional programme, representing the improvements it would wish to seeover and above its basic programme; the total sum available forsuch additions, however, might be no greater than  200 million.For this reason, any Minister who felt that his basic programme was too high should make this known as early as possible. When
the basic and additional programmes had been prepared, theywould, in the middle of the year, be matched in terms of resourceswith the national Plan for economic development; it would thenbe possible for the Cabinet to determine the priorities between theadditional programmes and to decide how far they could beaccepted.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposal to base the planning of public sector expenditure on an average annual rate of increase of 4  per cent at 1964 prices. It was mostimportant that all Departments, in preparing their programmes,should adopt the same basic price assumptions; and these should be provided by the Treasury. The country should beprepared for the implications of the Governments proposals for public expenditure by being informed in advance of the very heavyincreases in taxation that would have resulted from the commitments undertaken, but not fully explained, by the previous administration. Difficult questions would arise in assessing the priorities to be given to the various blocks of expenditure, but atpresent it would be right to give greater weight to proposalsassisting economic growth. Room would also have to be made for expenditure on proposals by the newly established Departments,particularly those which would lead to increased productivity in industry. It would also be necessary, in assessing priorities, to haveregard to those sectors of public expenditure that would assist in implementing the Governments policy for prices and incomes.The increases in the basic programmes shown in the Appendixfor the years 1964-65 to 1969-70 were based on existing commitments. This did not imply that the programmes should remain unchanged or that the priorities between the main sectors ofexpenditure were those that would be finally adopted. The extent towhich the programmes could be amended, however would vary from sector to sector: it might be difficult, for example, to makesignificant changes in some programmes before 1968-69 in view ofthe commitments entered into and announced for the intervening years; there might be other programmes, however, where changescould be made at a much earlier date. It would be for eachMinister to decide the extent to which his basic programme couldbe amended to accommodate part, or the whole, of any additionalproposals he might have. In so far as additional proposals couldnot be so accommodated, it would be for the Cabinet to determine whether they should form part of the proposed additional programme.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The Secretary of State for Defence said that he acceptedthe desirability of containing the defence budget within the figureof  2,000 million at 1964 prices, although his understanding hadbeen that this figure would not be reached before 1969-70, and thatit should be held at that level through until 1975. He had managed to prune the increase in defence expenditure for 1965-66 from
5 per cent as envisaged by the previous Administration to 3-7 percent; this figure would be further reduced to an increase of lessthan 1 per cent if the economies he had proposed in military aircraft were accepted. These economies would bring major savings in the longer-term, but the full reduction in defence expenditureof  350 million a year could only be achieved by a reduction in our defence commitments overseas. These were now being reviewed and proposals would be brought before the Cabinet later in the year; anumber of difficult political decisions would be involved and therewas little prospect that early savings could be achieved. It was argued, however, that this could mean that there would be little prospect of proceeding within the next few years with many of theGovernments important objectives and that a more rigorous andrealistic appraisal of our defence commitments should now be madein the light of the situation described by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(b) It should not be too readily assumed that cuts could bemade in the existing roads programme. Less was spent in thiscountry on roads per head of population than in any otherindustrialised country; it had been estimated that the economysuffered a loss of  350 million a year as a result of road congestion.There was greater Parliamentary interest in road development thanin almost any other subject, but the many schemes that were urgedupon the Government could not be accommodated even within thepresent programme whilst the Governments own plans for regional development, new towns, and urban renewal would all requireadditional road investment.(c) it was suggested in the Appendix to C (65) 10 that for thepurpose of preparing the basic programe for 1969-70, overseaseconomic aid should maintain its present proportion of gross domestic product, and that an additional programme could besubmitted for achieving the Governments declared objective ofincreasing the proportion of national income devoted to essentialaid programes. There would need, however, to be further discussionof the figure to be adopted for the basic programme for 1969-70;this should be assessed in the light of the actual outturn for overseas aid in 1964-65 and the estimate of gross domestic productin 1969-70. It was arguable how far expenditure on aid involved aspecial burden on the balance of payments. Aid might in future be tied to a greater extent to United Kingdom goods, unless this couldbe shown to distort the development programe of a recipientcountry. On this basis the burden on the balance of payments need be no greater than that caused by other items of public expenditure.A joint exercise would be undertaken by the Departmentsconcerned which should clarify the relationship between overseas aid and the balance of payments. Meanwhile, it was important to note that aid was a vital element in carrying out our overseapolicies.id) The basic programme proposed for social benefits and assistance need not prevent consideration being given to additionalsocial security schemes which would be financed from contributions
Nrather than by the Exchequer; any increase in contributions paidby the working population would, however, limit the extent to whichthey could also be expected to pay higher taxation.(e) Considerable difficulties could be expected in matching therequirements of public expenditure and the proper use of thecountry&apos;s resources. This was illustrated by increased investment in public sector housing which would make relatively little call onthe Exchequer but a major call on resources in the years in question.These resources, however, would be largely those used inindustrialised building for which production capacity was beingspecially developed and which would be under-employed if public sector housing was to be restrained. The size of the future housing programme would be the subject of a separate submission to cabinet in due course.(/) The buoyancy of the revenue could be increased by changesin the tax system and the contribution that this could make to theproblem of meeting increased demands for public expenditure should not be overlooked.(g) Investment by the nationalised industries, which alreadyformed a significant percentage of total fixed capital formationwould need to increase greatly to meet the demands of a 25 per cent increase in gross domestic product.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theCabinet accepted that the planning of public sector expenditure should be based on an average annual rate of increase of 4  per cent at 1964 prices, and that the basic price assumptions used should bethe same for all Departmental programmes. The Cabinet also accepted the proposals for the preparation of basic and additionalprogrammes on the lines of the Appendix to C (65) 10. It was agreedthat, in assessing priorities, greater weight would have to be givento proposals that would assist economic growth and, by the sametoken, proposals by newly established Departments which would lead to increased productivity in United Kingdom industry wouldalso need to be accommodated. The size of the overseas economic aid programme should also be reviewed in relation to both public expenditure and the balance of payments. It was most important that whilst Departmental programmes were being reviewed noannouncements should be made of new commitments for long-termexpenditure without the approval of Cabinet. In assessing the programmes as submitted by Departments the Cabinet would also have to bear in mind the effect of their decisions in relation to public and overseas expenditure on the confidence of other countries inour ability to improve and strengthen the United kingdom economy.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C (65) 10.SECRET
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (C (65) 8) about the Farm price review.The Minister of Agriculture said that under the AgriculturalActs of 1947 and 1957 the value of the guarantees to farmers mightnot be reduced in any one year by more than 2\ per cent,i.e., approximately  38 million, less the net change in their costs.These had increased by about  28 million so that the minimumdetermination that it was open to the Government to make in theforthcoming review would be to reduce the guarantees by 10 million. The industry had also been assured by the previous government that it would normally be left with a share of theannual gain from increased efficiency, at present assessed at 25 million. If the industry retained half, the guarantees would haveto be increased by  15^ million. He, the Home Secretary and secretary of State for Scotland considered that these two figuresset broadly the lower and upper limits for the forthcoming review.The former they regarded as politically indefensible, the latter astoo generous in present economic circumstances; and an award ofplus  10 million seemed to them appropriate.Over the last 10 years agricultural productivity had increasedeach year by 5 per cent, output had gone up by 33 per cent and thelabour force down by 25 per cent. Annual expenditure on food imports had been reduced by  250 million. The cost to theExchequer of agricultural support had in recent years averagedabout  300 million a year and in the present year was now estimatedat  270 million. Farmers&apos; income was estimated to have increased inthe current year by the amount of last year&apos;s award, i.e.,  31 million,and the farmers would regard this improvement as the first step towards their aim of increasing their income by 25 per cent about 100 million in the three years commencing 1964-65.The production of cereals was increasing rapidly and cuts inthe guaranteed prices were necessary to enable us to fulfil our obligations to our principal suppliers on imports. Eggs were in oversupply and the guaranteed price should be cut. On the other hand,beef was in short supply, world supplies were inadequate and ourdomestic supplies diminishing. The profitability of beef production should therefore be increased while that of other meat production should be maintained. In addition it would be necessary to give further encouragement to milk production which had been falling off and despite increases in the guaranteed price in the previoustwo years showed as yet no marked signs of recovery. An increasein the guaranteed price of one penny per gallon was therefore recommended. Under present arrangements this would fall not onthe Exchequer, but on the consumer. The rise in the retail price would not, however, exceed a halfpenny per pint for four months ofthe year.Finally, it was important that this review should start toreorientate support so as to help those in special need and toimprove the efficiency of the smaller farmers. A modest start should
be made in encouraging agricultural co-operation, in providingbetter credit facilities and in giving more help through the hill cowand hill sheep subsidies, which would assist the promotion ofbalanced regional development.A review on these lines would create great disappointmentamong farmers and was unlikely to be agreed but in the existingdifficult circumstances he and his colleagues considered it justifiable.The First Secretary of State said that the settlement the previous year had been generous and in present economic circumstances a lower determination than that proposed in C (65) 8 would be appropriate. While it was not possible to settle in advance the precise outcome it would be preferable to start by proposing themaximum cut of  10 million. Otherwise he was in generalagreement with the detailed proposals put forward, the impact ofwhich seemed unlikely to have any substantial effect on incomes policy, save for the proposed increase in the price of milk. Moreoverthis might retain in being too many of the smaller and inefficientproducers and might lead to a surplus of milk for liquidconsumption which would have to be converted unprofitably toother uses. It might also be desirable to re-examine the case for ahigher price for beef. More generally, there was need for a reviewof long-term agricultural policy to consider what was the desirablemaximum saving of imports, how the subsidies should be distributed as between different farmers to produce a greater equality of incomes and how uneconomic smallholdings might be reduced,including the possibility of transitional payments to thoseabandoning them.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The present Government were not bound by theundertaking of the previous Government that the industry would normally be left with a share of the annual gain from increasing efficiency. This would, nevertheless, be desirable as an incentive.(b) Regard must be had to our international obligations to overseas suppliers and particularly to New Zealand in respect ofour imports of butter.(c) The proposed increase for beef should be further consideredsince it took several years to increase production and the present high level of prices had not yet taken effect.(d) The proposed increase in the price of milk was necessaryto maintain supplies which had only been kept at an acceptablelevel the previous year because of the exceptional weather. Thenumber of producers was however continuing to decline and somefactories had not been able to maintain their full production of butter and other milk products. On the other hand, it was suggestedthat the increase might reduce consumption and lead to excessproduction which would be economically damaging, especially inrelation to our commitments to oversea suppliers of milk products.It might on this view be desirable to consider at least a smallerincrease than that proposed.SECRET6551-1 m
Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that thedetails of the offer to be made could best be considered by theMinisters immediately concerned. Much would clearly depend onthe progress of the negotiations. The Cabinet would, however, wishto decide what total offer should initially be made in the review and what was the maximum determination that would be acceptable.The issues should therefore be further considered in the light ofthe discussion by the Farm Price Review Committee andrecommendations on these points put to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Farm Price Review Committee to consider the issues further in the light of the discussion and to circulate a paper in accordance with the Prime Minister^summing up.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later date in thelight of Conclusion (1).Postal Tariffs(previous reference:CC(65) 1stConclusions,Minute 4)*5. The First Secretary of State recalled that the Cabinet had agreed, at an earlier discussion, that certain increases in Post Officetariffs, indicated in C (65) 1, should be brought into effect at anearly date. Further consideration, however, suggested that it mightbe unwise, particularly in terms of the possible impact on theGovernments policy for prices and incomes, to increase postaltariffs merely in order to liquidate a deficit which the Governmenthad inherited from the previous Administration and that it mightbe preferable to continue to finance this deficit by borrowing untilthe current review of the efficiency of Post Office services in general had been completed and it was possible to judge how far tariffincreases were still necessary.The Postmaster-General said that a decision to this effect couldnot be easily justified. The Government were publicly committed to try to achieve the objective of a return of 8 per cent on the capital employed by the nationalised industries and therefore, by analogy,a similar return in the case of the Post Office; and, the longer theydelayed the implementation of measures required for this purpose,the more difficult it would be to realise this objective. It would benecessary to publish, in a few weeks&apos; time, the annual White paper on the finances of the Post Office services. This would reveal themounting deficit; and public opinion both at home and abroadwould find it difficult to understand how the Government couldallow this situation to continue, particularly when it was liable to be aggravated by the current wage claims of Post Office workers.Moreover, the details of the proposed tariff increases had alreadybeen sent to Head Postmasters throughout the country; and,although they were contained in sealed envelopes which were not* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
to be opened without further instructions and could, if necessary,be recalled, it might become known that the Government hadalready taken a decision which they were now attempting to revokeor to defer.In discussion there was considerable support for the view thatthe earlier decision should stand and should be implemented as rapidly as possible. In particular, the Departmental Estimates whichwere due to be published in a few weeks would show a sharperincrease in Government expenditure than in any previous year. Inthese circumstances the Government could not afford to be seen to neglect any reasonable means of effecting economies; nor would it be politically wise to allow public opinion to suppose that theconsumer need not pay the economic price for the various services from which he benefited.On the other hand the continuing public concern about therise in prices suggested that it would be unwise to acquiesce in anyprice increase which was not clearly necessary and justified. Therewas no reason why the Government should feel obliged to liquidatean inherited deficit as well as to try to achieve the objective of an per cent return on capital in respect of current operations. Fromthis point of view it would be preferable to suspend judgmentabout the necessity for an increase in tariffs until the results of thecurrent review of the efficiency of the Post Office services as a whole were available.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that inprinciple the Cabinefs earlier decision to increase postal tariffsshould stand. On the other hand it might now be more appropriate that these increases should be announced at the same time as theforthcoming Budget, the Governments apparent inaction in the interim being defended by reference to the review of the efficiency of the Post Office services, on which it might be advisable to call for an interim report by March. The instructions which had beensent to Head Postmasters should be withdrawn as unobtrusively aspossible.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their approval in principle of the proposals inC (65) 1 for increases in Post Office tariffs.(2) Agreed that the announcement of these increases should be deferred until the forthcoming Budget.Poll Cards 6.   The Home Secretary said that it was necessary to giveActing Returning Officers advice about the preparation of pollcards based on the new register which came into operation thefollowing month. There was advantage m preparing the cards inadvance of an election, since otherwise much work fell on the staff at the same time as other work of electoral preparation. The
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th January, 1965.potential wasted expenditure was only about  50,000. An attemptto withhold advice would cause speculation and the best coursewould be to tell the Acting Returning Officers to prepare cards ifthey thought fit.Discussion showed general agreement with this view.The Cabinet Agreed that the Home Secretary should advise ActingReturning Officers to prepare Poll Cards based on the newregister if they thought fit.
