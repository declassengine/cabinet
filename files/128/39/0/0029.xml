The Cabinet considered a Note by the Minister of Health(C (65) 37), to which was appended a copy of a letter sent by theChairman of the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos;Remuneration to the Prime Minister in response to the governments request for clarification of the Review Body&apos;s Fifth Report on the pay of general medical practitioners, published in Cmnd. 2585.The Minister of Health reminded the Cabinet that in this Reportthe Review Body had recommended that the pool of remuneration for general medical practitioners should be increased by about 5^ million (on account of the current and prospective increase inthe workload of general practitioners) and that this additional money should be drawn upon, so far as necessary, in order to make possiblethe introduction of certain schemes, which had been agreed inprinciple between the Health Departments and the profession^representatives, for direct reimbursement to individual doctors ofcertain of their practice expenses. The total increase recommendedwas considerably less than the doctors had envisaged; and the profession^ leaders had objected particularly strongly to therecommendation that the distribution of the additional money shouldbe linked with the introduction of schemes for direct reimbursement of expenses, which had not been agreed by the profession as a whole.The British Medical Association (BMA) had therefore asked him tomake the  5-^ million available entirely in the form of an increasein the capitation fee. Having announced that the government accepted the Report, he had been unable to accept this proposal;nor had he been willing to agree that he should invite the review body to indicate how effect should be given to their Report if theschemes for direct reimbursement of practice expenses were notintroduced. He had acquiesced, however, in a procedure whereby the doctors themselves would raise this question; and he had agreedto transmit their enquiry to the Review Body. The Review Body&apos;reply made it clear that, if the schemes for direct reimbursement of expenses were not introduced, their recommendation that the remuneration of genera! practitioners should be increased by 5^- million would nevertheless stand. They had made it clear,however, that they would deplore a decision not to introduce theschemes, because they considered them to be in the best interestsof the profession and of patients.In these circumstances it seemed clear that the professionwould not now agree to the introduction of the schemes for directreimbursement of practice expenses. But since he had already agreedto enter into discussions with the profession^ representatives onthe contract of service and methods of remuneration of general practitioners, it could be argued that the objectives which wouldhave been partly met by the schemes for direct reimbursement of practice expenses could be secured in this more fundamental review.The negotiations for the purposes of this review would be liable tobe protracted; and it might therefore be possible to defer the finaldetermination of the amount of remuneration to be distributed
through the revised system until this question could be consideredby the Review Body at the next of their regular reviews of the remuneration of general practitioners.Meanwhile the British Medical Guild (an offshoot of the BMA)had called upon general practitioners to send in undated notices of withdrawl from the National Health Service, with authority to theGuild to date them and forward them to the Government. So farabout 40 per cent of general practitioners had completed thesenotices. On 24th March a representative meeting of general practitioners would decide whether the Guild should send in, on1st April, all resignations received up to that time, to take effect from 1st July. The decision would no doubt turn on the Guild&apos;view of the progress of negotiations with the Government. It would therefore be necessary to make it clear to the profession^ leadersthat, if this threat of resignation was implemented, the Governmentwould not be prepared to continue negotiations on the contract ofservice and methods of remuneration, since they would then benegotiating under duress.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be regrettable if the profession frustrated theintroduction of schemes which were intended to improve general practice; and, if the Government appeared to condone this attitude,those doctors who regarded the Review Body&apos;s original proposals as sensible and constructive would be disappointed. Directreimbursement of expenses was bound to be a feature of anyimproved system; and the problem of financing it in its initial stages,if not dealt with on this occasion, would still have to be faced at alater stage. Nevertheless, the discussions on contract of service and methods of remuneration might be fruitful in this respect.(b) In those discussions it should be made clear to the profession that there could be no question of any further increasein remuneration taking effect before the date of the next general review of doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration by the Review Body.The operative date of any increases recommended by the review body was not likely to be before 1st April, 1966.(c) The obvious discontent among general practitioners wasdisquieting. The profession genuinely believed that their prestige and social status would be higher if they were in private practice; andit was incumbent on the Government to find, if possible, some meansof allaying this discontent within the framework of a National health service. Remuneration was one important element to be taken intoaccount; the provision of adequate facilities was another. The general public might be willing to pay more for the National Health Servicethan at present; and it might therefore be useful to examine, in the context of the fundamental review of social security arrangements which was currently in progress, the possibility of financing a larger proportion of the cost of the National Health Service by means ofthe National Insurance contribution.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to congratulate the Minister of Health on the
Land 2.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordCommission president of the Council (C (65) 34), as Chairman of the ministerial committee on Legislation on Rent, Land Commission and leasehold enfranchisement, about the establishment of a Land Commission.The Lord President recalled that the Labour Party election manifesto had stated that a Land Commission would be established to buy building land for the public at less than market price, tomake it available at cheaper prices and, in particular, to make itavailable to owner-occupiers under a system of &quot; crown hold &quot;. the ministerial Committee had come to the conclusion, however, that itwould not be practicable for the Land Commission to buy allbuilding land at the outset; and, in order to avoid an inequitabledifference between the price paid by the Commission and the open market price, it was now proposed to introduce a levy on development value, payable on the sale of land or, residually, at thepoint of development. The Commission would collect the levy on private transactions and itself buy at market value net of levy. Oneconsequence of the continuation of the present market would be thatthe price of land for housing could not be artificially reduced; butthe cost to the purchaser could be offset by some form of concessionor grant.The major problems, which the Ministerial Committee had been unable to resolve, concerned the scope of the Commission^ functionsCC 13 (65)dignity and restraint with which he had dealt with a difficult andpotentially dangerous situation. They agreed, with some reluctance,that he should now abandon the schemes for direct reimbursement of practice expenses; should distribute the additional  54- million asa straight increase in the capitation fee (if the profession so agreed);and should enter into negotiations with the profession^ leaders onthe contract of service and methods of remuneration. It should bemade clear to the profession, however, that there could be no further increase in the amount of remuneration until the next general reviewof doctors&apos; incomes. The Cabinet should be consulted, in advanceof any commitment, about any further changes which were likelyto involve substantial additional expenditure.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the letter from the Chairman of the review body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration to thePrime Minister, appended to C (65) 37.(2) Invited the Minister of Health, in dealing with the problemsof doctors&apos; remuneration, to be guided by the points madein discussion and in the Prime Ministers summing up.
and the nature of its powers of compulsory purchase. In considering these it was necessary to take account, on the one hand, of the factthat, in the light of the acute shortage of valuers, the commission would for some time be able to purchase only on a small scale and,on the other hand, of the possibility that the imposition of bettermentlevy, combined with the effect of the prospective capital gains tax,might constitute a disincentive to put land on the market which, ifits effects became sufficiently widespread, could seriously retard thehousing programme. Two alternative approaches to this problem hadbeen considered by the Ministerial Committee. The Minister of Landhad advocated a comprehensive approach, which would give theCommission permissive powers to acquire any land which had beenthe subject of a planning  decision  that  it was  suitable for development. Priorities within this field, to be prescribed byMinisterial direction, would be (i) to bring land forward for development when this was necessary to serve the needs of national and regional planning; (ii) to assemble in advance land to becomprehensively redeveloped; (iii) to purchase land for industrial and commercial use; and (iv) to make land available on concessionaryterms for housing associations and in other ways for private housing.These functions would be matched by a compulsory purchaseprocedure which would allow the landowner to object only on theground that the land in question ought not be developed in the foreseeable future; and successful objections would involve automaticrevocation of planning permission without compensation.  TheMinister of Housing, on the other hand, had advocated that theCommission^ functions should be confined initially to purchasingland where it was necessary to bring it forward for development or   redevelopment;   to   secure   comprehensive   development   or redevelopment; or to make it available for the functions of a public authority. It would be open to a landowner to object to a compulsory purchase on the ground that acquisition by the Commission was not necessary for one of these purposes, for example, because the land was about to be developed privately.It could be argued that the comprehensive approach wasnecessary in order to give the Commission sufficiently effective powers of compulsory purchase to deter landowners from with-holding their land, whereas, if the Commission were given only themore limited powers, there would be a risk that the supply of land would be restricted and that the Commission would be discredited.The only means of avoiding this would be to fix the levy at a levelso low as to be derisory. On the other hand it could be maintained that, since the Commission would not be able to buy land extensivelyin its early years, it would be essential to fix the levy at such a ratethat, having regard to the capital gains tax, there would be no incentive to withhold land from the market. This implied a low rateof levy, with the possibility of an increase at a later stage. Moreover,it might be politically unwise to confer on the Commission initiallypowers which would be more extensive than it was likely to be ableto use in practice but would suggest widespread and arbitraryinterference with the rights of the individual.
These problems resolved themselves into the question whetherthe Land Commission should be given at the outset the widefunctions and corresponding powers proposed by the Minister ofLand or whether the Bill should provide only the more limitedfunctions for an initial period but enable wider functions to be conferred on the Commission after a second appointed day, to bedetermined by Order subject to Affirmative Resolution.The Committee had also examined certain problems which arose in connection with the Commission^ powers to dispose of land, both to local authorities and to private occupiers. In considering how thebenefits derived from the betterment levy could be used to help localauthorities to purchase land, the Committee had considered the merits of enabling the Commission to pay a direct grant to theauthorities concerned or, alternatively, of distributing the levythrough whatever grant system emerged from the current reviews of local government finance. They had concluded that a decision could be reached only after discussion with local authorities in thelight of these reviews and of subsequent legislation; and they had therefore recommended that the Bill should confer power on theCommission to make grants towards local authority land purchases in such circumstances and on such scale as the Minister of Landmight by regulations direct but that, pending discussions with thelocal authorities, there should be no commitment on either theamount of the assistance or the manner in which it should beprovided.As a means of assisting owner-occupiers it was proposed thatthe Bill should give the Commission powers to make land availablefor owner-occupiers either through local authorities and housing associations or direct, on terms which could consist of a longlease or a covenanted freehold with a non-assignable interest or,alternatively, a form of tenure by which the freehold would belong to the Land Commission but the crownholder would have anassignable interest for the duration of the life of the house. Thedetails would require further consideration.It would be necessary to make special provision in the Billin order to anticipate the twofold danger that, during the period between its introduction and the date on which it came into effect(which could hardly be earlier than January, 1967) some buildersmight be reluctant to buy land while others, who had stocks of land,might seek to start as much building as possible in order to avoidpaying the levy. Since both these reactions to the Bill would be liableto disrupt the housing programme, it was proposed that landtransactions during the period between the introduction of the bill and its coming into effect should be disregarded for the purposes ofassessing the levy and that builders should be allowed to develop,free of levy, stocks of land having planning permission which werein their possession at the date of introduction of the Bill, subject tofurther consideration of whether this concession should be subject toa time limit.
Functions and Powers of the CommissionIn discussion of the functions and powers of the land commission there was general agreement that the Bill should confer,from the outset, the comprehensive functions and powers which theCommission was intended ultimately to exercise. Discussion turnedon the stage at which, and the means by which, the wider powers should be made effective. On the one hand it was argued that, inview of the intrinsic difficulty of the problem and of the failure ofall previous measures designed for its solution, it would be desirableto proceed circumspectly during the early years when the commission would inevitably be able to operate on only a small scale, lest itshould find itself faced with widespread reluctance to sell land andbe unable to use its powers of compulsory purchase on a sufficientlyextensive scale to sustain necessary development. In this situation a low levy, combined with the fact that the capital gains tax, being based on values at April, 1965, would also exert only a gradualimpact, would constitute an incentive to sell, whereas the threat ofthe use of extensive powers of compulsory purchase might causelandowners to hold back their land in the hope of a change ofGovernment. On the other hand a Bill which did not confer wide powers at the outset would be liable to be the subject of embarrassingamendments moved by the Governments own supporters, who wouldbe concerned that it should appear to give full effect to their political commitment. A possible reconciliation of these conflictingconsiderations, however, might be found in the fact that, with twoexceptions, the priorities which the Minister of Land proposed to prescribe within the wide field of the Commission^ powers to acquireany land designated for development did not appear to differessentially from the limited functions which the Minister of Housingproposed should be conferred on the Commission initially. the exceptions were the purchase of land for industrial and commercialuse and the purchase of land to be made available on concessionaryterms for housing associations and in other ways for private housing.There would be no objection to the addition of the latter to the listof limited functions; and, since the Board of Trade already hadadequate powers to buy land for the purpose of encouraging theestablishment of industry in development districts, there was no needfor the Commission to exercise similar powers, although it might bedesirable to enable it to do so in the long run. On this basis theproposed limited functions should be sufficient to enable theCommission to ensure that land would be brought forward for development or comprehensive redevelopment. As regards the powersof compulsory purchase with which the Commission should be invested, the difference between the approach advocated by theMinister of Land and that recommended by the Minister of Housingseemed to lie in the fact that under the former the onus would lieon the landowner to show why his land should not be developed,whereas under the latter the onus would lie on the Commission toshow that the land was required for development. The second mightbe the easier to commend politically; and it appeared to be adequate for the task which the Commission would have to seek to dischargein its early stages. It would be important, however, to ensure that
the Commission would be able to exercise the wider functions and powers at a date fixed by means which could not be inhibited, as could the Affirmative Resolution procedure, by the House of Lords.This might be achieved by providing that the additional functions and powers would be made available to the Commission on a datefixed by direction of the Minister of Land; and control by the Houseof Commons could be safeguarded by an undertaking that theMinister would make such a direction only if authorised to do soby a Resolution of the House of Commons after a full debate.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was agreed that the Bill should confer on the commission the comprehensive functions and powers proposed by the Ministerof Land but that these should be made available to the Commissionin their entirety only on a date to be fixed by direction of the minister on a Resolution of the House of Commons. In the initial stage thefunctions and powers should be those proposed in paragraph 9 (ii) ofC (65) 34, with the addition of the function of purchasing land for thepurpose of making it available on concessionary terms for housing associations and in other ways for private housing. Power to purchaseland for commercial and industrial purposes should be included inthe Bill; but it would probably suffice if it were made available tothe Commission only at the second stage. An undertaking shouldbe given in the proposed White Paper on the Bill, and in debate,that the Governments intention to make the wider functions and powers available to the Commission in due course would besubmitted for debate by the House of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Land Commission Bill should be draftedand presented, as regards the functions and powers ofthe Commission, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up.Assistance to Local Authorities and Owner-OccupiersIn discussion of the proposal to confer power on the land commission to make grants towards the cost of purchases of landby local authorities it was suggested that, as soon as the commission was invested with a statutory power to this effect, it would be subjectto increasing pressure from local authorities to exercise it, whereasit might be preferable that it should be allowed initially to build upa fund to finance its purchases and its concessionary disposals toowner-occupiers before beginning to make money available to localauthorities. Moreover, if the Central Government were not to beara disproportionate part of the cost of land purchased by localauthorities, the amount of the benefit which the latter were to begiven as a result of the levy would have to be considered inconjunction with any proposals for a revised level of general grantwhich might result from the current reviews of local government finance. On the other hand, in view of the undertaking in the LabourParty&apos;s Election Manifesto to reduce the price of land, it would beSECRET6552-4 b
necessary to make it clear that local authorities, who might have topay higher prices for land as a result of the levy, would receive some immediate benefit from it.As regards the proposals for the disposal of land by theCommission to private occupiers, it was suggested that it might be preferable, in giving effect to the concept of &quot; crown hold &quot;, to avoidcomplicating the law of property by introducing a new form of tenurewhich would be neither leasehold nor freehold. The simplest solutionof the problem seemed to lie in the grant of a 999-year lease, whichcould be made subject, on the analogy of Crown land in certain othercountries of the Commonwealth, to conditions specifying the formof development to be undertaken on the land. This would avoid anumber of practical problems which would result from an attempt tocreate a new form of freehold; and its only disadvantage appearedto be that it might be thought to be inconsistent with the Governmentsundertakings on leasehold enfranchisement. But the grievances whichwere liable to develop when leasehold property reverted to a privatelandlord, including the extortionate prices often demanded for the renewal of leases, should not arise if the landlord were the land commission, particularly if it was clear that the leases would runfor 999 years. By contrast, the form of crown hold proposed inparagraph 21 of C (65) 34 would have two of the disadvantages of ordinary leasehold tenure, in that the property would decrease in value and would ultimately revert to the landlord. A long lease,therefore, seemed to be preferable as a basis for crown hold; but thedetails would need further consideration, particularly in relation to scotland, where it would be preferable to avoid introducing the alienconcept of leasehold and to seek to make within the ambit of theexisting law arrangements comparable to those proposed for england.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it might be desirable, in order to safeguard the positionof the Treasury, to provide that the exercise by the Minister of land of the proposed power to make regulations about grants to localauthorities should be made subject to the consent of the Treasury.Otherwise, the proposals in paragraph 19 of C (65) 34 might beregarded as approved in principle; but the Ministers concerned should consider further the arrangements for financing the operations of the Commission with regard both to its purchases and to the means whereby it might most appropriately provide assistance to localauthorities and owner-occupiers. Further consideration should alsobe given to the details of the proposals for crown hold; but thebalance of advantage appeared to incline in favour of arrangementsbased on a long lease.The Cabinet (2) Approved in principle the proposals in paragraph 19 ofC (65) 34, subject to the requirement that the Ministerof Land should secure the agreement of the treasury to regulations about grants to local authorities in respectof their purchases of land.
(3) Invited the Minister of Land to consider further, in consulta-tion with the Ministers concerned, the arrangements for financing the operations of the Land Commission.(4) Approved the recommendation that the Bill should empower the Land Commission to make land available for owner-occupiers, either through housing associations or local authorities or direct, on crown hold terms, and invited the Minister of Land to give further consideration,in the light of their discussion and in consultation withthe Ministers concerned and with the Law Officers, tothe details of a system of crown hold tenure.Interim arrangements in discussion of the proposed arrangements to prevent the disruption of housebuilding during the interval between theintroduction of the Bill and the date on which it came into operationit was suggested that it would be necessary for that date to be prescribed in the Bill itself, in order that the period during which special arrangements would apply might be clearly defined. But theMinister of Land should be empowered to postpone the date by direction, should it prove necessary to do so.The Cabinet (5) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 26 of C (65) 34,subject to the inclusion in the Bill of a provision, on thelines proposed in discussion, prescribing the date on whichit would come into operation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd March, 1965.
