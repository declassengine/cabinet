Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 69thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister of Nigeria,Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, was arriving in London for discussions on his proposal that a meeting of Heads of Common-wealth Governments should be held in Lagos on 10th January, 1966,to discuss the situation in Rhodesia. This date had been deliberatelychosen in an attempt to defer action by commonwealth governments on the recent resolution by the Foreign Ministers of african States at the meeting of the Organisation for African Unitythat diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom should be broken off if we had not succeeded in crushing the rebellion by15th December. President Kenyatta of Kenya, who was also opposedto breaking off diplomatic relations, had asked for a meeting of theSecurity Council to be held that day and African Governments were likely to promote a resolution on Rhodesia using the language of chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and hence imposingmandatory obligations on member States. In discussion the previous day the Ministers primarily concerned had agreed to instruct theUnited Kingdom Representative at the United Nations to suppor tsuch a resolution provided that it was limited to economic sanctions and an oil embargo. While such a resolution would, in the longer term, involve considerable risks for our oversea policy, and there might be pressure for similar resolutions relating to the situation inSouth Africa, the current balance of advantage lay in supporting it.Indeed, in relation to the immediate situation in Rhodesia it shouldbe advantageous to us by increasing the degree of support by member states for the economic sanctions which the United Kingdom wasimposing.Meanwhile, discussions were being held with the United StatesGovernment on joint Anglo-United States measures for theimposition of an oil embargo and for the commencement of an airliftof supplies of petrol, oil and lubricants to Zambia. It was desirablethat the announcement of such action should be made before theresolution of the Security Council was passed, since otherwise therewould be serious risks to supplies of oil to Zambia. But it was essential that we should only act in concert with the United Statesand that they should agree to participate in the airlift from the outset.He himself would be in New York in the very near future andwould, if necessary, take part in the discussions in the security council.The First Secretary of State said that the committee of officials concerned with further economic measures against Rhodesia had reported to him that certain decisions were urgently required andthat some of them were essential for the effective conduct of theMission leaving immediately for Zambia under the Minister of State,Commonwealth Relations Office. The most urgent decisions affectedcontingency planning to maintain the Zambian economy in the eventof a break of economic relations between Rhodesia and Zambia. Scfar we had offered to bear the cost, within a limit of  1 million, o:purchases of equipment to increase the capacity of alternative lane
routes for supplies into Zambia. The Zambian Government on theother hand had asked that Britain should bear the entire cost ofcontingency planning. Officials had now recommended that weshould be prepared to accept financial responsibility for the costs of capital equipment and construction work outside Zambia whichcould be completed or provided within three months from the start of the whole operation, including assistance to improve surfaceroutes in Tanzania. On the other hand, we should insist that Zambiashould meet costs arising in Zambia and should finance all purchases of goods and freight charges, even where these would be higher thannormal or the goods were required for stockpiling. The limit of our financial commitment should be set at  5 million for approvedprojects, plus the cost of any airlift on which we agreed to embark.It would be impossible for the Minister of State, commonwealth relations Office, to make any progress in his discussions with the zambian Government unless authority along these lines was givento him immediately. Secondly, officials had recommended that the preparations for mounting an airlift into Zambia by the UnitedKingdom should be pressed ahead, since it would take several daysyet to complete the necessary steps. In particular, discussions were needed with the Tanzanian Government over the use of airfields inthat country; and arrangements needed to be made for the chartering of the necessary aircraft. Thirdly, officials had recommended that exports of machinery, vehicles and chemicals to Rhodesia should bebanned at an early date in order to increase the pressure on the rhodesian economy.In discussion there was general agreement that it was necessaryto increase our contribution towards the cost of contingency planning for Zambia along the lines recommended by officials. It would be important not to indicate to the Zambian Government the limit ofthe commitment which we were prepared to entertain; but the ministerial mission should have authority to approve arrangements which would involve expenditure up to  5 million, excluding the costof an airlift. It would be essential not to find ourselves financingprojects which were really part of long-term economic development in Zambia. As regards the relation between the  10 million aid to zambia for which we already had a commitment and the aid forcontingency planning, officials had recommended that we should inform the Zambian Government that we could not at this stagecommit ourselves to maintaining the  10 million figure in additionto the aid for contingency planning and that we should review thematter with them in the light of all the circumstances after the rhodesian crisis had been resolved. This aspect of the matter should,however, be further considered by the Ministers concerned.As regards preparations for an airlift it was pointed out that stocks of petrol and oil in Zambia were at a very low level and thatit was most important to increase these stocks before an oil embargowas introduced. There was a strong case, therefore, for starting animmediate airlift of these products as soon as it could be arranged.On the other  hand, it was undesirable to accept a definite
commitment to this effect unless the United States Government wereprepared to share it with us. So far they had suggested that we should announce a joint oil embargo, together with a wholly UnitedKingdom airlift into Zambia, on the understanding that they wouldbe ready to reinforce the latter if it proved necessary. A limitedundertaking of this kind, however, was insufficient assurance ofUnited States support.As regards exports, it was suggested that United Kingdomexporters were not, in fact, at present prepared to export to Rhodesiaon any significant scale, particularly in the light of the withdrawalof the facilities provided by the Export Credits guarantee department.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the recommendations of the first secretary of State as regards the financial contribution to be madeby the United Kingdom to contingency planning for Zambia, i.e.,expenditure on immediately relevant projects to improve the capacity of the surface routes into Zambia up to a maximum of 5 million, plus the cost of any airlift. The upper limit should not,however, be disclosed to the Zambian Government. instructions should be sent to the Minister of State, Commonwealth relations office, in this sense. No action should be taken which would appearto commit the United Kingdom to an airlift into Zambia until theUnited States Government had agreed to share this responsibility;but preparations for the airlift should be pressed ahead in so faras this could be done without involving a definite commitment. TheFirst Secretary of State should arrange for the Ministers concerned to discuss the relation between our contribution to contingency planning in Zambia and our ordinary financial aid to Zambia and toconsider the possibility of a ban on exports of United kingdom goods to Rhodesia.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to increase the United Kingdom contribution tocontingency planning in Zambia on the basis set out inthe Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange forpreparations for an airlift into Zambia to be pressedahead, without at this stage incurring a definitecommitment to operate the airlift as a solely UnitedKingdom responsibility.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for discussion by the Ministers concerned of the other matters raisedduring the discussion.
Social ServicesReshapingNationalAssistance(previous reference:CC (65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C (65) 176) outlining her proposalsfor reshaping national assistance.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance recalled thatthe Cabinet had invited her to prepare a scheme for remodellingnational assistance in order to incorporate as many as possible ofthe features of the deferred Income Guarantee scheme. Her present proposals included the renaming of national assistance, a number ofprocedural improvements, and the introduction of certain standardallowances, in place of the present variable allowances, in order toreduce the amount of detailed enquiry which had to be made. taken together her proposals would remove the less desirable features ofthe present system and make individuals less reluctant to claimassistance under its new name. Her proposals had been accepted inprinciple by the majority of the Social Services Committee, providedthat the cost could be met within her public expenditure allocation.To achieve this she proposed to limit the next general increase ofnational insurance benefits, which was planned for 1967, to something less than would be required to keep those benefits in line with the movement of earnings.She attached the greatest social priority to her proposals which she hoped, subject to the necessary legislation, to bring into operation by the autumn of 1966, when a normal increase in national assistancerates would probably be required. The results of her survey, to bepublished in the early spring, of the resources of retirement pensioners would show that about 650,000 retirement pensioners hadnot applied for national assistance despite their underlyingentitlement, and that, of these, some 250,000 had no resources whichcould be disregarded, and were receiving no help from their families.The present national assistance scale rates represented a bareminimum of subsistence; the improvements she proposed were theleast that should be done if, as seemed likely, no income guaranteescheme could be introduced before 1970. Moreover, her proposals would assist in ensuring the defeat of a further Private Member^Bill to provide retirement pensions for persons not eligible for them.She accordingly sought the Cabinefs approval, as a matter of social priorities, of her proposals for remodelling national assistance and for limiting the next general increase in national insurance benefits to the extent required to bring the cost within her programmeof expenditure. She was pursuing separately the associatedorganisational changes.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Ministers proposalsposed in an acute form the choice between the commitment toincrease national insurance benefits in line with the movement of earnings on the one hand, and, on the other, a limitation of such increases in order to concentrate resources selectively on means-testedbenefits. This choice had not been so apparent when the proposals had been considered by the Social Services Committee. If theGovernment decided to limit the next benefit increase in this way,it would be essential to announce that intention at the same time
as the national assistance proposals were published. The Ministersproposals would add to the budgetary difficulties in the coming financial year; in particular her proposal to give a new standardallowance of 7s. 6d. in partial substitution for the present discretionaryadditions would account for some  27 million out of the total costof  32 million of her scheme. The implications of the choice nowfacing the Government, and of the need for a public announcementof any intention to limit a future benefit increase, ought to be further considered by the Social Services Committee who should also consider how far the proposed new standard allowance of 7s. 6d. was essential to the Ministers scheme.In discussion the Ministers proposals were generally welcomed.While there was a need for a fundamental review of strategy inregard to benefits and assistance in order to rationalise the presentprovisions and re-establish the priority given to the relief of poverty,the Ministers proposals would be a step in this direction, since theydiverted resources from unselective general benefit increases toselective provision for the most needy; but they left little room for expenditure on any other improvements up to 1970 unless resources were further diverted from general benefit increases. It was argued,however, that, if pressure to give the full earnings-related benefit increases was to be resisted when the time came to make them, itwould be essential that the intention to limit the increases shouldhave been made clear when the improvements in assistance were announced. A limitation on future benefit increases could most easily be justified in the context of the improvements in national assistance as expressing a coherent philosophy. On the other hand there was a risk of arousing unnecessary criticism by a premature announcementand in any event it would be important that the announcement should emphasise that even the limited increase in benefits was likely toimprove their real standard rather than the fact that this would fall short of a full earnings-related benefit.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be important to delay the announcement of the changes for as long as possible in order to reduce the time that wouldelapse between the announcement and its implementation in theautumn of 1966.(b) If there were no need for an early announcement there mightbe advantage in deferring a decision on the proposed standardallowance of 7s. 6d. for the old and others who had been on assistance for a long time, in view of its cost. On the other hand, thisproposal was an essential part of the Ministers scheme. It would substantially reduce the number of enquiries that had to be made and, without it, there would be no significant improvement in thefinancial provision to be offered those on assistance in the absenceof the income guarantee.(c) While within the national assistance field this allowance would benefit most those who had no special needs, the income guarantee would have had a similar effect.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet welcomed the Ministers proposals generally as concentratingavailable resources where they were most needed. While it would benecessary to associate with the announcement of the assistancechanges a statement about the limitation of the next benefit increase,the timing and wording of the announcement would need furtherconsideration. He would discuss with the Minister and the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster the question of further organisationalchanges which raised machinery of Government issues.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 176.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance toconsider, in consultation with the Lord President of theCouncil, the timing of the announcement of the proposed changes.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance to circulate in due course to the Ministerial Committee onthe Social Services the terms of a statement on theproposed changes.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Ministerof Pensions and National Insurance changes in organisation of the Ministry of Pensions and of theNational Assistance Board.Social Services       3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorSchool Meals   of the Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 178) about a proposal to increasethe charge for school meals.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the social services Committee had been unable to reach agreement on aproposal to increase the charge for school meals in the coming april to Is. 6d., or at least Is. 4d. It had been argued in favour of theproposal that the increase in the cost of the meal since the charge ofIs. Od. was fixed in 1957 had resulted in an increase from 50 percent to 624- per cent in the share of the cost borne by the Exchequerand that it was contrary both to common sense and to Socialistprinciple to allow the subsidy to rise in a period when real incomeswere also rising. Given an increase of 55-6 per cent in average earnings since 1957, the proportion of the family income spent on school dinners would remain less, even if the charge were put upto Is. 6d., than it had been in that year. The saving to the Exchequerfrom the full increase would be  15 million in 1966-67, rising to  19-5 million in 1969-70; and the money could be betteremployed in other parts of the educational service, for example, onthe minor works urgently required to improve sub-standard schools.If the charge remained at Is. Od., however, the increase in the school
population and in the proportion of children taking the school dinnerwould raise the charge to the Exchequer from  75 million in thepresent year to  94 million in 1969-70.On the other hand the Secretary of State for Scotland had argued that it would be wrong to change the pattern of family support by increasing the parental share of the cost of the school meal untilthe current studies of family support and of the relationship betweenhelp in cash and help in kind had been completed; that to increasethe charge to Is. 6d. would bear hardly on families just above thelevel at which charges were remitted; that to make the increase atpresent would be politically inopportune; and that it was unlikely tobe rendered more acceptable to the public by being presented as theonly way of financing improvements in school buildings. The social services Committee had recognised that the review of family support would take at least two years, as would a social survey specificallydesigned to establish the place of the school meal in family nutrition;but the Committee had hesitated to agree at present to an increase to either Is. 6d. or Is. 4d.In discussion it was pointed out that a charge which, for a familywith three children, would amount to 22s. 6d. a week, would be liableto cause hardship for families with incomes between  15 and  20,which were below the national average but just above the level whichwould attract remission, and would be inconsistent with other measures, such as the Rating Bill, which were particularly designedto help this income group. Moreover, a charge involving an increaseof 7 per cent in the amount which a typical family in this group spenton food might well be prejudicial to the Governments policy of seeking restraint on wages and to the increasing employment of married women in industry since this depended on the continuedavailability of arrangements to ensure that their children had theirmidday meal at school. It would also draw attention to the fact thatfamily allowances had not been increased since the price of the schoolmeal was last fixed; and it would undoubtedly be strongly opposed by the Governments own supporters. To continue the subsidy even at a rising rate, however, would cost less than to increase family allowances; and, while it might be logical to raise the chargesufficiently to restore the parents&apos; contribution to 50 per cent of thecost, it was arguable that the provision of a substantially subsidisedschool meal was a social service and should not be considered as a means of finding money required for educational purposes. If it mustbe so considered, then it could reasonably be given priority overminor works on school buildings, however desirable these might be.It was suggested, on the other hand, that the opposition to increased charges which was to be expected in the House of Commons mightnot reflect the opinion of the public at large, who might well accept that the parental contribution should keep pace with the rising costof the meal and might consider it inappropriate to spend increasingsums on this particular aspect of social welfare. If the charge werenot increased in the near future, it would not seem possible to increase
it in advance of major changes in the system of social security and family endowment.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet appreciated the anxiety of the Secretary of State for education and Science to find money for the improvement of sub-standard schools, they did not consider that it wouldbe appropriate at present to make any increase in the cost of school meals. This did not necessarily imply, however, that the charge needremain at its present level for a long time ahead.The Cabinet Agreed that there should be no change at present in thecharge for school meals.Road SafetyLegislation:Draft white paper(previous reference :CC (65) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (65) 177) to which was appended the draft of a white paper on Road Safety Legislation.The Minister of Transport recalled that the Cabinet had approved, earlier in the year, the provisions of a Road Safety bill relating to drink and driving. The Bill would not, however, be ready for publication before Christmas; and it had therefore been agreed by the Home Affairs Committee that a White Paper on its provisions should be published to take the place of the customary Christmaspropaganda campaign on drink and driving. The second part of theWhite Paper dealt with the safety of lorries, about which there was much public concern, and would make the goods vehicle provisionsof the Bill itself the easier to understand. The White Paper had beenredrafted to meet points raised in discussion by the Home AffairsCommittee.The Cabinet-Approved C (65) 177 and the draft of the White Paperappended thereto, subject to any minor points of draftingwhich Ministers might wish to raise direct with the Ministerof Transport.EconomicSituation(previous reference :CC (65) 41stConclusions)Trade Figuresfor November5. The President of the Board of Trade said that the statistics of United Kingdom trade in November would be published that day. The figure for exports was the second highest on record; and,although the level of imports was still high, the trade gap was smaller than in many recent months. Above all, it was encouraging that thefigure for exports over the first 11 months of 1965 showed an increaseof 7 per cent above the level of the preceding year.In discussion it was suggested that, though this improvementwas to be welcomed, there remained an urgent need for a further effort to increase exports. It was important both that existing
exporters should raise their level of exports and that manufacturerswho did not at present export should be induced to do so. there might be some advantage in setting a target figure for the increase which should be sought by all existing exporters if we were to ensure a satisfactory balance of payments. If such a campaign were launched,it would be important not only that Ministers with responsibilities for particular industries should secure their co-operation but alsothat Ministers without economic responsibilities should play their full part in the campaign. On the other hand there might bedisadvantages in establishing export targets with too much precision;nor was a campaign of the kind envisaged necessarily the most effective way of increasing exports.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider the relative advantages and disadvantages of afurther Government campaign to increase exports on thelines suggested in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th December, 1965.
