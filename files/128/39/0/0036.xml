Oversea affairs vietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 18thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had conveyed to the ambassadors of the United States and Vietnam the sympathy ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government for the injuries suffered by their nationals as the result of the recent bomb outrage in Saigon. Hehad also expressed to the United States Ambassador the hope thatthe United States Government would not feel obliged to takeretaliatory action; and it was satisfactory that the subsequent public statement by President Johnson had been restrained in tone. TheUnited States Government had also taken this opportunity to confirm their undertaking to give us advance warning of anyintensification of the present scale of their air attacks on north vietnam.There were some slight indications that the Government of north Vietnam might be less unwilling than hitherto to attend aconference to discuss possible means of ending the conflict in vietnam; but these indications were too uncertain to be of any value.The Prime Minister said that these developments might make itdesirable that Mr. Patrick Gordon Walker, in the course of his mission to South-East Asia, should visit Hanoi at a rather earlier stage than was at present contemplated.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether arrange-ments should be made for Mr. Patrick Gordon Walker to visit Hanoi at a rather earlier stage in his mission to south-East Asia than was at present contemplated.The Outline 3.   The Cabinet considered  a memorandum by the Firstp,an Secretary of State (C (65) 53) on the Outline Plan, to which was attached the draft of a White Paper on the Plan.The First Secretary of State said that it had originally been theGovernments intention to publish in March an Outline Plan whichwould provide background to the Budget and would constitute an interim report on work on the main Plan, which would not be complete until the summer. He had come to the conclusion,however, that this would be inadvisable. Any White Paperpublished while the main Plan was still in preparation would inevitably consist of little more than a repetition of policy decisionsalready announced, together with an outline of problems not yetfully resolved. Moreover, the deficit on the balance of paymentsseemed likely to persist until further remedial measures had beenCC 20 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
taken; and any figures published at this juncture might therefore have embarrassing repercussions on international confidence in sterling. Finally, the need to rectify the balance of payments and to intensify investment in order to achieve the necessary level ofeconomic growth might require a degree of restraint on theexpansion of personal consumption and the social services which,while most undesirable, would be unavoidable unless defence expenditure could be reduced, in real terms, to the level of the1964-65 Estimates. But since this critical question could not bedetermined until the current review of our oversea commitmentswas completed, it would be desirable to explain publicly that itwould be unsatisfactory to publish an Outline Plan while the mostimportant economic decisions had still to be made; and this statement could be elaborated as appropriate, in a subsequent speech in the House of Commons, which might most conveniently be made during the debate on the forthcoming Budget.Meanwhile, the initial stages of the work on the main Plan werenearly finished; and the further stages should be completed duringthe next four months. It should therefore be possible to publish thePlan at the end of the summer or in the early autumn, provided that decisions on the future level of defence expenditure were taken in good time.In discussion it was suggested that, despite the difficultiesindicated in C (65) 53, there would nevertheless be advantage in publishing an Outline Plan on the lines of the draft White Paper,both in order to explain to public opinion the Governmentsapproach to the problem and to emphasise the need for theGovernment to adopt a positive role in the direction of the economy.On balance, however, it was agreed that these considerations could best be satisfied by an oral exposition of the Governments policieson some suitable Parliamentary occasion and that the proposed white Paper on the Plan should not be published until the Planitself had been completed.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The statistical table indicating the broad dimensions of thePlan might be regarded as making insufficient allowance in itsestimate of the growth of the Gross National Product (GNP) forthe improvement in productivity which might reasonably beexpected to result from the measures being taken by theGovernment to improve industrial efficiency. On the other hand the achievement of a rate of growth of 25 per cent in the GNP between1964 and 1970 would itself require a considerable increase in productivity in the later years of this period; and it would, therefore,be imprudent to base any published Plan on a rate of growth inexcess of this figure.(b) Paragraph 27 of the draft White Paper suggested that,provided that defence expenditure was restrained, it might bepossible to allow expenditure on public services other than defence to rise by more than the assumed rates of 4  per cent a year. Butthis should not be interpreted as implying that it would in fact beSECRET
SECRET 5CC 20 (65)feasible to contemplate more generous provision for these servicesthan was indicated in the statistical table, which could be arguedto be already more optimistic than was justified.The Cabinet Approved C (65) 53.TSR-2 orF-IIIA(previous reference:CC(65) 6thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Defence (C (65) 57) about the TSR-2 and the F-111A(TFX) aircraft.The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on1st February the Cabinet had decided to defer a decision on theTSR-2 pending the receipt of further information about the comparative cost and capability of this aircraft and of the TFX.There had been no significant development since then as regardsthe capability of either aircraft. As regards cost, however, it had not proved possible to agree a fixed price for the TSR-2. the manufacturers had offered, instead, a target price in the sense that,if the eventual cost were lower than a prescribed sum, the profitwould accrue to them, while, if it were higher, they would acceptthe loss up to a limit of  9 million but any further loss would haveto be borne by the Government. On this basis a purchase of110 TFX would yield, by comparison with the purchase of a similarnumber of TSR-2, a Budgetary saving of about  280 million; butit would involve a dollar outlay equivalent to about  500 million(including interest charges of  70 million). It would be optimistic,however, to suppose that the resources released by cancellation ofthe TSR-2 would yield additional exports to the value of 500 million; and it could be argued that it would be a false economy to save Some  280 million of sterling expenditure at the cost ofincurring a heavy additional burden on the balance of payments. If,however, it were decided to cancel the TSR-2, there would be advantage in announcing this decision at the same time as the Budget,since it would demonstrate our determination to secure genuineeconomies in defence expenditure.If the TSR-2 could be considered in isolation, there would be astrong case for saying that it was too expensive and should be cancelled. Moreover, the industrial consequences of cancellation now appeared less formidable, since it had proved less difficult than hadbeen expected to absorb the redundant labour in the aircraft industry which had resulted from the Governments earlier decisions to cancel the P-1154 and the HS-681. The situation would be more serious,however, if we decided not only to cancel the TSR-2, but also toadopt the TFX in its place, since we should then have to meet, inaddition .to the industrial problem of redundancy on a substantial scale, the political charge that we were allowing ourselves to becomeunduly dependent on the United States. The methods employed bythe United States aircraft industry to gain markets abroad and the
pressure which they were exerting in order to frustrate sales ofUnited Kingdom aircraft to United States airlines lent additionalforce to this charge.Until the current review of our oversea commitments was completed, we could not say with certainty whether there would bea future requirement for an aircraft of the TSR-2 or TFX type; andit would therefore be difficult to sustain a decision to cancel theTSR-2 unless we could maintain that an alternative aircraft wouldbe available if it were needed. It had therefore been suggested thatwe should establish an option to buy the TFX, without commitment to purchase more than a very limited number. The Cabinet would need to consider whether this was a realistic assumption or whetherthe outcome of the review of oversea commitments was likely tomake a substantial purchase of TFX aircraft inescapable. In thelatter event it might be preferable to maintain the TSR-2 programme for a further two or three months in spite of the financial and otherdisadvantages which this would involve.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he had carefully considered whether we should need an aircraft of the type inquestion or whether the requirement could be met in other ways,e.g., by carrier-based Buccaneers or by Phantoms. This question could not be finally answered until the completion of the review ofour oversea commitments; but it seemed probable that we should need at least some aircraft of this type. Other aircraft lacked boththe range and the payload to fulfil either the strike or there connaissance roles for which the TSR-2 and the TFX were designed. Moreover, the range of the TSR-2 or TFX providedincreased flexibility and economy of deployment. If we dispensed with aircraft of this type, we should be unable to fight limited warsin the 1970s in the Middle East and the Far East, unless we acceptedcomplete dependence on the United States; and a decision involvingso major a change in our existing defence role could clearly not betaken in advance of the review of commitments.As regards the operational capability of the two aircraft, theTFX Mark I would be markedly inferior to the TSR-2 as regards low level attack. The TFX Mark II, however, with the improved avionicswhich would distinguish it from the Mark I, would have a slightmilitary advantage over the TSR-2.The cost of the TSR-2 would be far greater than that of theTFX; and the difference would increase as the numbers requiredwere reduced below 110. On the basis of 110 aircraft each TSR-2would cost  4-8 million (or  5-8 million if money already spentwas included): for an order of 50 aircraft these figures would riseto  7-3 million (or  9-5 million), since the full cost of research and development would have to be spread over a smaller numberof aircraft. For the TFX Mark I the United States Government had offered a maximum price of  2-1 million. They estimated the costof the avionics which would distinguish the Mark II from the Mark Iat  200,000; and, even if we allowed a further  300,000 in case this estimate proved too low, the cost of the TFX Mark II would stillbe no more than  2-6 million. These figures related to a purchase
of 110 aircraft; but the latest information from the United StatesGovernment indicated that, if we eventually decided to buy a smaller number, the unit cost would rise by only a very small amount.Moreover, in addition to the lower initial cost, the TFX should prove more economic to operate. In short, it could be assumed that,on the basis of a purchase of 110 aircraft, there should be a saving to the Exchequer of about  280 million over the full period of13 years; and in the first five years, which were in many respects of critical importance to us, the saving would be some  300 million, ata dollar cost equivalent to only  12 million.These arguments justified the proposal that the TSR-2 shouldbe cancelled and that we should negotiate an option to buy the TFX.This was essential because we could not be certain at this stage thatwe should have no requirement for an aircraft of this type and wemust therefore be able to maintain, if the TSR-2 were cancelled, thatan alternative aircraft would be available, if we needed it, at a priceagreed with the United States Government. Moreover, the UnitedStates authorities would agree to waive the 50 per cent preferencerule, which at present applied against any United Kingdom military equipment bought for the United States forces; and they would alsoundertake to use their best efforts to procure some defence equipment from this country, provided that it met United Statesrequirements in relation to performance, time and cost. these concessions should provide at least a partial answer to any allegationsthat the option to purchase the TFX would make us undulydependent on the United States. We should now proceed, therefore,to purchase 10 TFX Mark I, for which we should need to place a firm order by 1st January, 1966; and we should also take an option to purchase up to 100 TFX Mark II. But since firm orders in relationto this option would not need to be placed before April 1967 weshould have time, before deciding on the total number of aircraft which we wished to purchase, to complete the review of our overseacommitments and to judge, in the light of its results, how far wecould reduce the requirement. There would also be time to considerthe possibility of incorporating the Rolls-Royce Spey engine andother United Kingdom components in the TFX and to pursue in greater detail with the United States authorities the extent to whichthey would purchase equipment of United Kingdom manufacture.The Minister of Aviation agreed that the TSR-2 was tooexpensive and that there was a case, on these grounds, for cancellingit. But it would be a wholly different matter if we cancelled theTSR-2 and adopted the TFX instead. In the first place it seemed unlikely that the redeployment of the resources released by the cancellation would offset even half of the dollar cost, equivalent to 500 million, which we should have to meet if we purchased theTFX, especially since the calculation in question took no accountof the loss of aircraft exports which might result from the disruptiveeffect on the British Aircraft Corporation of the cancellation of their most important aircraft. Moreover, although the Corporation hadbeen unable to quote a fixed price for the TSR-2, we could only use

Moreover, although the Corporation hadbeen unable to quote a fixed price for the TSR-2, we could only use
this argument effectively if we could maintain that we could be certain of acquiring the TFX at a fixed price which was not merelydependent on United States estimates and expressions of good intent.It was not clear whether this was in fact so. Finally, the proposal that we should commit ourselves to buy 10 TFX Mark I could notbe defended since so small a number of aircraft would be uselessin themselves and would only be of any value or significance if theywere followed by a further substantial order. The question would therefore no longer be one of cancelling the TSR-2 but of substitutingthe TFX for it. But there seemed no reason to suppose that, if theUnited States Government were anxious to sell us the TFX now,they would be any less anxious to do so in some months time; andthe right course, therefore, would be to cancel the TSR-2, to enterinto no commitment as regards the TFX and to defend this courseon the grounds that, pending the conclusion of the defence review, itwas impossible to judge whether any aircraft of this type would berequired and, if there were such a requirement, whether it could bemet in other ways. Among the possibilities open to us would, ofcourse, be a purchase of TFX if this proved to be the best solution.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Aviation, to circulate the latest information about theterms of the agreement which might be concluded withthe United States Government for an option to acquire the TFX aircraft.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd April, 1965.
