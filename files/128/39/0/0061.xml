CC 45 (65)The 50-year 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the rule Prime Minister (C (65) 114), proposing that the period of 50 years which had been established by the Public Records Act, 1958, as theperiod within which Departmental records should not be availableto the general public should be reduced to 30 years.The Prime Minister said that the principle implicit in the concept of a closed period as regards the availability of Departmentalrecords had been the subject of criticism by modern historians onthe ground that the period of 50 years was unnecessarily long andthat the rule was inimical both to the public interest and to therequirements of genuine scholars. Moreover, the Advisory Councilon Public Records had recently recommended that the closed period should be reduced to 40 years and that even within that reducedperiod more liberal access should be allowed to established historians.The Scottish Records Advisory Council had made similarrecommendations.Fifty years was, admittedly, an arbitrary figure; and a balancedjudgment of the considerations involved suggested that a closedperiod of 40 years, or even less, could be adopted without any damage to the basic objective of the rule, which was designed not only toprevent the premature disclosure of confidential information whichmight be prejudicial to the State but also, and chiefly, to preserve theconstitutional principle of the collective responsibility of the cabinet and the individual responsibility of Ministers to Parliament. On theother hand the recommendation of the Advisory Council that withinthe closed period more liberal access should be granted to establishedhistorians would be very difficult to implement in such a way as notto undermine these principles. The selection of the individuals tobe granted this privileged degree of access would be invidious; the choice of the subjects in relation to which access might be allowedcould be embarrassing; and the grant of access to Cabinet recordson any discriminatory basis would be liable to be a particularlydelicate issue in the light of the strictly enforced principle that access to the papers of the Cabinet and its Committees within the closedperiod was not granted to private individuals. For these reasons itmight be preferable to find other means of satisfying the desire whichhad promoted the Advisory CounciFs recommendation in thisrespect; and this might best be achieved if the closed period were reduced to 30, rather than 40, years, on the understanding that theexisting safeguards against premature disclosure in appropriate cases would be retained, as follows:(i) The provision in the Public Records Act, 1958, whichallowed controlled access to records within the closed period of50 years would be retained in relation to a closed period of 30 years;but it should continue to be implemented in a manner which would ensure that such access remained exceptional.(ii) There should be no change in the arrangements whereby the Lord. Chancellor would retain the power under the Act to
prescribe closure for longer periods, extending perhaps to 100 years,in relation to specific classes of records containing information which might either occasion embarrassment or distress to individuals or constitute a breach of confidence or involve special securityconsiderations.Provided that these safeguards were retained a reduction ofthe closed period to 30 years should not undermine the essentialprinciples of public administration which the existing rule was designed to preserve; it would be consonant with the government&apos;s policy of liberalising the convention by which public life wasregulated; and it would bring our practice in this respect more nearlyinto line with that of other countries, who would otherwise remainfree to publish biased and partisan accounts of events in which wehad taken part while we should continue to be inhibited from making any adequate reply. Legislation would be required in order to effect the change; but, in anticipation of statutory action, it would bedesirable, as an earnest of the Governments intentions, to de-restrictin a single operation the official records of the 1914-18 war insteadof following the existing procedure of releasing them only one year at a time. This action could be taken by Order; and it would be convenient if the period of the war were interpreted as including theimmediate aftermath of hostilities, i.e., up to the end of 1922, the year in which the Coalition Government fell.In addition, two supplementary but separate measures might betaken in the same field:(iii) On occasion the Government of the day might judge it tobe in the public interest that a history of relatively recent eventsshould be undertaken while the written records could still be supplemented by reference to the personal recollections of publicmen who had taken part in the events in question. For this purpose the range of the Official Histories, which had so far been confined to the two world wars, might be extended to include selected periodsor episodes of peacetime history, on the understanding that thepublication of works of this kind would need to be suspended for atime which would normally be at least equivalent to the 30-yearclosed period. In order that there should be no derogation from theprinciple that one Administration did not enjoy access to the policyrecords of its predecessors it would be necessary to arrange that any decision to commission such histories should be taken by theGovernment only with the consent of the other political parties orof some form of bi-partisan body, preferably consisting of PrivyCounsellors.(iv) Alternatively, or in addition, it might be desirable to publishin relation to particular episodes of peacetime history as much aspossible of the relevant official documents. By analogy with theexisting Foreign Office series of Documents on British ForeignPolicy, these would have to be confined to the formal recordsillustrating the historical development and execution of policy andwould exclude the internal records of discussions by means of whichpolicy was formulated.
If the Cabinet endorsed these proposals, particularly theproposed change to a 30-year rule (both generally and as regardsCabinet records), it would be necessary to secure the agreement ofthe Opposition Leaders and to seek The Queen&apos;s approval in relationto Cabinet records. Thereafter the Governments intentions could be publicly announced and the necessary legislation could be introducedwhen Parliamentary time permitted.In discussion there was general approval in principle of theproposal to reduce the closed period. It could be argued that areduction to only 40 years would be preferable on the grounds that,particularly as regards foreign policy, some of the public recordswhich would be released on the basis of a 30-year rule could be embarrassing in relation to the conduct of foreign policy and mightbe thought to be prejudicial to the public reputation of individuals who were still alive. Moreover, the Advisory Councils ownrecommendation suggested that a period of 40 years would suffice to achieve the purposes in question. On the other hand the risks of embarrassment implicit in a reduction to 30 years should not be exaggerated; and it was known that the Advisory Council wouldhave recommended a closed period of 30 years if they had been allowed to believe that considerations of public policy would make this acceptable. The safeguards proposed in C (65) 114 would continue to be enforced, particularly the right to withhold certain categories of record for an indefinite period; and these should be adequate to protect both the Government and individuals fromdamaging disclosures.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be desirable to inform the Governments of other member countries of the Commonwealth of our intentions in advanceof any public announcement. They could be assured that we should maintain the principle that documents of common concern to members of the Commonwealth, e.g., the records of Imperial or commonwealth Conferences, would not be released without theconsent of all the Governments concerned.(b) It would be necessary to review Departmental recordswhich had already been transferred to the Public Record Office onthe basis of an assumption that they would not be made available tothe general public for 50 years. Before a 30-year rule could beintroduced Departments would need to have an opportunity toconsider how many of these documents they would wish to continueto withhold for more than 30 years.(c) At present Departmental records were normally transferredto the Public Record Office about 30 years after their creation, thereto await the expiry of the 50-year period. If that period were nowreduced to 30 years, it would be necessary to give furtherconsideration, from the point of view of accessibility of the recordsfor purposes of current administration, to the date at which theyshould henceforward be transferred to the Public Record Office.
id) For these and other reasons the change from a 50-year period to a 30-year period could not be abrupt but would have toextend over a reasonable interval.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 114.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would initiate thenecessary confidential consultations with the opposition leaders.Review ofPublicExpenditureOverseas Aid(previous reference:CC (65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C (65) 118), to which was annexed a memorandum,agreed between the Minister of Overseas Development and the chief secretary, Treasury, on the allocation for overseas aid within theprogramme of public sector expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the group ofMinisters who had originally considered the public expenditure programme had examined the proposals in this memorandum andhad recommended that the cash limit for expenditure on aid in1966-67 should be  225 million; that this amount, which was 9 million above the basic programme for that year, should coverall unforeseen contingencies; and that it should be retained up toand including 1969-70, on the understanding that the implications of maintaining this limit in 1967-68 and beyond should be reviewed in the following year as part of the annual review of expenditure.The Minister of Overseas Development said that she reluctantlyaccepted this proposal. It involved a very stringent limitation on expenditure and allowed little margin for new emergencies. Moreover,the fact that the limit, as distinct from the limits imposed on otherDepartmental programmes, was expressed in terms of cash ratherthan constant prices implied that a declining percentage of the gross national product would be spent on aid over the five-year period.Some elements in the aid programme, such as loans to overseaGovernments, were rightly calculated on a cash basis; but others were liable to be eroded by inflation and the implications of this factwould have to be considered in the next annual review. The resultantposition was only defensible in the context of the extreme difficultiesof our prospective balance of payments; and this should be reflected in the references to the aid programme in the National Plan.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals in C (65) 118. The fact that they involved an addition of some 9 million to the total public expenditure hitherto envisaged for1966-67 reflected the difficulty of establishing realistic limits, in thefirst year of a five-year forecast, for a programme which was solargely determined by continuing commitments.
CoalIndustry(previous reference:CC(65) 44thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (65) 120) recording the views of the ministerial committee on Economic Development (EDC) on the proposals ofthe National Coal Board (NCB) for increases in the price of coal, as described in the memorandum by the Minister of Power (C (65) 110).The Minister of State, Department of Economic Affairs saidthat the First Secretary of State, with the support of a majority ofthe EDC, had formed the view that an increase in coal prices at thepresent time could have a damaging effect on the governments policies as regards prices and incomes and that this considerationoutweighed the case in favour of an increase in terms of the interestsof the coal industry itself. In order to avoid adding to the burden onthe Exchequer, however, any deficit incurred by the NCB in 1965-66should be regarded as part of the  400 million of their liabilitieswhich the Cabinet had already decided to write off. This could beeffected by reducing the element of  150 million which it was intendedto write off even though the assets in question were still earningsome profits. If, however, coal prices had to be increasednothwithstanding the objections of social and economic policy, theEDC had recommended that selective increases, varying in relationto individual coalfields, should be adopted. But this would involvea considerable increase in prices in the regions which the Governmentwere seeking to assist in many other ways; and this factor was anadditional reason against raising prices at the present timeThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, together with othermembers of the EDC, he considered that it would be wrong to allow the NCB once again to begin to incur a deficit on revenue account.The Board had originally proposed to increase prices in April but had been asked to defer action in the interests of the prices and incomes policy at that time. There was no reason to suppose,however, that the difficulties of implementing policy would havebeen any greater if coal prices had been raised last April. If theywere not increased in the autumn the Board would incur aprogressively increasing deficit which could be financed only by either still heavier price increases or by an Exchequer subsidy.The Minister of Power said that it was essential that the NCBshould achieve a balance on revenue account, at least in the year1966-67. But they were likely, on the basis of present prices, to incurCC 45 (65)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now completed the review of public sector expenditure.This had imposed a heavy burden on the Ministers who hadconstituted the group responsible for the initial examination of departmental programmes; but the outcome had been a valuable contribution to development of the Governments economic policies.The Cabinet Approved C (65) 118.
a loss of  25 million in 1965-66 and an even larger sum in 1966-67.If coal prices were not increased this autumn, they would therefore have to be raised still more sharply in April 1966. Moreover, if theBoard were not allowed to raise prices to meet the deficit, the principleof requiring the nationalised industries to manage their affairs on a sound financial basis would be brought into disrepute. As regardsthe selective nature of the proposed increases, it was essential thatthe economic mines should not be expected to finance the uneconomicmines and so handicap themselves in competition with other fuels.Equal increases in all areas would be contrary to the policy of promoting the closure of the high-cost pits, in order to enable thelow-cost pits to compete effectively for a reasonable share of the fuel market.In discussion differing views were expressed about thedesirability of taking a decision now to increase coal prices on1st September. On the one hand it was suggested that there would be advantages in delaying a decision until September. Even though thiswould mean that the earliest date on which any price increase could take effect would be 1st December, it would enable any announcement to be deferred until after the meeting of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) in September, and would therefore reduce the risk ofprejudicing the Governments hopes of securing the support of the tuc for their policy on prices and incomes. The delay would alsoenable the Cabinet to consider whether an increase in coal prices would be consistent with other policies which might have to beadopted for dealing with developments in the economic situation.On the other hand, it was argued that an increase in coal prices was already overdue and that to seek to compel the nationalised industries to hold down prices at the cost of incurring deficits would lead to their progressive demoralisation. If it were subsequentlyfound that more stringent measures were needed to restrain prices and incomes, it would be possible to suspend the increase in coal prices.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The increase in prices in the areas of uneconomic productionmight be regarded by the miners in those areas as a deliberateattempt to accelerate the closure programme; and this might prejudicetheir readiness to co-operate in implementing that programme.(b) The psychological effect of increases in coal prices wouldbe out of proportion to the impact on the cost of living. In particular the increase in house coal prices would bear hardly on old-age pensioners.(c) There were serious disadvantages in increasing coal prices in September or, still more, in December when the normal seasonalwinter price increases would in any case come into force.(d) The Chairman of the NCB had already indicated publicly that some price increases would probably have to be made. Atleast six weeks&apos; notice of any increases would have to be given inorder that the necessary procedures could be completed.
LocalGovernmentFinance(previous reference:CC (65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (65) 121) on local government finance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committee on local Government had recently considered measures for improving the financial position of local authorities. They had authorised theMinister of Housing and Local Government to proceed with thepreparation of a major Bill which would greatly modify the presentsystem of Exchequer grants but could not be brought into operationbefore April 1967. The Committee had also considered the possibilityof providing a measure of relief to ratepayers with low incomes inadvance of any general measure of rating reform. This would require a short Bill, to be introduced early in the following Session and totake effect in April 1966. The cost would be of the order of 30-35 million, of which, it had been suggested, a large proportion.e.g., 75 per cent, might be met by the Exchequer. The Committee had authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Government toprepare this Bill, which could also provide for the payment of ratesby instalements. But the decision on this measure could be deferred until rather nearer the beginning of the next Session and no commitment should be made meanwhile. If, in the event, it were decided to postpone the Bill, the necessary provisions could beincluded in the major Bill, for later introduction.CC 45 (65)(e) The proposed increase in prices in Wales and NorthernEngland might have a serious effect on industrial development inthese regions, inasmuch as it would diminish the attractions of these areas for industry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwas generally agreed that the NCB ought to be enabled to achieve a balance on revenue account by 1966-67. It was more arguable,however, whether it was desirable to take a decision now to raise coal prices on 1st September or whether to defer a decision until september, when the problem could be considered in the light offurther developments in the prices and incomes policy and in theeconomic situation. On balance the latter course appeared to havemarginal advantages; but a final decision should not be postponedbeyond September.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power to inform the National coal board that the Government would consider itinappropriate that any action should be taken at thepresent time in relation to a possible increase in coal prices.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion early in September witha view to deciding whether coal prices should beincreased on 1st December.
The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theproportion of expenditure which could be borne by the localauthorities on providing relief to ratepayers in the manner proposed would be 25 per cent at the maximum and even this might give riseto considerable political difficulty. It would be necessary to give further consideration to this aspect of the question in the light of theviews of the local authorities.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (65) 121.(2) Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto prepare a short Bill to provide a measure of relief toratepayers with low incomes in advance of a generalmeasure of rating reform.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th August, 1965.
