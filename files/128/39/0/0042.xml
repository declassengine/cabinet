The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Soviet Governmenthad recently proposed that they and the United KingdomGovernment, as co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, should invite the Governments which participated in that conference toattend a new conference to discuss the neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia. This would provide a convenient opportunityfor simultaneous private discussions about possible means of ending the conflict in Vietnam; and we had therefore favoured the Sovietinitiative. The United States Government, on the other hand, had originally been reluctant to take part in the conference unless it was endorsed by the Government of South Vietnam. In response to strong representations from ourselves, however, they had now been persuaded to accept the Soviet proposal; and in these circumstances,it had been possible for him to announce in the House of commons on the previous day that we would associate ourselves with the SovietGovernment in issuing the necessary invitations. It had been the moreimportant to indicate our intentions without further delay in that theGovernment of the Peopled Republic of China had been pressing theGovernment of Cambodia to raise objections to the proposed conference. But the fact that we had now publicly endorsed the soviet proposal should make it difficult for the Soviet government themselves to withdraw it at this stage.The Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, had recently announced that a GeneralElection would be held in the Colony on 7th May. It would be important that we should not appear to intervene in any way in the electoral campaign or to encourage the natural tendency of the rhodesia Front Party to seek to make this campaign an occasion forinflammatory statements about a unilateral declaration of independence. At the same time we should maintain as unobtrusivelyas possible our confidential discussions with Mr. Smith about apossible basis for negotiated independence for Southern Rhodesia.Unfortunately, it seemed increasingly probable that the Governmentof the Colony would have recourse to a unilateral declaration, despite the apprehensions of the local industrial and commercial interestsabout its consequences. Mr. Smith had refused to publish the irrepresentations on this subject and had insisted on publishing, instead,a provocative White Paper of his own about the probable reactions of his Government to any economic measures which we might take in response to a unilateral declaration of independence. We must nowconsider urgently how we should best reply publicly to this white paper, recognising that, if the Government of Southern Rhodesiaimplemented its threat to take retaliatory action against Zambia andMalawi, we should be liable to face a very critical situation.CC 26 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet considered the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons in the following week.
Europe: The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the visit whichYugoslavia and he had paid to Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia during the EasterCzechoslovakia Recess fad been a profitable occasion. In several respectsmisunderstandings between these countries and ourselves had beenclarified; in particular, the Yugoslav Government, who were represented on the United Nations Committee of Twenty-Four, hadbeen persuaded to adopt a more favourable view of our own record ofdecolonisation. The Czechoslovak Government had been mainly concerned to try to persuade us to agree that the Munich Agreementof 1938 should be regarded as legally void, mainly in order that itshould not be used as a ground for reviving former German claims onCzechoslovakia. It was not possible to regard a treaty which hadbeen signed as having never entered into effect; but he had done his best to mollify Czechoslovak feelings on the issue. The czechoslovak government had also urged us to convene a conference on european security; and here, despite the great complexity of the problems involved, it might be desirable that we should in due course take someinitiative.Europe:e.c. andEFTA(previous reference:CC (64) 10thConclusions,Minute 3)The Prime Minister said that, during the previous week-end hehad held an informal conference at Chequers with the leaders of theSocialist Parties in various European countries. The relations betweenthe United Kingdom and Western Europe had constituted one of themain points of discussion. He had made it clear that there was noquestion of our seeking to join the European Economic Community(e.c.) at the present time, if only because there appeared to be no prospect of our obtaining satisfaction on the various conditions whichwe had always attached to our accession. On the other hand he had emphasised the increasing need to establish closer links between theCommunity and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA); andthe meeting had considered various possible means by which this objective might be realised. There had been general agreement thatthese possibilities should be further explored at the next ministerial meeting of EFTA, which might appropriately be attended by thePrime Ministers of the countries concerned. A meeting of this character should help both to avert the growing threat to the cohesionof EFTA itself and to strengthen the connections between the e.c. and EFTA, even though little progress could be expected in thisrespect until after the forthcoming elections in the Federal german republic.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of these statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary.(2) Agreed to consider, at an early meeting, the basis on whichthe United Kingdom Government might propose, at theforthcoming Ministerial meeting of the European free trade Association, additional means of strengthening the links between the Association and the European economic community.
Military aid to India and pakistan(previous reference:CC(65) 24thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState, Commonwealth Relations Office (C (65) 64) about military aid to India and Pakistan.The Minister of State recalled that at their meeting on 8th april the Cabinet had approved the supply of 30 Hunter fighters to India,subject to consultation with the United States Government on themethod and timing of the communication of this decision to theGovernment of India. But before deciding whether, in addition, tooffer India an Oberon submarine on 10-year credit terms and tomake a similar offer to Pakistan, the Cabinet had wished to ascertain whether the United States Government would meet these requirements. This suggestion had been unacceptable to the UnitedStates authorities; and we could not afford any further delay in deciding whether to provide the submarines ourselves. If we did not meet the wishes of the Government of India in this respect, it was virtually certain that they would accept the offer of a Soviet submarine and would subsequently acquire Soviet frigates in addition. For securityreasons it would then become necessary for us to impose restrictionson the manner and extent of our technical assistance to the IndianNavy; and this would lead in due course to a situation in which Sovietinfluence in the Indian Ocean would have supplanted our own. Forthese reasons of long-term strategic policy we should now decide inprinciple to offer to finance the construction of an Oberon submarineon 10-year credit terms for the Government of India, on the explicitunderstanding that they would not thereafter obtain submarines orfrigates from the Soviet Government. A similar offer, together withthe provision of certain radar and electronic equipment to a valueof  1 million, should be made to Pakistan. The timing of these offers,however, would require further consideration in view of the currenthostilities between India and Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch.Discussion showed some support for this proposal on the groundthat if, as a result of the forthcoming review of our defence commitments, we decided to maintain a military presence East of suez, this would be both more difficult and more costly if we thenfaced a Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean. It would be preferable not to prejudice the outcome of the defence review in this manner; and it would therefore be expedient, without prejudice tothe future level of defence aid, to offer to provide a submarine each toIndia and Pakistan.On the other hand, the Indian Government did not need a submarine for the defence of India against China; and an offer toprovide one on the conditions proposed would therefore mark thebeginning of a new and indefinite commitment to provide defence aid,both to India and Pakistan, on a scale which we could not affordand would thus aggravate the arms race between the two countries.The cost of military aid to oversea countries had steadily increased in recent years and now amounted to some  30 million a year. If weyielded to every request of this kind which we received for fear ofbeing supplanted by Sino-Soviet influence, we should expose ourselves
to pressure from an increasing number of Asian and African countries;and we should therefore undertake an urgent and comprehensive review of the policies on which we should provide military aid infuture. Moreover, it should not necessarily be assumed that a refusalon our part to provide the submarine in question would compel theIndian Government to turn to the Soviet Government for assistance,since this would not only be contrary to the Indian policy ofnon-alignment but might also put at risk the rest of the United Statesand United Kingdom aid, both civil and military, on which the indian government were so heavily dependent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion appeared to be opposed to the provision of defenceaid to India and Pakistan on the lines proposed in C (65) 64. Themanner in which this decision should be communicated to theGovernments concerned would require further consideration by the responsible Ministers. Meanwhile, a review of our defence aid policy should be put in hand; and consideration should also be given to thedesirability of discussing some of the issues involved in the context ofthe forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that we should not offer to provide a submarine on credit terms either for India or for Pakistan.(2) Invited the Minister of State, Commonwealth relations office, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary and theSecretary of State for Defence, to consider, in the light oftheir discussion, the manner in which this decision shouldbe conveyed to the Governments of the two countries concerned and to the United States Government.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the principles on which united Kingdom military aid should be provided to third countries.Iron and steel nationalisation(previous reference:CC(65) 24thConclusions,&apos;Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C (65) 63) to which was attached a revised draft of theWhite Paper on Steel Nationalisation.The Minister of Power said that the draft White Paper had been revised on the lines indicated by the Cabinet in their previous discussion. It had been thought important, however, to include inparagraph 10 certain material which the Cabinet had suggested should be omitted from the previous draft, in order to demonstrate that there was no practicable method of remedying the defects of thepresent system by strengthening public supervision so long as theindustry remained in private ownership. It had been suggested thatthe reference in the previous draft to exports should be eitherelaborated or given less prominence; but a passing reference to this important topic would hardly be consistent with the inclusion in theBill of a provision imposing on the National Steel Corporation a specific duty to promote exports. The passage had therefore been strengthened.
Tribunals of inquiry(Evidence)Act 1921(previous reference:CC(65) 15thConclusions,Minute 7)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (65) 62) on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,1921.The Lord Chancellor recalled that the Cabinet at their meetingon 11th March had invited him, in consultation with the ministers principally concerned, to consider means by which the operation ofthe Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act might be improved and theextent to which an independent inquiry for this purpose might beexpected to be of value. The criticisms levelled at the procedure underthe Act were principally concerned with the difficulty and expense towhich persons involved in inquiries might be exposed in defendingthemselves; the harm which might be done to the reputation of innocent persons; and the confusion liable to be created in the public mind by the appearance of the Attorney-General (or, in the case ofinquiries in Scotland, the Lord Advocate) as amicus curiae. On thelatter point, it had been suggested that it must remain a matter forthe Law Officer concerned to decide, in the discharge of his responsibility for safeguarding and representing the public interest,CC 26 (65)In discussion of the draft White Paper it was pointed out that paragraph 13 (d), dealing with the structure of the industry, was intoo general terms to be significant. The reference which had occurred in the corresponding passage in the previous draft to improving theuse of manpower had been omitted. But this point ought not to be completely suppressed; and a suitable reference should be insertedat the end of either paragraph 14 or paragraph 15. The reference inparagraph 13 (d) to the fact that technological progress would necessitate the development of larger units should be transferred to paragraph 11. The remainder of paragraph 13(d) could then be omitted.In further discussion the Prime Minister said that thearrangements for compensation, which had been provisionallyapproved by a group of the Ministers principally concerned under his own chairmanship, would be communicated to the Cabinet attheir next meeting. Thereafter, in order to reduce the risk ofspeculation on the Stock Exchange, it was proposed to publish theWhite Paper after the close of trading on Friday, 30th April.Arrangements would be made for copies to be sent to Members ofParliament by post in order to allow adequate time for them to study the document before it was debated on Thursday, 6th May. As theGovernment had recognised when they decided to proceed with the nationalisation of steel, this debate would be an occasion of majorParliamentary significance.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper appended to C (65) 63,subject to the amendments indicated in their discussion.(2) Approved the proposed arrangements for the publication ofthe White Paper and its debate in the House of Commons.
whether he should appear in a particular case or not. On the widerproblem the Ministers whom he had consulted had considered that,if it were accepted that it was necessary to retain a means ofinvestigating matters of urgent public importance by an inquisitorialprocedure, some minor improvements in the procedure itself could be devised but that it was unnecessary to seek the assistance of anindependent inquiry for this purpose. While the group were dividedin their views on the retention of the inquisitorial procedure, theywere agreed that its use continued to arouse so much public anxietythat it ought not to be retained without an authoritative inquiry,which could consider whether some other procedure, such, forexample, as that employed in the inquiry conducted by Lord Denning,could be equally effective without harming innocent persons. they considered that a small Royal Commission would be the most suitablebody to conduct such an inquiry; and they proposed terms of referencewhich would explicitly require the Commission to consider whetherthe procedure under the Act of 1921 should be retained or should bereplaced by some other procedure. It might be thought desirable thatthe Royal Commission should be under the chairmanship of a judge;but, in view of the present pressure of judicial work, it would beimpossible to make the services of a judge available unless proposals at present under consideration for an increase in the numbers of the judiciary could be accepted.In discussion there was general agreement that a RoyalCommission should be appointed with terms of reference whichwould enable it to consider alternatives to the procedure under the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act. In view of the importance ofsecuring the services of a judge as the chairman of an inquiry into a form of judicial proceeding, there might be advantage in deferring theappointment of the Commission until consideration of the proposed increase in the numbers of the judiciary had been completed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas agreement in principle with the proposal that a Royal commission should be established with the terms of reference proposed in C (65) 62.The necessary action for this purpose, however, should be deferred pending further consideration of the chairmanship of the Commissionin the light of the conclusions reached on the proposed increase in the judiciary.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed in principle the proposal to seek the approval ofThe Queen for the appointment of a Royal Commissionon the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, with the termsof reference proposed in C (65) 62.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the ministers concerned, to the selection of the chairman and membersof the Royal Commission.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th April, 1965.
