mOverseaAffairsDisarmament(previous reference:CC (65) 38thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Eighteen-NationDisarmament Conference had reopened at Geneva on 27th July.Meanwhile we had circulated, for discussion in the Council of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the draft of a treatyproviding for the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons. The UnitedStates had proposed to us certain amendments designed to keep open the possibility of such weapons being acquired by a future Europeanassociation and used on the basis of a majority vote of theconstituent countries. These amendments were unacceptable to us and had not so far been pressed in the NATO discussions. Our aimwas to secure NATO agreement to the circulation of a draft treatybased jointly on a Canadian draft and on our own.A principal cause of dispute with the Soviet Union would be their claim that the Atlantic Nuclear Force (ANF), or any similarlyconstituted force, would be contrary to the principle ofnon-dissemination. We did not accept that this was the case and itwas our intention to seek agreement on a treaty and then to demonstrate that the ANF would not be in breach of it. This wouldbe contrary to the view of the Federal German Government whichwas that we should seek to constitute the ANF before the treaty was actually signed.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Review ofPublicExpenditure(previous reference:CC (65) 39thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet resumed its consideration of the Report of theGroup of Ministers on the public expenditure programmes up to1969-70 (C (65) 101).Overseas and the  Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since the previous discussion on the overseas aid programme he had considered indetail the programmes involved in relation to 1966-67. Absolutecommitments for that year now totalled  198 million. It was clearthat additional commitments would have to be incurred in the lightof existing policies, including additional aid to India, Pakistan, EastAfrica and Malawi and for technical assistance projects. On theother hand, he was not satisfied that it was necessary to enter intoadditional commitments as large as the  73 million suggested bythe Minister of Overseas Development. For example, it should bepossible to reduce the amount envisaged for budgetary aid to Malawiin view of our own difficult situation, and other expenditure, suchCC 43 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
as aid to Thailand, seemed unjustified in present circumstances. after a careful examination, project by project, it appeared that additional commitments totalling  49 million were probably inescapable. Thiswould lead to a total commitment figure for 1966-67 of  247 million.But it would be reasonable to assume that  30 million of this wouldnot be drawn on because of under-spendings. On the other hand,there would undoubtedly be unforeseen demands, e.g., for ceylon and Ghana. It would therefore be reasonable to fix a ceiling of 225 million for actual expenditure in 1966-67 even though this was slightly above the basic programme. In subsequent years the minister would have much more freedom to reshape her programme as existing policy commitments ran out. It would therefore be reasonable to hold the expenditure figure at  225 million in subsequent years up to 1970. This would be a sustainable and viableprogramme, which must cover unforeseen contingencies.It was not possible in view of all the uncertainties to produce any firm figure of the cost in foreign exchange which would be involved. Allowing for the differences of interpretation by departments, it could be estimated that the increase of  60 million in aid since 1964-65 would lead to an additional burden on thebalance of payments of between  20 and  30 million in 1966-67.There was much wider disagreement about the foreign exchange cost in 1969-70.The Minister of Overseas Development said that the figure she had proposed of  250 million represented no more than the continuation of existing policies. Any reduction in this figure wouldhave serious effects on our relations with Colonial, commonwealth and foreign countries. It would, for example, be impossible to reducethe figure for budgetary aid to Malawi without grave consequences.Technical assistance was already running at the rate of over 32 million in 1965-66 and the increase of  5 million provided in her programme for 1966-67 was very modest in the light of thedecision already taken to expand it. Although she appreciated the effort by the Chancellor to meet the difficulties she had described atthe previous meeting, even a figure of  225 million would have themost serious consequences.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In view of the extremely difficult economic situation facing the country it was a wrong use of our resources to increase the levelof aid beyond the 1965-66 figure. We should, in fact, be borrowingadditional money abroad in order to finance the aid.(b) It might be represented that we had made cuts in investment and postponed urgently needed social measures at home in order toincrease the aid programme and if other expenditure programmeshad been examined in detail project by project this would have demonstrated equally strong cases for raising the allocations.(c) On the other hand it could be argued that the basic programme for overseas aid was not adequate, at least in 1966-67,to allow for the orderly development of existing policy; and that a
figure of  225 million would in fact represent a more severe reductionthan that which had been made in other programmes. If theprogramme were fixed as low as  216 million in 1966-67 the cabinet would inevitably have to consider one by one a series of proposalsfor assistance which could not be met out of the programme but where the consequences of refusal would be seriously damaging toour interests overseas. The case of Ceylon, which was forconsideration later on the agenda, illustrated the problem.In further discussion the Chief Secretary, Treasury, said thatthere was a further special factor affecting the aid programme. Sincethe commitments were made in money terms there was no provisionfor increasing them if prices rose. They were therefore subject to areduction in real value when inflation occurred whereas other programmes were protected against this.The Prime Minister said that this had not been previouslyapparent to Ministers and it would be desirable for the Group ofMinisters under the Chancellor of the Exchequer to meet again toconsider the aid programme in the light of this factor and of theviews now put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on theinescapable nature of a substantial part of the programme. TheMinistry of Overseas Development and the Treasury should agree allthe figures, including the consequences of restricting the 1966-67expenditure to any particular figure and a paper should then be circulated setting out the position. In the light of this further reportthe Cabinet would be able to take a final decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary. Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Overseas Development, to circulate a paper on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theGroup of Ministers concerned with the review of public expenditure up to 1969-70 to review the programme of overseas aid in the light of the discussion.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of the overseas aid programme at a subsequent meeting.Social security the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 108) on social security benefits andthe income guarantee.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the cabinet had already taken a decision to postpone the introduction of theincome guarantee and to proceed with wage related and short-term benefits. They had therefore in fact already adopted Course A setout in the memorandum. This could be financed within the limitsrecommended in C,(65) 101.
The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that thereport on her Departments enquiry into the resources of old people would show that there was a substantial number entitled to national assistance but not claiming it. This would add to criticism of thedecision already taken to defer the income guarantee. Such criticismmight be largely disarmed if it could be announced that national assistance was being remodelled and a Ministry of Social Securityset up to administer it. Some of the administrative improvementsenvisaged for the income guarantee could be incorporated and perhaps some preferential rates could be given, e.g., for the old. she had circulated proposals on these lines to the Group of ministers who had considered policy on social security and they had receivedgeneral support.In discussion it was suggested that a decision to reform national assistance, so as to present it as a substitute for the income guarantee,should not be taken until the possibility of working out a more attractive scheme of income guarantee, more akin to income tax inreverse, had been fully explored. There was now time to do this. Onthe other hand it had to be recognised that very thoroughconsideration had already been given to the form of the present scheme and that it was unlikely that anything substantially bettercould be devised.In further discussion there was general support in principle forthe ideas put forward by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance but it was the general view that it would be unwise tomake a final decision until specific proposals had been considered.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet supported in principle the idea of remodellingNational Assistance on the lines proposed, but did not wish to be committed to a decision until they could consider a detailed scheme.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance should thereforeprepare, urgently, proposals for remodelling the administration ofthe present National Assistance scheme as far as possible on thelines envisaged for the income guarantee. These would then beconsidered by the Social Services Committee and thereafter theCabinet could decide whether to adopt them or to proceed at a later date with the present income guarantee scheme.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance to circulate to the Social Services Committee a detailed scheme for the remodelling of National Assistance, inaccordance with the Prime Ministers summing up.housing the Minister of Housing and Local Government said that duringthe previous discussion on housing he had entered a reservation tothe recommendation in paragraph 53 (c) of C (65) 101 that thereshould be no additional expenditure on public sector housing in1966-67 and that the provision of local authority houses in England
Earnings-related short-term benefits(previous reference:CC (65) 38thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C (65) 112) on proposals forearnings-related short-term benefits.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that ifearnings-related short-term benefits were to be introduced in October1966 it was necessary to take decisions now on the general shape ofthe scheme so that the necessary consultations with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC), the Confederation of British Industries (CBI) and cc 43 (65)and Wales should be held in 1966 at the same level as 1965. He stillconsidered that if, as seemed probable, there was a substantial fallin private sector house building in 1966, the public sector should beincreased. This would, however, involve capital expenditureadditional to the amount recommended in C (65) 101.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted thedesirability of maintaining a reasonable level of output of housesbut it must be recognised that an increase in the public sector abovethe limits set out in C (65) 101 could raise public expenditure abovethe 4^ per cent limit. He must therefore reserve the right to re-opendiscussion on this matter.The Prime Minister said that it had been the general view ofthe Cabinet that the total housing programme should be kept at approximately its present level, any substantial fall in private housebuilding being offset by an increase in the public sector. It was not,however, necessary at this stage to take any specific decision. TheMinistry of Housing and Local Government should keep the matter under review.With the exception of the overseas aid programme the cabinet had now concluded its examination of the public expenditure programmes. For the other programmes the Cabinet had acceptedthe recommendations made in paragraph 55 of C (65) 101. Thedecisions on future programmes would be reviewed each year sothat they would continue to cover a five-year period. Departmentalestimates for 1966-67, other than those for overseas aid, should bedrawn up on the basis of the allocation in C (65) 101 after allowing for any savings which might arise as a result of the postponement ofcapital investment in the public sector which had now been announced. The extent of these savings would depend on the time at which the postponed projects were brought back into theprogramme.The Cabinet (5) Approved the Expenditure Programmes as set out inparagraph 55 of C (65) 101, other than that for overseas aid.
other bodies, and the drafting of legislation, might proceed. It wouldbe necessary to pass a Bill before March 1966 if the administrativepreparations were to be completed in time.The scope of the graduated benefit which could be offered in an interim scheme, in advance of the general review of national insurance as a whole, was limited by the present provisions fordependancy and family allowances which already led to over-compensation of the low wage-earner with a large family in relationto his normal earnings. Nevertheless her proposals would offer the single man, with earnings up to  30 a week, sickness and unemployment benefit of about half of his take-home pay, and about90 per cent of all male workers had earnings within this level. married men with children would, in the lower ranges earnings, get up to90 per cent of their take-home pay. It would, however, be necessaryto impose a ceiling on graduated benefit at this level. Graduatedbenefit would be paid for a maximum period of six months; for practical reasons, it would have to be related to earnings in theprevious tax year and no allowance could be made, at least initially,for loss of earnings due to sickness and unemployment; nor couldit be put into payment for the first 12 days. The scheme would be financed by a small addition to the graduated contribution chargeable to weekly earnings up to  30. It would, however, be necessary tomake a change in the arrangements for those contracted out of the graduated pensions scheme who at present paid no graduated contributions: they would be brought into the graduated pensions scheme like everyone else but would pay a lower flat rate contribution and receive a lower pension, the amount of the abatement beingrelated to the occupational pension entitlement by virtue of whichthey were contracted out. The change would have certain other advantages in easing the disproportionate weight of the existingcontribution on the lower paid contracted out worker and inenabling the contracted out to qualify for the graduated widow&apos;pension. The change would also yield some increase in contributionrevenue which would enable a small reduction to be made in thegeneral level of the flat rate contribution. Decisions were also required on two aspects of these proposals which were in dispute:(i) whether earnings-related widow&apos;s  allowance should beincluded in the scheme at an additional cost of  7 million a year, for which there was a strong social case;(ii) whether earnings-related supplements should be paid on top of industrial injury benefit at an additional cost of 31 million a year. The alternative was to allow theindustrially injured to claim earnings-related sickness benefit where this would give them more than the present industrial injuries benefit, but the TUC was unlikely tofind acceptable any diminution of the present differentialof  2 15s. between the sickness benefit and industrial injury rates.In discussion, concern was expressed at the proposal to bring intothe graduated scheme those who had contracted out, in view of the
strong public criticism which had been made of that scheme. the tuc was also likely to object and should be consulted before a finaldecision was taken. Although the lower wage earner would benefit,the higher wage earner who was contracted out would pay a highercontribution. On the other hand it could be argued that the change was paving the way for the general reform of the pensions provisions which would ensure a better return on the graduated contribution by accelerating the maturity of the pension. It was also argued thatfinal decisions should not be taken before there had been consultationwith the local authorities, and similar bodies with occupational pension schemes, on the effect which the proposed changes wouldhave on their schemes and arrangements for contracting out.In further discussion of the proposals for an earnings-relatedsupplement to widow&apos;s allowance and industrial injuries benefit, itwas pointed out that these additions would bring the cost of thescheme to  59 million a year of which only  14 million would beattributable to the introduction of earnings-related unemploymentbenefit which was the reason for introducing the scheme next year.While, with the deferment of the income guarantee, these additionswould not of themselves lead to an excess of expenditure on theMinistry&apos;s basic and additional programmes, there might be other and more desirable developments for which provision should bemade and the Social Services Sub-Committee might be asked toreport on priorities. On the other hand, at least in respect of industrial injuries, there was little prospect of anything less than the Ministersproposal being acceptable to the TUC.Summing up the discussion, the First Secretary of State saidthat the Cabinet had already decided that a scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits should be brought into force as soon aspossible. The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance was seeking authority to consult with the TUC, the CBI and other bodieson the basis of the proposals she had put to the Cabinet. such consultation was essential before final decisions could be taken bythe Cabinet on the main features of the scheme. The Minister should include in the public bodies to be consulted those with substantialoccupational schemes, including the local authorities. As regards theMinister^ proposals for widow&apos;s allowance and industrial injurybenefit, the former should be remitted to the Sub-Committee of theSocial Services Committee for further consideration of the prioritywhich should be accorded to it: the latter should be included amongthe proposals to be discussed with the TUC and other bodies concerned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, inthe light of the points made in discussion, to open discussions with the Trades Union Congress, the confederation of British Industries and other bodies on
the basis of her proposals in C (65) 112, including theaddition of an earnings-related supplement to industrial injuries benefit.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Sub-Committee on Cash Benefits of the social services Committee to consider the priority which shouldbe accorded to earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance.(3) Agreed to resume discussion of the Ministers proposals inthe light of her consultations in accordance with conclusion (1).5. The Commonwealth Secretary said that Ceylon&apos;srequirement of aid during the balance of 1965, if economic collapsewere to be avoided, had been assessed by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (IBRD) at $50 million. With ourencouragement the IBRD had arranged a meeting of potential donorcountries in Washington, which was currently taking place. Therewere large United Kingdom economic interests at stake: remittancesof profits and dividends of about il\ million a year, exports of 24 million a year and a capital investment of  100 million. If exportsof tea from Ceylon were reduced as a result of internal disturbances,the price would rise, with damage to our balance of payments. Inview of our past connection with Ceylon and the present degree ofour economic involvement, we should be expected to take the leadin any rescue operation and if we did not offer a contribution, themeeting would fail. We should therefore make a mimimum offer of$10 million and be prepared to go up to a maximum of $17 million to achieve the target of $50 million. This sum would, of course, haveto be met out of any aid allocation that might eventually be approvedby the Cabinet.In discussion the view was expressed that it would be wrong to anticipate any conclusions the Cabinet might reach at a subsequent meeting about the total level of the aid programme and that theproposed commitment of aid to Ceylon at the present time couldnot fail to prejudice them. More time was required for the Cabinetto consider the political and economic issues involved.In further discussion, the Minister of Overseas Development saidthat in view of the crucial nature of the current discussions and theneed to take an immediate decision, she proposed that we should offer to provide $10 million for the current year out of her existingfunds. This would be a confidential assurance to the IBRD with no public statement at this stage, and there would be no commitment atthe present time to our making any contribution for the succeedingyear. This sum could only be found by securing a postponement ofa number of drawings on existing commitments, mostly to foreigncountries. The Minister said however that this would not prejudicefirm commitments to the Colonies already entered into for thecurrent year.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th July, 1965.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal by the Minister of overseas development.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Overseas Development, to instruct theUnited Kingdom representatives at the IBRD meeting in the sense of Conclusion (1).
