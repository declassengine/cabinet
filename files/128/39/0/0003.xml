SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:C.C. (64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister said that it had become necessary tosend to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith,on the evening of Sunday, 25th October, a statement warning him ofthe consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence. since mr. Smith had not been prepared to give an undertaking that hisGovernment were not contemplating a unilateral declaration, it hadbeen decided to publish the statement on the morning of 27th October,in order that the people of Southern Rhodesia might be fully seizedof the consequences of unconstitutional action before a critical debate on the issue of independence started in the Legislature of SouthernRhodesia later that day. Meanwhile, the Ministers immediately concerned had reviewed the measures which we might be compelledto take if, despite the warning conveyed in our published statement,the Government of Southern Rhodesia made a unilateral declarationof independence.In discussion it was suggested that if, in the event, the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia were prepared to revert to constitutionalmethods of conducting their affairs and to contemplate making an advance towards majority rule, we might consider providing themwith additional economic aid as an inducement to maintain this attitude. Such assistance might comprise aid both for education andfor the training of Africans in administration.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Ministers statement about SouthernRhodesia.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to consider whether additionaleconomic aid might be offered to the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia, if they proved willing to revert to constitutional methods of conducting their affairs.3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (64) 7) about proposals involving public expenditure and by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (64) 8)about an increase in social security benefits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the natural expansionof the revenue in 1965-66 would be fully absorbed by the increased expenditure resulting from the programmes which the Governmenthad inherited from their predecessors. It would be necessary, inaddition, to take account of the increased pressure on prices which5375-3Oversea 1.

was likely to result from the economic measures announced earlier inthe week. It would not be possible, therefore, to endorse all theproposals for new expenditure in 1965-66 which Ministers had now submitted. Two specific questions, however, arose for immediate decision in relation to The Queen&apos;s Speech, namely, the size of theincrease to be made in National Insurance benefits and the proposalto abolish prescription charges under the National Health Service.In considering these two issues the Cabinet would also need to bearin mind other proposals for additional expenditure which were summarised in the Annex to C. (64) 7.An increase in National Insurance benefits should admittedlybe a first call on the Governments resources. Nevertheless, theincrease of 12s. 6d. proposed by the Minister of Pensions was excessivein view of the other demands which would be made upon the revenue.An increase of 10s.. with effect from April 1965, would keep benefits in line with the expected growth in average earnings between thatdate and the earlier increase in May 1963; and it could be coupled with the abolition of the widows&apos; earnings rule, an increase to 30s. inthe award to the &quot; 10s. widow &quot; and an increase of 10s. in national assistance rates. While the Governments commitment to removeprescription charges should also be given a high priority, it would be preferable that it should not be implemented in the first Session ofthe new Parliament. But the proposed expenditure of  18 million toprovide for the transfer of the liability in respect of old peopledhomes from the local authorities to the Exchequer might be accepted.The Minister of Pensions said that the estimated increase in thecost of living by next April, compared with the date of the last increasein benefits, would justify an addition of about 5s. to the standard rateof benefit. Recent increases in pension rates, however, had been madeby reference to the rise in average earnings; and this would justify an addition of nearly 10s. to the standard benefit. An increase confined to this figure would therefore represent the minimum improvementwhich the Government could reasonably make. But the Labour Party,when in Opposition, had strongly criticised the amount of the increaseawarded in 1963; yet it had been three times the figure justified bythe increase in the Retail Prices Index and twice the amount requiredby the increase in average earnings. An increase of 12s. 6d., as sheproposed, would not only safeguard the Government from the criticism that they were offering pensioners no more than theConservative Administration had provided but would also ensure a sufficiently long interval, before a further increase was required, toenable the Governments plans for a radical reconstruction of social security benefits to be thoroughly prepared. For these reasons therate of benefit for a single person should be increased to  4 and fora married couple to  6 10s. a week. The cost to the Exchequer wouldbe  110 million, not  126 million as was suggested in C. (64) 7.The Minister of Health said that the Governments attitude, tothe National Health Service would be regarded as the touch-stoneof their attitude to the social services as a whole. It would have been preferable to abolish all charges under the Service. But, if this wasnot possible on financial grounds, it would be essential to proceed at least with the complete abolition of prescription charges, whichhad been promised in the Labour Party Election Manifesto and wasconfidently expected by public opinion. This step would make no additional call upon national resources and would not necessarilyrequire legislation.In discussion there was considerable support for the higher rateof increase in benefits proposed by the Minister of Pensions. A newbasic rate of  4 would have a more dramatic impact on public opinionthan a figure of  3 17s. 6d. Moreover, the increased benefits wouldbe enjoyed by a large number of people, since they would apply notonly to the old but also to the sick and the unemployed. It. shouldnot be assumed that the remedy for inflationary pressure must
necessarily lie wholly in curtailing expenditure in the public sector;the private sector also should make its contribution to a reductionin the pressure on resources, for example, by the curtailment ordiminution of unnecessary office building. In addition, the revenue would be fortified by the receipts from the new import charges.On the other hand it would be unwise to decide the amount of theincrease in benefits by reference to the standards established by theprevious Administration rather than in the light of the circumstancesnow facing the Government. There could be no certainty that it wouldbe possible to hold Government expenditure within the limits of thepresent estimates or that the balance of the economy would be suffiently redressed by the measures which had already been taken.In these circumstances an increase of 10s. in the basic rate of benefit,which was considerably greater than the relevant increase in the retail Prices Index and was in line with the increase in the average level of earnings, could not be regarded as ungenerous.In further discussion considerable support was expressed for thecomplete abolition of prescription charges. Alternative measures, suchas a reduction in the charge from 2s. to Is. or the extension of the2s. charge to comprise the prescription form as a whole rather thaneach of its items separately, would not yield sufficient savings to offset the criticism to which the Government would be exposed if they failedto honour their commitment to abolish the charge in its entirety. Theexpenditure of  22 million which would be entailed by complete abolition could be absorbed if action was deferred to give effect tothe proposal to transfer the liability in respect of old people&apos;s homesfrom the local authorities to the Exchequer.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion appeared to be in favour of an increase of 12s. 6d.in the basic rate of National Insurance benefit and the complete abolition of prescription charges. It would be very desirable that theincrease in the rate of benefit should take effect, even if only partially,before the winter.The Cabinet Agreed that (1) National Insurance benefits should be increased by 12s. 6d.with effect from April 1965, at the latest, but at an earlier date, if possible.(2) The abolition of prescription charges under the national health Service should be announced in The Queen&apos;sSpeech.(3) The transfer of expenditure in respect of old people&apos;s homesfrom the local authorities to the Exchequer should be deferred until a later date.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1964.
