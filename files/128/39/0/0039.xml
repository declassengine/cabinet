CC 23 (65)immunities 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theand Privileges Commonwealth Secretary (C (65) 55), discussing the scale offor the . . . ....Commonwealth immunities and privileges to be accorded to the CommonwealthSecretariat       Secretariat.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in the preliminary discussions about the Commonwealth Secretariat, the representativesof all Commonwealth countries other than the United Kingdom had pressed strongly that full diplomatic immunities and privileges shouldbe accorded to all senior staff of the Secretariat recruited from elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Our representative had maintained that the United Kingdom Government would have great difficulty injustifying to Parliament a concession on this scale; but, in view ofthe strength of Commonwealth feeling on this issue, he had had toundertake that the question would be re-examined. The Home AffairsCommittee, which had subsequently considered the matter in detail,had felt that it could not be maintained that the staff of the secretariat would need, in order to fulfil their functions effectively,to enjoy more favourable immunities and privileges than the staffof other international organisations and that the grant of fulldiplomatic immunities and privileges in this case would therefore be inconsistent with the policy which we were seeking to promote inrelation to international organisations in general. For this reason theyhad, on balance, recommended that this concession should not bemade. On the other hand it could be argued that the Secretariatrepresented a special case; that, if we granted its staff preferential-treatment, this should not, therefore, provoke embarrassingrepercussions elsewhere; that we ought, in any event, to be preparedto treat a Commonwealth organisation more favourably than aninternational organisation; and that any failure to accommodate thefeeling of the rest of the Commonwealth on this point would beregarded as indicating lack of enthusiasm on our part for the concept of the Secretariat itself. In these circumstances we should endeavourto find some compromise solution; and this might best take theform of an arrangement whereby senior staff of the Secretariatrecruited from overseas would be allowed to obtain from the secretariat reasonable quantities of duty-free liquor and tobacco forrepresentational purposes and would be granted refund of petrolduty from the Vote of the Commonwealth Relations Office. Sucha concession would fall short of the scale of privileges and immunitiesfor which the other members of the Commonwealth were asking,since it would exclude personal immunity and would not grant fullcontinuing Customs privileges. On the other hand it would representa genuine endeavour on our part to meet the wishes of the rest ofthe Commonwealth.In discussion considerable doubt was expressed about the wisdom of the proposed compromise. It would be bound to attractconsiderable criticism in Parliament; it could not be justified on thegrounds that it was required if the Secretariat was to discharge its functions efficiently; and it would constitute a damaging precedent.
On the other hand, if we made no concession to the views ofother members of the Commonwealth, we should appear to be seeking to frustrate the Secretariat. Moreover, if we withheld thestraightforward concession now envisaged, the other commonwealth governments might still seek to achieve their objective by arrangingthat the personnel whom they contributed to the Secretariat shouldinitially be appointed to their High Commissions in London, wherethey would secure diplomatic privileges and immunities, and should thereafter be seconded to the Secretariat; and, if this practice were adopted by other international organisations located in London, theefforts which we were currently making to restrict the grant of diplomatic privileges and immunities to a more realistic level wouldbe liable to be increasingly frustrated. For these reasons it might be preferable to concede the full scale of diplomatic immunities and privileges from the outset and to justify this arrangement by referenceto the unique character of the Commonwealth Secretariat. But, in sofar as full diplomatic status would confer personal immunity on thestaff in question, it would be likely to attract particularly sharpcriticism from Parliament, which was showing increasing concern about the number of individuals in London who could now claimdiplomatic immunity in respect of e.g., traffic accidents.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the considerations were nicely balanced but that furtherconsideration should be given to the desirability of conceding, in thisunique case, the full Scale of diplomatic immunities and privileges.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, to arrange forthe Committee to give further consideration, in the lightof their discussion, to the scale of immunities and privilegesto be accorded to the Commonwealth Secretariat.The 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorCommTsdonCT of the Duchy of Lancaster *c (65) 50) about the establishment of a parliamentary Commissioner for administration.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theproposals in C (65) 50 had been prepared by a Committee ofMinisters under his chairmanship and were designed to secure that private persons did not suffer injustice as a result of faultyadministration on the part of the central Government. Since thiswas one of the functions of a Member of Parliament, it was proposedthat the Parliamentary Commissioner should be regarded as anadditional instrument which Members could use for this purpose.Like the Comptroller and Auditor-General, he would be appointedby Letters Patent, would be paid from the Consolidated Fund andwould be immune from dismissal except on a Motion of Parliament.He would make regular reports to Parliament, which would probablyestablish a Select Committee to consider them. He would act only
at the instance of a Member of Parliament upon a complaint of personal injustice suffered by the complainant. He would be concerned with faults in administration and would not be entitledto substitute his discretion for that of a Minister or to criticise policy.It had not been found possible to define the type of case with whichhe should be concerned in terms of particular manifestations of faultyadministration; and much would necessarily depend on his exerciseof his discretion. But certain issues would be explicitly excluded fromhis scope, including, among others, questions within the competence of the courts or of independent tribunals, matters concerningoversea relations and the administration of Colonial territories, thecommercial relationships of Departments and the employment of Crown servants in the widest sense.The Committee had thought it desirable that the commissioner should be seen as a Parliamentary, not a public, institution in orderthat his functions should not derogate from those of Members ofParliament or weaken the ties of Members with their constituencies.But this conclusion raised the further questions whether it shouldbe open to Members of the House of Lords to refer complaints tothe Commissioner and whether his reports should be received by a select Committee of both Houses. On these points the Committeehad not reached any conclusions. On the one hand Peers were notrepresentative in the same sense as Members of the House ofCommons. On the other hand Members of Parliament could not be excluded from referring complaints submitted to them by personswho were not their constituents but either had no constituency or were reluctant to approach their own Members; but, if Members ofthe House of Commons were not to be so limited, the case forexcluding Peers from access to the Commissioner was weakened.Moreover, Peers already addressed questions to Ministers aboutindividual cases; and they would be at a disadvantage if they couldnot pursue these enquiries by a reference to the Commissioner.As regards the composition of the Select Committee, there mightbe some embarrassment if Ministers who sat in the House of Lordswere summoned before a Select Committee of the House of commons and were subject to strictures which could be answered effectivelyonly in that House. There might be some difficulty, however, in securing an appropriate balance between the two Houses in a joint select Committee.The Committee had also left for consideration by the Cabinetthe questions whether the Commissioner should have access to cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers and conclusions and whetherthe Cabinet Office itself should be outside his purview. They inclined to the view that it might be better that the Government should allow the Commissioner a limited degree of access, confined to those cases in which he could demonstrate that it was necessary for the purpose ofhis enquiries, than that they should be faced with the embarrassmentof a report by the Commissioner that he was unable to concludecertain inquiries because he had been denied access to relevant
material. In any event, however, they considered that the cabinet office itself should be excluded from the scope of the Commissioner^inquiries.Access to the Parliamentary commissioner in discussion it was suggested that there would be liable to becriticism, both of the Government and of the House of Commons,if the private citizen, having failed to secure redress through hisMember of Parliament, were precluded from submitting hiscomplaint direct to the Parliamentary Commissioner. Morever, theburden on individual Members of Parliament, who would not be able in this context to refuse to deal with complaints from outside theirown constituencies, would become intolerable unless they wereprepared to refer complaints to the Parliamentary Commissionerwithout first making their own inquiries. To confine the right of access to the Commissioner to Members of Parliament would be themore undesirable if the restriction served to justify according thesame privilege to Peers, both because Peers might be put in a positionto complain that a Member of the House of Commons had notinvestigated a complaint adequately and because the right of access to the Commissioner would enhance the status and authority of theHouse of Lords. On the other hand, if the Commissioner was regarded as an instrument of Parliament (as was necessary bothin order to maintain the position of the individual Member ofParliament and to reduce the volume of work falling on theCommissioner), that instrument should be available to the second chamber so long as a bicameral Parliament was retained. Moreover,the House of Lords had its own role in securing the redress ofgrievances. Peers were accustomed to submitting complaints to ministers on behalf of individual members of the public; and, if theywere deprived of access to the Commissioner, their position wouldbe unjustifiably weakened in comparison with that of Members ofthe House of Commons.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that on balance the Cabinet were of the opinion that,as a means both of maintaining the standing of Parliament and of reducing the number of complaints reaching the parliamentary commissioner, it was necessary that access to him should be confined to Members of Parliament. Neither of these purposes, however, made it necessary to extend this right of access to Members of the Houseof Lords; there were sufficient- reasons for not doing so and,therefore, for confining the proposed Select Committee to Membersof the House of Commons. It would have to be accepted, however,that the citizen could not be expected to obtain access to theCommissioner only through his own Member of Parliament.Cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers in further discussion it was suggested that, if the Commissionerwere permitted to have limited access to Cabinet papers at the discretion of the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister would be exposed to Questions in the House of Commons about his reasons
for refusing access in a particular case. This might be embarrassing;and, since access could clearly not be unrestricted, the better course,and the course more consonant with the dignity of the Cabinet,appeared to be to refuse access in any circumstances. Where a matter which the Commissioner was investigating had been the subject ofa collective decision and an individual Minister had been responsiblefor executing that decision, the Commissioner^ inquiries should not extend beyond the discharge of this departmental responsibility. Thematter might appear to be more debatable where more than oneMinister had been involved and faults in administration might have resulted from defective co-ordination; but, here too, it would bedesirable that the Commissioners inquiries should be addressed tothe Department with the primary responsibility.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that it was agreed that the parliamentary commissioner should not be given access to Cabinet or CabinetCommittee documents. It followed that the Cabinet Office itself should be outside his purview.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The exclusion of local authorities and the nationalised industries from investigation by the Commissioner might be regardedas precluding inquiry into the large majority of instances of injusticesuffered by private individuals. To exclude nationalised industries inparticular might be thought to have political implications; and itwould be the more unfortunate in that these industries were not subject to the degree of Parliamentary control which could beexercised in relation to Government Departments. On the other hand the Committee&apos;s recommendation that the nationalised industries should be excluded from the Commissioner^ scope had been basedon the view that it would be inappropriate that the commissioner should concern himself with relationships between consumers andsuppliers which, in the case of the nationalised industries, were amatter for Consumer Councils or that the nationalised industries should be subjected to a form of scrutiny not applied to their competitors in the private sector. In addition, if the Commissionerwere empowered to investigate complaints against local authorities,he would be required to shoulder a greater burden than he could beexpected to carry, at least at the outset. It was proposed, however,that the legislation should be so drafted as to enable theCommissioner^ scope to be extended by Order, subject to affirmative Resolution.(b) It would be desirable that posts abroad should be excludedfrom the Commissioners investigations, since it might not be possiblefor him to inquire into their alleged defects v/ithout trespassingon the field of relations with oversea Governments, which werespecifically excluded from his scope. Moreover, the defects themselvesmight be attributable to some extent to the policies of theGovernments of the countries in question, which we were not in a
position to influence. Finally, it would be administratively difficult for the Commissioner to investigate complaints arising abroad.(c) No opportunity for the legislation to establish theCommissioner was likely to occur in the current Session. But itwould be desirable to publish a White Paper, setting out theGovernments proposals, after the projected White Papers on Land,Steel, etc., perhaps in July. Legislation would then be considered for inclusion in the programme for the following Session.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (65) 50, subject to the points made in their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the draft of a White Paper about the parliamentary commissioner to be submitted to them in due course.Space PolicyEuropeanLauncherDevelopmentOrganisation(previous reference:CC(65) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of United Kingdomparticipation in the European Launcher Development Organisation(ELDO).The First Secretary of State recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had questioned the desirability of ouraccepting a commitment to participate in the development of a more advanced launcher (ELDO-B). In view of the report that the FrenchGovernment might adopt a more flexible attitude towards the futureprogramme of the Organisation, the Prime Minister had hoped that,during his subsequent visit to Paris, he might be able to clarify their intentions. In the event, a suitable opportunity for this purpose hadnot arisen; but the attitude which our delegation should adopt at theforthcoming conference of the Organisation must be considered inthe light of the understanding which the Prime Minister had reached with the French President for a general intensification of anglo-French technological co-operation. In these circumstances weshould not adopt too negative an attitude towards ELDO; and itmight be best, therefore, that our delegation should agree in principle to continue to participate in the work of the Organisation until theend of 1965, during which period there should be a stringent reviewof the cost of the programme, which should then be further considered.In discussion it was suggested that it would be impracticable forour delegation to sustain this position. The conference would have before it the report of a Working Group, which recommended a compromise programme involving the development of a two-stagelauncher; and this proposal would either have to be accepted inprinciple or be rejected. It might be to our advantage to accept it,since it would be undesirable to leave future developments in this field to virtual monopoly by the United States. Moreover, the newunderstanding with the French Government about technological
co-operation between France and the United Kingdom strengthenedthe political arguments in favour of our continued participation inELDO; and these arguments were further reinforced by the fact that,since the previous Cabinet discussion, the French Government had themselves agreed to accept the report of the Working Group. If,therefore, we now rejected it, we should find ourselves isolated atthe conference; and our political standing in Europe would befurther damaged. In agreeing to participate in principle, however, weshould argue strongly for a limitation of the total cost of theprogramme and for a reduction of our share of the expenditure.On the other hand there was no scientific or economic advantage in continued participation in the programme, which would, indeed,represent a wholly uneconomic use of scarce technological resources,Moreover, the expenditure involved was not only substantial alreadybut was likely, on the basis of our previous experience, to increasewell beyond the present estimate. Finally, the recent discussions between representatives of the French Defence Department and theDefence Research Committee&apos;s Sub-Committee on Space, under thechairmanship of Professor Bondi, had established that the FrenchGovernment had little genuine enthusiasm for the ELDO programme and might prefer bilateral co-operation with the United Kingdom.This suggested that their attitude might well be dictated more by areluctance to incur the odium of bringing the Organisation to an endthan by a genuine desire to maintain its work.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the balance of advantage appeared to lie in accepting in principle the report of the Working Group for the continuation of the ELDOprogramme on lines directed to the development of an ELDO-Blauncher. But this should be on the understanding that we shouldnot at this stage accept any commitment as regards either the totalexpenditure to be incurred in relation to this project or our ownshare of that expenditure. In the meantime, there would be anopportunity to give further consideration to the financial and technological implications of continued participation in the ELDOprogramme; and we should also initiate confidential discussions withthe French Government in order to ascertain whether they would beprepared to consider alternative forms of technological co-operation which would be more economic than the continuation of ELDO.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom delegation at theforthcoming Conference of the European launcher development Organisation should be instructed topresent the United Kingdom case on the lines indicated by the First Secretary of State in his summing up of thediscussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theMinister of Technology, the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs  and  other  Ministers  concerned,  to  initiate
confidential discussions with the French Government inorder to ascertain whether they would be prepared toconsider alternative forms of technological co-operationwith the United Kingdom which would be more economicthan the programme of the Organisation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th April, 1965.
