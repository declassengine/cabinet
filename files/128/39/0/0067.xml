Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 50thConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Prime Minister(C (65) 131), to which was attached a record of the discussions whichhe had recently held with the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, Mr. IanSmith.The Prime Minister said that Mr. Smith had now returned to rhodesia after discussions which had been completely frank on bothsides and had fully revealed the extent of the differences of principle which still separated the two Governments. United kingdom ministers had made no concessions to Mr. Smith; but they had indicated to him several alternative courses of action which wouldenable the Rhodesian Government to escape from the presentdeadlock if they were prepared to compromise on their rigid stand.Moreover, as a result of approaches by our Embassies and HighCommissions overseas many other Governments had sent messages to Mr. Smith, warning him of the dangers of a unilateral declarationof independence (u.d.i.). In particular, the United States Government,both in messages to Mr. Smith and in a statement by their representative at the United Nations, had given a stern warning ofthe likely consequences of such action.In the United Kingdom itself Mr. Smith&apos;s appearances on television had initially had a favourable impact on public opinion and had momentarily succeeded in creating the impression that theUnited Kingdom Government were insisting on immediate majority rule in Rhodesia. But this was not so; and there now appeared tobe a more informed appreciation of the real issues at stake, togetherwith wide general support for the Governments policy. Our proposal that a Commonwealth Mission, consisting of a number of commonwealth Prime Ministers under the chairmanship of thePrime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies, should visitRhodesia in a mediatory capacity had placed Mr. Smith in a newdilemma in as much as, if he refused to receive it, he would forfeitany remaining sympathy in the United Kingdom and in othercountries. Even the Governments of South Africa and Portugal now appeared to be counselling caution. The longer a u.d.i. was postponed,the greater the chance that in fact it would never be made.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, while the situation was still evenly balanced, it appeared that the outcome of the recent discussions, together with the pressure brought to bear on Mr. Smithby world opinion, had at least postponed a u.d.i. and to that extentcould be regarded as a success. As regards the projectedCommonwealth Mission, Sir Robert Menzies was prepared to acceptthe chairmanship if this were acceptable to Mr. Smith and to african opinion. But there could be no question of a Mission consisting only of representatives of the older Commonwealth countries. Africanrepresentation was essential; nor would anything else be acceptable to Sir Robert Menzies himself. President Kaunda of Zambia had declined to serve on the understandable ground that his country was too intimately concerned with the problem. The Prime Ministerof Uganda, Dr. Obbte, had accepted membership, while the Prime
Ministers of Nigeria and Ceylon were still considering our invitation.Other influences were also being brought to bear on Rhodesianopinion. In particular, a mission of leading industrial and financial interests in the United Kingdom was leaving that day for rhodesia and would seek to persuade the European population of the dangers of a u.d.i. in relation to business confidence and the prospects of future investment in Rhodesia.Discussion showed full agreement with the policy which hadbeen pursued. The following main points were made:(a) There was as yet no indication of any effective politicalopposition to Mr. Smith&apos;s Party by other leading political figures in Rhodesia. But a postponement of a udi and a growing realisation of its consequences might lead in due course to a change in this situation.(b) There had been no further drawing down of Rhodesiansterling balances after certain recent transactions; and there was as yet no indication of any renewed calls upon them.(c) The Prime Ministers broadcast earlier in the week had hada very favourable effect on international opinion, particularly asregards African sentiment.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesituation was still extremely delicate. The United Kingdom andRhodesian Governments had failed to agree; but the latter had notyet committed themselves to any illegal action and relations had not,therefore, been finally broken off. In these circumstances it wasimperative that we should refrain from any public action or statement which could be regarded as provocative. Ministers should thereforeabstain as far as possible from any public reference to the Rhodesianproblem in the immediate future: and, in so far as they found itnecessary to mention it, they should agree the text of their remarkswith the Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statements about Rhodesiaby the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Secretary.LocalGovernmentFinanceRates Rebatesand Rates by instalments(previous reference:CC (65) 45thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (65) 132) by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, proposing that a short Bill should be introducedearly in the 1965-66 Session to provide a measure of relief toratepayers with low incomes and also to provide for the payment ofrates by instalments.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thepresent system of local rating was very regressive and bore withparticular severity on families with incomes just above the national assistance level. The Allen Report had shown that ratepayers withan income of between  6 and  10 a week had to pay over 6 per cent
of their disposable income in rates, whereas those with an income of over  20 a week paid only 2-7 per cent in rates. Althoughindividuals in receipt of National Assistance had their rates paid,in effect, by the National Assistance Board, no less than 500,000ratepayers who were eligible for National Assistance were notclaiming it. There was therefore an urgent need to provide some measure of relief to those poorer households, particularly since theaverage increase of 10 per cent in local rate demands in the current year was likely to be followed by a similar increase in 1966. It wouldbe desirable in due course to reconstitute the whole rating system on a less regressive basis; but this could not be achieved in the nearfuture, since much of the information needed for this purpose wasnot yet available. The present scheme had therefore been devised asan interim, short-term measure, to be in operation by April 1966.It provided for a householder to apply to his rating authority for relief if his rate liability exceeded  5 a year and his income did notexceed  8 a week in the case of a single individual or  10 a week inthe case of a married couple, with an extra 30/- a week for eachdependant child. There would be provision for marginal relief for those just outside these limits. The Exchequer would reimburse localauthorities to the extent of 75 per cent of the cost of the rebates;but, since the scheme would be operated by local authorities, it was essential that the balance of the cost should be borne by them inorder to give them an incentive to operate it conscientiously. Theburden falling on other ratepayers as a result of the rebates would,however, be relatively small. The cost to the Exchequer if all thoseeligible applied was estimated in C (65) 132 at  35 million; but morerefined calculations suggested that it would lie between  25 and  30million. Since the ratepayers who would benefit were responsible for only 7 per cent of the total rates, it should therefore be possible toensure a very substantial alleviation of hardship, for up to 2\ millionhouseholds, at a relatively small cost to the Exchequer. The scheme would be preferable to an increase in the general Exchequer grant to local authorities, since this would benefit all ratepayers regardless of need. Moreover, as to about one half of it would accrue to industryand commerce, not to the householder.The scheme was admittedly a rough and ready measure; andit would inevitably create certain anomalies. It would therefore be important to emphasise, in presenting it to public opinion, that itwas no more than an interim attempt to moderate the impact of ratesregarded as a form of tax and should not be interpreted as a socialbenefit similar to National Assistance or alternative to the proposedincome guarantee. For this reason there was no question ofincorporating in the scheme a family means test or an arrangement for disregards of income. Those who were already receiving assistancefrom the National Assistance Board in respect of their rates would continue to do so. But it would be inadvisable that the scheme shouldbe operated by the National Assistance Board; and a ratepayershould be able to apply to the rating authority for relief as of right.The anomalies and -imperfections of the scheme could be defended
if it were presented as a short-terra measure, which would subsequently need to be incorporated, perhaps in a different form,in a fundamentally reconstituted rating system.The proposed Bill would also provide that local authorities must make provision for domestic ratepayers to pay by monthly instalments. This would be a desirable reform.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it was essential toprovide a measure of relief from rates to the poorer families. Localauthorities in Scotland might be reluctant to operate a local means test in addition to the national one. Nevertheless, the social arguments in favour of the measure were very great.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although the proposal might represent the most effective means which could be devised forgiving relief to poorer ratepayers, it would be preferable that it shouldbe included in the main Bill on Local Government Finance whichwould come into effect in April 1967 rather than be enacted hastilyas a special measure. The main Bill would be introduced into parliament by February 1966, and would fully redeem the pledgesmade by the Labour Party at the General Election to reform the rating system and to transfer part of the burden of expenditure from rates to taxes. Moreover, it had been necessary to defer many otherdesirable types of expenditure in the light of the present economicsituation; and further demands for Government expenditure were now coming forward which had not been included in the estimatesso far approved by the Cabinet. These included assistance to collieryclosures, a large increase in the deficit of British Railv/ays and additional expenditure on the European Launcher development organisation. In addition both the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister of Public Building and Works had proposed that additional claims should be made on national resourcesthrough an expansion of building programmes. It would be the moredifficult to seek to accommodate these and other items if theGovernment committed themselves to an additional expenditure of 25 to  30 million on rate rebates in 1966-67, which would have to bemet by an increase either in taxation or in Government borrowing.In discussion the balance of opinion favoured the introductionof the proposed rebate scheme as soon as possible on the grounds that, despite the administrative difficulties and anomalies which itwould involve, it would represent a desirable measure of social justice.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Tenants of local authority houses who at present paid a combined sum for rent and rates would obtain the appropriatedegree of rate relief grant by an abatement of rent.(b) The income limit for the purposes of rate rebate would be higher than in the case of National Assistance and national insurance; and pressure might develop to increase these rates in step.(c) Local authorities should not make it a condition of the raterebate that an applicant first applied for National Assistance, eventhough he might be eligible for it. The scheme should be available toassist those who were not prepared to apply for National Assistance.
(d) Difficulties might arise in connection with the administrationof the scheme. Individual incomes often fluctuated and wouldsometimes be higher and sometimes lower than the qualifying limit.It might therefore be necessary to assess income on other than anannual basis. Difficulties might also arise in relation to the treatmentof unearned income. For these reasons the scheme would be liableto be expensive and difficult to administer. On the other hand many local authorities already had experience of problems of this naturein connection with rent rebate schemes; and they had confirmed thata rate rebate scheme of the kind proposed should be workable.(e) The scheme provided for assistance in all cases where therate liability exceeded  5 a year. This figure seemed low; and it wouldbe desirable to consider whether a somewhat higher figure would be appropriate.(/) If the scheme was to remain in operation for several years,it would be desirable to incorporate in the Bill provision for amending the qualifying income limits in the light of changes in circumstances.(g) On balance it would be undesirable to provide for a statutory appeal against the decisions of local authorities on therebate scheme. On the other hand there would undoubtedly be caseswhere applicants would feel that they had not been fairly treated; andlocal authorities should be encouraged to make definite provision forthe hearing of dissatisfied applicants.(/?) Even if provision were made for the payment of rates bymonthly instalments, individuals with very small incomes would stillbe liable to be hard pressed. An arrangement whereby they couldpurchase stamps which could then be used to meet the rate demandswould be very valuable. It might be uneconomic to introduce specialstamps for this purpose; but consideration might be given to the useof, e.g., National Savings stamps for the payment of rates.(/) It would not be possible to include in the proposed Billprovision for the rating of empty property, since this issue involvedproblems which would need further examination. But the question would be dealt with in the main Bill on Local Government Financewhich would be introduced later in the Session.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in favour of proceeding with the scheme as an interim measure in order to alleviate the worst effects of a system of local taxation which was socially unjust and was becoming increasinglyregressive. The necessary legislation should precede the main measureon Local Government Finance in order that the rate rebate scheme might be in operation by April 1966. The scheme should be presented,however, as an interim measure, designed to meet an immediate needwhile a basic reform of the whole rating system was being prepared;and its introduction should not be allowed to retard work on thispermanent and long term reform. The Bill should not include provision for appeals against decisions of the rating authorities inrelation to rebates; but local authorities should be encouraged toestablish  appropriate  machinery  for  hearing  complaints.  The
arrangements proposed for the payment of rates by instalmentsshould also be adopted. Further consideration should be given,however, to the various points which had been raised in discussion in connection with the administration of these proposals (includingthe  5 level of minimum rate liability) and to the possibility of enabling ratepayers to discharge their liabilities by the tender of appropriate stamps.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C (65) 132, subject to furtherconsideration of the points indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th October, 1965.
