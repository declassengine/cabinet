SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that relations with the Government of Rhodesia appeared to bedeteriorating afresh. At the time of the visit to Salisbury which,together with the Lord Chancellor, he had made earlier in the year it had appeared that the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith,was not unwilling to contemplate a constitutional settlement onreasonably liberal terms. Subsequently, however, Mr. Smith seemedto have fallen under the control of the more extreme elements of his party; and, as a result of the recent General Election in Rhodesiain which the Government had gained an overwhelming victory, those elements must now be presumed to be in a position to dictate toMr. Smith the policy which he should pursue.In these circumstances he had recently suggested that he should pay a fresh visit to Central Africa, which would provide him withan opportunity to ascertain whether there was still any prospect of reaching agreement with the Rhodesian Government on the basis, ofthe principles of progressive constitutional advance which had beenthe subject of our recent negotiations with them. Mr. Smith had nowindicated, however, that, while he did not reject the possibility ofsuch a visit, he did not feel that it offered any prospect of advantageso long as we adhered to the principles in question. In an interview with the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Salisbury, in whichhe had amplified this message, Mr. Smith had made it sufficiently clear that he and his colleagues were no longer prepared to entertainthese principles and that the only basis of future dealing betweenthe two Governments which they could contemplate would be ouracquiescence in Rhodesia&apos;s assuming her independence, if necessaryoutside the Commonwealth.The Prime Minister said that these developments confronted theCabinet with a very serious situation. It now appeared probable thatthe Government of Rhodesia would make a unilateral declarationof independence in the near future; and this would require us toindicate forthwith, by measures which might involve the recall ofParliament, our attitude to an act of rebellion against the Crown.The Government had made clear, in the statement which they had issued in October 1964, the policy which they would adopt in this event; and the fact that this statement had been endorsed by all theother members of the Commonwealth and by many foreign countriessuggested that if the Government of Rhodesia committed themselvesto a unilateral declaration of independence, they would be unlikely to enlist international support except from the Governments of SouthAfrica and Portugal. It was uncertain how far these two governments would be willing to provide material assistance to the Governmentof Rhodesia; but the Government of Portugal, with whom we were already at odds about the terms on which a diplomatic representativeCC 47 (65)Government 1.  The Cabinet discussed the programme of government business        business for the forthcoming Parliamentary Session.
of the Government of Rhodesia should be accredited to Lisbon, werein a position, by virtue of their control over communicationsthrough Mozambique, to inflict very considerable damage on the zambian economy if the Government of Zambia sought to oppose a unilateral declaration of independence by Rhodesia. In that eventexports of Zambian copper might be endangered; and in thesecircumstances our own industrial production might be significantlythreatened by a shortage of copper. It was therefore essential thatwe should continue to exert every effort, consistently with theprinciples to which we were committed, to prevent the Governmentof Rhodesia from making a unilateral declaration of independence and that, if they finally committed themselves to such a declaration,they should not be able to plead any action of ours in justification.He would arrange, in consultation with the Ministers immediately concerned, to give urgent consideration to the reply which should now be sent to Mr. Smith and to ensure that the contingency planning already in hand should be pressed vigorously ahead in orderthat, if we were confronted with an emergency, we should be readyto do all that lay in our power both to protect the United kingdom economy and to play our part in exerting whatever pressure against rhodesia might be mobilised by international opinion, short ofmilitary intervention.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals;the Cabinet were unanimous on the need to be ready to resist anyunilateral and unconstitutional action by the Government of rhodesia.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the means by whichwe might seek to check the deterioration in relations withthe Government of Rhodesia, while preparing for apossible unilateral declaration of independence by thatGovernment.Kashmir 3.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that  the hostilities between India and Pakistan which had recently broken out inKashmir represented a new and grave stage in the continuing disputeabout this territory. It appeared that early in August the Governmentof Pakistan had arranged for irregular forces to cross the cease-fireline in Kashmir; and this had proved to be the first step in a processof action and retaliation by the two Governments which hadculminated in a direct Indian invasion of Pakistan acrossthe international frontier. There was little doubt that the indian government were hoping by these means to convince theGovernment of Pakistan that the cease-fire line in Kashmir mustbe accepted as a permanent line of demarcation and that the problemof Kashmir must be regarded as finally settled. The Government of pakistan were equally determined to use the dispute as a means ofreviving their claim that the whole question of Kashmir&apos;s future must
be reopened and could be settled only by a plebiscite. We had doneour best to moderate the conflict both by sending appropriatemessages to the two Governments and by encouraging other commonwealth Governments to counsel restraint during the period in which the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was now visiting both Pakistan and India, was seeking to find means of bringing the immediate hostilities to an end. The Secretary-general would probably report his findings to the Security Council in thefollowing week. But there appeared little prospect at present thathe would be able to promote a cease-fire; and in these circumstances the United Nations might propose the introduction of some formof sanctions against both India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, we ourselves were ceasing to supply arms and military stores to thecombatants; and the United States Government were taking similar action. Arrangements had been made to ensure the safety of UnitedKingdom nationals. At some stage it might be appropriate for theCommonwealth to take an initiative in promoting mediation; but itwould be premature to commit ourselves on this point until we knew the results of the mission of the Secretary-General of the united nations.In discussion there was general agreement with these suggestions.It might become relevant that the 1962 Agreement governing thesupply of arms to India entitled us to satisfy ourselves that theywere used only for the defence of India against Chinese aggression and to require their return when they were no longer needed for thispurpose. Decisions would also be needed in due course on the extentto which we should maintain unchanged the various measures bywhich we provided non-military assistance to the Governments ofIndia and Pakistan in terms of, e.g., financial aid, technical assistance and commercial arrangements, including the facilities provided bythe Export Credits Guarantee Department. But, although we couldnot defer decisions on such issues for very long and arrangements should be made for their early consideration, it would be preferable that we should avoid the appearance of unilateral action in relationto any measures which might be interpreted as sanctions against thecombatants and should act, in this regard, in concert with othercountries and in conformity with the policy of the United Nations.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the issues which were arisingas a result of the hostilities between India and Pakistan inKashmir.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th September, 1965.
