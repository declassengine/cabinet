SECRET 3CC 18 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government might be defeatedon the Second Reading of the War Damage Bill in the House ofLords that afternoon. Alternatively, and perhaps more probably, asubstantial amendment might be carried against the government during the Committee stage.The Prime Minister said that, if the Bill were rejected on SecondReading, it would be desirable to issue a public statement forthwith,indicating that the Government intended to invoke the parliament act on this occasion in order to secure the passage of the Bill andthat they would meanwhile act in accordance with the views of theHouse of Commons, i.e., that no payments from public funds wouldbe made contrary to the intentions of the Bill. It was for consideration whether the statement should also make it clear that, if the House ofLords continued to obstruct Government business, the Governmentwould seek a mandate at the next General Election to curtail thepowers of the Upper House in this respect. If, however, the Billreceived a Second Reading but the Government were defeated on asubstantial amendment during the Committee stage, a statement onthese lines would not necessarily be appropriate at that juncture; andfurther consideration would have to be given to the issues whichwould then arise.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.Oversea affairs vietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 17thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during the visit to the United States from which he had just returned, he hadconducted useful discussions with President Johnson and othermembers of the United States Administration and also with theSecretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant.He had established that there was broad agreement between theUnited States and the United Kingdom on most of the majorinternational issues of the day. As regards the particularly difficult problem of Vietnam, the United States spokesmen had made it clearthat the measures which they had recently taken to attack targets inthe northern half of the country were directed solely to arresting the progressive infiltration of South Vietnam by the Viet Cong forces and that the statement by General Maxwell-Taylor, the United states representative in Saigon, that there was no limit to the potentialincrease of the war, should not be interpreted as inconsistent withthis policy. They regarded thmselves as having no alternative to thiscourse of action. They could not contemplate the evacuation ofVietnam, except at the unacceptable price of allowing communist influence to extend progressively throughout South-East Asia. they regarded it as equally impracticable that they should remain in South6559-1a 2
Vietnam but refrain from any counter-action to arrest the infiltrationof the Viet Cong forces. In these circumstances the only course opento them was to strike at those forces in the area from which they came.They appeared fully to appreciate the risks inherent in this course,particularly the length of time which might elapse before theGovernment of North Vietnam were finally deterred from furtheraggression and the danger that, in this interval, the Government ofSouth Vietnam might itself collapse. They regarded these risks,however, as outweighed by the imperative need to check the north vietnamese advance. Nevertheless, they did not intend to attackNorth Vietnam with ground forces; and they had undertaken toinform us in advance if they contemplated any extension of theirpresent policy of air attack.So far there was no indication that the mounting United Statespressure was causing the Government of North Vietnam to be moreready to contemplate negotiation as a means of ending the conflict.The United States Government were equally unwilling to contemplatenegotiation unless infiltration by Viet Cong forces ceased and satisfactory evidence to this effect could be produced. Nevertheless,they had been not unsympathetic to our suggestion that, in the absenceof any prospect that we could take some action jointly with theGovernment of the Soviet Union as co-Chairmen of the 1954 geneva conference, we should seek to explore the possibilities of accommodation by means of an initiative of our own. For this purpose they would provide us with a statement of their views about thesituation in Vietnam in general; and they would thereafter beprepared to discuss with us a formula by which, in our capacity as one of the co-Chairmen of the 1954 Conference, we might subsequently seek to ascertain from the Powers concerned the basis on which they considered that negotiations for a peaceful settlementof the dispute might be undertaken. If we could agree such a formulawith the United States Administration, this would be helpful; butthey understood that we reserved our right to take this initiative, afterconsultation with them, in whatever form we judged most appropriate.As regards the recent occasion on which United States troops had used gas against the Viet Cong forces, he had left the UnitedStates Administration in no doubt of the strength of public feeling onthis point in the United Kingdom and the extent to which, in ourview, the episode had damaged the international reputation of theUnited States. In fact, however, the United States government themselves had not been consulted by the local Commander beforethe weapons in question were brought into use; and the gas in question had been only the non-lethal type, which had been used by many countries, including ourselves, for the control of civil disturbances.In discussion there was general agreement that there were nowsome grounds for cautious hope that means might gradually be found for achieving a peaceful solution to the problem of Vietnam. It was particularly satisfactory that we had established, in relation to theUnited States, conditions in which we might be able to take an initiative for this purpose; and we should now pursue this possibility
Prices and incomes(previous reference:CC(65) 7thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary of State(C (65) 47) to which was attached a draft memorandum on prices and incomes policy.The First Secretary of State said that the draft memorandumdefined the criteria which should govern the behaviour of prices and incomes and indicated the average annual rate of increase in money incomes, to be known as the &quot; norm &quot;, which would be consistent with the aims of the Joint Statement of Intent and should be exceededonly in exceptional circumstances. While it begged some questions and ignored others, it represented a further important step forward in the development of the Governments prices and incomes policyin that it contained an agreed incomes &quot; norm &quot; of 3-3^ per cent,which reflected current economic realities, but at the same timeestablished criteria which would enable cases for exceptionaltreatment to be identified and would therefore help the smaller and less powerful groups of organised labour in promoting their claims.The memorandum was intended to provide the starting point for thework of the National Board for Prices and Incomes and would serve as a foundation on which a body of case law could be built up.The memorandum had now been approved by the governingbodies of the Trades Union Congress and the National Associationof British Manufacturers; and it would be submitted for approval to the British Employers&apos; Confederation and the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce on 7th April. If the Cabinet endorsedhis proposals, he proposed to publish the memorandum as a white paper on 8th April. The Chairman of the National Board had nowbeen appointed; and, if the remaining members of the Board had been selected in time, their names, together with the Royal Warrantestablishing the Board, could be published simultaneously with theWhite paper in discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be desirable that, before the memorandum was published as a White Paper, it should be circulated to the mainorganisations in the public sector, including the nationalised industries and local authorities, which had not been consulted in thecourse of its preparation. Ministers should also be free to offer todiscuss the memorandum with these organisations after the white paper had been published.as vigorously as possible. In doing so, however, we should have regardto the interests of other countries in Asia, particularly India, whichmight be threatened if the United States military presence wereprematurely withdrawn from the area.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary.
(b) The Board would not interfere with, or replace, establishedmachinery for arbitration on wage and salary claims. It was hoped,however, that the memorandum would serve as a guide to those concerned with the fixing of wages and salaries; and the Governmentwould reserve the right to refer an arbitration settlement for further examination and comment by the National Board if they felt that itwas of particular importance in relation to incomes policy generally.(c) Among the circumstances which might justify exceptionalpay increases were those in which existing wage and salary levelswere generally recognised to be too low to maintain a reasonable standard of living or the pay of the workers concerned was knownto have fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work elsewhere. These criteria should suffice in principle tocomprise the claims of such groups as nurses and teachers who had recently fared less well than organised labour in general. They might also allow the Board to take some account of the differences in remuneration between skilled craftsmen and semi-skilled workers employed on mass production processes; but it was unlikely to bepossible to deal satisfactorily with this problem until the concept ofan incomes policy had been more widely accepted.(d) It was not intended to refer to the Board wage and salarysettlements in the public service which had been dealt with by the established and accepted machinery for negotiation and arbitration.In any event the Board should be fully occupied in dealing with casesarising elsewhere, particularly in the private sector, where wage settlements were based on considerably less critical examination.(e) While the memorandum represented another importantadvance in the development of a policy for prices and incomes, muchhad still to be achieved before that policy could be regarded asoperating effectively. In particular, difficulties might arise in the early stages as a result of an inconsistency between the Governmentsdeclared objectives and the rate at which earnings were actuallyincreasing. Moreover, there appeared to be some conflict of viewamong the trade unions themselves about the specific nature of the objectives and criteria to which they had formally subscribed. On theother hand the detailed negotiations which had preceded each step inthe development of the policy should have left no room formisunderstanding between the parties concerned. An effectiveincomes policy would inevitably take time to come into full operation;and much would depend on the selection of the early references tothe Board and on the Board&apos;s determination of those references. the selection of cases would lie entirely with the Government and, in thefirst instance, would be concerned primarily with price increases;these would be followed by references relating to movements in wagesand salaries. It was hoped that by these means the Board wouldgradually build up a body of case-law which would not only be relevant to the determination of further specific references but alsocreate a general climate of opinion in relation to movements in prices and wages generally.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet congratulated the First Secretary of State on the latest
development in the formulation of incomes policy, although they recognised that there were still many difficulties ahead which would need careful handling both by the Government and by the national board for Prices and Incomes.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft memorandum on prices and incomes policy annexed to C (65) 47.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, subject to final agreement by all the parties concerned, to present to Parliament a white Paper on the lines of the draft memorandum.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th March, 1965.
