Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 51stConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the latestmessage which he had received on the previous day from the PrimeMinister of Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, while seeking to controvertthe points which the Prime Minister had made in his own message of 18th October, had advanced the new proposal that the UnitedKingdom Government should now concede independence to Rhodesiaon the basis that the Rhodesian Government would observe theprinciples of the 1961 Constitution and that their undertaking to doso should be guaranteed by a solemn treaty. This message could be interpreted as implying that the Rhodesian Government were stillhesitating to commit themselves to a unilateral declaration of independence and had, indeed, slightly withdrawn from the extremeposition which they had hitherto maintained in this respect. On theother hand it contained the statement that they had now made their decision on their next step and that its implementation, and theconsequences which flowed from it, depended entirely on the responseof the United Kingdom Government. If the final decision had indeedbeen taken, the sole purpose of the letter might therefore be simply to seek to cast upon the United Kingdom Government the onus of driving Rhodesia into unconstitutional action. But, whicheverinterpretation was more accurate, the letter did not finally break offdiscussion and still offered some prospect of keeping negotiations in being. It was essential that we should not neglect this opportunity,particularly in view of certain signs of a growing divergence of publicopinion on the merits of the Rhodesian dispute which, if not arrested,could harden into a partisan difference of view in relation to issues of race and colour. In these circumstances, he intended to proposeto the Rhodesian Government that he should himself visit Salisburyin the very near future in order to explore the possibilities of further negotiation, provided that he was allowed to meet any person whose views he considered might be relevant to the issues involved. Thisproposal would impose on the Rhodesian Government the invidiousresponsibility of rejecting a renewed demonstration of our genuinedesire to end the deadlock; it should help to prevent Afro-Asiansupport for the Africans in Rhodesia from developing on extremelines; and if it succeeded imperceptibly in enlarging the debate froma bilateral negotiation with the Rhodesian Government to a more comprehensive discussion with all important shades of Rhodesianopinion, we might eventually be able to contemplate convening some kind of constitutional conference which would enable us to make afresh start in guiding Rhodesia to independence.In discussion it was suggested that it might be premature to contemplate, at this stage, an intervention by the United KingdomPrime Minister, whose personal presence in Rhodesia should beregarded as an instrument of policy to be employed only in thelast resort. It might be preferable that, if a representative of theUnited Kingdom Government were to pay a further visit to salisbury, this should be the Commonwealth Secretary; and itmight also be for consideration whether a representative of theOpposition should be associated with the mission, in order to restore the bi-partisan approach to the Rhodesian problem which
had recently shown some signs of weakening. On the other hand it would probably be a tactical error to appear to put theGovernment into commission, even on this issue; nor couldit be certain that the Opposition^ participation in the missionmight not confuse its purposes and prejudice its results.As regards the personal intervention of the Prime Minister, the issue in question related less to the intrinsic value of such a visit than to itstiming. If it were indeed the case that the Rhodesian Governmenthad already taken their final decision and that, as soon as they received our reply to their latest letter, they might be irretrievablycommitted to a unilateral declaration of independence, this was thelast opportunity of effective intervention which we should have, fnview of the appalling consequences which might flow from a unilateral declaration of independence and might, in certain circumstances,gravely affect our own economy, we should seek to avert it by all means consistent with conscience and honour; and no considerations of personal prestige or reputation should inhibit us from exertingourselves to this end while there was still time to do so.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ proposalto visit Rhodesia in an attempt to renew negotiations onthe question of Rhodesian independence.Road Safety 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 136) on a proposal to include inthe Road Safety Bill a provision making it an offence to drive or bein charge of a motor vehicle with more than a prescribed concentration of alcohol in the blood.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theGovernment were committed by specific undertakings in the Houseof Commons to introduce legislation as soon as possible in the coming session to make it an offence to drive with more than a prescribedamount of alcohol in the blood. The case for doing this rested on thenumber of road casualties attributable to drink and the fact that theexisting law making it an offence to drive while the ability to do sowas impaired by drink was ineffective because proof turned mainly on the driver showing visible signs of intoxication, whereas manydrivers drank sufficiently to be unsafe on the road without showingsuch signs. The Ministers concerned were considering the adoptionof a blood alcohol level of 80 mg./100 ml., recommended by theBritish Medical Association as the level at which driving ability was undoubtedly impaired, irrespective of individual reactions to alcohol.At this level, however, a driver would not necessarily show signs ofintoxication, and, if the new measure was to be effective, it wastherefore necessary to provide the police with powers to detect driverswho possessed the prescribed level of blood alcohol but showed no signs of intoxication. Exidence of the existence of the prescribedlevel of blood alcohol could be obtained by chemical tests ofspecimens of either blood, breath or urine, which could be taken ata police station. It was accordingly proposed to empower the police
to administer to drivers a roadside test by a breath-testing devicewhich would show prima facie evidence of the existence of theprescribed level of blood alcohol, and to require drivers showing this level to come to the police station and give one or other form ofspecimen. The principal question at issue was whether the police should be empowered to stop drivers at random for the purpose of administering the screening test, or to stop only those whom theyhad reason think had been drinking, for example, because they hadbeen seen leaving a public house. The Home Affairs Committee hadpreferred a random test, on the grounds that it would produce thegreater deterrent effect, would cast no slur on a driver who happened to be stopped, and would probably be regarded by the public asless objectionable than a selective test. A selective test, on the otherhand, might seem to be biased against those whose social drinkingnormally took place in public houses or clubs, and would expose thepolice to a suspicion of unfairness, since, in order to justify stoppinga driver, they would have to be in a position to identify him and hence to select known individuals. It was also open to the technicalobjection that traces of alcohol in the mouth of a driver stoppedshortly after drinking even a small quantity of alcohol would cause the screening device to show a disproportionately high level of alcoholin the blood. The Committee had rejected the possibility of makingthe possession of the prohibited level of blood alcohol conclusive evidence of the existing offence without providing the police with additional powers, on the ground that this would not be regardedas an adequate fulfilment of the Governments pledges to take effective action to deal with the problem of drink and driving.It had also been proposed that, if a separate offence of drivingwith more than a prescribed level of blood alcohol were introduced,the maximum penalty on summary conviction should be fixed at three months in order not to confer a right to claim trial by jury.This could be justified in view of the known leniency of juriestowards driving offences and the fact that the question at issue wouldbe merely whether the blood alcohol was or was not shown by the chemical test to have exceeded the prescribed level. There were,however, arguments the other way, and the Committee had concluded that if this proposal attracted criticism in the House of Commonsit would be right to abandon it.In discussion it was pointed out that the new proposals were of considerable severity and represented a revolutionary change inthe law in that it would be possible to secure a conviction withoutproof of actual impairment of ability to drive. Public opinion wasnot necessarily convinced that the problem was sufficiently serious to warrant measures of this kind. On the other hand, there had been apublic demand over a number of years for effective action to dealwith the dangers to which drivers who were unfit to drive throughdrink undoubtedly exposed other members of the public, and it was clear that the changes in social custom necessary to ensure that peopledid not drive after drinking would not take place unless theGovernment were prepared to introduce a statutory blood alcohollevel and to provide effective means of enforcement. While, however,
it would be right to introduce the new offence, it might be unwise to refrain from conferring on drivers charged with it the right to claimtrial by jury. The substitution of an objective for a subjective test of the commission of an offence would, in any event, considerablyreduce the harmful effect of the leniency of juries.Discussion then turned on the question whether the police shouldbe empowered to stop drivers for the purpose of a screening test ona random or a selective basis. It was suggested that a random testwould expose a driver who had in fact not been drinking to the riskof arrest at the discretion of the police. It was explained, however,that a driver who refused the test but did not appear to have beendrinking, would simply be summoned, and, if convicted of the offence of refusing the test, would be punishable by a fine. This might enable a driver who suspected that his blood alcohol was above theprescribed level but was not visibly affected to avoid liability for the penalties of the main offence by refusing the screening test andincurring a fine, but it was not likely that a high proportion wouldtake this course. It might be expected that drivers as a whole would see less objection to a random check which carried no implication that they had been drinking, and that the risk of being stopped atrandom would be a powerful encouragement to the necessary changein social attitudes. On the other hand, a selective check, which inevitably implied suspicion, might well be more deeply resented, andwas open to substantial objection on the ground of the oppertuinities which it would give for unfair discrimination on the part of the police.It might therefore be that a random check would ultimately be thebest solution of the problem, but it was for consideration whether public opinion might be more willing to accept it if, in the firstinstance, the police were given only the more limited power to impose a selective check, provision being made in the Bill for the powersnecessary for random checking to be conferred on them later by regulation.After further discussion it was suggested that to take a powerto introduce random checks which it was not intended to useimmediately might expose the Government to the criticism of failing to take a measure which they knew to be necessary because they feared to incur unpopularity. The balance of advantage seemed,therefore, to lie in introducing a random check at the outset. It wouldbe necessary to ensure, however, that a check designed to detectdrivers who had been drinking was not used as an occasion for seeking to detect other offences, for example, in connection with the mechanical condition of the vehicle. It might also be desirable toconsider whether, in the context of the new provisions, it wasnecessary to strengthen the safeguards for the driver who, knowinghimself to be unfit to drive, remained in his car but without any intention of driving.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that it should be made an offence to drive orbe in charge of a vehicle with more than a prescribed amount ofalcohol in the blood, and that it would be unwise to withhold fromdrivers charged summarily with such an offence the right to opt for
iron and 3.  The Cabinet began its discussion of the future treatment ofSteel legislation for the nationalisation of the iron and steel industry butNationalisation     ,. , ,adjourned at an early stage.(previous reference:CC (65) 27thConclusions,Minute 2)Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st October, 1965.trial by jury. They were also agreed that if the new measure was tobe effective in inducing a change in social habits it was necessary toconfer additional powers on the police. The balance of opinion wasin favour of empowering them to stop drivers at random rather thanon the basis of a suspicion that they had been drinking, and of introducing these powers at the outset. He had himself hoped that itmight be possible in a matter so closely concerning public behaviourand public opinion to arrange for the House of Commons to take an active part in the preparation of legislation through a SelectCommittee, but he accepted that, in view of the pledges to introduce a Bill before Christmas, this was not practicable. When the Bill came before the Legislation Committee, however, consideration should begiven to the possibility of allowing a free vote on the provisions dealing with drink and driving. Consideration might also be givenin a wider context to the value of the Swedish system of relating finesto the income of the offender.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it should be made an offence to drive or be incharge of a motor vehicle with more than a prescribedconcentration of alcohol in the blood, and that driverscharged summarily with this offence should be entitled to claim trial by jury.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Transport to considerwhether any further safeguards were necessary for thedriver who being unfit to drive remained with his vehiclebut without intending to drive it.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for theLegislation Committee to consider in due course whetherit would be appropriate for the provisions of the road safety Bill dealing with drink and driving to be left to a free vote in the House of Commons.(4) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to consider the possibility of adopting a systemof fines in which the amount of the fine would be automatically related to the income of the offender andto bring their conclusions before the Home AffairsCommittee.
