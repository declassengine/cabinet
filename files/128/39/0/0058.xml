commonwealth immigration(previous reference:CC (65) 35thConclusions,Minute 3)VouchersThe Lord President said that the Cabinet had decided on 8th July that the total number of vouchers should be 8,500 a year.Within this total 1,000 vouchers would be available for immigrants from Malta as a temporary arrangement subject to review after two years. The Cabinet had taken the view that no publicity shouldbe given to this arrangement and that the total figure for vouchersshould not otherwise be divided into quotas for separate countries.In fact, however, the arrangement for Malta had already become known and the Commonwealth Immigration Committee therefore recommended that it should be mentioned in the White Paper. It wasalso recommended that, to ensure a fair distribution, no oneCommonwealth country should be given more than 15 per cent ofthe total of Category A vouchers, and that this should also be mentioned in the White Paper.In discussion it was pointed out that the special arrangement for Malta was being made not because of a specific commitment toaccept Maltese immigrants but because of our obligation to assistMalta to deal with the economic difficulties caused by changes inour defence policy. However, if this were explicitly stated in theWhite Paper it might set a precedent for similar claims from other territories. The White Paper should therefore refer to our specialobligations to Malta without specifying how these arose. It wouldalso be preferable that the White Paper should refer to a total of8,500 vouchers within which there would be an allocation of 1,000vouchers for Malta; and this allocation would be subject to reviewafter two years.The Lord President said that in addition to the limit of 15 percent of the vouchers for any one Commonwealth country it was recommended that in the allocation of Category A vouchers theMinister of Labour should normally deal with applications in theorder of the date of their receipt but should have discretion to givea measure of priority to the more essential types of employmentsuch as the hospital and transport services.In discussion it was pointed out that if Category A voucherswere allocated according to a system of priorities this would mean that we should be distributing all the vouchers in accordance withThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C (65) 109) to which were annexed drafts of a white paper and of a statement of Government policy, on commonwealth immigration, and a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C (65) 111) on the admission of foreign workers.The Lord President said that the statement of government policy would be made on 2nd August and it was intended that theWhite Paper should be published later the same day.The following main points were made in the discussion of theWhite Paper.
the needs of the United Kingdom and without regard to the interestsof the Commonwealth countries, whereas the conclusion of theCabinet on 8th July was that the Category A vouchers should beissued according to the date of the application. It should thereforebe made clear in the White Paper that Category A vouchers wouldbe available for unskilled as well as skilled workers and that the applications would generally be dealt with in the order of the dateof their receipt. In administering the scheme, however, the Ministerof Labour should have a measure of discretion in allocating thesevouchers.AliensThe Home Secretary said that he had been invited to report tothe Cabinet if it appeared that the number of aliens accepted for permanent settlement in the United Kingdom was likely to riseabove 6,000 a year. On the basis of the figures during the first six months it seemed likely that the total in 1965 would be over11,000. The real comparison, however, should not exclude dependantsand, on this basis, in 1964 55,900 Commonwealth immigrants were accepted for settlement as against 19,211 aliens. Even with the reduced number of vouchers now proposed for commonwealth immigrants it seemed likely that their total, including dependants,would be at least double that of alien immigrants for several years to come. There would also be practical difficulties about restricting the number of alien workers accepted for permanent settlementsince permission for such settlement could only be sought after thealien had been resident for four years in this country.In discussion it was suggested that it would be difficult to defend a  situation in which the number of alien workers settling permanentlyin this country was higher than that of Commonwealth workers, andthat measures should therefore be taken to ensure that the numberof such aliens did not rise above the present level. This was also desirable in order to prevent a possible increase in the number ofalien workers to fill jobs which would be available owing to the reduced number of Commonwealth immigrants admitted under thevoucher scheme. On the other hand it was pointed out thatrestrictions on the issue of work permits for aliens would be contrary to our traditional policy and would have a damaging effecton the employment needs in this country. Since it seemed certainin any event that for many years the total number of commonwealth immigrants would greatly exceed the number of alien immigrants,new restrictions on the entry of aliens should not be imposed. Thepoint should not be specifically mentioned in the White Paper, butif questions were asked it should be stated that it would be thepolicy of the Government that the number of non-commonwealth immigrants admitted for permanent settlement would continue tobe restricted to a figure considerably below that for commonwealth immigrants.DependantsThe Lord President said that the Commonwealth ImmigrationCommittee proposed a scheme whereby immigrant workers, both
those already in the United Kingdom and those coming in future,would declare their dependants, if they wished them to come to theUnited Kingdom, so that the particulars could be checked in thecountry of origin and entry certificates issued. The scheme wouldbe designed to prevent evasion of the controls and although it couldnot be fully effective, particularly during the initial stage, it was desirable that it should be introduced as soon as possible in orderto check the influx of dependants to this country which might otherwise follow the publication of the White Paper. A firm date of1st September should therefore be given in the White Paper for theintroduction of the scheme.In discussion it was pointed out that the scheme would bedifficult to administer, both by the Home Office in this country andby the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office inrespect of the countries of origin. The White Paper stated that the forms which immigrants would require for the declaration of their dependants would be available early in September; it would bedifficult to be more specific than this. This part of the White paper should therefore stand as drafted.Conditions of entryThe Home Secretary said that it had been agreed that power should be taken to require Commonwealth students and otherimmigrants whose bona fides were in doubt to register with thepolice, but it had been suggested that this power should not be exercisable unless expressly conferred by a statutory instrumentsubject to the Affirmative Resolution procedure. If control were tobe effective and evasion prevented it was essential that immigration officers should be able to require registration with the police as acondition of entry, although this power would in fact be exercisedvery sparingly.In discussion it was agreed that the Affirmative resolution procedure need not be followed in respect of the power to requireregistration with the police.RepatriationThe Home Secretary said that in accordance with the cabinet decision on 8th July he proposed to seek a general power, in additionto his power to act on the recommendation of a Court, to repatriatea Commonwealth citizen if he considered the public interest torequire it. This was necessary if he were to be able to deal effectively with Commonwealth immigrants whose conduct or activities clearlypointed to repatriation but fell short of criminal activities whichcould be proved in a court of law and could not therefore be madethe basis of a criminal charge. The powers he would seek in respectof Commonwealth immigrants would go no further than the powershe already possessed in the case of aliens.In discussion it was pointed out that the Home Secretary&apos;spowers in relation to aliens already aroused criticism and the
extension of such powers to Commonwealth immigrants would beregarded as unjustified both in this country and in theCommonwealth. The power to repatriate Commonwealth immigrantsother than on the recommendation of a Court should therefore belimited to cases in which the immigrant had evaded control, forinstance by obtaining entry by misrepresentation or by disregardingthe conditions on which he had been admitted. The relevantparagraphs of the White Paper should be amended in this sense.Financial assistance for local authorities the Lord President said that the Treasury had proposed aredraft of paragraph 62 of the White Paper.In discussion there was agreement that the Treasury redraftshould be accepted, though the words &quot; for a limited period &quot; shouldbe omitted. It seemed inevitable that the special measures envisagedwould have to be continued for a number of years but the omission of these words would not prevent the arrangements being reviewed,and if necessary modified, from time to time.A number of other amendments to the White Paper and to thestatement of Government policy were agreed.The Prime Minister said that, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion, the statement of Government policy would be madeon 2nd August and the White Paper published on the same day.He proposed that the White Paper should be issued in his name andthat, in his absence, the Lord President should make the statement on his behalf.The Cabinet (1) Approved the drafts of the White Paper and of the statementof Government policy annexed to C (65) 109, subject tothe amendments agreed in discussion.(2) Took note that the statement of Government policy wouldbe made by the Lord President of the Council on 2nd August, and that the White Paper would bepublished in the Prime Minister^ name on the same day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th July, 1965.
