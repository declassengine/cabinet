Sir Winston 2.   The Prime Minister said that Sir Winston Churchill wouldChurchill celebrate his 90th birthday on Monday, 30th November. It would be appropriate that the Cabinet should send a message of greeting andcongratulation to Sir Winston on this occasion; and he hoped that itmight be possible for him to deliver this message in person.The Cabinet Endorsed the Prime Ministers proposal.EconomicSituation(previous reference:C.C. (64) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the heavy pressure on sterling which had developed within the last few days hadbeen relieved during the previous afternoon by the offer of the central banks of eleven foreign countries, together with the Bank for international Settlements, to put at our disposal resources whichwould be equivalent to $3,000 million. This gesture provided not onlyessential technical support for sterling but also convincing evidencethat international monetary authorities were convinced of theimportance of maintaining sterling as a reserve currency and had sufficient confidence in its basic stability to be prepared to make aconsiderable effort to reinforce it at a moment of particular stress.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although the actionof the other Central Banks had been very welcome, it afforded no grounds for complacency. It would be particularly important,therefore, that the Governments intentions should henceforward beexpounded in terms which would command not only political supportat home but also the confidence of foreign holders of sterling. Thevarious measures which the Government had in mind economies in defence expenditure, the provision of further incentives for the exporttrade, a critical review of prestige projects and so forth must be shown to be directed primarily to the release of productive resources in order to ensure the stability and expansion of the economy; andit would be very desirable that all Government spokesmen shouldstress, in public pronouncements, that this would be the main purpose of the Governments policies.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwould be important to convince domestic opinion that a stablecurrency depended to a considerable extent upon the degree to which other countries believed that our economy was basically sound andhealthy. From this point of view international opinion would be liableto attach greater importance to positive and rapid action to increase production and productivity than to the more gradual elaboration of an incomes policy; and for the same reason, it would be desirableC.C. 11 (64)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
that in any public discussion of the Governments proposals to nationalise the iron and steel industry Ministers should emphasise the contribution which this measure would make to the expansion of exports rather than the political commitment which it woulddischarge.The Prime Minister invited all Ministers to be guided, in any public statements which they might make in the near future, by themain considerations which had emerged from the discussion and toensure that junior Ministers were similarly advised.OverseaAffairsThe Congo(previous reference:CC. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent proposal by theBelgian and United States Governments to attempt to rescue the europeans who were held as hostages by the rebel Congolese forces inStanleyville had confronted us with a difficult choice. If we were seen to contribute to the operation by placing facilities on Ascension Islandat the disposal of the United States aircraft conveying the Belgianparatroops concerned, we ran the risk that we might provoke the rebelforces to massacre the hostages forthwith and, by appearing to supportthe Government of M. Tshombe, might alienate opinion in otherAfrican countries. On the other hand, if we refused to assist theBelgian and United States Governments, we might be held partiallyresponsible for any disaster which overtook the hostages. In thesecircumstances the obligation to try to save human life was clearlyparamount; and we had therefore agreed that the aircraft engagedin the rescue operation should be given staging facilities on ascension island. This had undoubtedly contributed to the success of theoperation; and many lives had been saved. In particular, all UnitedKingdom subjects, with one possible exception, had been rescued.The fact that a number of non-Europeans had also been saved andthat we were now seeking to ensure that relief supplies would beprovided for the Africans who had suffered during the attack onStanleyville might moderate to some extent the sharp political criticism of our action which had been expressed by most african countries, with the exception of Nigeria.The Belgian force were now engaged in a secondary rescueoperation elsewhere in the Congo; but thereafter they would be withdrawn and should have returned to Belgium by the beginning ofthe following week. The humanitarian purpose of the operation would, by then, have been achieved as far as was possible; but an unknown number of Europeans, living in isolated parts of the Congo,would inevitably remain unaccounted for.Defence and *5.   The Prime Minister said that the Ministers primarilyOversea Policy concernerj had now completed, under his chairmanship, an initialreview of our defence and oversea commitments, which had been directed to considering both our global defence policy in the longer* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET
term and the more immediate issue of the proposals which we might put forward, during the forthcoming discussions in Washington, for reinforcing the interdependence of the member countries of the north atlantic Alliance in relation to nuclear weapons.The United Kingdom was attempting to discharge three majordefence roles a commitment to the defence of Europe under theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO); the role of a nuclear power, which the Government had inherited from their predecessors;and the maintenance of a world-wide military presence, based on ouroversea commitments. The resultant burden on our economy made itimpossible for us to sustain all three roles indefinitely; and it wouldbe necessary for the Cabinet to consider on a subsequent occasion,when more detailed proposals had been formulated for the purpose,both a revision of the scale of our oversea commitments and thepossibility of effecting corresponding reductions in the relevantweapons systems, particularly certain very costly aviation projects.The scope for economies would be conditioned partly by the fact thatit was desirable, both in principle and as a means of maintaining theCommonwealth connection, that we should continue to play a significant military role in the Mediterranean and east of Suez andpartly by the fact that we might nevertheless be unable, for local political reasons, to retain indefinitely the oversea bases on which our ability to discharge that role at present depended.For these reasons it would be necessary to make it clear to theUnited States Government, at the outset of the forthcoming discussions in Washington, that we should henceforward be compelledto relate our defence expenditure more closely to our resources. Asregards the European theatre we should not be able to ignore the momentum which the scheme for a mixed-manned surface fleet had now acquired. But this scheme, inasmuch as it would increase the nuclear potential at the disposal of NATO, was strategicallyunnecessary and economically unwelcome. We must therefore continue to oppose it; but we should do so more effectively by putting forward constructive alternative proposals, which would be directed to the same end as the mixed-manned surface fleet, i.e., the contain-ment of the aspirations of the non-nuclear members of NATO, but would seek to achieve this end without any increase in the nucleararmament of the Alliance. For this purpose we should propose thecreation of an Atlantic Nuclear Force (A.N.F.), to which we would commit irrevocably, so long as NATO existed, our V-bomber forceassigned to Europe and such Polaris submarines as we mightconstruct. The precise number of these submarines would be forfurther consideration; but it was relevant to a decision that theconstruction of some of them was already sufficiently advanced tomake it unrealistic to cancel the orders. On the other hand the number to be retained would be smaller than the number which the previous government had envisaged and would be such as to make it clearthat we no longer contemplated the maintenance of an independentnuclear force. We should look to the United States Government to commit an equivalent number of submarines to the proposed A.N.F.
In addition the force might include a mixed-manned component, towhich the non-nuclear Powers could contribute; this might be constituted by the mixed-manning of V-bomber squadrons and land-based missiles.The control of the A.N.F. would raise difficult problems; but itwould be essential to make it clear that it would operate in close co-operation with the command system of NATO and that both theUnited States and the United Kingdom Governments would possessa veto not only on its use but also on any change in the method ofcontrol. It seemed unlikely that the French Government would participate in the project at the outset; but it would be desirable toleave the way open for them to do so later.Although the fact that one element in the force would becontributed by the United Kingdom and that we should retain have to on its use would imply that the non-nuclear Powers would still not obtain precise equality with us, our surrender of our right to independent nuclear action should go far to meet their susceptibilities;and we might hope to obtain, in return, general agreement to a new initiative for a relaxation of East-West tension. We must also usesuch bargaining power as our proposal afforded us to dispose of theexisting project for a mixed-manned surface fleet. Initially, we shouldcontinue to oppose the creation of such a fleet at all. We might find it impossible to sustain that position; but, if so, the Cabinet wouldhave to consider the nature and extent of any contribution which we might have to make to the fleet.We must also seek, as part of our new initiative, to obtain freshundertakings not only by the nuclear Powers not to disseminatenuclear weapons but also by the non-nuclear Powers not to acquiresuch weapons; and we must try progressively to extend the scope ofthese undertakings.Finally, we must endeavour, through the A.N.F., to ensure thatwe and the other members of NATO would be brought into closerconsultation on the use of United States nuclear weapons not only within the NATO area but also elsewhere in the world.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be one of the main political objectives of the discussions to prevent a nuclear alliance between the United States and Western Germany and to keep the wayopen for a subsequent French Government to join the force. Weshould have to bear in mind in this connection the German reaction to the recent speech by General de Gaulle at Strasbourg. This had caused some division of opinion within the German Government but had also, for that reason, made them less insistent on an early decisionon the proposals for a mixed-manned surface fleet.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, whereas theproposals for a mixed-manned surface fleet involved the diversion ofmen and money to the creation of an additional and unnecessarynuclear force, our own project for an A.N.F. ,va0 directed to solving the political problem in Europe by establishing joint control of nuclear weapons which already existed. Tm&apos;c would require a readiness onour part to commit to the new force both our V-bomber force, whichwould be operational until about 1970, and the Polaris submarines,
Pensions ofMinisters and members ofParliament(previous reference:C.C. (64) 8thConclusions,Minute 3)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C. (64) 17) on the pensions of Ministers and members of Parliament and other related matters.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had invited him toarrange for a Committee of Ministers under his chairmanship toexamine the contributory pension scheme for Members of Parliamentrecommended by the Lawrence Committee, the position of ministers in the House of Lords in relation to the daily attendance allowanceC.C. 11 (64)which would be operational until about the end of the 1970s. It wouldbe impracticable to look further at present. In return for this contribution we should seek some reduction in the extent of our commitment to ground defence in NATO, together with a measureof assistance in our main role of peace-keeping overseas. As regardsthe number of Polaris submarines to be constructed, two were alreadyrelatively far advanced, while contracts for another two had beenplaced and work on the prefabrication of essential parts had beentaken a considerable way. No contract had yet been placed for the fifth submarine; but work on the so-called &quot;long lead&quot; items had started. The necessary steps were being taken to ensure that we shouldnot be faced with further unnecessary expenditure on this vessel.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals put forward by the Prime Minister as the basis on which negotiations in Washington should begin. The following main points were made:(a) The commitment of our nuclear forces to the A.N.F. would imply that the French Government would enjoy a degree of independent control over their force de frappe which we should havesurrendered in relation to our own deterrent. There was considerable doubt, however, whether the force de frappe would in fact constitute a credible independent deterrent by the time it became operational.(b) The Chiefs of Staff had endorsed the A.N.F. project inprinciple from the military point of view.(c) The size of the reduction to be made in the programme ofPolaris submarines could be determined only in the light of a further detailed examination of the requirement, with due allowance for a margin of insurance against accidental damage to one of the vessels.It would also be for consideration, in the light of the negotiations inconnection with the A.N.F., how far we should continue research anddevelopment in relation to nuclear weapons.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement about the project for the creation of an Atlantic nuclear force.(2) Agreed that the proposals outlined in discussion should beput forward on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment at the forthcoming discussions with theUnited States Government in Washington.
and the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition andthe Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords. The Committee&apos;srecommendations on these matters were as follows:Contributory pension scheme the Committee considered that the recommendations of the lawrence Committee should be accepted as a whole and withoutalteration, notwithstanding that they were more generous than theprovisions of other public service pension schemes in that theyenvisaged no abatement in respect of National Insurance benefits andthat widows would be entitled to half the husband&apos;s pension insteadof one-third, at the expense, as to half, of the Exchequer instead ofwholly at that of the contributor. The Committee considered that therisk of repercussions on other public service pension schemes shouldbe accepted in view of the overriding advantage of transferring from members of the House of Commons to an independent body theinvidious responsibility for fixing the terms of the pensions scheme.On the same grounds is seemed desirable to prescribe the schemefully in the necessary legislation, leaving only minor details for adjustment by Statutory Instrument. It would be necessary to considerwhether the Members&apos; Fund could properly be used to supplement the pension payable under the contributory scheme. There was noobjection in principle to the Fund&apos;s making allowances to members who for one reason or another failed to qualify for full pension underthe scheme or to ensuring that Members whose expectations fromthe Fund were greater than from the scheme would not be penalised.But there were arguments against allowing the Fund to supplement the benefits normally available under the scheme to those who firstbecame Members at the beginning of a Parliament. It would bedesirable, however, for the trustees of the Fund to examine its futureneeds and scope when the scheme was in operation; and in themeantime the Bill should not be so drafted as to prohibitsupplementation of benefits under the scheme.Ex officio pensions the Speaker had been consulted about the provision of a pension for himself and his widow and had expressed a preference that thepensions should be fixed at the time of his retirement and not in theforthcoming Bill. The Lord Chancellors pension would be increasedby half the amount recommended by the Lawrence Committee; andthe Lord Chancellors widow would continue to receive one-third ofher husband&apos;s pension in return for the reduction by half of the lump sum to which he would be entitled on retirement. It was proposedthat the practice of providing for the Lord Chancellors salary and pension in a statute fixing judicial salaries should be continued. Itcould be argued that the pension for the widow of a Prime Minister,to be paid by the Exchequer, should be no more than that which she would have received under the scheme if her husband had contributed to it during the whole of his service in the House of Commons. Onthe other hand it might be more appropriate that it should be related,as was the pension of the widow of a Lord Chancellor, to the provision made for her husband.
It was proposed that all persons entitled to ex officio pensions should withdraw, on appointment, from the contributory scheme. Itwould be undesirable to extend the new pension rates to existingbeneficiaries of ex officio pensions; but it would be possible in theforthcoming Bill to apply to them the provisions of the Pensions(Increase) Acts, which would have the effect of increasing their pensions by about 30 per cent.House of LordsIt had been agreed that it would be impracticable to enable ministers in the House of Lords to draw daily attendance allowances,since the allowances escaped taxation only on the basis that they were intended to reimburse expenses in connection with an office carryingno remuneration. Moreover, the Parliamentary salary payable to ministers in the House of Commons was paid in recognition of theirconstituency expenses.It was proposed that the Leader of the Opposition and theOpposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords should be paid  2,000and  1,500 a year respectively.The Law officers the salaries of the Law Officers had traditionally been paid underthe authority of a Treasury Minute; but it would now be appropriate that they should be established by legislation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Government might be criticised for enabling Membersof Parliament to enjoy more advantageous pension rights than public servants generally; and there was a danger of repercussions not onlyin the public service but in the nationalised industries. On the otherhand a public servant was normally entitled to retire on pension atthe age of 60 and would also be better placed than a Member ofParliament in certain other respects. The balance of advantageappeared to lie in accepting the recommendations of the lawrence committee as a whole, as though they were in the nature of an arbitration award.(b) The exceptional demands which the Prime Ministers duties imposed on him and his wife were sufficient to justify a more generous pension for his widow than the scale appropriate to the widow of a Member of Parliament.(c) While it had proved impracticable to enable Ministers in theHouse of Lords to continue to draw the attendance allowance, itshould be recognised that this would leave them less well off than some of their Ministerial colleagues in the House of Commons.id) It would not be possible to arrange for the Bill giving effectto the recommendations of the Lawrence Committee to receive its second Reading until 18th December; but this would be sufficient toenable the Fees Office to pay arrears of salary at the end of December.It appeared that this arrangement would be generally acceptable to members.SECRET5510-5 b

The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment approved the proposals in C. (64) 17 and agreed thatthe legislation giving effect to them should apply the Pensions(Increase) Acts to the beneficiaries of existing ex officio pensions. TheLord President and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should give furtherconsideration to the provision to be made for the widow of a PrimeMinister and to any other matters which might arise for decision inthe course of the preparation of the Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to Conclusion (2) below, approved the proposals inC. (64) 17.(2) Agreed that the Pensions (Increase) Acts should be appliedto the existing beneficiaries of ex officio pensions.(3) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, to give further consideration to theprovision to be made for the widow and dependants of a prime Minister and to dispose of matters of detail arising in the course of the preparation of the Bill on the salaries and pensions of Ministers and Members of Parliament.ChildWs 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordService in President of the Council (C. (64) 20) on the question whetherGreater London ....        ,     , ,   , ,      , , .     , T      ,legislation should be introduced to enable the Greater london council (G.L.C.) to exercise certain of the functions of a children&apos;authority.The Lord President said that a firm undertaking had been given during the Third Reading of the London Government Bill that theLabour Party, if they attained office, would prevent the fragmentationof the social services maintained by the London County Council(L.C.C.); and in July 1964 the present Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, as chairman of the LabourParty Local Government Committee, had given a further assurance that it would be the intention of a Labour Government to confercertain functions, which required administration over a wider area,on an authority other than the London boroughs. In accordance withthat undertaking it was now proposed that responsibility should beplaced on the G.L.C. for approved schools; for remand homes, largechildren&apos;s homes and specialised children&apos;s homes now administered by the L.C.C. and the Middlesex County Council; for staff training,statistics and research, the prescription of parental contributions andboarding out allowances; and for general supervision over theprovision by the boroughs of residential accommodation for children,with concurrent powers to provide specialised accommodation. Theindividual boroughs would continue to be responsible for preventivework in relation to the family, for receiving children into care andboarding them out and for the administration of small children&apos;shomes for their own use. Although these proposals were defensible on merits, they were undeniably a compromise which fell short of the
Labour Party&apos;s original intentions. Moreover, since they were neithersimple nor uncontroversial, they would be likely to expose theGovernment both to political criticism and to the risk of Parliamentaryobstruction designed to impede the progress of other government legislation. Time could be found for this Bill only at the cost of abandoning one of the Governments other urgent measures; and,even so, there was no guarantee that the Bill could be passed in timeto enable the G.L.C. to recruit the necessary staff and to be vestedwith the transferred properties before 1st April, 1965, when, in theabsence of legislation, the London boroughs would resumeresponsibility for the full range of institutions and services in their areas.If it were decided not to proceed with the Bill, it would benecessary to admit that it was not possible at this stage to preserve the L.C.C. Children&apos;s Service as an entity in view of the steps already taken by the London boroughs to assume their responsibilities; thatthe Government had considered whether, short of this, it would be practicable to confer on the G.L.C. certain responsibilities over theGreater London area as a- whole; that, in the light of theGovernments other urgent commitments, it was not possible to takethe necessary action for this purpose in the time available; but thatthe Government would review the working of the LondonGovernment Act in due course and would not rule out the possibilityof amending the arrangements for the children&apos;s service if they proved to be unsatisfactory. It must be recognised, however, that this undertaking would be largely illusory, since it would be difficult ata later date to deprive the boroughs of functions which they had become accustomed to exercising.The Home Secretary said that, before the drafting of legislation could be completed, it would be necessary to have discussions withthe local authorities concerned on the nature and scope of thefunctions to be transferred to the G.L.C. and on the difficult questionsof rating and finance which would be involved. Such discussions could hardly take place at less than two weeks&apos; notice; and on this basis it would not be possible to introduce a Bill before the christmas Recess. In these circumstances it was doubtful whether there would be sufficient time after the passage of the Bill for theG.L.C. to recruit the necessary staff and for the Council and the.boroughs to revise the plans which had already been made for theadministration of the institutions and services for which it was nowproposed that the G.L.C. should assume responsibility.In discussion it was pointed out that the common services whichit was proposed that the G.L.C. should administer were all that could now be preserved of the L.C.C. Children&apos;s Service. But this element at least should be safeguarded in fulfilment of the pledgeswhich the Government had given while in Opposition and in the best interests of the children concerned. There was no doubt that theLabour members of the G.L.C. and most of the Labour members ofthe borough councils were strongly in favour of this course. On the
other hand the boroughs had already made arrangements for theadministration of the homes which would have to be shared among them and had made the necessary appointments of staff. It was known that the Children&apos;s Officers of the boroughs considered that matters had gone too far to make it feasible to retain services overa wider area; and it was possible that, by the time the Bill wasdebated in the House of Commons, the boroughs themselves would be reluctant to lose the functions which they had for some months beenorganising themselves to discharge. Moreover, to alter thearrangements only a matter of weeks before 1st April, 1965, might put both the G.L.C. and the boroughs in considerable difficulty, evenif the Governments intentions were made clear in advance; and this consideration in conjunction with the difficulty of securing thepassage of the Bill in the time available, might tip the balance ofadvantage against proceeding with the proposals. If, however, theBill were introduced in January, it appeared inescapable that anotherBill already in the programme would have to be abandoned; and,since there could be no certainty that the Opposition would facilitate the passage of legislation to give effect to the proposals underconsideration, the Bill to be sacrificed might need to be one of theGovernments major measures.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet considered the proposed Bill desirable on merits, theycould not reach a final decision on its inclusion in the legislative programme until they knew which of the Bills at present in theprogramme would have to be abandoned if this Bill were introduced.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for thefuture Legislation Committee to consider which Bill or bills would have to be excluded from the legislative programme for 1964-65 if the proposed Bill on the Children&apos;s service in Greater London were introduced in January; and toreport to the Cabinet at an early meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th November, 1964.
