ParliamentMurder(Abolition ofDeathPenalty)BillDefence 2.   The Prime Minister said that the Labour Party, when in policy Opposition, had invited the Government of the day to discuss defence policy with them on a confidential basis. It was for consideration whether, now that they held office, they should renew this initiative in relation to the present Opposition. To do so would not imposeany unacceptable restrictions on the Governments defence policy,since this had already been made clear. Nor would there be anyquestion, at least for some considerable time, of giving the Oppositionfactual information which they did not substantially possess already.He had consulted the Secretary of State for Defence, who favoured the proposal.In discussion there was general agreement with this suggestion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister wouldascertain whether the Opposition would endorse a proposal that confidential discussions on defence policy should bearranged between themselves and the Government.Law 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorCommissions   of the Ducriy 0f Lancaster (C. (64) 27) about the establishment ofLaw Commissions for England and Wales and for  Scotlandrespectively.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the HomeAffairs Committee had considered proposals for the creation of aLav/ Commission for England and Wales, composed of five lawyersof high standing who would be appointed, with their supporting staff,by the Lord Chancellor. The Commission would have the task of planning a systematic review of the English law; carrying outconsolidation and statute law revision; putting forward proposals forthe reform of particular areas of the law; and providing departments with a research and advisory service, particularly on commonwealth and foreign law. It was proposed that a similar body should beSECRET5586-3 a 2N1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill would receive its second Reading on Monday, 21st December; and it was agreed in discussion that, although there would be a free vote, any ministers who supported the retention of the death penalty should preferablyabstain from voting rather than vote against the Bill. Ministers should inform junior Ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretariesaccordingly, on the understanding that they would not be pressed toact otherwise than in accordance with their conscience.
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the lord advocate jointly, in order to review Scottish law.The Committee had considered that bodies with the proposedfunctions would be valuable instruments for securing a systematicreform of the law; but they had been concerned to find a means of reconciling the exercise of initiative by the Law Commission for england and Wales with the responsibility of Departmental ministers for the law within the field for which they were answerable toParliament and, therefore, to establish that the Commission would operate under the ultimate authority of the Cabinet. In.many fieldsissues of law and of policy were closely related. Moreover, it mightbe desirable on occasion to ensure that particular topics were notexamined at a time which might be inopportune in relation to thedevelopment of Government policy and that questions involvingimportant political and social issues were examined by anappropriately constituted body, which might, for example, be a departmental Committee or the Criminal Law Revision Committeerather than the Law Commission. It was therefore proposed that theLaw Commission for England and Wales should submit to the LordChancellor from time to time a programme for the detailed examination of particular aspects of the law, together with recommendations on the manner in which the examination shouldbe undertaken. The Lord Chancellor, before approving theprogramme, would consult the Ministers concerned; and any proposals on which agreement could not be reached would besubmitted to the Cabinet. The approved programme would bepublished, as would the Commission^ recommendations on areas ofthe law which it had been agreed that they should themselves examine in detail; and the Commission would make to the Lord Chancelloran annual report which would be presented to Parliament. Theposition in Scotland would be simpler. The Scottish Law commission would make their proposals to the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Lord Advocate, who would consult the appropriate EnglishMinisters on any proposals affecting the law with which they were concerned. Acceptance of the Commissions&apos; programmes would not preclude Ministers from themselves putting in hand investigationson matters of current concern; nor would they be under an obligationto consult the Commissions on Bills included in the governments programme of legislation, although it might on occasion be useful todo so.In discussion it was agreed that, although the proposals did not go as far as had originally been envisaged towards the creation ofa body with independent authority to review the law on the analogy of the Department of Law in some countries of Western Europe,Commissions on the lines proposed would nevertheless have considerable scope for valuable work. It was unlikely thatDepartmental Ministers would often find themselves unable to endorsespecific proposals in the Commission^ programme; and they wouldnot be in a position to prevent particular projects from being undertaken unless the Cabinet were prepared to support their objections. The necessary legislation should be ready for introduction
Transport ^ 4.   The First Secretary of State said that the MinisterialCo-ordination Committee on Economic Development, at their meeting on theprevious day, had considered a proposal by the Minister of transport to appoint Dr. Beeching, on his retirement from the position of chairman of British Railways at the end of the year, to make a study of transport co-ordination on the understanding that he would devotehis whole time to this undertaking for a period of five months beforereturning to private industry on 1st June, 1965. Some doubts hadbeen expressed about this proposal on the grounds that Dr. Beechingmight not be disposed to pay sufficient regard both to the place ofpublic enterprise in the national transport system and to the socialconsiderations involved in transport co-ordination. His appointmentmight also be criticised by the Trade Unions concerned, whoseco-operation would be essential both for the study itself and for the implementation of any decisions which resulted from it. In additionsome Ministers had thought it unlikely that, despite the assistance which Dr. Beeching could expect to obtain from the Ministry ofTransport and elsewhere, a satisfactory report on so wide-ranging a subject could be produced within five months. A superficial report,however, would be politically embarrassing to the Government; and,for this reason alone, it might be desirable, if Dr. Beeching was finallyappointed, for the Government to refrain from any commitment to publish his report when it was completed.The Minister of Transport said that the Government were committed to preparing a national plan for the co-ordination of thedifferent forms of transport; and they would come under increasing pressure to declare their intentions in the relatively near future. Therewas therefore an urgent need for a study on the lines proposed; and dr. Beeching, whose experience as Chairman of the Railways board had already made him familiar with many of the problems involved,was well qualified to undertake the proposed inquiry in the limitedCC. 15 (64)immediately after the Christmas Recess; but, since it would not itselfgive any indication of the manner in which the Law Commissionswere expected to work, there would be advantage in publishing an explanatory White Paper at the same time as the Bill and arrangingappropriate publicity for the proposals.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (64) 27 for the establishmentof Law Commissions for England and Wales and forScotland respectively.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate,to prepare a draft White Paper for publication at thesame time as the necessary legislation and to give furtherconsideration to other means of securing appropriatepublicity for the Governments proposals.
time available. If five months proved to be too short a period for the study, it should not be impossible to arrange for Dr. Beeching&apos;services to remain at the Governments disposal for a little longer.Some of the other criticisms of the proposal should be met if it waspossible to dispel the misconception that Dr. Beeching would act inan executive capacity as &quot; overlord &quot; of the country&apos;s transport system and to make it clear that he would merely be invited to advise theGovernment on the problems involved.In discussion it was suggested that Dr. Beeching had alreadyshown that in principle he favoured further co-ordination of transport on lines similar to those advocated by the Government and that the criticism of his suitability for the proposed appointment was to this extent unfounded. On the other hand, although a formal committeewould be liable to prove too elaborate a means of conducting the rapid inquiry which was needed, it was essential that all the interests concerned should have an adequate opportunity to make their viewsknown. It would therefore be appropriate that Dr. Beeching shouldbe assisted by a strong panel, comprising representatives of the road and rail trade unions, the road haulage interests and independentindividuals with experience of the economics of transport. It wouldbe preferable that the members of the panel should not be regardedas merely assessors but that they should take an active part in the inquiries and discussions leading to the final report.In further discussion there was general agreement with the viewthat the study might well require more than five months if it was tobe satisfactorily completed, although there were strong arguments infavour of its findings being available to the Government well beforethe end of 1965. It was also agreed that the Government should give no undertaking to publish the eventual report, if only on the grounds that it might contain confidential information acquired from private interests, e.g., individual road hauliers, which could not properly bemade public.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared to be the general view of the Cabinet that Dr. Beechingshould be invited to undertake the proposed study on transportco-ordination on the basis that he would be assisted by a strongadvisory panel which would be actively associated with his inquiries,that the period of the study might need to be extended beyond31st May, 1965, and that the Government would reserve their position about the publication of the report. The public announcement of dr. Beeching&apos;s appointment should take account of these points, sofar as necessary; and the terms of reference of the inquiry should be amended in order both to emphasise that the review would be directed to the co-ordination of transport within an expanding economy andto require Dr. Beeching to take account of the social, as well as theeconomic, aspects of the issues involved. The Government shouldalso be prepared, if necessary, to consider the desirability ofsubsequently appointing a full-scale Committee to examine the scope for transport co-ordination in the light of the recommendations madeby Dr. Beeching. But this possibility, which should not be publicly announced at this stage, could be held in reserve.
Prices and 5.   The First Secretary of State said that he had now reachedIncomes agreement with representatives of both sides of industry on a joint statement of Intent on prices and incomes. It was hoped that the text would receive the approval of the five bodies concerned atseparate meetings on the morning of Wednesday, 16th December;and their spokesmen would join the Ministers concerned later that day in a formal ceremony at which the Statement would be signed.The Statement was only the first, but nevertheless a very important,step towards a difficult objective; and, if properly presented to publicopinion, it should both contribute to the renewal of international confidence in sterling and provide a firm foundation on which todevelop the Governments domestic policies for economic expansion.Work was already in hand on the next stage, which would be concerned with the machinery for implementing the intentionsoutlined in the Statement; and he hoped shortly to submit proposals to his colleagues with a view to starting the next instalment of negotiations with the two sides of industry, possibly through theNational Economic Development Council, early in the following.month.In discussion the Cabinet congratulated the First Secretary ofState on securing general endorsement of the joint Statement of intent on prices and incomes. It was agreed, however, that the extentto which the signatories of the Statement would regard themselves as genuinely committed to its objectives would become clearer duringthe next stage of more detailed negotiations.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the first secretary of State about the joint Statement of Intent on prices and incomes.Judicial 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordSalaries Chancellor (C. (64) 26) about the salaries of the higher judiciary.The Lord Chancellor said that the salaries of the judges, whichwere fixed by statute, had been last increased in 1954 after an interval of 120 years. Although the increase granted on that occasion hadbeen intended to suffice for a generation, its value had been rapidlyeroded; and the fact that the lower judiciary had received three salary increases in the interval since 1954 had resulted in an unrealisticC.C. 15 (64)The Cabinet -Invited the Minister of Transport, in pursuing the proposalfor the appointment of Dr. Beeching to make a study oftransport co-ordination, to be guided by the points madeby the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.
reduction in the differential between their salaries and those of thehigher judiciary. The existing salaries of the judges were nowinsufficient to attract individuals of the highest calibre to the Bench;and the Lord Chief Justice had advised both his predecessor and himself that the judges themselves now considered that they had avery strong claim to an increase in their remuneration. The Sub-Committee on Prices and Incomes of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development, who had considered the question, had therefore recommended that legislation should be introduced in Juneor July 1965 in order to increase the salaries of the higher judiciary with effect from September. They had judged it undesirable that, any public announcement to this effect should be made in the immediate future,in view of its possible impact on the incomes policy which theGovernment were seeking to promote; but they had agreed that the judges and the previous Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, should beinformed of the Governments intentions in confidence. The quantumof the increase would be a matter for further discussion between theMinisters primarily concerned.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Cabinet Approved C. (64) 26.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th December, 1964.
