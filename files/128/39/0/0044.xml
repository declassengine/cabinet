Oversea AffairsDominicanRepublicRann of KutchSouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 26thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that for many years theDominican Republic had been under the dictatorship of GeneralTrujillo. On his assassination in May, 1961, general elections had brought to power the Government of Mr. Bosch, whose policies,although radical rather than Communist, had become increasinglysubject to Communist influence. In 1963 Mr. Bosch&apos;s Governmenthad been ejected by a military group which had now itself beenoverthrown, during the recent uprising, by elements which supportedMr. Bosch. Their first attempts had been largely ineffective; but the leadership of the rising had recently passed to certain individuals whohad clearly had expert training in armed rebellion and it now seemed likely that they would be successful. Small arms had been distributedwidely throughout the capital, where great disorder had prevailed forseveral days and foreign residents had been in serious danger. Therewas little doubt that the action of the United States Government,in despatching a military force to the island, had contributed to the saving of human life. It could perhaps be argued, however, that theUnited States intervention had been on a larger scale than was required for this purpose; and it was fortunate, therefore, that theUnited States Government had now invoked the assistance of theOrganisation of American States (OAS) in dealing with the situation.The fighting had been brought to a halt; and it seemed possible thatthe United States troops might gradually be replaced by an OASpeace-keeping force until a new Government was installed.The situation had been somewhat complicated by the recentstatement by the President of the United States, President Johnson,that the United States Government intended to prevent theestablishment of any Communist Government in the western hemisphere. But, although we might not be able to endorse this statement in all its implications, we could defend the United Statesintervention in the Dominican Republic as having stabilised a critical situation and provided the circumstances in which the OAS couldseek to promote a political settlement of the dispute.The Prime Minister said that the United Kingdom high commissioners in India and Pakistan had succeeded in obtaining theagreement of the two Governments concerned to a cessation of fighting in the Rann of Kutch; and he hoped that this might besucceeded by a formal cease-fire.The Prime Minister said that the current debate on SouthernRhodesia in the United Nations Security Council might well continue until after the Rhodesian elections on 7th May. It appeared that itwould not be necessary for us to veto the draft Resolution which hadbeen tabled during the debate and that on its merits we could properly abstain. We must recognise, however, that our abstentionCC 28 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
could be misrepresented as implying that we tacitly accepted thecompetence of the United Nations to discuss the problem of SouthernRhodesia. This was contrary to the attitude adopted by the previous administration and might be regarded by the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia as constituting an act of provocation which would justify them in making a unilateral declaration of independence.Australia and The Commonwealth Secretary said that, during his recent visitNew Zealand   to Australia and New Zealand, he had attended meetings of the cabinets in both countries and had been asked to convey theirgreetings to the United Kingdom Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Trade UnionsDeductionof UnionSubscriptionsfrom Pay(previous reference:CC (65) 14thConclusions,Minute 6)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C (65) 69) on the deduction of trade union subscriptionsfrom pay.The Lord President recalled that in their previous discussion theCabinet had reached no conclusion on a request from the Staff Sideof the National Whitley Council that trade union subscriptionsshould be deducted from the pay of the members of any Civil service staff association which sought this facility. He had subsequentlyconsidered the issues more fully in consultation with the ministers concerned. They had concluded that the original proposal, whichcontemplated deductions at differential rates according to whetherthe political levy was paid or not, was unacceptable, since it might enable the Government to deduce trends in political opinion among members of the Civil Service from the fluctuations in the numberswho paid the political levy. An alternative proposal that subscriptionsshould be deducted at a single rate, including the levy, leavingmembers who contracted out to claim a subsequent refund from theunion, was objectionable on legal and political grounds; and theunions had shown themselves unwilling to accept the deduction ofthe industrial contribution only. The Union of Post Office workers and the Post Office Engineering Union had suggested, however, thatdeductions should be made at a rate which included the political levyand that unions should pay to members who contracted out, inadvance at the beginning of the financial year, the amount whichwould be deducted in respect of the levy during the year. Thisarrangement was not open to the objections which had been advanced against the previous proposals; and, while it might not entirely dispose of the criticism that the Government were facilitatinga deduction which benefited only their own Party or suffice to preventthe introduction of a Private Member&apos;s Bill to prohibit the deduction of trade union subscriptions from the pay of civil servants, itappeared to be preferable, on balance, to accept these risks than torefuse to the Civil Service unions a facility which was increasinglybeing provided by private employers and the nationalised industries.If the facility were given to the Civil Service unions, however, it could
Immunities and privileges forTheCommonwealthSecreiariat(previous reference:CC(65) 23rdConclusions,Minute 1)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 70) about immunities and privileges for the Commonwealth Secretariat.The Chancellor of the Duchy recalled that at their previous meeting the Cabinet had felt unable to agree on the scale of diplomatic privileges to be accorded to the senior officers of theCommonwealth Secretariat, other than the &quot; High Officers&quot; whowould enjoy the full diplomatic range of immunities and privileges.The Cabinet had invited the Home Affairs Committee to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of proposing for the senior officers ofthe Secretariat some scale of privileges which would be more modestthan the full diplomatic scale but more generous than the scalenormally accorded to the generality of international organisationssituated in London.The Home Affairs Committee had been unable to reach agreement on this issue. They had recognised the force of thearguments against conceding full diplomatic status, to the officers inquestion, as follows :(i) Such status was required to protect members of a diplomatic mission of one sovereign country in the territory of another and toenable them to discharge their functions without hindrance from theauthorities of. the country in which they served.not be withheld from employees of the National Health Service, whowere likely to ask for it. It would be essential in negotiating theadministrative details with the Staff Side of the National whitley council to ensure that deductions were wholly voluntary and weremade only on the individual written request of the individuals concerned.In discussion it was suggested that the arrangements negotiatedwith the National Staff Side should ensure that no obstacle was putin the way of a member of a union who might wish to withdraw his request for the deduction of union subscriptions from his pay.Members who contracted out would be adequately safeguardedagainst failure or delay in paying the amounts which they would beentitled to receive in respect of the political levy by the union&apos;? legal obligation to relieve them of the levy and by their right of recourse to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.The Cabinet -Agreed that the Government should, if so requested, accepta scheme for the deduction of trade union subscriptionsfrom pay on the lines, and subject to the safeguards,indicated in C (65) 69.
(ii) The Commonwealth Secretariat, however, was not a diplomatic mission. It was an international organisation, whose members would not require this status for the efficient discharge oftheir functions.(iii) If the senior staff of the Secretariat were granted a more generous scale of immunities and privileges than was strictlynecessary in functional terms, this would be liable to expose us to pressure for the extension of a similar concession to other international organisations.(iv) There would be intensified public and parliamentary criticism if we acquiesced in a further increase in the number of oversea officers and their families who were enabled to commitoffences in the United Kingdom with impunity.On the other hand the Committee had appreciated that it couldbe urged in favour of conceding full diplomatic status that:(v) We ought not to be thought by the other members of theCommonwealth to be reluctant to make a concession which they regarded as essential to the success of the Secretariat.(vi) Individuals of the high quality required, who would also be qualified for senior posts on the staff of their countries&apos; HighCommissions in London, might be unwilling to accept posts in the secretariat if these were of lower status and entailed feweradvantages.(vii) As the senior organisation of the Commonwealth, the secretariat could reasonably be regarded as unique; and, even if thisview proved over-optimistic, the successful inauguration of the secretariat was of sufficient importance to outweigh the possibleembarrassment of creating a precedent.Unless the Cabinet were prepared to reconsider the compromise which they had previously rejected (namely that the senior officersof the Secretariat should be allowed reasonable quantities of duty-freeliquor and tobacco and a refund of petrol duty but should not begranted personal immunity) it would be necessary to decide which of these conflicting considerations should prevail. His own view wasthat the balance of advantage lay in granting full diplomaticimmunities and privileges to all senior officers of the Secretariat.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was strong pressure from other Commonwealth Governments for the grant of full diplomatic status to.the senior members of the Secretariat; andthere was no doubt that, if the Secretariat were to be sited in anyother capital, this status would be conceded without question by theGovernment of the country concerned. Moreover, even if we decidedto refuse it as a matter of principle, it would be open to other commonwealth Governments to circumvent us by appointing theofficers in question to the staff of their High Commissions in Londonand subsequently seconding them to the Secretariat.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Minister of overseas Development, who was absent through illness, had asked
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (65) 68) on the law relating to homosexual offences.The Home Secretary said that Lord Arran would move in theHouse of Lords on 12th May a Motion &quot; to call attention to therecommendations of the Wolfenden Committee on HomosexualOffences; and to move for Papers&quot;. He was expected to addresshimself in particular to the recommendation that homosexualbehaviour between consenting adults in private should cease to bea criminal offence; and he was likely to receive considerable support.But strong opinions were also held in the opposite sense; and thesubject was not one on which the Government could contemplateintroducing legislation in the foreseeable future. It was proposed,therefore, that the Government spokesman in the debate should refrain from advising either for or against the implementation of theWolfenden Committee&apos;s major recommendations but should indicatethat the proper course for those who wished to promote the that the discussion should not prejudice the proposal currently underdiscussion for the grant of certain immunities and privileges to the senior staff of the Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit (CELU).Some members of the Cabinet took the view that there shouldbe no extension of immunities and privileges to the senior membersof the Secretariat, either on the full diplomatic scale or in the modified form proposed in their earlier discussion. The offences committed by diplomatic representatives in London in the previous year, in respect of which they could claim immunity, had been ona scale which might well evoke strong public criticism; and thiswould be exacerbated by any extension of diplomatic privilege.Moreover, there was considerable reason to believe that the customsfacilities accorded to diplomatic representatives were not infrequentlyabused. Finally, the extension of privileges in cases where they werenot required for the efficient discharge of the duties and functionsinvolved might undermine our attempt to limit their scope in relationto international organisations in general. The balance of opinion,however, was in favour of the concession of full diplomatic status,as proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary, on the ground that theCommonwealth Secretariat could reasonably be regarded as uniqueand that it was important to the Governments Commonwealth policy that it should be seen to be so. The subsequent consideration of the privileges to be accorded to the CELU must proceed on this basis.The Cabinet Approved the extension of full diplomatic immunities and privileges to the senior officers of the CommonwealthSecretariat.

The Law 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeRelating to      Secretary (C (65) 68) on the law relating to homosexual offences.HomosexualOffences The Home Secretary said that Lord Arran would move in theHouse of Lords on 12th May a Motion &quot; to call attention to therecommendations of the Wolfenden Committee on HomosexualOffences; and to move for Papers&quot;. He was expected to addresshimself in particular to the recommendation that homosexualbehaviour between consenting adults in private should cease to bea criminal offence; and he was likely to receive considerable support.But strong opinions were also held in the opposite sense; and thesubject was not one on which the Government could contemplateintroducing legislation in the foreseeable future.

Finally, the extension of privileges in cases where they werenot required for the efficient discharge of the duties and functionsinvolved might undermine our attempt to limit their scope in relationto international organisations in general. The balance of opinion,however, was in favour of the concession of full diplomatic status,as proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary, on the ground that theCommonwealth Secretariat could reasonably be regarded as uniqueand that it was important to the Governments Commonwealth policy that it should be seen to be so. The subsequent consideration of the privileges to be accorded to the CELU must proceed on this basis.The Cabinet Approved the extension of full diplomatic immunities and privileges to the senior officers of the CommonwealthSecretariat.
amendment of the law was to introduce a Private Member&apos;s Bill.He might then indicate that the Government would not obstructsuch a Bill and would accept a decision of Parliament on a free vote;or, alternatively, he might undertake that, if there appeared to bea general wish that a Private Member&apos;s Bill should be discussed andthis could not be done unless the Government provided time, theGovernment would consider doing so, although not in the present session. The Home Affairs Committee had preferred the latter course.If, as seemed likely, Lord Arran pressed his Motion to a division,it was suggested that Government supporters, including Ministers,should vote according to their personal judgment.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the veryconsiderable Parliamentary difficulties which normally confronted a controversial Private Member&apos;s Bill if it received no assistance fromthe Government, it might be desirable that the Government should provide time to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on thequestion of homosexual offences if it was clear that both Houses ofParliament wished to do so. This would follow the precedents ofSir (then Mr.) A. P. Herberts Matrimonial Causes Act and thecurrent Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill. On the other hand it was not clear, as it was in the case of the problem of capital punishment, that a majority of either the members of the House ofCommons as a whole or the Governments own supporters were infavour of amending the law on homosexual offences. And, if therewas, in fact, a substantial demand for legislation, it should be possiblefor the promoters of a Bill to muster sufficient support to secure thatit was debated on a Friday. In the present political situation, however,no undertaking should be given to provide time for a PrivateMembets Bill, although this need not preclude reconsideration of thematter in the light of any later developments in public opinion. nor should any undertaking be given not to obstruct the passage of aPrivate Membets Bill, since it would be impolitic to attribute anybias to the Government in this context.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment spokesman in the debate in the House of Lords should maintain a strictly neutral attitude, indicating merely that the subject was one on which changes in the law would normally be sought bymeans of a Private Member&apos;s Bill. If he were asked whether theGovernment would provide facilities for such a Bill, he should makeit clear that it would have to follow the usual course without government assistance. Ministers should feel free to vote on the motion according to their personal judgment; but the government spokesman should make it clear that they were voting as individuals,not as representatives of the Government.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the debate on lord Arran&apos;s Motion on the law relating to homosexualoffences to be conducted in the manner indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing up.
ComputerIndustryComputers forGovernmentDepartments6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the first secretary of State (C (65) 65), the Minister of Technology (C (65) 66)and the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C (65) 67)about the procurement of computers for Government Departments.The First Secretary of State said that it had recently become clear that United Kingdom computers, particularly the largermachines, were less competitive with foreign computers than hadbeen generally assumed. It had therefore been suggested that, in orderto give the necessary support and encouragement to the domesticindustry, two outstanding Government orders for large computersshould be awarded to United Kingdom firms, despite the fact thatin one case (a computer required by the Scottish Departments) a united States subsidiary company, International Business Machines(UK), Ltd. (IBM (UK)) had submitted a lower tender than themain United Kingdom contender, International Computers andTabulators, Ltd. (ICT), and in the other case (a computer requiredby the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough (RAE) itappeared likely, although tenders had not yet been invited, that, heretoo, IBM (UK) would submit the lowest quotation. In the case ofthe Scottish computer the IBM product was not only considerablycheaper, perhaps by as much as 25 per cent, than the ICT counterpartbut was also markedly superior in terms of capacity and operation.On these grounds there was a clear case for accepting the IBMtender; and any suggestion that a decision to this effect woulddiscriminate unfairly in favour of a United States industry could berebutted by the argument that the IBM subsidiary in question had been established in a Scottish development area with the encouragement of the Government and was making a valuable contribution to local employment. It would be desirable, however, to try to offset any impression that the Government were unconcernedabout the future of the United Kingdom computer industry; and afurther attempt should therefore be made to establish whether the requirement at the RAE could properly be met by a United Kingdomcomputer. For this purpose it would probably be necessary eitherto limit the field of permitted tenders to United Kingdom companiesor to allow open tender and to decide in the light of the resultwhether any of the quotations by United Kingdom firms could beregarded, perhaps with the benefit of some margin of pricedifferential, as sufficiently competitive to merit the award of theorder.The Minister of Technology said that he was not concerned to seek deliberately to exclude United States interests from ourcomputer procurement or to establish an undue measure of protection for the United Kingdom industry. On the other hand, theGovernment had a responsibility to use their own requirements,which accounted for no more than about 10 per cent of the market,to encourage the United Kingdom industry; and it would be consistent with this policy if the needs of Government departments for computers were met by the purchase of United Kingdommachines unless no United Kingdom machine could satisfy the
requirement or the purchase of a United Kingdom machine wouldinvolve a serious delay (say, two years) or there was a gross disparity(say, 25 per cent or more) between the tender prices for UnitedKingdom and foreign machines respectively. The enforcement ofthese stipulations should secure an interval in which the measures now being taken by his Department to encourage the UnitedKingdom computer industry to become more competitive wouldhave time to yield results. It was significant that since his memorandum had been circulated another United Kingdom firm,English Electric, Ltd., had submitted a tender for the Scottishcomputer at a price which, although still in excess of the IBM price,was significantly lower than the price quoted by ICT. They hadundoubtedly been assisted in doing so by the fact that they had recently received orders for six computers for the Post Office; andthis illustrated the advantages to be gained from the rationalisation of ordering and production which he would hope progressively topromote if the United Kingdom industry were given a reasonablemeasure of protection for a relatively short time.Moreover, the comparison between the IBM and ICT machinesin the case of the Scottish computer was by no means as unfavourable to the latter as had been suggested, whether in terms of cost orcapacity or operation; and the fact that the IBM company wereprepared to provide extensive programming support for theirmachine was evidence not of its technical superiority but of thecompany&apos;s determination to establish a foothold in the UnitedKingdom market for this particular model of computer and to makeus even more dependent than at present on imports of their machines,which were already at a wholly excessive level. In these circumstances and having regard to the new tender recently submitted by english electric, Ltd., it would not be unreasonable that the contract for theScottish computer should be placed with a United Kingdom firm andthat in the case of the computer for the RAE the invitations to tender should be confined to the three United Kingdom companies,ICT, English Electric and Elliott Automation.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance emphasised the importance of avoiding any delay in the payment of social security benefits or any breakdown of the system as a result ofinadequacy of equipment. Moreover, delay would be expensive interms of eventual savings foregone, which, in the case of certaincomputers to be installed in the Regions for the payment of national insurance short-term benefits, could be well over  1 million a year if United Kingdom machines were installed despite the costadvantage of United States machines. For these reasons, any criteriagoverning future purchases of computers by the Government mustallow sufficient latitude to enable her Department to adjust itsprocurement programme in the light of the overriding need to beable to discharge its obligations promptly and efficiently.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Scottish computer had been under consideration since1962. Tenders had been invited in March, 1964, and had beensubmitted during the summer of that year. Since the ICT tender
showed so marked a cost disadvantage and the more recent english electric tender would involve an unacceptable and expensive delay in bringing the computer into operation, it would be virtually impossible at this stage to reject the IBM tender without incurringa very damaging charge of retrospective discrimination which itwould be the more difficult to refute in that, in addition to its othermerits, the IBM machine provided a greater margin of spare capacity for future expansion of work. The Government would be sufficientlyprotected against any counter-accusation that they were givingpreference to a foreign product by the fact that an ICT computerhad recently been adopted by the Inland Revenue establishment at East Kilbride.(b) In any discussion of the prospects of the United Kingdomcomputer industry it was important to distinguish between theindustry based in the United Kingdom and the industry owned by united Kingdom interests. In the former sense the computer industrycomprised such foreign subsidiaries as IBM, whose contribution to employment, particularly in the development areas, was ofconsiderable value and should not be discouraged. We did not seek to protect other industries from foreign competition in this sense;and it would be invidious and unwise to single out the computer industry in this respect.(c) Whatever decisions were reached in relation to the two casesunder consideration, it was essential that measures should be takento reorganise the computer industry on a more efficient and competitive basis. Centralised ordering to meet Governmentrequirements would be valuable in assisting the industry to planahead and to achieve the economies of scale which systematicproduction should yield. Substantial Government orders forcomputers, numbering 50 or more, were under active consideration;and steps should be taken to ensure that these, to the extent to whichthey were approved, were put forward as a definite programme forpurposes of negotiations with the industry.(d) In any announcement of the criteria which the government proposed to adopt in procuring computers for their own use it wouldbe preferable to avoid any reference to a specific period as themeasure of excessive delay or a stated percentage which would rendera price disparity unacceptable. It would be wiser to indicate in general terms that preference would be given to the purchase of UnitedKingdom computers unless this would involve an unreasonable delayor a price which would render the project uneconomic.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment were politically committed to support the technologicalindustries, particularly the computer industry, which faced intenseUnited States competition and was handicapped by past neglect. Themost effective step which the Government could take for this purpose would be to promote a systematic programme of centralisedpurchasing to meet Departmental needs, based on advice from the computer unit of the Ministry of Technology which should be consulted by all Departments at a very early stage in the formulation
of their requirements. Further consideration should also be given tothe desirability of discussing with the United States computerinterests in this country possible action to curtail excessive importsof computers. As regards the two cases immediately at issue theScottish computer had now reached an advanced stage of negotiation;and the possibility of rejecting the IBM tender appeared to be small.Nevertheless, it would be desirable, before reaching a final decision,to allow a further brief interval to elapse in which only the UnitedKingdom companies concerned might be given a second opportunityto tender in relation to a specified target price, which should be fixed at a realistic level. If a United Kingdom company proved able to tender on the basis of this price and to satisfy our other requirements as regards date of operation, servicing facilities, etc., it might be awarded the contract. Otherwise, it would be necessary to accept theIBM tender. In the case of the computer for the RAE the procedure should be based on open tender; but it would be reasonable thata certain margin of price differential in favour of a UnitedKingdom company should be prescribed in the invitation to tender.If it was suggested that these arrangements constituted deliberatediscrimination in favour of United Kingdom owned companies, wemust defend our action on the grounds that, in the case of ourcomputer industry as in the case of our agriculture, we had decided,as a matter of deliberate policy, to provide a measure of support and encouragement to the United Kingdom producer. At the sametime we must be prepared to make, on an appropriate occasion, apublic statement of our policy in relation to the computer industry;and this might be on the lines proposed in C (65) 66, as modified inthe light of discussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of technology and other Ministers concerned, to arrangefor the procurement of the computers for the ScottishDepartments and the Royal Aircraft Establishment,Farnborough, to proceed on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Technology, to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of taking action to reducethe import of computers.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to institute arrangements forcentralised purchasing of all computers to meetGovernment requirements.(4) Invited the Minister of Technology to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given, in the light of their discussion,to the terms in which the Governments policy in relationto the computer industry might be publicly announced on an appropriate occasion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th May, 1965.
