-    18SECRET 3CC 15 (65)The Prime 1.   The First Secretary of State expressed to the Prime MinisterMinister        (.jie Cabinefs warm congratulations on the anniversary of hisbirthday.The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues for their good wishes.Abolition ofthe death penalty(previous reference:CC(64) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Lord President said that on 5th March the House ofCommons had adopted a Motion that Standing Committee C shouldbe discharged from further consideration of the Murder (Abolitionof Death Penalty) Bill and that the Bill should be committed to aCommittee of the whole House. In this situation four courses ofaction appeared to be open to the Government:(a) To accept the decision of the House. This would implydevoting four or five days of Parliamentary time to the committee stage of the Bill and, possibly, a further three days to its remaining stages.(b) To send the Bill back to Standing Committee by resolution of the House, in order that the discussion should be resumed at thepoint at which it had been interrupted. The necessary Motion,however, would occupy most of one day; and, since the opposition had indicated that they might table a number of amendments onReport, a further three or four days might be occupied by theremaining stages of the Bill.(c) To accept the decision of the House but to secure, by resolution, that the House should sit on Wednesday mornings forconsideration of the Committee stage of the Bill. If all amendmentscould be defeated, this would enable the Government to dispense with a Report stage; but they might then be subjected to pressure to accord similar treatment to other Private Members&apos; Bills.(d) To abandon the attempt to secure the passage of the Billin the current Session.The balance of advantage appeared to incline in favour of adopting the third course.In discussion it was generally agreed that the Bill ought, ifpossible, to be passed in the current Session. In favour of the course recommended by the Lord President it was argued that theadvantage which the Government might enjoy over the opposition in securing the attendance of their supporters on Wednesdaymornings might discourage the Opposition from attempting to securethe committal of other Bills to a Committee of the whole House. Onthe other hand to adopt a novel means of dealing with the Murder(Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill might suggest that the government attached disproportionate importance to a measure which did notcommand the unanimous support of public opinion; and it might be preferable, therefore, to deal with that Bill during normal hours of sitting and to devote Wednesday mornings to the Committee stage
of some other measure. This, however, might create embarrassment,since no Government Bills which could be dealt with in this mannerwere at present available and to transfer Private Members&apos; Bills fromStanding Committee C to a Committee of the whole House wouldbe liable to give undue prominence to measures which, in some cases,the Government might not wish to see enacted.In further discussion it was suggested that certain of theGovernments supporters might move an amendment to the Bill toprovide for the establishment of an independent body to advise theHome Secretary on the exercise of his discretion to release personssubject to life imprisonment. This proposal was designed to allaypublic anxiety; but it would nevertheless be desirable to seek to dissuade its supporters from moving the relevant amendment in committee in order to avoid the expenditure of Parliamentary time on a Report stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet agreed that the least objectionable course would be to acceptthe decision of the House committing the Bill to a Committee of thewhole House and to arrange for it to be so considered at specialsittings on Wednesday mornings. Provided that the principle of a free vote on the issue of the death penalty was preserved, arrange-ments should be made to prevent, if possible, the adoption of any amendments to the Bill.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to make arrangements for thefurther consideration of the Murder (Abolition of death penalty) Bill on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister inhis summing up of their discussion.Parliament 3.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Iron and steel nationalisation(previous reference:CC(64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Prime Minister said that it had come to his attentionthat at a recent unofficial meeting in the House of Commons, whichhad been attended by several members of the Government, therehad been some discussion about the forthcoming legislation on there-nationalisation of iron and steel. It was undesirable thatspeculation on this subject should be encouraged, particularly at atime when the Cabinet had not yet considered the form and content of the relevant Bill; and all Ministers should therefore take great care to avoid being drawn into any discussion which might throwdoubt on the collective responsibility of the Government in relationto this politically sensitive issue.
OverseaAffairsFederalGermanRepublic5. The Prime Minister said that the outcome of the visit whichhe and the Foreign Secretary had recently paid to the federal german Republic had been reasonably satisfactory, particularly sinceGerman public opinion had been favourably impressed by the factthat United Kingdom Ministers had visited Berlin before proceeding to the Federal capital at Bonn.In the discussions in Bonn the Federal Government had emphasised their concern to promote some new initiative by theWestern Powers in relation to the reunification of Germany; and wehad agreed that discussions for this purpose should be undertakenwithin the Ambassadorial Group in Washington. We had also expressed the hope that the Federal Government would be equallydisposed to sponsor an Anglo/German initiative on the organisationof the nuclear capability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO); but they had been reluctant to endorse this procedurewholeheartedly and had been anxious to ensure that in thediscussions now to be undertaken in the Working Group in Paris theoriginal proposals for a multilateral nuclear force should still figureno less prominently than our own project for an Atlantic nuclear force.The Federal authorities had been not unsympathetic to our suggestion that, despite the absence of any prospect that the UnitedKingdom could accede to the European Economic Community(e.c.) in the near future, discussions should now be undertakenabout the means by which closer functional links between theCommunity and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) mightbe created. It would be desirable, therefore, to give furtherconsideration to the basis on which we might recommend to ourassociates in EFTA that such discussions should be set in train.On the issue of the contribution made by the federal government to the foreign exchange costs of maintaining UnitedKingdom forces in Germany we had made very clear to the federal authorities the dissatisfaction with which we viewed the operationof the current Agreement for this purpose. The federal chancellor, Dr. Erhard, had therefore undertaken to issue instructions to the Federal Ministries concerned to seek fresh meansof offsetting the costs in question by increasing Federal purchases in the United Kingdom in relation both to the requirements of theFederal Government for their own purposes and to certain venturesof oversea development to which they might contribute. these possibilities should now be vigorously explored by the UnitedKingdom departments concerned. At the same time we had made itclear to the Federal Government that v/e proposed to undertake afurther review of the current Agreement in a few months&apos; time andthat, unless some means of improving its operation had by then been devised, we might be compelled to suggest that the Agreement shouldbe abrogated at the end of the first year of its two-year currency and that a,new two-year Agreement should be negotiated on a more acceptable basis, to run from 1st April, 1965, to 31st March, 1967.
WesternEuropeanUnionVietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 14thConclusions,Minute 1)In discussion, the Cabinet expressed their appreciation of theefforts which the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary had made to improve relations between the United Kingdom and theFederal Republic of Germany. It was suggested that, in negotiatingany fresh arrangements to promote Federal purchases in the UnitedKingdom in relation to development projects in other countries, weshould take care to ensure that the content and timing of our ownprojects of oversea development were not adversely affected.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement about the discussions which he and the Foreign secretary had recently held with representatives of the Governmentof the Federal German Republic.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the basis on which we mightpropose to our associates in the European Free trade association that the Association should seek to take afresh initiative in establishing closer functional co-opera-tion with the European Economic Community.The Foreign Secretary said that the meeting of the western european Union in Rome, which he had attended after leavingBonn, had also been broadly satisfactory. With the exception of therepresentative of the French Government who had adopted anunco-operative attitude throughout the proceedings, the spokesmenof the other Governments had responded favourably to our suggestion that they should collaborate with us in seeking to establishcloser functional links between e.c. and EFTA; and they had also expressed satisfaction with the measures which we were taking tostrengthen the United Kingdom economy.The Prime Minister said that there had been no change in thesituation as regards Vietnam since he had last stated theGovernments policy in the House of Commons on 9th March.There was still no response from the Soviet Government to our proposal that the Governments concerned should be invited toindicate their views about a possible basis for a settlement of the conflict. The forthcoming visit of the Soviet Foreign Minister,Mr. Gromyko, might, however, enable us to explore this possibilitymore effectively.The Cabinet (3) Took note of these statements.RailwayClosures(previous reference:CC(64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (65) 41) on rail closures.The Minister of Transport recalled that in a parliamentary statement on 4th November, 1964, he had undertaken to withholdconsent to any major closure which would be likely to conflict withthe regional transport plans now in preparation; to insist, in cases
where consent was given, that the track should be retained, unless this was clearly unnecessary, and to institute a new procedure for ensuring that proposals for closures which were clearly unacceptableshould not, at least for the present, be put forward by the railways board at all. Nevertheless, opposition to closures had recentlyintensified, particularly from the railway unions; and there was nowconsiderable Parliamentary support in principle for the bill introduced by Sir Alexander Spearman, m p, which would give theGovernment power to rescind consents given by the previous administration. Acceptance of this Bill, however, would entailreopening the 150 consents which had been given in the last18 months; and this would not only place the Railways Board in an impossible position but also create considerable local uncertainty andagitation. Moreover, a review of this kind would take a long timeand would be unlikely to result in the reversal of more than a few, ifany, of the previous decisions. As regards the closure of freight lines and depots, on which the opposition of the railway unions was mainlyconcentrated, he had no power to intervene. Nor would interventionbe justifiable, since these closures would enable the railways to carryan undiminished volume of traffic more efficiently and economically and, it was unlikely that the transport study now being undertaken by Lord Hinton would produce results which were inconsistent withthe current policies of the Railways Board in this respect. In short,the closure programme was an integral part of the reshaping of therailways; and, by eliminating waste and releasing resources for more productive use, it should enable them to discharge more effectivelytheir major tasks of transporting freight and passengers over longerdistances, as well as maintaining commuter services. these considerations, coupled with the major financial economies whichthe programme should yield, justified the Government in adhering totheir present policy.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the last two years railway manpower had been reducedby 16 per cent, passenger miles had decreased by only 4 per cent andton miles had increased by 5 per cent. As a result, the railways board had been able to absorb wage increases of some  40 million and their deficit had been reduced by some  30 million. Even if the savings had been derived mainly from the reduction in manpower and the increase in freight traffic had been less than the growth in freight generally, the improvement denoted by these figures was significant; and any major departure from present policies,particularly any attempt to halt freight closures would inevitablyreverse this process. As against this consideration it would bemistaken to assess the results of current policies only in terms of the improved return on the Board&apos;s own assets which they secured; andthe balance of economic advantage in relation to any individualclosure proposal should take account not only of the effect on theBoard&apos;s finances but also of the impact on the economic life of that section of the community affected by the closure.
(b) It would help to put the Governments policy in betterperspective if the established procedure for making a preliminary examination of major closure proposals at an early stage, with a viewto rejecting those which were clearly unacceptable, could be shown to be really effective by arranging for a small number of such proposals to be brought forward in the near future for rejection. TheRailways Board, however, had preferred to withdraw one case of thiskind rather than to allow it to be rejected. Moreover, it would in any event take the Board some time to submit proposals in the detailrequired by the Minister in accordance with the recognisedprocedure in such cases. Nevertheless, proposals of this kind, whensubmitted, should provide the Minister with an opportunity to demonstrate the Governments readiness to reject closures whichwere incompatible with regional transport plans.(c) In order to reinforce the Governments concern on this point the newly created Regional Boards and Councils should be invitedto consider proposals for major passenger closures before they were submitted to the Transport Users&apos; Consultative Committees(TUCCs). It would be preferable that these Boards and councils should be asked to advise on all proposals of this kind rather thanonly on those which had survived the procedure for preliminary consideration.(d) The railway unions maintained that decisions on freightclosures, on which they were not consulted, often prejudiced laterdecisions on the closure of associated passenger services, on whichthere was established machinery for consultation. On the other hand the experience gained, for example, by the miners&apos; unions in relationto pit closures suggested that it was doubtful whether the railway unions would secure any real advantage from being associated withthe process of determining individual closures; instead, they mightwell attract criticism from their own members.(e) It was for consideration whether the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Rail and Road Transport should henceforward extend its efforts to ensure that social and economic considerations were taken into account in relation to closure proposals by rejecting anyproposal if it could be shown that closure of the services in question might affect the studies on the co-ordination of transport which werebeing undertaken by Lord Hinton. Action of this kind, however,should not be allowed to encourage the misconception that allpassenger closures could be halted until such time as Lord Hintonproduced his report.(/) Dissatisfaction was also being currently expressed with theGovernments policy in relation to railway workshops and the useof railway land. The question of railway workshops was shortly tobe considered by the Ministerial Committee on economic development; but meanwhile there would be advantage in invitingRegional Councils and Government Departments to considerwhether any additional work could be provided for them, includingthe manufacture of equipment for export to developing countries aspart of our programme of oversea aid.
N(g) Many local authorities could already acquire railway landfor housing by using their powers of compulsory purchases and theRailways Board were usually prepared to sell land to localauthorities for other purposes as well. In cases where the land wassuitable for commercial development, however, the Board had oftenpreferred to sell sites direct to a private developer. While there wasa strong case for ensuring that surplus railway land should be used,wherever possible, for the benefit of the community, any new measures adopted for its disposal should be co-ordinated with the procedures in force in relation to the disposal of land by other nationalised industries and by Government Departments.(h) In relation to railway closures in Wales it would become increasingly important to provide alternative road transport services on an adequate scale and to improve the roads.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Minister of Transports recommendation thatthe Government should resist pressures for rescinding past consentsto passenger closures and for halting all future passenger and freightclosures. They also agreed that it would be advantageous if theMinister could take an early opportunity to reject a few proposalsfor major passenger closures in accordance with the procedurewhereby such proposals were submitted to preliminary examinationat an early stage. In addition, the appropriate Regional Boards andCouncils should be invited to advise on all future proposals for passenger closures before the statutory procedure of TUCC hearingswas initiated; and the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Rail and road transport, in considering future passenger closures, should beprepared to refuse consent to those proposals which were likely to affect the studies on transport co-ordination which were being madeby Lord Hinton. The other issues which had been raised during the cabinets discussion should be examined by the appropriateMinisterial Committees as rapidly as possible; and the Minister ofTransport should seek to make a comprehensive parliamentary statement at an early opportunity about the Governments policy on railway closures and the related questions of railway workshop and land.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 41, subject to the points made by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider the future of the railway workshops and thepossibility of supplying them with additional work on thelines indicated in their discussion.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider the principles and procedures which should&apos; govern the disposal of surplus land owned by the
Railways Board, other nationalised industries and government Departments.(4) Invited the Minister of Transport to make a comprehensiveParliamentary statement at an early opportunity aboutthe Governments policy on railway closures and the related questions of railway workshops and land.Tribunals 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the home of inquiry       Secretary (C(65)31) about the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921.The Home Secretary said that in recent years public opinion had shown considerable concern about the operation of this Act on everyoccasion on which it had been necessary to establish a tribunalunder the Act. It was maintained that the inquisitorial nature of theprocedure necessarily adopted by most tribunals of this kind wasunfair; that wholly innocent and respectable individuals who mightbe involved were liable to suffer damage both in respect of their personal reputations and as regards the expenditure which theyincurred as a result of being legally represented before the tribunal;that the proceedings before the tribunal, including such matters asthe leading of evidence by Counsel, the cross-examinationof witnesses, etc., were open to criticism; and that the arrangementsfor dealing with witnesses who refused to answer questions wereunsatisfactory. In these circumstances it was desirable that theoperation of the Act should be made the subject of an independent and authoritative inquiry. It would be possible to propose theappointment of a Select Committee for this purpose. But such a bodymight, perhaps unconsciously, be influenced by political considera-tions in dealing with an issue which should be examined withjudicial impartiality; and it would be preferable, therefore, to entrust the inquiry to a Royal Commission with a judicial chairman.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether a RoyalCommission would constitute the most appropriate means of conducting the proposed review. It must be presumed that parliament would wish to retain some statutory means, other than recourse tothe Courts, of inquiring into matters of urgent public importance;and, so long as this need persisted, it seemed virtually impossible to dispense with some kind of inquisitorial procedure. In its details e.g., the powers of the tribunal, its methods of work, etc. this procedure might be capable of improvement; but it would bedesirable that the Government should themselves consider these issues before taking the major step of establishing a RoyalCommission which might appear to call in question the basicprinciple of the 1921 Act.In further discussion, it was suggested that the objections to a select Committee as the means of conducting an independent inquirywere not necessarily decisive and that it might prove to be a more
Farm price review(previous reference:CC(65) 14thConclusions,Minute 5)8. The Minister of Agriculture recalled that the Cabinet had authorised the Ministers concerned to offer to the Farmers&apos; Unions,for the purposes of the current Farm Price Review, increases in thevalue of price guarantees and production grants not exceeding .11 million in total. It had been agreed by the ministerial committee on the Review that this sum should include  8 - 8 million in respect of an increase of one penny a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk, which would imply an increase in the price of milk to the consumer of a half-penny a pint for four months during1965-66. In negotiation the Unions had therefore been offeredincreases amounting in all to  10-4 million, including the increaseof one penny a gallon in the price of milk. It had become clear, however, that there was no prospect of agreement on the basisof this offer. He had therefore explored informally with the Unionsby how much it would need to be improved in order to secure their agreement. It now appeared that this could only be achieved at thecost of an addition of a further  5 million in respect of the other agricultural guarantees, together with an increase of twopence a gallon in the price of milk which, after certain other adjustments,would imply a total increase in price guarantees and production grants amounting to  22 million. Since this was clearly unacceptable,it would be necessary to impose a settlement on the basis of the offeralready made to the Unions. This should be defensible to publicopinion; but it would be liable to be strongly criticised by the farmers.In discussion there was general agreement that in thecircumstances there was no alternative to imposing a settlement onthe basis recommended by the Minister of Agriculture.CC 15 (65)appropriate instrument for this purpose than a Royal commission under a judicial chairman. A decision on this point, however, shouldbe deferred until it had been decided whether it would be desirableto promote any form of independent inquiry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the lord president, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, theMinister without Portfolio, the Attorney-General and theLord Advocate, to give further consideration to the means by which the operation of the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, might be improved and to theextent to which an independent inquiry for this purposemight be expected to be of value.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of C(65)31 in thelight of the outcome of the action to be taken under conclusion (I) above.
The Prime Minister said that the Ministers concerned were tobe congratulated on the manner in which they had conducted aseries of difficult negotiations. Member of the Government would now need to defend the settlement in public as vigorously as possible.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Farm Price Review should be determined on the basis of increases in the price guarantees and production grants amounting in all to  10-4 million,including an increase of one penny a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to circulate to the Cabinet thedraft of the White Paper to be issued as a result of thenegotiations during the Review, together with a covering memorandum describing the basis on which thesettlement might most convincingly be presented to public opinion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th March, 1965.
