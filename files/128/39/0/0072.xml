Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Prime Minister(C. (65) 142), to which were annexed:(a) The text of the statement which the Prime Minister had madein the House of Commons on the previous afternoon describing the outcome of his consultations with the Rhodesian Government during his visit to Salisbury in the previous week.(b) The text of a report by the Commonwealth Secretary andthe Attorney-General about the result of further discussions whichthey had conducted with the Rhodesian Government since the PrimeMinister^ return from Salisbury.(c) The text of a letter which the Prime Minister of Rhodesia,Mr. Ian Smith, had sent to London on the previous day.(d) The text of part of the discussions which the former PrimeMinister and Commonwealth Secretary had held with RhodesianMinisters in London in September 1964.The Prime Minister said that he had made it clear to Mr. Smithin Salisbury that, if he was prepared to reject the advice of his more extreme supporters, it was now possible for him to lead Rhodesiaaway from the concept of a unilateral declaration of independencetowards more constitutional methods of procedure. This opportunityhad been provided to him by the suggestion which we had made towards the end of the discussions in Salisbury, namely that a RoyalCommission should now be established, on the joint recommendationof both Governments, in order to devise a means of ascertaining wether specified constitutional proposals were acceptable to thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole and so satisfying the fifth of our five principles. Mr. Smith had accepted this proposal in principle, togetherwith our suggestions about the size and composition of the RoyalCommission and our stipulation that their report should be unanimous. On the other hand there was as yet no agreement betweenthe two Governments about the content of the proposals whichshould be submitted to the test of opinion in Rhodesia once theRoyal Commission had devised a satisfactory means of conductingsuch a test.The Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-Generalconfirmed that this was so. All the discussions which they hadconducted with the Rhodesian Government after the departure of thePrime Minister from Salisbury had revealed that a fundamental difference still persisted between the two Governments about the safeguards which should be incorporated in any proposals to becanvassed by the Royal Commission in order to prevent retrogressiveamendment of the constitution after independence. In particular, itwas clear that the Rhodesian Government were determined to retain their freedom to prevent the ultimate emergence of African majority rule in Rhodesia by refusing to entrench the clauses in the constitution which governed the composition of the Legislature and so leavingthemselves free to adjust the ratio of &quot; A &quot; Roll to &quot; B &quot; Roll seats in such a way as to perpetuate a European majority. Theycontemplated the elimination of a &quot; B &quot; Roll seat in return for each6706-3
&quot; A &quot; Roll seat which was won by an African as the Africansacquired, over a period of years, the higher educational and economicqualifications which the &quot; A &quot; Roll franchise required; and they had rejected even our modest suggestion that one African &quot; B &quot; Roll seatshould not be surrendered until at least two &quot; A &quot; Roll seats wereoccupied by Africans. Moreover, although they were prepared to try to enlarge African educational opportunities, they had made it whollyclear that their motive in so doing was merely to equip the Africansto participate more effectively in the economic life of the countryand not in any way to hasten their political advancement.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were faced with a verydifficult decision. His discussions in Salisbury had made it very clearthat Rhodesia was not yet ready for independence. The AfricanChiefs, on whom the Rhodesian Government relied for support oftheir own views, were politically immature. The African Nationalistswere divided between two factions, who showed little inclination toco-operate or to adopt constitutional methods, although he had some success in compelling them to realise the realities of the situation in rhodesia and the impracticability of United Kingdom intervention by means of military force. European opinion in the country was divided between the extremist Rhodesia Front, which constituted theGovernment, and more moderate individuals such as the chief justice, Sir Robert Tredgold, Mr. Garfield Todd, Sir Roy Welensky,etc., all of whom had been shown by his discussions with them to be opposed to a unilateral declaration of independence but, for a variety of reasons, to be incapable in present circumstances of providing an effective focus of opposition to Mr. Smith&apos;s Government. african opinion outside Rhodesia was similarly divided. On his return journey he had discussed the situation with the President of Zambia,President Kaunda, who had been very apprehensive of the possibleimpact of a unilateral declaration of independence on the Zambianeconomy but had agreed with other African leaders in condemningthe attitude of Mr. Smith&apos;s Government. The Prime Minister of nigeria had also adopted a moderate tone and had been prepared togive public support to our proposal for a Royal Commission. ThePresident of Ghana had attacked it in a public statement but had shown himself, in private discussion, to be well disposed towards our efforts of conciliation. The East African leaders, in their discussions with the Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-General ontheir way home from Salisbury, had shown a similar diversity of attitude. President Nyerere of Tanzania had maintained that thereshould be no question of independence for Rhodesia until majority rule had been established, no matter how long this process might take. President Obote of Uganda had continued to insist that, in thelast resort, the United Kingdom should be prepared to intervene with military force. On the other hand the Prime Minister of Malawi.Dr. Banda, had welcomed the proposed Royal Commission; and president Kenyatta of Kenya had indicated that, provided the RoyalCommission played a genuinely constructive role and was not regarded as a mere device for gaining time, he would be prepared to try to influence the African Nationalists to co-operate with it in its work.
In these circumstances, four courses of action appeared to beopen to the Cabinet:(i) We could accept the suggestion made in Mr. Smiths latestletter that the proposal to be canvassed by the Royal commission should be the Rhodesian Governments own proposal that Rhodesiashould proceed to independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitution,with no more than the minimum of formal amendment required to eliminate the last remnants of United Kingdom control. This wouldbe on the understanding that we would accept whatever resultemerged from the procedure whereby this proposal would be put tothe test of Rhodesian opinion.(ii) We could proceed as in the first course, while making itclear that, so far from acquiescing in the Rhodesian government proposal, we openly opposed it.(iii) We could suggest that Rhodesian opinion should be given  an opportunity to choose between the Rhodesian government proposal and our own proposal for an independence constitution which would be more liberal in its character and would containmore effective safeguards against retrogressive amendment. Therewere certain precedents for providing an option of this kind inconstitutional referenda, not least the precedent of Rhodesia itself in 1923, when the population were allowed to indicate whether theypreferred to unite with South Africa or to remain associated with theUnited Kingdom.(iv) We could refuse to make any further concession to the rhodesian Government and could insist that the only proposal tobe submitted to the test of Rhodesian public opinion should be aproposal for the type of constitution which we ourselves favoured.We could indicate that, if this suggestion were rejected, we would nolonger support the proposal for a Royal Commission.The merit of the first and second courses was that they mightpostpone a unilateral declaration of independence for a few moremonths. The third and fourth would be more likely to provoke the rhodesian Government into taking early action of this kind; but theywould have the advantage that we should be more clearly seen to beadhering to our five principles.In discussion it was suggested that a fifth course might lie insubmitting the Rhodesian Governments own proposal to the test of a referendum as distinct from some procedure devised by theRoyal Commission. This would certainly be unacceptable to the rhodesian Government; but it was the one course which it was known that the African Nationalist leaders would accept. If, therefore,our objective was to take Mr. Smith at his word by showingwillingness to test the acceptability of the 1961 Constitution withoutsacrificing our principles and the support of African opinion, thiswas probably the safest course which we could pursue. On the otherhand there would be very great difficulty in ensuring that a referendum would be satisfactorily conducted in a country whosemethods were now. largely those of a police state. Nor could we
afford to appear to abandon the concept of a Royal Commission so soon after we had actively promoted it ourselves. For these reasons the effective choice appeared to lie between the second and third ofthe courses suggested by the Prime Minister. In favour of the thirdit could be urged that, so far as it was possible to predict there actions of the Rhodesian Government, they would probably rejectwhatever suggestions we made, since they had almost certainly taken the decision to assume their independence unilaterally and were merely seeking the most favourable occasion to do so. If so, it was essential that we should not appear to have sacrificed our principlesmerely in order to avoid a unilateral declaration of independence;and we should be better placed to demonstrate this to world opinionif we insisted from the outset that the proposals to be canvassedby the Royal Commission should include our own proposal for anew and more liberal constitution as well as the RhodesianGovernments proposal for the mere continuance of the 1961constitution. On the other hand it remained essential to avoid, ifpossible, a unilateral declaration of independence, having regard tothe incalculable damage which it might cause, not least to the economies of the United Kingdom and Zambia, if a state ofeconomic warfare developed between Rhodesia and Zambia and supplies of Zambian copper to the United Kingdom were interrupted.Moreover, there were grounds for questioning whether the economic measures which we had it in mind to take in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence would, in fact, prove to be effective;and every week which passed without such a declaration made it theless likely that the Rhodesian Government could maintain the stateof political unity and psychological tension which it presupposed.Finally, it was open to question whether we should be wise to commit ourselves to inviting the Royal Commission to canvass ourown proposal, since the constitution which it implied, though far more liberal than the Rhodesian Governments proposal, wouldnot be likely to be acceptable to those sections of African opinion which would be content with nothing less than African majority ruleas a prior condition of independence. For these reasons it might be preferable to adopt the second course, provided that we publiclydissociated ourselves from the Rhodesian Governments proposal and that this was made clear by the Royal Commission in thecourse of their canvassing of public opinion in Rhodesia.Admittedly, this course involved the risk that, if the proposal wereshown to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole as was not impossible, if the African members of the populationboycotted the Royal Commission procedure we might then bemorally bound to recommend to the House of Commons that independence should be granted to Rhodesia on terms which we ourselves should have condemned in advance. On the other handthis risk should be negligible in practice, particularly if the Africansrealised that we ourselves rejected the proposal which they wouldbe being invited to endorse. Moreover, the findings of the RoyalCommission should not be mandatory; and, although they would obviously carry great weight, we could not be expected to commit ourselves in advance to implement them by legislation, regardless of
ShippingIndustryFairfieldsShipyard2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a difficult situation had arisen at the shipbuilding yard of the Fairfields engineering and Shipping Company. This was a modernised yard on the Clydewhich employed some 3,500 men and had got into financial difficulties. The Receiver had informed him that money could not beCC 56 (65)their nature. The Rhodesian Government would themselves confrontthe same dilemma, if their proposal were shown to be unacceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole and we required them inadvance to accept the consequences.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet appeared to be in favour of thesecond course, although we should not count on its provingacceptable to the Rhodesian Government. In reply to the latestletter from Mr. Smith, therefore, we should agree that the RhodesianGovernmenfs own proposal should now be put to the test ofacceptability to the people of Rhodesia as a whole, provided thatwe publicly dissociated ourselves from it and insisted that this factshould be made clear by the Royal Commission; that the RoyalCommission, before canvassing it with Rhodesian opinion, should submit, for approval by both Governments, a unanimous reporton the methods by which they proposed to conduct this canvass;that, if their suggestions for this purpose were approved, they should themselves supervise whatever procedures were adopted in order to implement their findings; that we should refuse to commit ourselves in advance to accept without qualification the result of the canvass;and that, if the Rhodesian Governmenfs proposal was shown to be unacceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole, we should be free either to revive our original conception of a Royal commission as a means of devising a new constitution for Rhodesia or to remitthe issue to a constitutional conference, of course which would havethe unanimous support of African opinion.At the same time, we should inform the Rhodesian Governmentthat, if they were unwilling to accept these suggestions, we wouldbe prepared to agree that their proposal should be submitted to the test of a referendum of the whole of the adult population of rhodesia, provided that it was conducted on the basis of uninhibitedpolitical activity by all sections of the community, was subject to adequate impartial supervision and incorporated stringent safeguards against intimidation.He would propose to make an announcement to this effect inthe House of Commons on the following day, shortly after our replyto Mr. SmiUYs letter had been delivered in Salisbury. It would be helpful if he could announce at the same time the name of theUnited Kingdom representative on the Royal Commission.The Cabinet-Agreed that the reply to the latest letter from the PrimeMinister of Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, should be on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
obtained to continue the day-to-day operations of the yard after thepresent week and it would have then have to close down unlessGovernment assistance were forthcoming. The Bank of Scotland wasthe main creditor, with a first charge on loans amounting to  4 million which were unlikely to be settled in full on liquidation. Althoughthe men employed would probably find other jobs on the Clyde ifthe yard were closed down, its closure would be a profoundpsychological shock for the shipbuilding industry. Moreover, theReport of the Geddes Committee of Enquiry on Shipbuilding was due in January and might make proposals for rationalising the shipbuilding yards on the Clyde as well as in other areas. Mr. Geddeshad informed him that his Committee would not feel able to presentan interim report relating to the yard but might feel able to referspecifically to it in his eventual report. There was, therefore, a case for considering whether the Government should take steps to seethat the yard was able to carry on until the Geddes Report couldbe considered. This could be done by asking the Bank of england to advance money, with a guarantee from the Government under the borrowing (Control and Guarantee) Act of 1946. But to keep the yard going for several months might require up to  1 million andit was probable that little, if any of this money would be recovered.Moreover a permanent reconstruction of the company&apos;s financeswould probably require  3- 4 million of additional equity capital.The difficulties of the yard sprang from bad management and fromaccepting contracts for ships which could only be fulfilled at a loss.He had not yet formed a view on whether the Government should keep the firm going until the Geddes Report was available but itwould be desirable for a group of Ministers to meet under his chairmanship to consider this. The group might consist of the first secretary of State, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of technology.In discussion there was general agreement that Ministers should consider whether Government assistance, either through the Bankof England, or possibly through the Board of Trade AdvisoryCommittee, should be given to the firm for a short period until thefuture of the shipbuilding industry could be seen more clearly. Whenthe Geddes Report was received it might be desirable to considerwhether the yard should be taken over by the Government but itwould be premature to do so now.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to convene ameeting with the First Secretary of State, the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the President of the Board of Trade,the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Technology toconsider whether short-term Government assistance shouldbe given to keep the Fairfields yard in operation for thetime being.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd November, 1965,
