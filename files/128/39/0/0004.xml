The Cabinet considered a Note by the Lord President ofthe Council (C. (64) 6), to which was annexed a revised draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Speech need not include a reference to the introductionof legislation in respect of concessionary fares; but the governments intentions in this respect should be made clear during the Debate onthe Address.(b) It would be desirable in principle to introduce legislation inrespect of monopolies and mergers as soon as possible; but it wouldnot be wise at this stage to give a firm undertaking to do so in thefirst Session.(c) The Governments agricultural policy might most conveniently be described in the Speech as the continuance of thesystem of guarantees under the existing Agriculture Acts. But the implications of this statement should be more fully explained duringthe Debate on the Address.id) The Speech should indicate the Governments intention to restore control of rents, to establish a Crown Lands Commission as rapidly as possible and to provide for leasehold enfranchisement.The necessary Bills should be drafted and, if possible, introduced in that order; and legislation on rent control and the Crown LandsCommission should have priority over measures to deal withmonopolies and mergers.(e) While it would not be appropriate that the Speech should contain a specific reference to the issue of compensation for owner-occupiers displaced by development schemes, the government&apos;s policy in relation to this question should be explained during the debate on the Address.if) The issue of the abolition of capital punishment could best be raised by means of a Private Membets Bill, on which there shouldbe a free vote. This should be arranged as rapidly as possible.ig) The action against racial discrimination which wasforeshadowed in the Speech should, if possible, deal also withincitement to racial hatred. But, in view of the difficulties of devisingsatisfactory legislation for this purpose, no commitment on this point should be accepted at this stage.(h) Certain textual amendments to the draft Speech were approved.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion,the draft text of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament annexed to C. (64) 6.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would submit the text,as amended, to The Queen for Her approval.(3) Invited the Ministers concerned, in preparing for the debate on the Address, to be guided by the points made in their discussion.(4) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to give further consideration to the proposal that facilities should be be provided at an early date forthe introduction of a Private Membets Bill for theabolition of capital punishment.(5) Took note that the Home Secretary would examine further the possibility of introducing legislation to deal withincitement to racial hatred.

The industrial situation(previous reference :CC. (64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6)Docks2. The Minister of Labour said that his discussions with theemployers and the trade unions about the dispute in the docks had resulted in agreement on the appointment of a Court of Inquiry,of which Mr. Justice Devlin would be Chairman. The Court would first consider the issue of pay and might submit an interim report onthis question. Thereafter it would examine other problems relatingto the organisation of labour in the docks.Railways The Minister of Labour said that a meeting between theChairman of the Board of British Railways and the Railway unions would shortly take place. It seemed unlikely that this would resultin a settlement; but it was uncertain whether the unions would thenagree that the issue should be submitted to the National Tribunal or would decide to take other action. He would keep the situation under close review.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1964.
