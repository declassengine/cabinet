2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the 1964-65legislative programme. They discussed the various factors whichshould determine the length of the Session and the further legislation to be introduced, including the political importance of ensuring that the Bills to nationalise the iron and steel industry andto establish a Land Commission should be introduced and debatedmore or less concurrently and should be accompanied, if possible,by a Bill to provide a more satisfactory basis for the financing ofhousebuilding. Other important measures, including those relatingto new social security arrangements, leasehold reform and theParliamentary Commissioner, would also need to be taken intoconsideration.The Cabinet decided that in these circumstances the most advantageous course might be to introduce, during July, the bills to nationalise the iron and steel industry and to establish a land commission, together with such other important legislation,particularly as regards the financing of housebuilding, as could beprepared in time. At that point it would be necessary to decide howfar it would be expedient to indicate publicly whether theGovernment intended to prolong the present Session sufficiently toensure the enactment of these Bills or whether the Session shouldbe of normal length and the Bills, having lapsed on its prorogation,should be reintroduced at the beginning of the following Session.Without prejudice to this decision the planning of the legislative programme for the next Session should be based on the hypothesis that these Bills would probably be the first measures to beintroduced at its outset.legislative programme(previous reference:CC(65) 29thConclusions)The Cabinet Invited the Ministers concerned to be guided by the sense of their discussion.Oversea AffairsNorth AtlanticTreatyOrganisation3. The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions at the ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO), which was currently meeting in London, were provingreasonably satisfactory. It was perhaps significant that in the debate on South-East Asia none of the member countries, including France,had sought to argue that the United States Government should withdraw their support from South Vietnam; but they had all been concerned to express, with varying degrees of emphasis, theirconviction that the United States Government should seek to resolve the conflict by negotiation and should keep the othermembers of NATO more closely informed of their policies.SECRET 3CC 30 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The DominicanRepublic(previous reference:CC(65) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that no regimecommanding the substantial support of the Dominican people had yet emerged from the civil war in the Dominican Republic and thatthere was therefore no question, as yet, of our having to decide whether we would be prepared to extend recognition to a new government of the country. Meanwhile, substantial United states forces remained in the country. But arrangements were underdiscussion whereby they would be replaced by a peace-keepingforce recruited from the members of the Organisation of american states; and this initiative, if successful, should contribute to theestablishment of a new and constitutional Government.The Soviet Union had tabled, in the Security Council of theUnited Nations, a resolution condemning the United Statesintervention in unacceptable terms. An alternative resolution, tabled by the Government of Uruguay, was less objectionable; and,provided that it could be amended in certain respects, we might find it difficult to withhold our endorsement. On the other hand theUnited States Government might still regard the resolution as unacceptable and decide to abstain when it was brought to the vote;and in that event we should face the unwelcome prospect that, in a debate in the Security Council, we might have to adopt a formalattitude at variance with that adopted by the United StatesGovernment. Hitherto, this had happened very rarely; and it couldbe damaging to the unity of the North Atlantic Alliance. It wouldbe necessary, therefore, to give very careful consideration to our final decision on this issue.In discussion it was suggested that we might have avoided ourpresent embarrassment to some extent if we had recognised fromthe outset that the United States intervention in the DominicanRepublic had been dictated not merely by the humanitarian motiveof preventing the loss of lives but also by the political motive offrustrating the establishment of a Communist regime in the western hemisphere. By paying insufficient regard to this distinction we hadperhaps imposed an unnecessary strain on those elements of publicopinion in this country which, while supporting the North atlantic alliance in principle, were becoming increasingly doubtful aboutUnited States policy in certain respects and had only acquiescedreluctantly in the Governments endorsement of that policy inrelation to South Viet-Nam. On the other hand we had made itclear throughout that, while we endorsed the United Statesintervention in the Dominican Republic in so far as it hadundoubtedly contributed to the preservation of human life, wereserved our position on the more delicate question whether that intervention, in its political aspects, was wholly compatible with theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. We should adhere to this attitude in the further debates in the Security Council. even so, we had frankly to recognise that the United States Governmentcould not be expected to remain inactive while the DominicanRepublic lapsed into chaos and that we ourselves had benefited tosome extent from the United States action, particularly as regardsthe United Kingdom subjects whose lives had thereby been saved.
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (65) 71) on the arrangements to be madefor restraining imports of cotton textiles after the end of 1965.The President of the Board of Trade said that most of thepresent arrangements for restraining imports of low-cost cotton textiles would expire at the end of 1965 and it was therefore necessary to establish the main principles of our future policy inorder that discussions might be started with the developing countrieswhich exported cotton textiles to the United Kingdom, particularlyIndia, Pakistan and Hong Kong. It was necessary to devise a schemewhich would provide our domestic cotton textile industry with thefurther period of stability which it required in order to complete the current process of reorganisation, and would at the same timeensure to the developing countries a reasonable prospect of continuing outlets for their cotton textile exports to this country.We already imported a greater proportion of our total consumptionof cotton textiles than other major industrialised countries; and areasonable case could be made for restraining the future increase inour imports to an annual rate of \\ per cent, which was approximately the likely rate of increase in domestic consumptionas a whole. If such restraint could be maintained for a period offive years, it should allow some increase in the domestic industry&apos;ssales at home, while affording it sufficient time in which to completeits reorganisation and re-equipment. There would inevitably be some reduction in employment in the industry during this period;but alternative employment should be readily available.These objectives could best be achieved by setting a total limit on cotton textile imports from developing countries in the form ofa global quota. This might comprise some measure of individualcountry quotas, particularly if the principle of limitation would thenbe more acceptable to our oversea suppliers and the pressure on prices in the home market would be mitigated. Consideration hadbeen given to the possibility of imposing tariffs on cotton textileimports from other Commonwealth countries. It seemed unlikely,however, that tariffs could secure a sufficiently predictable level ofimports, as was essential while our own industry was beingreorganised; and they would also be contrary to our declaredcommercial policy in relation both to developing countries in generaland to Commonwealth trade in particular. A proposal of this kind would therefore be liable to be particularly embarrassing if it weremade just before the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters. This did not imply, however, that we might not considerthe possibility of introducing tariffs as a means of restraining cottontextile imports in the longer term, when our own industry had achieved greater stability; but any proposal to this effect would alsoa 3The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
have to be examined in the light of the import policies of othercountries, notably the United States and the European economic community (e.c.).The negotiations required to give effect to these proposals would be difficult and protracted; and, whatever course was adoptedwas likely to evoke considerable protest both from our overseasuppliers and from the domestic industry. But, by claiming credit for already giving far greater access than any other majorindustrialised country to the cotton textile exports of developing countries, we should be able to persuade them to accept limitationby global, and possibly country, quotas, particularly if, at the sametime, we joined with them in pressing the United States and the eec to adopt a more generous policy in this respect.In discussion there was general support for these proposals.Considerable progress had already been made in recent years inreorganising the United Kingdom cotton textile industry; inparticular, Courtaulds and Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., wererapidly expanding their interests in the industry and there was now a prospect of a radical improvement in its efficiency during the nextfew years. It was essential, therefore, that these developments shouldnot be inhibited by a continuing rapid rise in imports. It was also important, however, that the interests of the developing countries,particularly India, should be reasonably protected; and this might best be secured by the establishment of individual country quotaswithin the total limit on imports.In further discussion it was generally agreed that furtherconsideration should be given to the desirability of providingcontinuing protection to our cotton textile industry by means of acountervailing levy and to the additional possibility of establishing a Cotton Commission which would deal in imported goods orexercise control over their prices. Since the establishment of sucha Commission would be strongly opposed by the exporting countries,who would regard it as merely a means of collecting a variable levy,an indication that the Government had not dismissed it as apossible method of import restriction might induce them to adopta more reasonable attitude during the forthcoming negotiations onquotas.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that negotiations should be started with the developing countries with a view to securing on a voluntary basis a limitation of their exports of cotton textiles to this country by meansof a global quota, which might incorporate some measure of individual country quotas in order to safeguard the interests ofcertain Commonwealth countries, particularly India and Pakistan.The total limit should be allowed to increase at an annual rate of\\ per cent; and the arrangements should be negotiated, if possible,for a period of five years. Further consideration should also begiven to the possibility of introducing a countervailing levy and establishing a Cotton Commission with a view to deciding, whenthe negotiations on the quotas were completed, whether either ofthese courses or a combination of both should be adopted as part
SECRET 7CC 30 (65)of our policy in relation to cotton imports in the longer term.Meanwhile, there might be some advantage in letting it be known,during the negotiations on the quotas, that the Government had notruled out the possibility of establishing a Cotton Commission.The Cabinet Approved the proposals contained in C (65) 71, subject tothe points made in their discussion.Links betweenEFTA and the eec(previous reference:CC(65) 26thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary, discussing recent developments in Europe (C (65) 51) andthe possibility of creating links between the European Free trade association (EFTA) and the European Economic Community(e.c.) (C (65) 52), together with a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C (65) 73) on the latter subject.The Foreign Secretary said that there was a risk that the EECmight become a closed community, with serious disadvantage to our economic relationships with the United States, the rest of theCommonwealth and the other EFTA countries, since all thesecountries would then be subjected to increasing pressure to make arrangements with the Community which might be prejudicial to us.Moreover, the maintenance of an integrated Atlantic policy in defence would become increasingly difficult. There could be noquestion, in present circumstances, of our renewing our applicationto join the Common Market. But we might wish to do so at somepoint in the future; and it was to our interest to keep the optionopen. This was largely a question of the presentation of our policies,which should emphasise the positive, rather than the negative,aspects of our attitude to Europe. We should make it clear,therefore, that, provided that our essenial (but unspecified) interests were safeguarded, we should ultimately wish to join a widerEuropean market, together with any other members of EFTA who wished to accompany us, and that such a policy would becomplementary to, and not incompatible with, our membership ofthe Commonwealth and our relationship with the United States.The Prime Minister said that the gradual consolidation of efta as a free trade area and of the e.c. as a customs union wasaccentuating the division of Europe in a manner which would be detrimental to our interests and to those of the Western world as awhole. We must therefore maintain our efforts to promote closerpolitical and economic unity in Europe in a form in which we couldplay an integral part. It was difficult to envisage the ultimate solution of this problem; but in the meantime we must seek toprevent a loss of confidence or cohesion in EFTA and to bringEFTA and e.c. closer together. His recent discussions with leadersof European Socialist Parties had suggested that we should do well to take advantage of the forthcoming meeting of the EFTA Councilin Vienna to ventilate certain proposals which might at least
mitigate the division and perhaps help to promote the eventualunion of Europe. The immediate need would be served by theestablishment of a standing joint Consultative Council of the member countries of e.c. and EFTA and perhaps by an exchangeof Ambassadors between the two organisations. The terms ofreference of the Council should provide for the discussion of questions of general economic and commercial policy of particular interest to the member countries, while avoiding any duplication ofthe functions of other and more comprehensive bodies such as theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).In addition we should also canvass at the Vienna meeting,without commitment, certain proposals which had been put forward from various quarters for improving the links between EFTA andthe e.c.. These might include:(i) The creation of a new European free trading area, of which both EFTA and e.c. would be members.(ii) The maximum use of the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations to secure tariff reductions in relation to industrial products.(iii) A further reduction of tariff barriers on commercialexchanges between EFTA and e.c., the benefits of whichwould have to be extended to other countries on amost-favoured-nation basis.(iv) The formation of free trade area type arrangements for appropriate goods on the model of the recent agreementbetween the United States and Canada in relation tomotor vehicles.None of these possibilities, however, would constitute a permanent solution to the problem; and it would be important that the third and fourth proposals should not prejudice the outcome of the kennedy Round or be considered at this stage other than privately,as suggestions which might merit further examination after the kennedy Round was completed. Other possibilities which might bediscussed were:(v) The extension on a wider European basis of functionalcollaboration in the field of advanced technology.(vi) European co-operation in basic regulations and codes of practice, such as patents and industrial standards.These suggestions might be reinforced if we also indicated that wewere now actively reviewing the possibility of gradually adopting the metric system and a decimal coinage and hoped to bring these issues to the point of decision in the near future.It might therefore be advantageous to suggest at the Viennameeting that there should be a further meeting of senior Ministers of member Governments of EFTA and e.c. in order to discuss theestablishment of the proposed Joint Consultative Council, whichshould thereafter adopt as its initial agenda the various proposalswhich he had indicated. It might also be desirable to arrange ameeting of appropriate delegations from EFTA countries to work
out further stages of this initiative. Meanwhile, our intentions shouldbe disclosed, informally and confidentially, to EFTA Governments,to other Commonwealth Governments and to the Governments ofthe United States and Eire, in advance of the Vienna meeting.Discussion showed broad agreement with the Prime Minister^proposals and a general endorsement of any practicable steps whichmight be taken to prevent the hardening of divisions in Europe andto associate the United Kingdom with wider European interests. in pursuing these initiatives, however, we should bear the following considerations in mind:(a) We must be on our guard against any attempt by the othermembers of EFTA to secure more generous access to our market for their agricultural produce.(b) The interests of the developing countries should be takeninto account in any wider European discussion of the kind envisaged;and, while avoiding any duplication of the activities of OECD inthis respect, we might explore the possibility of a joint e.c./EFTAinitiative in this field.(c) It would not accord with our interests at the present timeto seek specific institutional links on a European basis which mightimpair our autonomy in the control of our currency arrangements,particularly as regards movements of capital.(d) We must avoid giving any indication that we might be ableto make further reductions in the current surcharge on imports inthe near future.(e) The other members of the Commonwealth should be keptfully informed of the development of our proposals.In further discussion the Cabinet considered whether theGovernment might shortly make a public declaration that they intended to promote the gradual introduction of the metric system.It was agreed that, in principle, it would be to our advantage tomove in this direction. But the metric system still encountered ameasure of opposition in some sections of industry; and we mustallow time for this to be overcome. We must also take full accountof the importance of our trade with countries, such as the UnitedStates and other members of the Commonwealth, whose system ofweights and measures was identical with, or similar to, the system which we ourselves used at present. The possibility of introducing adecimal coinage would need further examination before any commitment in this respect could be incurred.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (65) 51 and 52.(2) Approved C (65) 73, subject to the points made in their discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary, in consultation with the First Secretary ofState and the President of the Board of Trade, to give further consideration to the manner in which other
6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the attorney-General (C (65) 72) on the Trade Disputes Bill.The Attorney-General said that the effect of the Bill as atpresent drafted would be that causes of action which had arisen,but in respect of which no legal proceedings had been instituted,before Royal Assent would be decided in accordance with theprovisions of the Bill and not in accordance with the current stateof the law. The Bill would thus have some measure of retrospectiveeffect in that a potential plaintiff whose right of action had accruedbefore the Bill became law might lose that right. CurrentParliamentary debates on the War Damage Bill had emphasised thestrength of opinion against retrospective legislation; and it might therefore be desirable that the Trade Disputes Bill should be amended to reduce the degree of retrospection by permittingproceedings to be instituted within six months of the Royal Assentin respect of causes of action which had then accrued. It seemedimprobable that this amendment would have much practical effectsince there were unlikely to be more than a very few cases which fell within the category in question.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Minister ofLabour concurred in this proposal. In further- discussion it foundgeneral support, on the understanding that, although the decisionrested with the Government alone, it would be desirable that theTrade Union Congress should be informed in confidence of theGovernments intentions.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 72.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with the attorney-General, to inform the Trade Union congress in confidence of the Governments intentions as regardsthe amendment of the Trade Disputes Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th May, 1965.Trade DisputesBillQuestion of retrospection(previous reference:CC(65) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4)Commonwealth Governments and the Governments ofthe United States and Eire should be informed of theproposals in C (65) 73.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Technology, to give further consideration, in the lightof their discussion, to the desirability of indicating, both at the forthcoming meeting of the Ministerial Councilof the European Free Trade Association and simultaneously in Parliament, that the Government were disposed to promote the gradual introduction of the metric system of weights and measures; and to considerthe form in which an announcement to this effect mightmost appropriately be made.
