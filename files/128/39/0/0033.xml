The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had now replied to the suggestion, which we had conveyed to them on20th February, that the Governments of the United Kingdom andthe Soviet Union, as co-Chair men of the 1954 Geneva Conference,should invite the Governments concerned to indicate their iews about a possible basis for a settlement of the conflict in Vietnam.The Soviet response to this proposal had been little more than adenunciation of the United States Government and had therefore been unacceptable. He had accordingly discussed the situation withthe Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, on the basis that it wasnot the function of the co-Chairmen to provoke controversy of thiskind; but Mr. Gromyko had given no indication that his Governmentwere prepared to adopt a more conciliatory attitude. Nevertheless,the time which the Soviet Government had taken to reply to our proposal suggested that they might have been disposed to entertainit if they had not been subjected to strong pressure by theGovernments of Communist China and North Vietnam to refuse to compromise on the issues involved. In these circumstances he proposed to explore further with the United States Government,during his forthcoming visit to Washington, how we might stillmaintain our original initiative. It might be helpful, for example, ifthe United States authorities would make some further public statement of their policy towards Vietnam, including some indication that they were prepared to contemplate inter-Governmentaldiscussions for the purpose of ending the conflict.In discussion it was agreed that there was no simple or obvioussolution for a deadlock in which each party was seeking to insist thatthe other party must desist from aggression before there could be anyquestion of negotiation. Nevertheless, we should seek to persuade theUnited States Government to recognise the potential opportunitiesimplicit in a situation in which the Soviet Government must bebecoming increasingly resentful of Chinese pressure; and we should therefore endeavour to ascertain how far they might be prepared,despite apparent Soviet intransigence, to acquiesce in our maintaining our initiative to promote a negotiated settlement of the conflict.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, as a resultof their recent dispute with the Government of the United arab republic (UAR), the Federal German Republic had now announced their intention of establishing diplomatic relations with theGovernment of Israel. The reaction of the other Arab governments had varied. Some were threatening that when German/Israeldiplomatic relations had been established they would not only break off diplomatic relations with the Federal Government but alsorecognise the Government of East Germany, while others hadconfined themselves, for the moment, to forecasting a rupture of
3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Power (C (65) 42), togetherwith a memorandum by the Attorney-General (C (65) 39), on the nationalisation of the iron and steel industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals contained in C (65) 42 were designed to keep the Bill for nationalisingthe iron and steel industry relatively short and simple, to prevent it from being a hybrid measure and to facilitate the effective and speedytransfer of the main part of the industry into public ownership. Alarge number of small companies would remain outside the public sector; but it would be open to them to seek to be taken over bythe proposed National Steel Corporation and the Corporation wouldhave powers to acquire such companies if it so wished. The Bill didnot provide for taking into public ownership the British Iron andSteel Federation (BISF) and its associated trading companies, since this would almost certainly make it a hybrid measure; nor was sufficient information about the activities and organisation of theBISF available to enable statutory provisions for this purpose to be framed with confidence. Even so, the degree of nationalisationprovided by the Bill would represent a major step towards bringing the iron and steel industry into public control, which should not be delayed merely because it would not be feasible to include the BISFin the Bill. It should be possible to achieve the transfer of theindustry&apos;s central trading services to the National Steel Corporationafter nationalisation by means of negotiation with the Federation;but the Government should make it clear, during the debates on theBill, that, if a satisfactory settlement in this matter were not reached,they would introduce further legislation for the purpose. The questionIron and steel nationalisation(previous reference:CC(64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)relations with the Federal Government. These developments wereunfortunate in so far as they were liable to intensify antagonismbetween the West and the Arab world. On balance, the Governmentof Israel had probably improved their position, while the UARGovernment might suffer in the longer term as a result of havingcoerced other Arab Governments to contemplate more forcible actionthan many of them might have wished. In these circumstances, while we should not abandon our attempt to promote more cordial relations with the UAR Government, we must clearly moderate ourinitiative; and it would now be undesirable to pursue the earliersuggestion that a United Kingdom Minister should pay a visit to cairo at Easter. It would be tactically unwise to appear to invokethe breach between the Federal Government and the UARGovernment as a reason for deferring this visit; but the recentintensification of UAR aggression in Aden and the South ArabianFederation would justify us in informing the UAR Government thatit must be postponed for the time being.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was also suggested that the Cabinet should take an early opportunity to discuss our foreign policy as a whole.
of the compensation to be paid in respect of the companies to be nationalised would need separate examination.The Minister of Power said that the Bill would nationalise the13 major groups (including Richard Thomas and Baldwins) whichowned all 22 integrated steel works in the United Kingdom andaccounted for over 90 per cent of the production of iron ore, pigiron, crude carbon steel, sheet and tin plate. These activities wouldbe brought under the control of a National Steel Corporation, whichwould be required to submit, within 12 months of Vesting Day,proposals for the long term organisation of the public sector. Thisshould constitute a more practicable course of action than anyattempt to determine in the Bill a form of organisation which would render denationalisation impossible. The main safeguard againstsubsequent denationalisation lay in the fact that it would be verydifficult to sell off once again the very large units which constitutedthe main part of the steel industry. The National Steel corporation would have wide powers to diversify its activities on the basis of thediversified interests of the main companies to be nationalised. TheIron and Steel Board would be abolished; and the necessaryrationalisation of the remaining private sector should be broughtabout by competition among the private firms and between thosefirms and the public sector. But the Bill would make it possible,in addition, to veto substantial development projects by private companies in the basic fields of iron and steel making. It had beenverified with the authorities of the House of Commons that, subjectto a final ruling by the Speaker, a Bill on this basis would not be ahybrid measure.The Attorney-General said that there was no satisfactory meansof making provision in the Bill for taking part of the activities of theBISF into public ownership or for restricting the ability of theFederation and its associated trading companies to hamper theoperations of the nationalised sector. At the present stage theGovernments knowledge of the organisation of the BISF wasnecessarily incomplete; and any attempt to transfer its activities tothe National Steel Corporation might therefore be ineffective andeven damaging to the public sector. Moreover, if the Bill includedany provisions dealing either generally or specifically with theFederation, it would have to be dealt with in accordance withthe Standing Orders relating to Private Bills; and the resultantParliamentary procedure would provide considerable opportunity forobstruction and delay.In discussion it was agreed that, while there would be certaindisadvantages in excluding the BISF and its subsidiaries from thescope of the Bill, these did not, on balance, outweigh the desirabilityof nationalising at an early date the main part of the iron and steelindustry on the lines proposed in C (65) 42. There was some risk that,through its links with its own trading subsidiaries, with the companies to be nationalised and with private industry generally, the Federation
might attempt to frustrate or to delay the smooth transition of theiron and steel industry into public ownership. On the other hand it seemed unlikely that the activities of the trading companies,particularly the British Iron and Steel Corporation (Ore) Limited,which was responsible for importing all iron ore into the UnitedKingdom, could be so managed as to harm the nationalisedcompanies, since there were contractual agreements between theCorporation, the companies to be nationalised and the overseasuppliers of iron ore which would have to be observed. Moreover,as a result of their close association with the Iron and Steel board in the last 10 years the Government would be less dependent uponthe BISF for information about the industry in the early days of nationalisation than they had been after the passing of the 1949 Act.Since the Bill would empower the Minister to obtain information from the BISF and its trading companies about their organisationand activities, it might be possible, after nationalisation, to achieve a settlement between the National Steel Corporation and theFederation by negotiation. The BISF should be encouraged to adopta responsible attitude in this regard; but the Government would haveto make it clear that, in the absence of co-operation by the Federation,they intended to secure their objective by further legislation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet endorsed, in principle, the proposals in C (65) 42 fornationalising the main part of the iron and steel industry. They also agreed that, while it would be inadvisable to attempt to bring theBISF and its trading companies within the scope of the proposed bill, it would be essential to secure the transfer of the industry&apos;scentral trading services to the National Steel Corporation as quickly as possible after nationalisation, either by negotiation or, if necessary,by further legislation. It would be desirable to provide public opinionwith a full explanation of the Governments proposals; and this might best be arranged by means of a White Paper which might also discussthe compensation to be paid in respect of the companies to be nationalised. The White Paper should be issued in the fairly nearfuture as a preliminary to legislation at a later point in the present session. Meanwhile he would arrange for further consideration tobe given to the question of the precise timing of the publication ofthe White Paper, particularly in relation to the date on which theterms of compensation should be announced.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C (65) 42 fornationalising the iron and steel industry.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to circulate in due course thedraft of a White Paper describing these proposals and explaining the reasons for the exclusion of the british iron and Steel Federation and its trading companies fromthe projected legislation.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of power the timing of the publication of the White Paper.
Rent Bill(previous reference:CC(64) 16thConclusions,Minute 1)4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (65) 45 and 46 respectively), covering the draft of a white Paper about the Rent Bill.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thepurpose of the White Paper was to summarise the main considerations which the Government had had in mind in preparing the Rent Bill. This Bill had two objects first, to restore the securityof tenure undermined by the Rent Act of 1957; and second, to laythe foundation for a better relationship between the landlord andthe tenant of rented property by introducing a new and flexiblesystem of rent regulation. The provisions of the Bill in relation to agricultural tied cottages had given rise to considerable difficulty;but a solution had now been devised which should be acceptable tothose concerned.&apos; In discussion it was suggested that, since the Bill would not, initself, increase the number of houses available for rent (and, by improving security of tenure, might actually make them more scarce)it might be advisable to reconsider the Governments housing policy on the provision of houses for owner-occupation and to concentrate on building houses for renting. On the other hand, the present difficulties in relation to rented accommodation, acute though theywere, were confined primarily to a few large conurbations; and theproblem was therefore mainly one of regional priorities in theprovision of different types of housing until such time as the shortagescould progressively be overcome.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The severity of the penalties provided by the Bill for the offence of harassing a tenant might result in some difficulty in securing convictions as often as would be justified. On the other hand the degree of public sympathy with tenants in such cases should suffice to overcome any inhibitions in this respect.(b) It might prove difficult to deal effectively with landlordswho harassed their tenants by acts of omission rather thancommision, e.g., by neglecting repairs. In such circumstances,however, it would be open to the tenants to apply for a reductionof rent. Moreover an action might still be brought against the landlord in so far as his neglect could be shown to be motivatedby an intention to harass.(c) The provisions of the Bill relating to the rental of furnished accomodation had been drafted with regard to the interests ofmembers of the Public Services who let their houses when they wereposted abroad.(d) Consideration should be given to the possibility of amending the Bill in Committee in order to provide that landlords who hadbeen convicted of harassing their tenants might be debarred fromletting accommodation in future.
(e) Paragraph 26 of the draft White Paper should be amended in order to make clear the distinction between, on the one hand,the further legislation which might result from the Governmentsexamination of the more general aspects of the law of landlord and tenant and, on the other hand, the comprehensive review of theexisting housing law in England and Wales by the Law Commission,which would be largely a measure of codification and would not raise issues of policy.(/) Consideration was being given to the possibility of publishinga layman&apos;s guide to the provisions of the Bill and an abbreviatedversion of the Milner Holland Report on Housing in Greater London.Certain other amendments to the draft White Paper were also agreed.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft of the White Paper attached to C (65) 45subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government toconsider the possibility of introducing an amendment tothe Bill in Committee in order to enable the Court todebar landlords convicted of harassing their tenants fromletting accommodation in future.Cabinet Office, SWA,18th March, 1965.
