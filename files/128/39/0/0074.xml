SubjectRhodesia
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 57thConclusions,Minute 3)The Prime Minister said that the situation in Rhodesia was becoming increasingly critical and there were signs that a unilateral declaration of independence (u.d.i.) was imminent and might even be made within 24 hours. The Chief Justice of Rhodesia, Sir HughBeadle, who had just arrived in the United Kingdom in response tothe suggestion in his most recent message to the Prime Minister of rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, reported that the Rhcdesian Cabinetseemed to be divided and that, while Mr. Smith was probably stillin favour of the proposal for a Royal Commission, he was understrong pressure from the more extreme of his colleagues to takeindependence by unilateral action. Mr. Smith had asked for a privateassurance that, if the Royal Commission reported that the grant of independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitution was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole, the United KingdomGovernment would recommend Parliament to accept this. It mightbe argued that, formally, this would not prejudice the ultimatesovereignty of Parliament; but in practice the authority of theGovernment would be engaged, the issue would be one of confidence and the decision could not be left to a free vote. Although it was unlikely that the Commission would submit a unanimous report infavour of independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitution itwould not be right that either the Government or Parliament shouldbe bound in advance to accept it. Moreover, developments in rhodesia in the interval before the Commission reported, such asrepressive measures imposed under the State of Emergency, mightwell make it impossible for the Government to recommend the grantof independence even in the unlikely event of a unanimous report bythe Commission in this sense. On the other hand an assurance onthe lines requested by Mr. Smith, which could not be given in secretbut would have to be public, might now be the only way of avertinga u.d.i.; and, although the Opposition supported the principle thatParliaments rights could not be prejudiced, they might well seek to divide public opinion on the application of sanctions in the event ofa u.d.i. Admittedly, the Government could now demonstrate thatthey had made every effort to reach a negotiated settlement; andpublic opinion might be expected to condemn illegal action on thepart of the Rhodesian Government. Nevertheless, there might bedevelopments, such as action against the white population in otherAfrican countries, which could influence sentiment in the UnitedKingdom once more in favour of the Rhodesian Government.In these circumstances it would be advisable that, in his statement in Parliament that afternoon during the Debate on the address, he should say no more than that we did not wish to break off negotiations and were discussing with Sir Hugh Beadle the way in which the Royal Commission might operate, including thequestion of an interim report on procedure and the effect of the Stateof Emergency in Rhodesia. He would also repeat his earliersuggestion that he and Mr. Smith might meet in Malta.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal. to commit the Government or Parliament to support a recommendation
by the Commission in favour of independence on the basis of the1961 Constitution might be regarded as a failure to honour the five principles which the Government had declared to be essential forthe grant of independence. Moreover, Mr. Smith, if he chose to exert his authority, could almost certainly obtain support in Rhodesiafor any solution he advocated; and there was no reason why weshould sacrifice our principles in order to accommodate his politicalconvenience. On the other hand, there was no possibility that theCommission would in fact reach a unanimous conclusion that thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole were in favour of independence onthe basis of the 1961 Constitution; and a refusal by the Governmentto undertake to recommend acceptance of a unanimous report bythe Commission might therefore be criticised if it resulted in a u.d.i.The possibility of giving the proposed assurance in return for anadequate counter assurance might therefore deserve furtherconsideration, on the understanding that the position of Parliamentmust not be prejudiced and that any assurance which the UnitedKingdom Government might give should have the approval ofParliament.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould continue his discussions with Sir Hugh Beadle and would consult the Cabinet again before any decision was taken about afurther message to the Rhodesian Government.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th November, 1965.
