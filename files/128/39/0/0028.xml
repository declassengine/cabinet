The Foreign Secretary said that, with the agreement of theUnited States Government, we had recently proposed to the SovietGovernment that, as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, weshould jointly seek the views of the Powers concerned on a possible basis for a settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. So far theSoviet Government had been unresponsive; and, if they maintainedthis attitude, we might need to make our initiative public.In South Vietnam the Government of Dr. Quat remained in office but its position was precarious. The previous Prime Minister,General Kanh, had been appointed Ambassador at large to presentthe case of South Vietnam to world opinion.The Colonial Secretary said that, as the result of dissensionbetween the groups and parties concerned and the resignation ofthe Aden State Government, it had been necessary to postpone theSouth Arabian Constitutional Conference which had been due to begin in the following week. There would inevitably be an interval before a new Government was formed in Aden; and, while anyprolonged postponement of the Conference would be unfortunate,an early initiative on our part seemed unlikely to be productive.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary.housing programme(previous reference :CC(65) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (65) 33), the Secretary of State for Scotland(C (65) 32), the Minister of Housing and Local Government(C (65) 26 and 28), and the Minister of Public Building and Works(C (65) 29) on the housing programme, with particular reference tothe proposal that approvals for public authority housing should beincreased by 12,000 in 1965.The Minister of Housing and Local Government recalled thatat their earlier discussion the Cabinet had invited him to define theareas in which the additional approvals should be permitted; to explore possible means of ensuring that these additional approvalswould be implemented by industrial building methods; and toconsider, together with the other Ministers concerned, how building resources might be freed by limiting private building, particularlyprivate housing.The potential increase in capacity for industrialised buildingsystems in 1965 was considerably greater than the proposedadditional programme for public authority housing. In particular,Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
unused capacity existed in those parts of the country in which theneed for more public sector housing was greatest; and preliminary surveys had shown that two-thirds of the additional12,000 houses could be built by industrialised systems in such areas, apart from Wales, which would have to rely on sources ofsupply in England for the time being. Moreover, industrialisedsystems could secure savings of 10-50 per cent in labour employed;and the existence of surplus capacity implied that such systemscould be encouraged in other parts of the country where skilledmanpower was scarce, particularly in London and Birmingham.The additional load could therefore be borne by the construction industries provided that a systematic and ambitious change toindustrialised methods was put in hand; but the concentration ofthe increased public authority programme in particular areas would imply that house building by local authorities in other parts of thecountry would have to be restrained to the 1964 level.Although public authority housing had increased in the last three years, there had been a substantial diversion to private houseconstruction since the previous Labour Government were in power,with the result that only 35 per cent of total house construction was now in the public sector. The Government had committed themselves to meeting the large unsatisfied need for rented accommodation as well as to providing money for house purchaseat preferential rates of interest. But it would not be possible to honour these commitments unless restraints were placed on other private building. As regards the possibility of limiting private house building by controlling advances by building societies, it was unlikely that any scheme of voluntary restraint could be agreed orbe wholly effective in view of the large number of societies involved.Moreover, the smaller societies might frustrate such a scheme byattracting business which would otherwise be handled by those who did co-operate. It would also be necessary to link any limit ontotal advances with the limitation which it would be necessary toimpose on the amount of new house building to be assisted by a preferential rate of interest. Finally, any restriction of total advancesby building societies would have to be accompanied by similar action by the banks and insurance companies, which also advancedmoney for house purchase.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that the costof 12,000 additional houses would be about  40 million, or just over 1 per cent of the total work expected to be undertaken by theconstruction industries in 1965. There was a reasonable expectation that the industries&apos; productivity would increase by 5 per cent duringthe next year; and, provided that the additional houses were built by industrialised systems, they should therefore be accommodatedwithout undue difficulty. It was for consideration whether additional resources might be released by the imposition of physical controls on private building. It would be relatively simple to impose a control on houses in excess of, say, 1,500 sq. ft., although legislation and appropriate administrative machinery would be required and thecontrol would take a long time to become effective. It would also bepossible to extend the control on offices by using the powers
provided in the Control of Office and Industrial Development Bill,particularly in such areas as Birmingham and Manchester, althoughthe amount of building affected would form only a very small proportion of the total demand. About  270 million a year was spent on other private building, such as garages and places ofentertainment, which might be regarded as non-essential; but theimposition of control would require legislation and the administrative problems would be particularly complex. The fundamental objectionto any arrangements of this kind, however, was the fact thatphysical controls would appear to the construction industries as a return to a &quot; stop go &quot; policy and, by undermining their confidence in the future, would be liable to diminish their output and productivity.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while there mightbe general agreement that public authorities should provide morerented accommodation, the claims of this sector of the economycould not be considered in isolation. If the building industry was now working at full capacity, any additional burden, whether byway of increased public authority housing or private housingassisted by preferential interest rates, would add significantly to the strain on resources. It was essential, therefore, that any further increase in public authority housing should be accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in private demand. The Control of borrowing Order offered one method of establishing a financial control over private house building; but it was open to questionwhether this or any other form of financial control would be effective. On the other hand, it would take some time to bringphysical controls into effect. It was now essential, therefore, toconsider whether a balanced set of measures could be devised for achieving a significant diversion from private to public housebuilding, which could then be considered in the context of theGovernments total programme of public expenditure.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, although the pressure on building resources in Scotland was not as heavy as in parts of England, one-fifth of Scottish public housing in 1965 wouldincorporate industrialised systems and a recent review had shownthat productive capacity existed for a further increase insystem-built houses. There was no sign, however, that the private sector was likely to increase at all rapidly in its very small shareof total house construction in Scotland. In view of the importanceof a better supply of private houses for economic development and because of the existence of spare resources in the Scottish buildingindustry, any restriction on private building in Scotland could haveunwelcome consequences.In discussion there was general agreement on the importanceof expanding public authority housing. Given a reasonable increasein the output of the building and construction industries, a relatively small diversion from private to public sector building would benecessary in order to accommodate the additional public authority
housing programmes which would be required during the next fewyears. This diversion, however, could best be effected not byoutright prohibition but by a system of licensing for private housing(beyond a stated limit of cost or size) and for non-essential private building, which could be applied selectively in different parts of thecountry. This might be assisted by an extension of the control overoffice building outside the London area. If measures of this kindwere adopted, however, room could be found for the legislation which would be required only if some other item in the legislative programme for the current Session were abandoned.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) There were many cases in which the net increase inaccommodation created by the redevelopment of housing sites wassmall in relation to the resources used in the new buildings. Thiswas particularly marked in private development; but localauthorities also tended to demolish large numbers of houses forslum clearance well in advance of the new housing that would replace them. Further consideration should be given to thedesirability of preventing the unnecessary or premature demolition of houses which could still give useful service.(b) If some form of physical control over private building were introduced, it should be presented as a means for promoting thedevelopment of desirable projects rather than for curtailing theexpansion of construction demand in general.(c) It would be advisable to refrain from any public announcement of an increase in public authority housing untilinternational confidence in the economy as a whole was fullyrestored.(d) It was equally important that no publicity of any kind should be given to the fact that the Government were consideringthe introduction of some degree of control over private building.(e) Special measures had been taken by Welsh local authoritiesto provide houses for workers in the coal and steel industries whomoved to Wales from other parts of the country. This had limited the extent to which the housing needs of the local population couldbe met; and this fact should be given due weight in the allocation of additional public housing approvals. It would also be necessaryto provide more public housing in Wales in order to promote theredeployment of labour within the Principality.(/) For similar reasons the special requirements of authoritiessuch as the National Coal Board, which were engaged in large-scaleredeployment of labour throughout the country, should be borne in mind.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentshould have authority to give 12,000 additional approvals for public housing in 1965, on the understanding that these would be provided to the maximum extent possible by industrialised building systems.This decision, however, should not be announced publicly, at least for the time being. The Cabinet also agreed that some form of
control should be instituted over private building, in addition to thelimitation provided by the Control of Office and IndustriesDevelopment Bill. The Economic Development Committee should consider, as rapidly as possible, the means by which building controlmight be implemented in the private sector, with a view to submitting proposals for legislation to the Cabinet. Further consideration should also be given to the means by which the premature orinessential demolition of existing property could be held in check.The implications of introducing legislation on building controls forthe rest of the Governments legislative programme would also need to be examined; and a study should be made of the means bywhich the Governments intentions in relation to building in boththe private and the public sectors could best be presented, at theappropriate point, to public opinion both at home and overseas.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentshould have authority to grant 12,000 additionalapprovals for public authority housing in 1965, on theunderstanding that this decision would not be publicly announced for the time being.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for theEconomic Development Committee to consider, at theearliest opportunity, the prospective demands on theconstruction industries in the light of the resources likelyto be available and to examine the most appropriate means of controlling building in the private sector.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, toconsider how the premature or inessential demolition ofexisting houses might best be prevented.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, the implications for the Governments legislative programme in the current Session of introducing legislation on building controls.(5) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers concerned, to arrange for a study of the means whereby the Governments decisions in relation to private andpublic building could best be presented, at theappropriate moment, to public opinion at home andabroad.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th February, 1965.
