RhodesiaAid to zambia(previous reference:CC (65) 65thConclusions)*1. The Prime Minister said that President Kaunda and someof his leading Ministers had been informed on the previous dayof the Governments agreement to send RAF fighters and a detachment of the RAF Regiment to Zambia, subject to theconditions on which the Cabinet had decided at their previous meeting. The completion of this action had, however, been deferred, although the Javelins had been sent as far as Nairobi,since President Kaunda&apos;s reply raised further issues which theCabinet would need to consider. The President, while expressingappreciation of our willingness to provide air cover, maintained that the Zambian request in relation to the safeguarding of theKariba power supply had not been met. In these circumstances he felt unable to agree to the understanding which we had requested that no land forces from other nations should be accepted inZambia, save with our agreement. It was clear that the ZambiaGovernment were still obsessed by the fear that the illegal regime in Rhodesia might strike a vital blow at them by cutting off thesupply of electric power from Kariba and was also under heavy pressure from other nations in the Organisation for African Unity(OAU) to accept the stationing of their troops in Zambia. Itappeared that the danger of the latter action being taken was nowconsiderably greater than had previously been supposed, since,when we had sought the agreement of the Government of theUnited Arab Republic to overflying their territory with unarmedmilitary units for the purpose of sending forces to Zambia,permission had been refused on the ground that African countries had already offered troops to Zambia and that there was now norequirement for United Kingdom troops. In considering the furtherissues which arose from the Presidents reply we might properlybear in mind that the cutting off by the illegal regime of the supplyof electric power to the Zambian copper mines would cause severe damage not only to Zambia but also to the United Kingdom. Ifthis occurred it appeared that we could not expect any substantialhelp from the United States in view of their existing preoccupationwith the shortage of copper arising from the effects of hostilities in vietnam. In these circumstances it might well be thought right thatwe should make it clear to the illegal regime that if they were toswitch off supplies of electric power we would take the appropriateretaliatory action and arrange to cut off their own electric powersupplies from Kariba.In response to President Kaunda&apos;s reply we might thereforeinform him to this effect and also agree that we would send a battalion of United Kingdom troops to be stationed in Ndola andLusaka, that is, at some considerable distance from the Zambianfrontier with Rhodesia. This should be on the firm understandingthat in no circumstances would they be used for an attack on rhodesia and that the Zambian Government would not allow the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
air or ground forces of other nations to be stationed in Zambiawithout our consent.In discussion there was general agreement that the damage which would be caused to the United Kingdom economy byswitching off the supply of electric power from Kariba to the zambian copper mines was such as to provide reasonablejustification for retaliatory action on our part of the kind which was contemplated and which would fall short of a military attack on rhodesia. It was for consideration whether at this stage the threat&apos;of such action should be openly declared or whether it would notbe better in the first instance to convey it privately to the illegal regime and to inform President Kaunda and the members of his cabinet that we had done so. While it v/as extremely probablethat this information would shortly thereafter become generally known, this might be preferable to a public statement at the present stage. It was, however, the general view that the best course wouldbe to make clear publicly the extent of the damage which wouldbe caused to our economy if power supplies to the Zambian coppermines were to be cut off and to state that in these circumstances the Government were not prepared to see such action taken by the illegal regime.The Prime Minister, summing up. the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that in addition to the despatch of RAFfighters, we should also send a battalion of United kingdom troops to be stationed at Ndola and Lusaka, provided the zambian Government gave an assurance that no air or ground forces of other nations would be accepted in Zambia without ourconsent and provided that it was clearly understood that in no circumstances would our forces be used for an attack on Rhodesia.We should also inform President Kaunda that we would not standidly by if the illegal regime in Rhodesia were to cut off the supplyof electric power to the Zambian copper mines. Any public statement on our action must, however, await the notification of president Kaunda&apos;s acceptance of these conditions. In additionwe should consider what, if any, comparable action we might take if the illegal regime were to cut off supplies of coal from the Wankiecollieries to the Zambian copper mines. Meanwhile, our planning for a possible airlift to Zambia should continue, but it was now less likely to be required save in respect of supplies of oil, if an oil embargo were later to be enforced.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a battalion of United Kingdom troops shouldbe sent to Zambia in addition to RAF fighters on theconditions indicated by the Prime Minister, subject totheir acceptance by the Zambian Government.(2) Agreed that, subject, to the outcome of Conclusion (1), itshould also be stated publicly that the Governmentwere not prepared to accept action by the illegal regimeto switch off the supply of electric power from Karibato the Zambian copper mines.
The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations (C (65) 161), to which was attached anote by officials, on help for loyal civil servants in Rhodesia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there had beeninter-departmental discussion of measures that might be taken tohelp public servants in Rhodesia who lost their employmentbecause of the illegal character of the present regime. It was proposed to pay the salaries of such officers for six months if theyleft Rhodesia and to guarantee the pensions of all. Apart howeverfrom the Governor and the members of the judiciary the present proposals did not provide for any guarantee of salary for officers who lost their employment on this account, but who remained in rhodesia. There were strong arguments for guaranteeing either thepayment of salary in such cases or some later reimbursement whichwould not be less than was proposed for officers who left thecountry. Further consideration should also be given to the paymentof salaries after the six months period and to guaranteeing the continuing accrual of pension rights after the date on which officersvacated or were dismissed from their offices.In discussion it was suggested that the maximum publicity should be given to the institution of a scheme on the lines of that proposed and that loyal civil servants should be induced to leave their work in order to achieve the quickest possible disintegrationof the illegal regime. It was, however, the general view that, sincethe other measures being taken by the Government were aimed atachieving the quickest possible end to the rebellion, it would be preferable that loyal civil servants should, subject to their not being called upon to perform illegal acts or acts contrary to theirconscience, remain at their posts in order that a capable and well-disposed service should be available to maintain theadministration of the Government when the Constitution had beeneffectively restored.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that measures should be taken on the lines contemplated in C (65) 161. Further consideration should be givento the details by the Ministers primarily concerned with a view to establishing appropriate machinery for dealing with individual cases in accordance with these principles. At this stage we should avoid any public statement of our proposals. It would also benecessary td give further consideration to the appropriate Vote onwhich the expenditure involved should be borne.Heip forLoyal CivilServantsCC 66 (65)(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to consider whethersimilar action to that envisaged in Conclusion (2) might appropriately be taken in respect of supplies of coal from the Wankie collieries to the copper mines.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Overseas Development and the chief secretary, Treasury, to give further consideration to theprovision of help for loyal civil servants in Rhodesiaon the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Intensification The First Secretary of State said that the Ministers directlyMeasures&quot;&quot;0 concerned, under his Chairmanship, had agreed on the previous day on the further steps which should be taken to intensify theeconomic pressure being exerted on the Rhodesian economy. Sofar we had banned the import of tobacco and sugar from rhodesia. This ban affected about 20 per cent of all Rhodesianexports. We had been pressing other Governments to take similar action and were having considerable success. If all countries bannedRhodesian sugar and tobacco, about 40 per cent of Rhodesianexports would be affected. It was now proposed to extend the banon imports from Rhodesia to cover agricultural products (of whichmeat was the most important) and also minerals and metals. Ofthese asbestos was the most important. It would be necessary to seek alternative sources of supply for asbestos for the UnitedKingdom and it would be important to see that the UnitedKingdom firm, Turner and Newall, who controlled through a subsidiary company nearly all the Rhodesian supplies, did not take action to re-arrange their business in such a way as to frustratecompletely the effect of our action on the Rhodesian economy.Our other imports of minerals and metals from Rhodesia were notimportant to our economy. The extension of the import ban would,in fact, cover virtually the whole of our imports from Rhodesia.It was not proposed, however, to ban all imports completely, since this would make it politically almost impossible for Zambia notto do the same. Zambia was at present so dependent on importsof coal and manufactures from Rhodesia that the introduction ofa complete ban immediately would disrupt the Zambian economybefore arrangements could be made to get alternative supplies from elsewhere.The extension of the ban on imports by the United kingdom would not in itself have a further major effect on the Rhodesianeconomy. It was, however, desirable to take this action unilaterallyin order to demonstrate the Government^ determination to dealwith the situation and to give an answer to criticism that we werenot doing enough. The extension would also produce considerableconfusion immediately in production and trade in Rhodesia andwould form the basis for pressure on other Governments to take similar measures.As regards exports to Rhodesia from the United Kingdomit had been decided that there would be no advantage at this stage in introducing either a complete ban or a selective ban on UnitedKingdom exports alone. A list was being drawn up of exportswhich were particularly important to the Rhodesian economy andapproaches would be made to the United States Government and
other major exporters to see if they would co-operate in a jointban on exports of these products. If this failed, we should haveto consider our own action further; but we could not expect toproduce major effects on the Rhodesian economy by our own actionalone, since alternative sources of supply would soon be found byPvhodesia.Exports of oil to Rhodesia presented a special problem. Wewere continuing our efforts to persuade the United StatesGovernment to join us in organising an oil embargo which would be largely, even if not completely, effective in stopping supplies to rhodesia. Discussion at the official level the previous week, anda meeting which he and other Ministers had had with Mr. Mann ofthe United States State Department that morning, had, however,been extremely discouraging. Unilateral action by the UnitedKingdom alone would be quite ineffective in reducing oil supplies to Rhodesia. It was, however, difficult to explain why UnitedKingdom tankers were delivering oil for Rhodesia at a time when we were taking severe measures to disrupt the Rhodesian economy.Arrangements had been made to delay for a few days the nextUnited Kingdom tanker sailing for Rhodesia. But unless theUnited States could be brought to co-operate with us and to helpin putting pressure on the French and other Governmentsconcerned, it would seem inevitable that we should drop for thepresent our efforts to delay the arrival of tankers with supplies for Rhodesia. United States assistance was required also in theorganisation of an airlift to Zambia to be put into effect as soon asRhodesia ceased to supply oil to Zambia, which would happen ifwe introduced an oil embargo.Preparations were continuing to ensure the economic survival of Zambia if economic warfare broke out between Rhodesia andZambia. In addition to preparing for an airlift, expenditure wouldalso be incurred on the improvement of other land routes to zambia. Sir Norman Kipping had visited Zambia at our requestin order to explore the possibilities of replacing Rhodesia as a source of imports, particularly of manufactured goods. His report(which had just been received) was optimistic about the possibilityof changing the source of supply of a substantial proportion ofZambia&apos;s imports of manufactures over a period of three to sixmonths. If this were done, it would seriously damage manufacturing industry in Rhodesia since about a third of its production wasexported to Zambia.In discussion there was general agreement with the action proposed by the First Secretary of State. The extension of the banon imports from Rhodesia to cover agricultural products, metalsand minerals might suitably be announced in the House ofCommons on 1st December. It would be important to make useof this virtual ban on Rhodesia&apos;s export trade with the UnitedKingdom in order to exert the maximum pressure on otherGovernments to follow our lead. The United States Governmentshowed no signs of being ready to assist us with our economic
measures and it might be impossible to move them until theforthcoming meeting between the Prime Minister and PresidentJohnson. It was, however, particularly important to secure UnitedStates co-operation since, without it, that of other major countries would not be forthcoming. We should not rest content with simplybanning the import of Rhodesian products into the United kingdom but should seek to make it as difficult as possible for the Rhodesiansto evade the ban. Action had already been taken in order to try to prevent Rhodesian tobacco being sold through South Africa. Asregards asbestos, a meeting had been arranged with Turner andNewall. It might also be necessary to consider measures to preventthe major United Kingdom tobacco firms disposing of theirfactories in Rhodesia in a manner which might frustrate our banon tobacco imports. Consideration should also be given to preventing the cargo of sugar which had been stopped from entering the UnitedStates from reaching any alternative market.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the measures proposed by the First Secretaryof State to intensify the economic pressure against rhodesia should now be taken.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe extension of the ban on imports from Rhodesia intothe United Kingdom to be introduced on 1st December.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to bringthe maximum pressure to bear on other governments to take similar action.(5) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to considerwhether steps should be taken on the lines indicated in discussion to prevent the disposal of tobacco factories in rhodesia belonging to United Kingdom firms in a manner which might frustrate the ban on tobaccoimports.(6) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and the Attorney-General, toconsider how best to prevent the cargo of Rhodesiansugar now on the high seas from finding a market.Proposals forIntensifiedFinancialMeasuresThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (65) 163) setting out proposals for bringing further financial pressure to bear on Rhodesia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the measures listed in his paper were intended to bring the maximum pressure to bearas soon as possible on the Rhodesian economy. Financial measuresmust be regarded as having a supporting role in relation to measuresdirectly affecting Rhodesian trade. By themselves they might not be effective. He was still considering the alternative courses listed inparagraph 3 of taking action to exercise control over the reserve bank of Rhodesia. It would be valuable to obtain a legal basis on
which to control the use of the bank&apos;s balances held outside london. The action proposed would certainly lead to banks abroadthat held Rhodesian balances freezing the operation of the accountswhile the legal position was examined. To replace the governor and Director of the Rhodesian Reserve Bank by United Kingdomnominees would involve accepting responsibility for managing theday to day operations of the bank in Rhodesia itself but would bemore effective by giving us full control. He was considering possibleappointments to the posts of Governor and Directors of the bank.In discussion there was general agreement that the financial measures affecting Rhodesia should be greatly strengthened andthat we must accept that they would involve individuals and firms in Rhodesia in hardship. It was however essential to show theGovernments determination to establish a legal Government in rhodesia as soon as possible. The presentation of the measures should be framed primarily with a view to obtaining the best possible effect in Rhodesia itself.In discussion of the individual proposals the following points were made:(a) Proposal (hi) involved a ban on new United Kingdominsurance business with Rhodesia which it would be illogical toimpose until such time as we decided to stop all trade withRhodesia.(b) Proposal (iv), which would stop transfers of Rhodesiansecurity sterling from one Rhodesian to another, would have repercussions out of proportion to its value in intensifying pressure on Rhodesia and should not be pursued.(c) Proposal (v), which would restrict the transfer of securitiesheld by the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia, would be unnecessary ifcontrol over the Reserve Bank were assumed.(d) Proposal (vii), which would stop all cash gifts by UnitedKingdom residents to Rhodesia, should not be pursued at presentbut should be reconsidered after Christmas.(e) Proposal (x) would prevent United Kingdom banksoperating in Rhodesia from obtaining overdrafts in London. the repercussions of allowing a United Kingdom bank in Rhodesia todefault through inability to obtain an overdraft in London might be considerable but on balance it would probably be desirable toproceed with this measure.(/) Proposals (xiii) and (xiv) would prevent payments by united Kingdom residents to Rhodesia which were not definitecontractual commitments and would put a temporary stop tocontractual payments to Rhodesia, including Governmentcontractual payments. About 300 people receiving United KingdomGovernment pensions would be affected. Although these measuresmight create hardship in the case of certain individuals in Rhodesia,it was agreed that they should be introduced and that the individuals concerned must look to the illegal regime to take action to assist them and not to the United Kingdom Government. It would be
important to emphasise in Rhodesia that the money concerned incontractual payments would be held in suspense accounts inLondon and would be.t paid out immediately a constitutional government was restored in Rhodesia.(g) There was general agreement that action should be takento exercise control over the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia, subject tofurther consideration of the best means of doing so.(h) It might be preferable that the new measures should be announced in a statement to the Press by the Chancellor of theExchequer on 1st December rather than in the Debate that day inthe House of Commons, since the details were complex andtechnical. The decision in relation to the Reserve Bank of Rhodesiashould not be announced on 1st December but later in the weekwhen its impact might be greater.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that the measures set out in C (65) 163 should beintroduced with the exception of (iii), (iv), (v), (vii)and (x).(8) Agreed in principle that the measure listed at (x) should beintroduced, subject to further consideration by theChancellor of the Exchequer of its implications for united Kingdom banking interests generally.(9) Agreed that these measures should be announced on1st December.(10) Agreed that control should be taken over the reserve bank of Rhodesia in the way considered most appropriate by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; andthat this should be announced later in the week.FairfieldsShipyard(previous reference:CC (65) 56thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First Secretaryof State (C (65) 162) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C (65) 165) about the possibility of the Government taking overthe Fairfields Shipyard.The First Secretary of State said that at their meeting on 3rd November the Cabinet had agreed to guarantee an advance bythe Bank of England of up to  1 million to Fairfields in order tokeep the yard in full operation until Ministers had had anopportunity to consider the report of the Geddes Committee ofEnquiry on Shipbuilding. It was now clear that this limited action would not suffice to keep the yard in operation until the reportbecame available. Four of the five berths were at presentvacant. The yard had contracts for the construction of twobulk carriers for Reardon Smith; but this firm had indicated that they would want to place their contracts elsewhere unless the receiver of Fairfields could give them an assurance by2nd December that, once the ships were started, Fairfields would carry them through to completion. The Receiver did not feel thatin default of further measures of assistance he could give such an
assurance. There were therefore three choices before theGovernment. They could refuse to give any commitments runningbeyond 31st March, 1966, in which case the yard would almost certainly close down; they could extend the guarantees given tothe Receiver; or they could take over the yard. The best course might be to take over the yard, putting in a completely newmanagement and seeking to secure co-operation from the tradeunions in the removal of restrictive practices. The amalgamated engineering Union and the Electrical Trades Union had told him that they believed Fairfields offered an opportunity for anagreement by the unions which would greatly increase productivity.Although it was not possible to be sure that the enterprise would,in fact, prosper under Government ownership, there was areasonable chance that it would prove successful. It would be better to take this risk than to allow the yard to be closed down.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be imprudent for the Government to take over control of the existingcompany which had large debts and contracts which offered little chance of profit. It would however be desirable to keep the yardin operation and this might best be achieved through theGovernment buying the physical assets of the shipyard at the lowest price for which they could be obtained from what was, infact, a bankrupt company. If necessary the price might be fixed by arbitration. It would be preferable for the Government to act in association with private industry, possibly through Sir Isaac Wolfson.In that event Reardon Smith might be persuaded to wait for afew days beyond 2nd December for a decision.In discussion there was general agreement that it would bedesirable for the Government to acquire the physical assets of theFairfields shipyard at the lowest price for which they could beobtained. It would not be necessary or desirable to secure all the assets of the group of companies involved. The objective shouldbe to acquire the yard without interrupting its operation, sincethe latter would lead to the disruption of the labour force and to difficulties over contracts. The Government should seek to co-operate with private capital in the acquisition of the yard and, if sir Isaac Wolfson were really interested in such a co-operativeventure, it might be desirable to allow him to carry on the actualnegotiations on a basis to be agreed with the Government. If,however, neither he nor any other substantial private interest wereprepared to proceed, the Government should acquire the assets ontheir own. It would be essential to put in a new and progressivemanagement which would establish good labour relations. Thetrade unions concerned should be kept in touch with developments and their agreement in principle to the abandonment of restrictive practices would be an essential accompaniment to the Governmentsaction. Even so, it would be dangerous to assume that the enterprisewould prove profitable for several years, particularly since therewas some doubt whether it was located in the best place for ashipyard or whether it had been laid out in an ideal manner.
Legislation would be required. The question of whether or not toproceed with the Navy Departments contract for a destroyer couldbe decided later.The Cabinet (I) Agreed that the Government should seek to acquire the physical assets of the Fairfields shipyard, preferably inco-operation with private capital, on the lines indicatedin their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the attorney-General, to pursue the necessary negotiations.IndustrialDisputesBakeryIndustry(previous reference:CC (65) 64thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Minister of Labour said that the Baker&apos;s Union were still adamant in their determination not to submit their case fora wage increase to the National Board for Prices and Incomes.They required an initial increase of 20s. a week, not as an interimpayment but as a step towards a further increase coupled with thereduction of overtime, before they would even begin negotiations.The Government were now in the dilemma that, since they hadalready taken action to refer this wage claim to the Board, theinstitution of normal conciliation proceedings by the Minister ofLabour would appear to prejudice the position of the Board and thereby damage the Governments policy on prices and incomes.If, on the other hand, the machinery for conciliation were not employed, then the Baker&apos;s Union might call what they termed a&quot; national strike &quot;, though the exact meaning of this term in thepresent instance was not clear and it might involve no more thana temporary nation-wide stoppage in the industry.The First Secretary of State said that, if the Governmentwere now to withdraw their reference of the claim to the Board,or to take action which prejudiced the Board&apos;s consideration of it,this would be a clear indication to other trade unions that theycould, by threatening strike action, make nugatory any reference of wage claims to the Board. If, however, the Government did not take such action they must be prepared to face the risk of strikes.The only possible compromise which might be available was forthe Government to take action on lines similar to that which hadbeen taken in respect of the claim by the railway unions and see ifthe bakery firms and the union could be induced to start negotiations with could reach agreement on an initial increase of wages of some3i per cent, that is the &quot; norm &quot; which was envisaged by the prices and incomes policy, to be followed by reference of the claim to theBoard for their opinion on what, if any, further increase was justified.Even this action, however, would inevitably involve an increase inthe price of bread, certainly of a halfpenny a loaf and perhaps of a penny, when the review of the existing price took place on 6th December.
In discussion it was argued that the action being taken bythe Government to refer a number of wage claims to the board was incurring the risk of the Board increasingly being viewed asa substitute for normal industrial arbitration machinery. It was not designed or suited for such a task and the continuation of thiscourse might therefore prejudice the future standing of the Boardand the Governments policy on prices and incomes. On the otherhand, it was recognised that the Governments action in referringthe present claim to the Board had been necessary in the absenceof any indication by the Union of willingness to accept the use of conciliation machinery, or arbitration. It was also recognised thatin the present instance there was the additional complication thatthe employers might be ready to grant a substantial increase ofwages provided that they were enabled to increase the price of bread. In these circumstances, any further action by the Governmentwhich seriously compromised the position of the Board might seriously damage the prices and incomes policy and hence necessitate a radical change in the Governments current policy relating to thelevel of activity in the economy as a whole.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that in the first instance theMinister of Labour should seek the agreement of employers and ofthe union to negotiations which might lead to the payment of a wage increase of the order of 34- per cent on condition that theuniohs claim for a higher increase would then be referred to theBoard by the parties concerned. If agreement could not be reached on this basis the Cabinet would wish to consider the matter further.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to take action in the senseindicated in the summing up by the First Secretary ofState.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th November, 1965.
