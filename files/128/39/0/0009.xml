ParliamentProtection fromEviction BillGrammarSchoolsThe Secretary of State for Education and Science said that hehad it in mind to announce his decision in respect of the maintenanceof grammar schools in Bristol during the adjournment debate onFriday, 27th November.In discussion it was suggested that the Cabinet should take anearly opportunity to consider the Governments policy in relation togrammar schools generally, after proposals for this purpose had been examined by the appropriate Committee.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science to circulate to the Social Services Committee, andsubsequently to the Cabinet, proposals about the futureof grammar schools in the educational system.2. The Cabinet discussed the possibility that, despite theformidable administrative difficulties involved, the effective date of payment of the increased National Insurance benefits, which had recently been announced as 29th March, 1965, should be accelerated.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had agreed thatthe date should be advanced in relation to disability benefits and theabolition of the rule relating to widows&apos; earnings. The advancement of the date in relation to benefits generally, however, would have serious financial implications in as much as it would entail additional expenditure of  25 million a month, of which only  16 million wouldbe offset by increased contributions and the balance would have tobe financed by the Exchequer. This would be very unwelcome; and,if the increase in benefits were to take effect from a date earlier thanthat originally envisaged, whether by back-dating or otherwise, itwould at least be essential that the increase in contributions shouldbe correspondingly accelerated.SECRET5510-3 a 2NationalInsurance(previous reference:C.C. (64) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theprovisions of the Protection from Eviction Bill relating to agriculturaltied cottages were likely to be controversial. They were not essentialto the main purpose of the Bill and could be omitted if this werejudged advisable in order to save Parliamentary time. On balance,however, it would be preferable to retain them.Discussion showed general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the provisions of the Protection from EvictionBill relating to agricultural tied cottages should beretained in the Bill.
In discussion there was general agreement that, despite the extra cost to the Exchequer, there would be advantage in advancing the effective date of payment of the benefits, provided that means couldbe found to overcome the administrative complications. If so,however, the effective date of the increase in contributions should be similarly advanced. Alternatively, some means might be devised forsupplementing National Insurance benefits for a limited period duringthe winter, on the lines of the arrangement which has already beenapproved for this purpose in relation to National Assistance.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of technology, to circulate, for consideration at their next meeting, a memorandum discussing:(a) the cost of advancing the effective date of payment ofthe approved increase in National Insurance benefits,on the assumption that the date of the increase in contributions would be similarly advanced;(b) the possibility of expediting the administrative processesinvolved, particularly by the employment of independent advice on the extent to which computerservices might be used for this purpose;(c) the   possibility   of   arranging   for   some   limitedsupplementation of National Insurance benefitsduring the winter on the lines of the correspondingconcession already approved in relation to national assistance.3. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson)said that it still seemed unlikely that the Soviet Government wouldbe willing to modify their refusal to make good the arrears of their contributions to the United Nations Organisation; and, if theypersisted in this attitude, a very serious situation could arise underArticle 19 of the Charter of the Organisation. We should continueto support the United States Government on the issue of principle involved; but we should be ready to consider any means by which areasonable compromise settlement might be reached.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson) saidthat the armed forces of the Congolese Government were continuing to advance on the rebel stronghold in Stanleyville and some 1,000Europeans, including 26 United Kingdom nationals, who were atpresent held as hostages by the rebels, were now in grave danger.The Belgian Government had concerted with the United StatesGovernment an operation by which Belgian paratroopers might be dropped on Stanleyville from United States aircraft, in an effort to rescue the hostages. It had been agreed that we should be prepared in principle to provide staging facilities for the aircraft at ascension island.OverseaAffairsUnited Nations(previous reference:C.C.

european free trade association(previous reference:C.C. (64) 8thConclusions,Minute 4)4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial sub-Committee on External Economic Policy had considered, earlier in the week, the attitude to be adopted by the United kingdom ministers attending the Ministerial meeting of the European free trade Association (EFTA) in Geneva on 19th-20th November. TheSub-Committee had considered a number of proposals designed to counteract the effects on EFTA of our imposition of importsurcharges in breach of the Stockholm Convention and without prior consulation with our partners. These proposals had included asuggestion that we should give the other members of the Associationan undertaking that the first relaxation of the surcharges would takeplace by the middle of next year: but the Sub-Committee had considered that, while this might in fact prove to be an appropriate time for some relaxation, it would be unwise to commit ourselves inadvance. The Sub-Committee had also examined a suggestion, whichit was understood that the Swedish Government might wish to putforward, for a multilateral acceleration of reductions in the remainingEFTA tariffs on industrial goods. But this would conflict with theundertaking, which we had recently given as a virtual condition ofour recourse to the International Monetary Fund, that we wouldnot discriminate in favour of EFTA; and in any case it would be unlikely to appeal to some members of the Association itself. Weshould therefore seek to dissuade the Swedish representative fromraising this issue at the Ministerial meeting. Thirdly, a suggestion had been put forward by M. Haekkerup, the Danish Foreign Minister,for the creation of a common EFTA Fund, to be financed by the proceeds of our own import surcharges and of the remaining customsduties levied by EFTA countries and to be used for promotingdevelopment projects in less developed countries and within EFTAand for encouraging projects designed to increase intra-EFTA trade.5510-3a 3C.C. 9 (64)In discussion some concern was expressed that our participation in this operation might embarrass our relations with other african countries, especially if it could be misrepresented as implying tacitsupport for the present Government of the Congo and for the policies of the Belgian Government in Africa. It was generally agreed,however, that we could not stand aside in view of the risk to the lives of United Kingdom nationals and the unlikelihood that anyother organisation, e.g., the International Red Cross, would be ableto intervene effectively.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence,would keep the situation in Stanleyville under closereview.
M. Haekkerup had already been informed, however, that his proposal would be unacceptable to us, particularly in view of its probable effect on our balance of payments.On the other hand it should be possible for us to accept anotherproposal by M. Haekkerup for the establishment of a new StandingCommittee of officials in EFTA to review economic developments in member countries. Our representatives at the Ministerial meetingcould also renew our undertaking to consult the other members ofthe Association when we were able to relax our import surcharges;and they would be able to announce a technical concession in relationto the imposition of the surcharges on duty-paid contracts. Moreover,they would take credit for the fact that we had given EFTA advance information about the contents of the industrial exceptions listwhich we proposed to table in connection with the tariff negotiations in the Kennedy Round and that we should be prepared to outline toour partners the agricultural offer list which we should be tablingshortly in relation to the same negotiations.We must hope that action on these lines would demonstrate ourwish to maintain the cohesion of EFTA and to restore theAssociation^ morale. Our partners should be reminded, however,that, although they would suffer temporary embarrassment as aresult of our import surcharges, they had derived great benefits byway of increased trade with this country since the StockholmConvention was signed and that it was in their interests to await theopportunity for a further expansion of this trade which would arise as soon as the surcharges were removed.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Docks(previous reference:CC. (64) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (64) 15) on the threatened dock strike.The Minister of Labour said that the first report of theCommittee of Inquiry which had been appointed to consider issues arising from the current dispute in the docks was likely torecommend wage increases of 5 per cent on piece rates and 19s. 2d.on weekly time rates. These should be compared with the Union&apos;claim for increases of 5 per cent on piece rates and 25s. on weeklytime rates and with the employers&apos; offer of increases of 3^ per centon piece rates and 12s. 6d. on weekly time rates. If account wastaken of the last increase received by dock workers in May 1962of the agreement which they had secured for a shorter working weekand of the fact that some 30 per cent of dock workers were on timerates and 70 per cent on piece rates, the additional amounts which theCommittee would probably propose could be said to be equivalentto an average increase of 4 per cent per annum. An award of thiskind should remove the risk of a dock strike; and, although therewould still be difficult negotiations about its application, it should
ease the remaining stages of the Committee&apos;s work on such major questions as the decasualisation of dock labour.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had given preliminary consideration to the measureswhich the Government might need to take if a national dock strikestarted on 1st December. Now that there was a reasonable prospect that the strike would not take place it would be essential to avoid any action which might be regarded as needlessly provocative andso frustrate a peaceful settlement. At the same time it was the dutyof the Government to make plans to maintain essential supplies ifthe strike took place. If it was decided that troops should be employedin the docks, the Ministry of Defence would need to consult unitsbelow Command level 10 days before the strike was expected to start. This would be followed by discussions with the port authoritiessix days before the start of the strike; and movement of troops would begin three days later. But, even if all available troops were used,together with any voluntary civilian reinforcements which might beenlisted, insufficient labour would be available to deal with thesituation which would arise if a dock strike developed intomore widespread industrial action. Moreover, the Governmentspreparations could not be kept secret once the consultations withthe port authorities had taken place; and even consultation withinthe Services below Command level might become known. Since it seemed unlikely that there would be any serious shortage of essentialfoods for about three weeks after the start of a dock strike and therisk of the strike had itself receded, it might be advisable that the initial action by the Ministry of Defence should be deferred for thetime being. Subject to this reservation, it would be desirable that heshould be authorised, if subsequent developments so required andafter consultation with the Minister of Labour, to invite the Ministryof Defence to begin consultation with Service units below Commandlevel.In discussion there was general agreement that no overt step should be taken which might prejudice the discussions which would now have to be undertaken in the light of the probablerecommendation of the Committee of Inquiry and that the cabinet should consider the situation again in the following week.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be desirableto commission an inquiry into the adverse effects on exports of congestion in the docks, particularly where they were also used aswarehouses. Such an inquiry should examine, in addition, thepossibility of distributing the shipment of cargo among a larger number of ports.The Cabinet (1) Agreed -to give further consideration, at a subsequent meeting, to the proposals in C. (64) 15 for maintainingessential supplies in the event of a dock strike.
(2) Agreed that, meanwhile, no action should be taken whichmight jeopardise negotiations for a settlement of thecurrent dispute in the docks.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for theEconomic Development Committee to consider the causes of delay and congestion in the docks and to recommendhow these questions might best be examined in greater detail.Railway andBus Disputes(previous reference:C.C. (64) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Minister of Labour said that the unofficial decision towork to rule by drivers in the South-Eastern section of the SouthernRegion of British Railways had now been withdrawn, on theunderstanding that the issue in dispute would be submitted to theRailways Tribunal on 1st December.As regards the dispute in respect of London buses discussions were taking place between the London Transport Authority and theTransport and General Workers Union.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.LegislativeProgramme1964-657. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C. (64) 16), to which was annexed a provisional programme of legislation for 1964-65.The Lord President said that the Bills to which the Governmentwere already committed, together with others which might become essential or were considered to be of exceptional urgency orimportance, had been placed by the Future Legislation Committee inLists A and B of the programme annexed to C. (64) 16. These Bills,however, would occupy an amount of Parliamentary time equivalentto two normal Sessions. Additional time could possibly be providedby arranging for Parliament to reassemble after the Christmas recessas early as 12th January (although this would be advantageous only if Bills were ready for introduction by then) and by reducing the whitsun recess to one week. It might also be possible to continuethe Session until the end of November. Even so, it was clear that no new commitments could be undertaken unless the Government wereprepared to defer some Bills to which they were already committed.Moreover, it would be important that Bills should be brought forward in good time. It was hoped to introduce before Christmas the Billson Capital Punishment, Control of Offices, Highland development authority, War Damage and Ministers&apos; Salaries and Members&apos;Pensions and to introduce in January those on Trade Disputes, theLaw Commission, Racial Discrimination and the parliamentary commissioner. The Rent Bill and the Iron and Steel Bill must beintroduced by the middle of February if they were not to encounterconsiderable difficulty later in the Session. Bills in List B2 would be
brought forward if time allowed; but it was unlikely that roomcould be found in the programme for the measures in List C, whichshould be regarded as held in reserve and should not be accordedany priority in drafting.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was important that the Overseas Aid Bill and the colonial development and Welfare Bills, which might be combined, shouldbe passed during the current Session, since the existing provisions for financial assistance to oversea territories would lapse in March1966 and it was very desirable to give the territories concernedadequate notice of the aid on which they could rely for the purposeof planning their own programmes during the succeeding threeyears. Either the necessary legislation should be enacted before the summer of 1965 or the Government should be prepared to give a binding undertaking, in advance of legislation, to provide specifiedamounts of aid during the next three years. The Overseas service bill was equally important as a measure for enabling the Governmentto contribute to the remuneration of European staff employed in thepublic services of the developing territories.(b) The Backing of Warrants Bill, which was designed to remedy a defect in the arrangements for returning to the irish republic fugitives from justice in that country, might necessitatefurther negotiations with the Irish Republican Government, whowere ready to introduce a corresponding Bill in their own Legislature.It would therefore be inappropriate that the United kingdom legislation should be introduced by a Private Member; but it wouldbe embarrassing if the arrangements for the reciprocal return offugitives could not be put on a satisfactory basis during the current session.(c) The completion of the Rent Bill must await considerationof the report of the Committee under the chairmanship of Sir MilnerHolland. Subject to this, it would be convenient if the stages of this bill were arranged concurrently with those of the Iron and Steel bill and both Bills were, if necessary, made the subject of a singletimetable Resolution.(d) As a means of stimulating public discussion of theGovernments proposals there might be advantage in introducingduring the summer any major Bills which could not be ready earlier,even if they were unlikely to be enacted before the end of the Session.Consideration might also be given to the possibility of arranging forcertain Bills to be carried over, by Resolution, into the following session.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Overseas Development to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of amalgamating the overseas Aid Bill and the Colonial Development and welfare Bills and to submit drafts of the Bill and of the overseas Service Bill to the Legislation Committee for
further consideration of their eligibility for inclusion in thelegislative programme for 1964-65.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the lord president and the Chief Whip, to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of arranging for theBacking of Warrants Bill to be introduced by a private member.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) above, approved inprinciple the legislative programme for 1964-65 annexed to C. (64) 16 and invited the Lord President to arrangefor the Future Legislation Committee to keep theprogramme under review.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th November, 1964.
