CC. 3 (65)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. It might be necessary,however, to rearrange the order of business if, on further consideration,it appeared appropriate to reinstate the proposed statement by thePrime Minister on export incentives and related economic measures.2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the replieswhich he had received from the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia,Mr. Ian Smith, to his recent messages suggested that relations with southern Rhodesia, after a period of relative quiescence, were once again about to enter a critical phase. In particular, Mr. Smith had rejected our suggestion that a Parliamentary Commission should visit the colony; and the intemperate tone of his letters appeared to offerlittle opportunity for breaking the deadlock between the twoGovernments. On the other hand circumstances might provide theoccasion for Mr. Smith to visit London in the near future; and in that event we must be ready, and willing, to explore every means ofrenewing contact with him and seeking to persuade him to adopt amore reasonable attitude. Meanwhile, it was becoming increasinglyclear that, if the Government of Southern Rhodesia decided to declaretheir independence unilaterally, the economic consequences, both forthe United Kingdom and for Zambia, might be serious; and it was important, therefore, that all Ministers should refrain from making any public statement about Southern Rhodesia which might affordMr. Smith&apos;s Government a pretext for taking this final, decisive step.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson) saidthat the United Nations Organisation still faced a deadlock on thequestion of the payment of arrears of contributions by certain member countries, particularly the Soviet Union and France. A decision onthe issue was likely to be taken at the beginning of the following week;and we should maintain our efforts to persuade the Government ofthe Soviet Union to make a sufficiently large voluntary payment toallow the General Assembly to regard the matter as disposed ofwithout the need for action under Article 19 of the Charter of theUnited Nations. But, if the Soviet Government refused to make any move in this direction, the issue would have to be put to the vote. the outcome was unpredictable; but, whether it was a victory for theSoviet Government or for the Powers who were seeking to uphold theprinciple of Article 19, the consequences could not be other thanharmful. Moreover, any attempt to evade the issue by postponing theAssembly until, say, the following autumn would be no less deplorablein so far as the prestige of the Organisation would be gravely damaged and its ability to promote peace-keeping operations would be severelydiminished.In discussion there was general agreement that we should spareno effort to persuade the recalcitrant member countries, particularlyFrance and the Soviet Union, to resolve the deadlock by means ofSECRET6079-3 a 2
AtlanticNuclear Force(previous reference:C.C. (64) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)The Congo(previous reference:C.C. (64) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)voluntary contributions. On the other hand both these countries might be prepared, if necessary, to allow the United Nations todisintegrate rather than to compromise on the financial issue involved;and, if the forthcoming debate indicated that there was a real risk that this might happen, we must be prepared, in consultation with theUnited States and other member countries, to take some action, at very short notice, to demonstrate our determination to maintain the integrity and cohesion of the Organisation. We must also ensure, sofar as possible, that no part of the blame for this situation wouldappear, in the eyes of the Afro-Asian bloc and other uncommittednations, to attach to the United Kingdom.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was satisfactory that the United States Government had now publiclyindicated that they considered that discussion of our proposals forthe creation of an Atlantic Nuclear Force should proceed asexpeditiously as possible. They were probably prepared to allow thefinal decision on these proposals to be deferred until after theforthcoming elections in the Federal German Republic; but theywould support us in seeking to establish some formal machinery fortheir detailed examination in the interim. Meanwhile, the initialreactions of the Federal German Government to our proposals hadbeen not unfavourable; but it remained to be seen how far theirattitude might be modified as a result of the recent discussions betweenPresident de Gaulle and the Federal Chancellor, Dr. Erhard.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinetthat the political situation in the Congo appeared to be deterioratingstill further. M. Tshombe remained unwilling to take any action tobroaden the basis of his Government; and the rebel forces seemedto be gaining fresh strength. We should continue to take any actionwithin our control to moderate the situation; but the outlook wasunpromising.HospitalCapitalExpenditure:1965-663. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (C. (65) 6) on the level of hospital capital expenditure in1965-66.The Minister of Health said that the rate of expenditure onhospital building which was implied in the long-term hospitalconstruction plan initiated by the previous Administration was determined by an estimate of the capacity of Hospital Boards toprepare plans for individual hospital projects. The programme for1965-66 had been settled, on this basis, at  63 million; but it had recently become clear that Hospital Boards had so improved theirspeed of planning that they would now be able to spend an additional 5 million in the next financial year. While the proposed increase in expenditure took account of some increase in earlier estimates of costs,it derived mainly from the fact that the plan would reach its peakearlier than had been expected. The plan was now being revised; andthe circumstances which had led to the proposed increase in expenditure in 1965-66 should not be repeated in later years.
Meanwhile, however, an enforced limitation of expenditure in thatyear to the original figure of  63 million would result in the postponement of a number of important specific projects; and a delay in starting schemes which were ready to be implemented forthwithwould be widely regarded as a reduction, even though the startswould be ahead of the original programme. The damage to the reputation of the Government, who had publicly declared themselves as in favour of an acceleration in hospital building, would be out of proportion to the savings in public expenditure.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the proposed increasein expenditure on hospital building should be considered against theincrease of more than 10 per cent in total civil expenditure now envisaged for 1965-66 compared with 1964-65. The increase in expenditure by the Health Departments within this total was alreadymore than 10 per cent above the current year&apos;s level. Hospital building was proceeding in accordance with an agreed programme, which hadbeen adjusted to allow for increased costs; and revision of theprogramme on the lines proposed would not only cast doubt uponthe efficiency of the Governments forward planning as a whole but would also be liable to impose delays on other important building programmes in view of the additional strain which would be placed upon the construction industries. The consequences of overloadingthe economy in this manner would be far more serious than thepolitical embarrassment of appearing to delay hospital projects whichin any event were scheduled for later years.In discussion it was suggested that there would be serious social and political disadvantages in arresting the momentum of hospital building under the existing plan. The question at issue was one ofrephasing, not expanding, the agreed programme; and it carried noimplication for a further increase in hospital building in 1966-67beyond the figure of  67 million now envisaged. The modernisation and extension of hospital facilities had been started only a few years before; and it would be particularly unfortunate if this were the firstprogramme to be chosen for deferment by a Labour Government.Moreover, a number of important projects would be affected,including a joint Regional Board/Medical Research Council project for a clinical research centre; and the highly qualified staff who hadbeen assembled for the centre might be lost if its construction was delayed.On the other hand there had already been a substantial increasein expenditure on the health services as a result of the abolition ofprescription charges; and further possible increases were in prospectin relation to, e.g., the remuneration of general practitioners and nurses. There was already a significant shortage of craftsmen in thebuilding industry; and it would be unwise to increase the demands onthe industry unnecessarily. While a decision to restrain the hospitalprogramme would&apos; be unpopular, some degree of political difficulty was inescapable in any attempt to establish priorities between one form of Government expenditure and another.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the discussion clearlyillustrated the difficulties of reaching decisions on specific proposalsfor increased expenditure in the absence of an assessment of the priorities to be adopted in the field of public expenditure as a whole.He intended to circulate in the near future proposals for a public expenditure programme for the next five years, based on a 4 per centgrowth rate in the economy. He would invite Departmental ministers to prepare, in the light, of this programme, more detailed proposalswithin the fields for which they were responsible, distinguishing between basic programmes on which commitments had already been incurred and new proposals for additional expenditure. The national plan would be in course of preparation at the same time; and at alater stage in the year it would be necessary to match the proposalsfor public expenditure over the next five years with the resourcesexpected to be available. Against this background it would be preferable that the Minister of Health should withdraw his proposalfor increased expenditure on hospital building until priorities hadbeen established within the programme for public expenditure as awhole.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, while sympathising with the difficulties facing the Ministerof Health in relation to the hospital building programme, felt unableto reach a decision on his proposals for increased expenditure until they had been further considered in relation to other competing claims on the national resources. The Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Health should therefore re-examine the necessityfor an increase in hospital building in 1965-66; and, if such anincrease appeared unavoidable, it would be necessary to considerwhether savings could be made elsewhere in expenditure on health orother services.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Health to re-examine the proposals in C. (65) 6 on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion.Trade DisputesBill: Question of retrospection(previous reference:C.C. (64) 16thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C. (65) 7) about the degree of retrospection for which provision should be made in the proposed Trade Disputes Bill.The Minister of Labour said that, unless the Bill was explicit onthe issue of retrospection, all legal proceedings which depended uponcauses of action arising before it became law would be settled inaccordance with the law as it was at present. Such proceedings mightbe started up to six years after the cause of action arose; and a casemight therefore fall to be settled under the present law many yearsafter the Bill came into operation. Some measure of retrospection wastherefore desirable. It would be objectionable, however, for the Billto apply to all proceedings which were in train when it came into
operation, since individuals who had started litigation before publication of the Bill might find their cause of action removed ordrastically altered before the action was settled. After consultationwith the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General he therefore proposed that the Bill should apply to proceedings which were startedafter it became law, since it would then be wholly clear, at the timewhen the proceedings were begun, whether they would be settledunder the old law or the new law. The practical consequences wouldbe small, since there were unlikely to be more than two or three cases in the next few months. The Bill would not be a hybrid measurewhether it applied to proceedings started after its publication or to proceedings started after it became law.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Cabinet Approved C. (65) 7.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st January, 1965.
