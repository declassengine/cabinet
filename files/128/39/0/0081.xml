SubjectRhodesia: Aid to Zambia
*The Prime Minister said that he had received from thePresident of Zambia, President Kaunda, a request that UnitedKingdom forces should be stationed in Zambia both in order tosafeguard the power station at Kariba and to protect the country against attack by the Rhodesian Air Force. It was clear that president Kaunda was under heavy pressure both within Zambiaitself and from the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) to acceptforces in Zambia from member States of the OAU and, possibly,from the Soviet Union or Communist China. Hitherto, he had succeeded in resisting this pressure, with support from PresidentKenyatta and President Nyerere, in the hope that he could rely onthe United Kingdom for help. But if we rejected his requestcompletely, he might be overthrown; and there would then be no obstacle to the outbreak of a racialist war which could lead to the disintegration of the Commonwealth and would expose the wholeof Central Africa to Communist infiltration and subversion.Preparations had therefore been made to enable us to send a squadron of Javelin fighters, with the necessary radar equipment,into Zambia at short notice if the decision to do so were taken.Their purpose would be twofold. First, by pre-empting the Zambianairfields, they would prevent the arrival of air forces of othercountries, whose motives would be less creditable; and from thispoint of view we should need to make it a condition of the operationthat forces of other countries would not be admitted to Zambiawithout our agreement and that we should be given operational control over all the main Zambian airfields. Second, by providingZambia with some protection against Rhodesian attack, the Javelinsquadrons would strengthen Zambian morale and would reinforcePresident Kaunda&apos;s political position. In the latter role, however,their function would be purely defensive; and they would be committed to action only in the event of a Rhodesian attack. Theremust be some risk that the Rhodesian Air Force itself would attemptto launch a pre-emptive attack against the Javelin squadron before it was fully operational; and in order to provide a deterrent against such an attempt HMS Eagle, with an air strike capability, had beensecretly moved from the Far East to a position off the East african coast. It was intended that the Commanders of the Rhodesian AirForce and of the Rhodesian Army should be informed of our intentions, through the Governor, an hour or two before the Javelinsquadron reached Zambia; and this should help to prevent anyprecipitate reaction by Rhodesia to an operation which the rhodesian regime might otherwise interpret as a threat to themselves.We could not agree, however, to accede to President Kaunda&apos;second request, namely that United Kingdom ground forces shouldbe sent to Zambia to protect the power supplies from Kariba, sincethe Kariba power station was situated on the Rhodesian bank ofthe Zambesi River and an attempt to seize it would thereforeconstitute an invasion of Rhodesia which might well be resisted by* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET6718-1 a 2
Rhodesian forces. Moreover, there was some reason to believe thatthe power station had been mined by the Rhodesian authorities;and, if we attacked it, we might therefore precipitate the catastrophewhich our intervention would have been intended to prevent.It must be accepted that the despatch of the Javelin squadronto Zambia might mark the first stage in a new and developingcommitment; and it would therefore be even more important thatwe should now adopt further economic and financial measures designed to bring the rebellion in Rhodesia to an end as rapidly aspossible. In particular, the possibility of instituting an oil embargo,at least to the extent of preventing the delivery of crude oil to Beiraor the use of the pipeline from Beira to Rhodesia, was under urgentstudy. In order to be effective, however, this would probably requirecollective international action; and urgent discussions with theUnited States Government were now in progress. We should also need to discuss with the United States authorities PresidentKaunda&apos;s request for financial and economic assistance in relationto contingency planning against economic warfare between Zambiaand Rhodesia, since this, too, was an enterprise which we could not undertake by our own unaided efforts.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, if an immediate decision were taken, the Javelin squadron could be at Ndola airfieldin Zambia in the early afternoon of 30th November. Sea Vixenfighters from HMS Eagle could, if necessary, arrive rather sooner;but they would be less effective for the purpose envisaged and woulddelay the subsequent arrival of the Javelins. The radar equipment required would be fully operational at Lusaka airfield by the evening of 1st December. Detachments of the RAF Regiment would be stationed at Ndola and Lusaka in order to protect the aircraft andradar and might also be sent to Livingstone, which we might need to use as a diversionary airfield. The Javelin fighters could i notnecessarily prevent an air attack on Zambia by Rhodesia; but theywere superior to the aircraft of the Rhodesian Air Force and their presence would constitute a considerable deterrent to any attack onZambia since this would be an act Of war against the UnitedKingdom.In discussion it was recognised that the proposed operation, bymonopolising a large part of the airfield capacity of Zambia, would inevitably reduce the effectiveness of any airlift which might subsequently be necessary in order to support the Zambian economy.It was also suggested that one motive for President Kaunda&apos;s requestmight be a desire to involve the United Kingdom by degrees in military operations against Rhodesia and that; however much we might seek to evade pressure of this kind by emphasising that the role of the Javelin squadron would be purely defensive, we might find it impossible to rest in this posture if our economic measures against Rhodesia did not prove effective sufficiently rapidly. To this extent the need for some further military action might be held to beimplicit in the initial limited operation which was now envisaged.Gn the other hand this would not necessarily prove to be so.
Moreover, if we refused all President Kaunda&apos;s requests, he mightwell be unable to resist extremist pressures in Zambia and in theOAU; and we might then lose control of a situation which, if weheld the Zambian airfields, we might still hope to stabilise. If so,however, the operation now in question would have to be supportedby an intensification of other measures designed to bring about theearly downfall of the illegal Rhodesian regime; otherwise we shouldbe subjected to increasing pressure to send ground, as well as air,forces to Zambia and eventually to undertake military action against rhodesia. There was now reason to believe that public opinion inthe United Kingdom expected further action by the Governmentand would support the despatch of air forces to Zambia and theadoption of more stringent economic and financial measures against rhodesia.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a United Kingdom fighter squadron should besent to Zambia in answer to President Kaunda&apos;s request. He would announce this decision in the House of Commons on 30th November.The intensification of other measures against Rhodesia should nowbe considered by the Ministers principally concerned; and the outcome should be reported to the Cabinet as rapidly as possible.The possibility of instituting an oil embargo should be further explored in consultation with the United States Government; anda decision should be taken during the week, if possible, since wehad already initiated temporary action to prevent supplies of crude oil from reaching Beira, but could not sustain ad hoc measures ofthis kind in the absence of international collaboration. It would,however, be essential to confirm that the Government of Zambiawould endorse an oil embargo against Rhodesia and would acceptits inevitable consequences for Zambia itself. It would also be important that public opinion should not be encouraged to expect the imposition of an oil embargo unless it could be shown that itwould be applied collectively and would be effective in its operation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that United Kingdom air forces should be sent to zambia on the lines proposed in their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to submit, as rapidly as possible, proposalsfor the intensification of economic and financial measures against Rhodesia.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th November, 1965.
