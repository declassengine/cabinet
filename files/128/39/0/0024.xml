CC 8 (65)DefenceEconomies(previous reference:CC(65) 6thConclusions,Minute 6)1. The Prime Minister said that on 2nd February hawker siddeley had proposed that instead of the C-130 the Governmentshould buy a newly designed plane, the HS-802 consisting of Cometengines and wings with the HS-681 fuselage. The firm had been told that their suggestion would be considered if in three days they had put forward detailed proposals including a guaranteed price andguaranteed delivery dates. Such proposals had been submitted onthe morning of 5th February and had been examined by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministers principally concerned on the same evening.The Minister of Aviation said that the HS-802 would have a slightly better performance than the C-130 as regards speed and operational ceiling. The total capital cost would be higher, about 113 million as against  79 million, and there would be additionalmaintenance and operating costs amounting to about  50 million over 10 years. The C-130 would be available about two years earlier.The HS-802, which was not significant for the technological advanceof the industry, would not offer much work for design teams but itwould offset redundancies in the production staff caused by the cancellation of the P-1154 and the HS-681. Indeed in two or threeyears the labour force in Hawker Siddeley would be larger than it was at present. In the long term the effect would be to give a virtualmonopoly in the aircraft industry to Hawker Siddeley in airframeconstruction and to Rolls-Royce in engine manufacture.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the adoption of theHS-802 would add  50 million to the defence budget over the next five years. From the defence point of view the C-130 was preferable,not only because it was cheaper but also because it would be availabletwo years earlier. Moreover, it was a tested plane and more reliablethan we could reasonably expect any new aircraft to be. It wouldfully meet operational needs and the extra performance of the HS-802was relatively unimportant to our defence transport requirements. Afurther advantage of the C-130 was that the number of planes weeventually purchased need not be decided yet, whereas an order forthe HS-802 would commit us to take the full number specified at the outset of production.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the terms worked outwith the United States Government for the purchase of United states aircraft were exceptionally favourable. Dollar payments over thefirst five years would be kept to a minimum and would be spreadevenly over the ensuing seven years. He had agreed with the UnitedStates Secretary of the Treasury that the interest rate for the dollarcredit required would be reduced from 5 per cent to 4f per cent. these terms would not be affected by the decision to defer the choice between the TSR-2 and the TFX but if we now sought to modify theagreement still further and not purchase the C-130 we could not reasonably expect that such favourable terms would be maintained.This could affect not only the credit terms but also the adoption of
the United Kingdom components for the Phantom and the assemblyof some of the Phantoms in the United Kingdom. This could add asmuch as  85 million to the dollar cost of the Phantom order.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) No decision need yet be taken about the distribution of workin the United Kingdom on the assembly of Phantoms. It would bedesirable that Short Brothers and Harland should have a share if theadditional cost were not too heavy, and the British aircraft corporation would also have a claim if the TSR-2 were cancelled.(b) The proposal for the HS-802 had been produced at very short notice and there had been insufficient time fully to evaluate it.However, in the case of all Hawker Siddeley&apos;s earlier projects, costshad increased and delivery dates had slipped in the course ofdevelopment.(c) It had been suggested that the Government should announcemore detailed plans about redeployment and retraining for surpluslabour in the aircraft industry. In fact, however, it was not yet knownwhat needed to be done or whether, indeed, there would be anysubstantial problem unless the TSR-2 were cancelled. Hawker Siddeleyhad announced that there would be redundancies of 14,000 owing tothe cancellation of the P-1154 and the HS-681. The true figures were that 3,000 men were now employed on these two projects and thatthis figure would have risen to 9,000 by the end of 1965. New projectswere expected to absorb 1,300 by the same date, leaving a gap of ,700. The figure of 14,000 had been reached by adding 6,000 whowere already or would shortly become redundant for reasonsunconnected with the Governments decisions. Redeployment whichwas desirable on broad economic grounds could not take place without dislocation and Hav/ker Siddeley might have to close a factory at Coventry. Other firms in the area, including motor manufacturers,were, however, short of labour to the extent of being unable to meetexport orders and could absorb production staff from the aircraft industry with little or no difficulty.id) In announcing the Governments decisions about the aircraft programme it had been accepted that the aircraft industry should bereduced in size in order to free resources for more profitableemployment. If the HS-802 were adopted in order to avoid thedifficulties of redeployment, the Government would be abandoninga fundamental principle of their economic policy as a result of surrender to pressure from the industry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a conclusive case for adhering to the decision to purchase theC-130. The defence arguments about delivery dates and the reliability of the aircraft were particularly important and these were reinforced by the financial considerations. Pressure should be maintained onHawker Siddeley in regard to redeployment since it was not acceptable that a company which relied so heavily on Governmentmoney should follow a policy of redeployment which had no regardto social considerations.
2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C (65) 18) about Gibraltar.The Foreign Secretary said that in the previous autumn theUnited Nations Committee of Twenty-four had adopted a consensusinviting the United Kingdom and Spain to find a negotiated solution.This had been immediately followed by the imposition of restrictionsby the Spanish authorities on transit of the frontier between spain and Gibraltar. These had been lifted a week later; but they had beenreimposed at the end of October, immediately after our decision notto participate in the SPANEX exercise and had since been extended.Repeated representations by HM Ambassador had been ineffective.The ultimate purpose of the Spanish Government was undoubtedly the recovery of Gibraltar; and they had been genuinelydisturbed by the decision of the United Kingdom Government togrant a further measure of seif-government to the Colony in April1964, an act which they argued was contrary to the provisions of theTreaty of Utrecht that, if the Crown of Great Britain should alienatetherefrom the propriety of Gibraltar, &quot; the preference of having thesame shall always be given to the Crown of Spain before any others &quot;.They had accordingly intimated that the present restrictions might be abandoned if we were ready to hold discussions about Gibraltarwithout preconditions. HM Ambassador had been instructed to reply that, while we could not regard the question of sovereignty overGibraltar as a matter for negotiation, we had at no time wished to insist on preconditions in a manner which would prevent discussionsfrom starting.There appeared to be no further diplomatic action which wecould usefully take for the time being. Meanwhile, the counter-measures which we might take in retaliation for the restrictions were examined in the Annex to C (65) 18. But, apart from the possibility that we might arrange a non-attributable Press campaign againstSpain, any reprisals would be likely to inflict at least as much damage on our own interests as on those of Spain. In particular, our rapidly expanding exports to Spain would be at risk; and our defence interests which might also suffer. It would therefore be preferable to try to dealwith the problem of Gibraltar in isolation and to concentrate our efforts on positive measures designed to support the economy of theColony in such a way as to demonstrate that we had no intention ofyielding to duress.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office,said that the considerable increase in recent years in the tourist tradein Gibraltar had made both the budget of the local Government andthe personal incomes of the inhabitants more vulnerable to the pressure now being exerted by the Spanish restrictions; and the chief the Cabinet Agreed that the decision to adopt the C-130 in place of theHS-681 should be maintained.
Minister of the Colony was perturbed that so far no positive steps had been taken by the United Kingdom Government to maintainGibraltar&apos;s interests.Discussion showed general agreement that it would not be inthe interests either of the Colony or of the United Kingdom that ourrelations with Spain should deliberately be exacerbated or that weshould initiate measures which might lead to mutual economicretaliation. At the same time it was essential that we should giveGibraltar all the help and support in our power.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The inhabitants of Gibraltar had no desire to achievecomplete independence, since they realised that their safety and prosperity depended on their continued relationship with the UnitedKingdom. It might be helpful, therefore, to let it be known to theSpanish Government that there was no question of the Colony&apos;sbeing accorded an independent status similar to that which had recently been granted to Malta.(b) It might be desirable to consider what measures could betaken, whether by the Royal Navy or otherwise, to dissuade theSpanish Government from enforcing their recent requirement wherebyships bringing fresh fruit from Tangier to Gibraltar were being diverted to Spanish ports and retained there until the fruit becameunmarketable.(c) Further action should be taken to strengthen the economy of gibraltar, particularly by extending the housing programme in orderto accommodate refugees who had been evicted by the SpanishGovernment from their houses in Spain. The possibility of releasingfor this purpose land at present held by the Navy Department shouldbe examined urgently.(d) Action should also be taken to ensure that supplies of oxygenwould continue to be available for use in hospitals.(e) Further consideration should be given to the most appropriate means of dealing with certain outstanding proposalswhich might be of benefit to Spain or Spanish nationals, e.g., a request for recognition of Spanish fishing rights in United Kingdomwaters and a suggestion by British European Airways that fares forair travel on the London-Malaga route should remain at their present level while fares on the London-Gibraltar route should be increased.It would not necessarily be to our long-term advantage to seek to use these opportunities as a means of retaliation against the Spanishrestrictions; but we need not be unduly concerned, in presentcircumstances, to expedite any action which would be to Spain&apos;sadvantage.(/) It might be desirable to demonstrate the Governmentssympathy with the inhabitants of Gibraltar by arranging for a UnitedKingdom Minister to visit the Colony in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, ColonialOffice, to arrange to visit Gibraltar at an early date.
oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference:CC(65) 7thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it wouldprobably be necessary to indicate, in reply to a Private notice question in the House of Commons that day, that we remained ready,as co-Chairman of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Vietnam, tore-convene the Conference if such action offered any prospect of resolving the dispute between North and South Vietnam. It was perhaps not without significance that the Prime Minister of north vietnam had recently stated openly that he regarded his country as now at war with the United States.EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC(64) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatwe had recently secured the continuation, for a further three months,of the financial accommodation, amounting to $3,000 million, whichhad been put at our disposal by certain Central Banks in November1964.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th February, 1965.CC 8 (65)(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to consider, in thelight of their discussion, the most appropriate means of ensuring the unhindered transit of vessels carryingfoodstuffs to Gibraltar; and to examine, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of releasing Navy Departmentland in the Colony for the construction of civilian housing.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider further, in the lightof their discussion, the balance of advantage in initiatinga non-attributable Press campaign against Spain on thelines indicated in the Annex to C (65) 18.(4) Invited the Minister of Aviation to be guided by the general sense of their discussion in dealing with the currentapplication by British European Airways in relation to air fares to Spain and Gibraltar.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture to give further consideration to theapplication of Spanish fishermen for the recognition of fishing rights in United Kingdom waters on the lines suggested in their discussion.(6) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the foreign secretary, the Attorney-General and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, to consider theextent to which the Spanish Government might be ableto promote embarrassing claims against the UnitedKingdom under the Treaty of Utrecht.(7) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee to give furtherconsideration, at an early meeting, to the issues raised bythe actions of the Spanish Government in relation to gibraltar.
