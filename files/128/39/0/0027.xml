Relationswith thePress(previous reference:CC (65) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Prime Minister said that he felt bound to draw the cabinet&apos;s attention to a new and potentially dangerous developmentof Press technique, which was illustrated by an article published inthe Sunday Times on the previous day by Mr. Anthony Howard, itsrecently appointed &quot; Whitehall Correspondent&quot;. This article purported to describe a conflict of view between the Department of of economic affairs and the Treasury about the direction of economic policy;and, in the course of a detailed analysis of this alleged dispute, itidentified as protagonists not only the Ministers in charge of the two departments but also their senior advisers. In an accompanyingleading article the Sunday Times claimed that this procedure, althoughan innovation in journalistic practice in this country, was justified onthe ground that it was the proper function of the Press to publishsecret issues of politics, whether they related to the Cabinet, toParliament or to the Civil Service.These articles represented a novel challenge to the establishedconventions governing the conduct of public business; and the factthat their description of the alleged conflict of view between theDepartment of Economic Affairs and the Treasury was in many respects inaccurate did not necessarily permit the Government to ignore the threat which they represented. It might be desirable togive further consideration to their implications in relation to thedischarge of collective Ministerial responsibility by means ofdiscussion in the Cabinet and its Committees, since it was essentialthat the normal processes whereby differences of opinion wereresolved by confidential discussion, both between Ministers and between officials, should be maintained without risk of beingmisrepresented as dramatic encounters between contending theoriesor rival personalities; and it would be no less important to protect the Government against the embarrassment of the statutory enquiry which would inevitably be required if this new form of intrusion bythe Press resulted in the apparent disclosure of some particularlysensitive item of information, e.g., in relation to the forthcoming budget. More immediately, however, the articles demonstrated afreshthe need for Ministers to maintain the utmost discretion in theircontacts with the Press. It should now be made an established rule,to be vigilantly observed, that Ministers should not give Pressinterviews, whether attributably or unattributably, except in thepresence of a reliable witness such as a Public Relations Officer; anda careful note of such interviews should be made. In addition, all ministers should instruct their advisers to maintain a correspondingstandard of discretion in any contacts with the Press which their official duties might require and, in particular, to refrain fromaccording more favourable treatment to the &quot; WhitehallCorrespondent &quot; of the Sunday Times than to any other representativeof the Press whose contacts with Departments would normally bemade through their Public Relations Officers.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement about relations with the Press.
2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Council of theEuropean Free Trade Association, which was meeting that day in geneva would expect us to offer a significant reduction in the15 per cent import surcharge. From the economic point of view anearly reduction would be premature since, although our balance oftrade had recently shown some improvement, there still seemed likelyto be a substantial balance of payments deficit during the current year. This consideration, however, had to be weighed against the adverse political effect of maintaining the surcharge at its present level, including the possibility of retaliation. On balance, therefore,it would probably be right to reduce the surcharge in the near future;and although a reduction of only 2\ per cent would have been preferable economically, the political arguments suggested that itwould be wiser to offer a reduction of 5 per cent on all items, with effect from 26th April, i.e., six months after the surcharge had been imposed. But we should refrain from accepting any commitment tomake a further reduction at any foreseeable date in the future.Discussion showed general agreement that the balance ofadvantage inclined in favour of the proposed reduction in the surchange. The following main points were made:(a) There must necessarily be some uncertainty about the effectof the surcharge during the limited period in which it had been inoperation at the rate of 15 per cent, since it was in this period thatcongestion in the London docks had been substantially relieved andthe statistics of imports and exports had been affected accordingly.(b) The surcharge appeared to have achieved some reduction inthe importation of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods. Itscost, however, had been absorbed, perhaps by as much as 50 per cent,by the exporters and importers; and to this extent it had not been reflected in United Kingdom costs.(c) The undertaking to reduce the surcharge two months hencemight well result in a postponement of imports. The immediate effect would be favourable; but this would be liable to be offset by thedeferred increase which would take place after the reduction came into effect.The Cabinet Agreed that the 15 per cent surcharge on imports should bereduced to 10 per cent with effect from 26th April, 1965.EFTAMinisterialMeeting(previous reference:CC (65) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)Vote onAccount,1965-66(previous reference:CC(65) 10thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (65) 27), to which was annexed a draft of a parliamentary Statement on the Vote on Account, 1965-66.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the statement had beenredrafted in the light of the points raised by the Cabinet in their previous discussions, in order to place public expenditure more clearly in the context of total national expenditure.
In discussion it was suggested that the Governments freedom ofaction might be unduly restricted by the proposed undertaking to limit the average increase in public sector expenditure to 4  per cent a year at constant prices over the next five-year period. The balanceof opinion, however, favoured a statement on these lines, providedthat it was made clear that this limitation reflected the Governments&quot; present judgment&quot;. It would also be desirable to emphasise thatthe Government intended to exercise a corresponding control overthe private sector and that neither public nor private expenditure could be allowed to rise in terms of annual rate of increase until theannual rate of increase of national production as a whole showedsome improvement.In further discussion certain textual amendments were agreed.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion,the draft Parliamentary Statement on the Vote on Account,1965-66, annexed to C (65) 27.Medical 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofEducation      State for Education and Science (C (65) 25), proposing the appointmentof a Royal Commission on medical education.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that theSocial Services Committee had agreed on 9th December, 1964(SS (64) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1), to a proposal that an authoritativebody should be established to examine medical education, including such matters as the exceptionally high cost of training doctors, theorganisation of medical schools, the relationship of medical education to the development of the National Health Service and post-graduateand post-experience medical training. If the Cabinet endorsed this conclusion, it remained for consideration whether the inquiry shouldbe given the status of a Royal Commission. Since its recommendations were likely to be controversial, it was desirable that they shouldcommand the fullest authority in order to commend them to a somewhat conservative profession. Moreover, the new body shouldbe clearly distinguished from a committee recently appointed by theGeneral Medical Council to review the undergraduate medicalcurriculum. Both considerations pointed to giving it the status of a royal Commission.In discussion it was suggested that, if there were any likelihood that current discussions between the Minister of Health and representatives of the British Medical Association on the remuneration of doctors might lead to the appointment of a body toundertake a comprehensive inquiry into the place of the general practitioner within the National Health Service, it might be desirableto defer a decision on the appointment of a Royal Commission on medical education, in order that two Royal Commissions should not
be at work simultaneously in closely related fields. It seemed unlikely,however, that any such proposal would result from the currentconsultations about medical remuneration or that those consultationswould be in any way prejudiced by the appointment of a RoyalCommission to inquire into medical education.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a recommendation should be made to The Queenfor the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into medical education on the lines proposed. Some further consideration, however,should be given to the draft terms of reference in C (65) 25, in orderto ensure that the Royal Commission would take sufficient accountof the importance of medical education in relation to our programmes of oversea aid and technical assistance.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science, inconsultation with the Minister for Overseas Development,to give further consideration to the terms of reference ofthe proposed inquiry in the light of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, invited the Secretary ofState for Education and Science to send to the PrimeMinister proposals, for submission to The Queen, on the composition and terms of reference of a RoyalCommission on medical education.RacialDiscriminationand incitement to RacialHatred5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (65) 23) on racial discrimination and incitement to racial hatred.The Home Secretary recalled that an undertaking had been givenin The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament to take actionagainst racial discrimination and to promote the full integration of commonwealth immigrants in the community. In addition he had indicated in the debate on the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill theGovernments intention to introduce legislation to deal withincitement to racial hatred, if the difficulties of definition could be overcome. It was now proposed :(i) to make it an offence to practise discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic or national origin in places to which thepublic had access. This would penalise forms of discrimination which were plainly indefensible withoutinterfering with individual rights, such as that of alandlady to decline to accept a coloured lodger. Aprovision so limited should be capable of enforcement;but, in order to prevent unnecessary or maliciousproceedings, prosecutions would be instituted only by, oron behalf of, the Director of Public Prosecutions;
(ii) to deal with incitement to racial hatred by applyingSection 5 of the Public Order Act, 1936, to the written, aswell as to the spoken, word and by providing that aperson who, with intent to stir up hatred against a group of Her Majesty&apos;s subjects, disseminated written matter orused speech in public which was threatening, abusive orinsulting and likely to stir up hatred against that group on grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin should be guilty of a new offence.In proceedings for this offence it would not be necessary to show, asunder Section 5 of the Public Order Act, 1936, that there was an intention to provoke a breach of the peace or that a breach of thepeace was likely to be occasioned. The offence would carry amaximum penalty on indictment of two years&apos; imprisonment or a fineof  1,000; and, as a safeguard against frivolous or trivial proceedings,it was proposed that prosecutions should be brought only by, or onbehalf of, the Attorney-General. The proposals were intended to dealnot so much with incitement at public meetings, about which therewas at present less public concern, as with the dissemination of anti-Semitic news-sheets, swastika-daubing and the fly-posting of offensive notices. It was also proposed to confer on the High Court,on the application of the Attorney-General, a power to wind up anyassociation a member of which was convicted of the new offence ofincitement, if he had committed it wholly or substantially in furtherance of the purposes of the association.The Home Affairs Committee had considered, but had not accepted, a suggestion that the proposals should be extended todiscrimination or incitement on religious grounds. Section 5 of thePublic Order Act, 1936, already applied to abuse on religious grounds;and there appeared to be no need for more stringent provisions.If these proposals were approved, it would be appropriate topresent them, together with others now under consideration for promoting the integration of Commonwealth immigrants in thecommunity and for discussing immigration problems with other commonwealth countries, as the counterpart of the governments proposals for strengthening the control of immigration.In discussion the following main points were made:Racial discrimination(a) While discrimination against coloured tenants could not bemade a criminal offence, it was wrong that the civil law should beused to enforce discriminatory covenants; and it was forconsideration, therefore, whether a ban on assignment or sublettingto coloured persons should be made unenforceable unless, in a casenow before the courts, such a ban was held to be contrary to public policy.(b) There might be pressure from the Governments supporters in the House of Commons for the Bill to be extended to discriminationby employers, some of whom refused to engage coloured persons on
the grounds that their white employees would object. In additionsome trade unions refused to admit coloured persons to membership.Neither form of discrimination could be prevented by the criminal law; but it might be useful if the Trades Union Congress were publiclyto deplore them.Incitement to racial hatred(c) The proposed provisions differed from those in the Billspromoted by Mr. (now Lord) Fenner Brockway in the previousParliament in that they did not deal with incitement on grounds of religion. There might be some demand for this issue to be brought within the scope of the Bill. But, if so, it should be resisted on theground that measures extending beyond Section 5 of the Public OrderAct, 1936, would be liable unduly to restrict religious controversy. Itwas possible that the Government of Northern Ireland, where religiousprejudice was stronger than in Great Britain, would considerintroducing parallel legislation in that country.(d) The provisions in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Annex C of C (65) 23,whereby action would be taken only by, or on behalf of, the Attorney-General, would ensure that the new provisions would normally beused only against ringleaders and organisers of incitement to racial hatred.(e) The reference in Annex C to &quot; persons owing temporaryallegiance to Her Majesty &quot; might give offence in commonwealth countries which had adopted a republican form of government andshould be reconsidered.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary:(i) to consider further, in consultation with theMinister of Housing and Local Government, thepoint raised at (a) in their discussion;(ii) to consider, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations, the point raised at (e) in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider whether the TradesUnion Congress should be invited to issue, on a suitable occasion, a public statement deploring discrimination on grounds of race or colour in connection with employment and trade union membership.(3) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC (65) 23 and invited the Home Secretary to consider, inconsultation with the Prime Minister, how they mightmost appropriately be announced in conjunction with proposals for integrating Commonwealth immigrants inthe community and for promoting discussions on immigration problems with the other members of theCommonwealth.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,    .22nd February, 1965.
