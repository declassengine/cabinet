OverseaAffairsThe YemenSudan(previous reference:C.C. (64) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)The CongoThe UnitedNations2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that it now seemed possible that the Governments of the United Arab republic and Saudi Arabia would reach a settlement which would ensure a cessation of hostilities in the Yemen. If so, we should have to face the question whether we should thereafter recognise the regime inthe Yemen and to decide the conditions on which we might beprepared to do so.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a revival of therecent civil disturbances in the Sudan. There was no reason to suppose that the popular agitation was directed particularly againstthe United Kingdom; and the new Sudanese Government were doing their best to protect foreigners. There appeared to be no need, atleast at the present stage, to provide special facilities for our nationalsto leave the country.The Foreign Secretary said that the forces of the CongoleseGovernment were now pressing hard on the rebel troops whoremained in Stanleyville. It was uncertain how many foreigners,including United Kingdom nationals, the rebels still held in their power; and, although we were taking all possible measures to rescuethem, there could be no assurance that we should succeed.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the UnitedStates Government were still refusing to commit themselves to makea contribution to the United Nations Special Fund unless the SovietGovernment were prepared to make good the arrears of their contribution to the United Nations in conformity with Article 19 ofthe Charter of the Organisation. While we must support theGovernment of the United States on the issue of principle involved,we should nevertheless continue to assist the purposes of the SpecialFund; and, although we should avoid any precise commitment inthis connection, it would be desirable that we should undertake inprinciple to contribute to its activities more generously than in theprevious year.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.remuneration of ministers and Membersof Parliament3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (64) 12), to which was attached the report of theCommittee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members ofParliament (the Lawrence Committee); and a memorandum by theLord President -of the Council (C. (64) 14) on the matters arisingfrom the report on which it was necessary for immediate decisions to be reached.5510-2a 2Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The Lord President recalled that the Lawrence Committee hadbeen asked to report as soon as possible after the General election in order that whatever action seemed appropriate in the light of theirfindings might be taken at the beginning of the new Parliament. TheCommittee of Ministers under his chairmanship which had consideredthe report had concluded that it would be desirable, in order to relieve Members of Parliament of the invidious responsibility of determining their own remuneration, to adhere as closely as possibleto the Lawrence Committee&apos;s recommendations. In respect ofMembers&apos; salaries and allowances, including travelling allowances and daily attendance allowance for Members of the House of Lords,the recommendations v/ere acceptable; and the new rates should operate from the beginning of the Session. The proposal that a contributory pension scheme should be established for Members ofParliament was also acceptable in principle; but the details wouldrequire further consideration. It would be appropriate for the salaries of the Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and theChairman and Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means to be increasedby the same amount as the Ministerial salaries with which they were linked. The Lawrence Committee had made no recommendationabout the payment of the Leader of the Opposition and the chief whip in the House of Lords; but they had recorded that it had been represented to them that, without payment, it might be impossiblefor these officers to give the virtually full-time service which theproper transaction of the business of the House now required. It hadbeen suggested that the Leader of the Opposition in the House ofLords should receive  1,500 and the Opposition Chief Whip  1,000a year. It would be appropriate for the Opposition Chief Whip inthe House of Commons to be paid at the same level as a parliamentary Secretary.As regards the salaries of Ministers the Ministerial Committeehad thought it important to express whatever increase was consideredappropriate as a proportion of that recommended by the lawrence committee rather than as a proportion of the existing salary. a figure of 50 per cent of the recommended increase through the whole range of Ministerial salaries appeared to be appropriate. To reducethe proportion to 40 or 30 per cent would result in the salaries ofthe most junior Ministers being too low in relation to those ofPrivate Members. The Ministerial Committee&apos;s attention had been drawn to the situation of Ministers in the House of Lords who werenot entitled to draw the daily attendance allowance. This might bear Ihardly on junior Ministers in particular, whose salaries would hardlyenable them to meet the extra expense of travelling to, and living in, london. The question whether they could be allowed to continue to jdraw the attendance allowance, however, raised a difficult point of 1principle and would need further consideration in the light of the 1taxation implications.It was hoped that it would be possible to embody the provisions knecessary for the establishment of a Members&apos; contributory pension f.scheme and those increasing Ministerial salaries in a single Bill which  could be debated shortly before Christmas, on the same day Bas the Resolution increasing Members&apos; salaries.
CC. 8 (64)In discussion the Cabinet considered the following questions arising from the report of the Lawrence Committee:Salaries and allowances of Members of parliament it was suggested that it would be embarrassing to increaseMembers&apos; salaries shortly before the announcement of arbitrationawards for dockers and railway workers and some months beforethe new increases in National Insurance benefits could take effect.Nevertheless, the Government should not evade responsibility foracting on the recommendations of an impartial committee whichhad been appointed for the express purpose of resolving the embarrassment which the Government of the day would alwaysencounter in proposing increased salaries for Members of Parliament.The proposed increase was amply justified in the light of the movementof prices and salaries and of the current necessity for Members to spend the greater part of the week in London. The recommendations should therefore be accepted and should be implementedretrospectively to the beginning of the new Session. As a matter of presentation it would be desirable to attempt to make clear to thepublic the distinction between the basic salary of  2.000 and the allowance of  1,250 for expenses.Pensions of Members of parliament it was agreed in principle that the Lawrence Committee&apos;recommendation for the establishment of a contributory pensions scheme should be accepted, subject to the consideration of detailswhich the Committee had not fully elaborated. There might be advantage if the scheme operated from a date related to theintroduction of graduated pensions under the National InsuranceScheme; but the precise date would have to be considered in thelight of the fact that the salary recommended by the lawrence committee took account of the proposed pensions contribution of 150, which should accordingly be deducted from the date at whichthe new salary became payable. The date of operation of the pensions scheme should therefore be further considered, together with otherdetails, by the Lord Presidents Committee of Ministers.Ministerial salaries in discussion it was agreed that in determining the statutorysalaries to be paid to Ministers due weight should be given both tothe responsibilities of the posts in question and to the fact thatMinisterial salaries were liable to remain unchanged for abnormallylong periods. As regards the amount of the salaries it was argued, onthe one hand, that the principle enunciated by Mr. Lloyd Georgeand quoted by the Lawrence Committee, that payment in the publicservice should enable a man to maintain himself comfortably andhonourably but not luxuriously, pointed to a level of remunerationlower than that &quot;which would result from the adoption of 50 per cent of the increase recommended by the Lawrence Committee. On theother hand, if proper allowance was made for the responsibilities ofa 3
Ministers and for the earnings of individuals of comparable standing in other walks of life, the figure of  8,500 for a senior Minister,which would result from acceptance of half the recommendedincrease, was the minimum that could reasonably be adopted; andeven at that level Ministers would receive less than the salaries whichit might prove necessary to offer in order to attract individuals from outside the public service into their Departments. For purposes oflegislation, therefore, the figure of half the increase recommended bythe Lawrence Committee should be adopted in respect of allMinisterial salaries, including those of the Prime Minister, the LordChancellor and the Law Officers. It was arguable that theLord Advocate should be placed on an equality with the Solicitor-General, as the Lawrence Committee recommended. But it was not clear that his responsibilities, though of wider scope, were of equalweight; and the more appropriate course would be to apply thefactor of half the Lawrence Committee&apos;s proposals to all existingsalaries without exception.Date of operation of increases in Ministerial salariesIt was suggested that, while it would be appropriate to introduce legislation at an early stage of the present Parliament in order toauthorise the new Ministerial salaries, there would be advantage if ministers declined for the time being to draw the additionalemoluments in view of the serious economic situation. This purposecould be achieved either by a voluntary collective agreement or bya provision in the Bill that the new salaries would not become payable until a date in the future. A gesture of this kind on the partof members of the Government could be a powerful means of effecting the necessary change in the attitude of the public towardsthe development of an incomes policy, on which the rest of theGovernments economic plans were largely dependent; and it wouldbe in accordance with the Labour Party&apos;s policy of reducing disparityof incomes by requiring the largest sacrifices from the wealthiermembers of the community. On the other hand it was argued that theGovernments most effective gesture would be seen to be thereduction by half of the increase recommended by the lawrence committee. To refuse to accept the remaining increase would be unlikely to make any additional impression on public opinion, wouldbe irrelevant to incomes policy (which depended not on a standstillin wages and salaries but on the achievement of higher productivity)and would merely expose the Government to the continuing difficultyof finding a time when acceptance of the increases would beopportune. Moreover, it would be unwise to overlook the additional expenditure which Ministers would find it necessary to incur as aresult of the acceptance of office or the losses which they wouldsustain by forgoing the other sources of income which had beenopen to them as Private Members of Parliament. A long delay in bringing the increases into operation might well place some ministers, particularly junior Ministers, in financial embarrassment.Substantial postponement might also be embarrassing to back-benchMembers of Parliament, since the considerations of the publicinterest which had induced Ministers to forgo an increase in their
CC. 8 (64)salaries might be held to be equally applicable to Members ofParliament. The balance of advantage appeared to lie in choosing a relatively early date, such as April 1965, for the implementation ofthe approved increases, since by that time some recovery in the economy could be expected whereas circumstances at a later date,such as the beginning of the second Session of Parliament, would beless predictable.Pensions of the Prime Minister and the Lord ChancellorIt was agreed that the principle of accepting half the increaserecommended by the Lawrence Committee should be applied to thepensions of the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor.The SpeakerIt was agreed that the salaries of the Speaker, the Chairman andthe Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means should be raised inconformity with Ministerial salaries, to which they were at presentlinked, and from the same date. The Speakers expense allowance should remain unchanged for the present; and his pension shouldcontinue to be fixed by Resolution of the House of Commons onthe retirement of each Speaker, rather than by statute as recommended by the Lawrence Committee.Allowances of Members of the House of LordsIt was agreed that the daily attendance allowance of Membersof the House of Lords should be increased to A\ guineas with effect from the beginning of the Session. Further consideration should begiven to the position of Ministers in the House of Lords, some ofwhom might suffer hardship from the loss of the daily attendance allowance at a time when it had become essential for them tomaintain accommodation in London. The problem should be examined by the Lord Presidents Committee of Ministers.Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons and in theHouse of Lords; and the Opposition Chief WhipsIt was agreed that it would probably be appropriate that the salary of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of commons should be equated with the lower level fixed for Ministers of Stateand that a new salary to be paid to the Opposition Chief Whip shouldbe at the rate applicable to a Parliamentary Secretary. The questionof providing a salary for the Leader of the Opposition and theOpposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords should be examined by the Lord Presidents Committee of Ministers.ProcedureIt would be desirable that a statement, indicating theGovernments intentions on the major recommendations of the lawrence Committee, should be made by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons, to coincide with the publication of the
Committee&apos;s report on the afternoon of Monday, 16th November.The Bill which would be required to increase Ministers&apos; salaries andto introduce a contributory pensions scheme for Members ofParliament should be introduced, if possible, in time to be debatedbefore Christmas, on the same day as the Resolution authorising theincrease in Members&apos; salaries.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should (a) accept   the   recommendations   of   the   lawrence committee in respect of salaries, allowances anda contributory pensions scheme for Members ofParliament and of allowances of Members of theHouse of Lords;(b) propose increases in the salaries of Ministers, and ofOfficers of the House of Commons whose salarieswere related to those of Ministers, by halfthe amount recommended by the lawrence committee, with effect from 1st April, 1965;(c) propose an increase in the salary of the Leader of theHouse of Commons to an equality with that ofa junior Minister of State and propose theintroduction of a salary for the Opposition chief whip in the House of Commons on an equality with that of a Parliamentary Secretary.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for his Committee ofMinisters to examine, in the light of their discussion (a) the details of a contributory pensions scheme for members of Parliament;(b) the position of Ministers of the House of Lords inrelation to the daily attendance allowance;(c) the payment of a salary to the Leader of theOpposition and the Opposition Chief Whip in theHouse of Lords;and to report to the Cabinet.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thereport of the Lawrence Committee to be published on16th November and would announce the Government^conclusions upon its main recommendations in the Houseof Commons on the same afternoon.Import 4.   The First Secretary of State said that the MinisterialCharges Committee on Economic Development, at their meeting on Friday,6th November, had decided to refer to the Cabinet a proposal, onwhich the Committee had been unable to reach agreement, that weshould unilaterally abolish the remaining tariffs on industrial goods which we imported from other members of the European Free trade association (EFTA). This proposal was intended to counteract the adverse impact on EFTA of our recent decision to introduce import
5. The Prime Minister said that the Defence and overseas policy Committee had recently considered the supply of arms to south Africa. They had agreed in recommending that there shouldbe an embargo on future supplies, in the sense that no new contracts should be authorised and that no new export licences should beissued. They had taken the view, however, that existing contracts,subject to two exceptions, should be fulfilled, on the grounds thattheir cancellation would be liable to entail serious financial and commercial consequences and might endanger our staging andoverflying rights in South Africa. Since the supplies concerned were largely items of naval equipment which could not be used for internalrepression, this course would be defensible.The first of the two exceptions would relate to sporting weapons and ammunition. Since these were particularly relevant to repressivepolicies, all shipments would be stopped from the date of theannouncement. The second exception would relate to an order for16 Buccaneer aircraft, in respect of which the Government of Southcharges in breach of the EFTA Convention and without advanceconsultation with our partners in the Association. It was open to the objection, however, that it would be liable to be regarded by othercountries as an act of discrimination; and the force of this obection had been confirmed by the fact that, later in the same day and before there could be any opportunity to seek a ruling from the Cabinet,the French Government had made it clear that, if we discriminatedin favour of EFTA, they would refuse to take the necessary technicalaction to enable us to have recourse to the International monetary fund (I.M.F.). Since we could not afford to leave sterling withoutthe support which a drawing on the I.M.F. would provide, there hadbeen no alternative but to inform other EFTA countries that wecould not reduce our tariffs.In discussion there was general agreement that it was veryunfortunate that we should have been forced into this decision bythe action of the French Government, even though it was one which,on merits, we might ultimately have reached ourselves. The foreign secretary, the President of the Board of Trade, and the Minister ofAgriculture would be attending the EFTA Ministerial council meeting on 19th November; and it would be necessary to considerbefore then the steps which might be taken at that meeting to restore the morale of EFTA, which had been severely strained by recent events.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forfurther consideration to be given, in the light of their discussion, to the manner in which we might best seek to reinforce the cohesion of the European Free trade association.
Africa had already paid  11 million towards a contract price of 25 million. The future of this order would have to be considered inthe light of our own defence requirements and of the possibility of finding an alternative foreign purchaser. A decision would be taken before the end of the year; and there was no risk that any of theaircraft would be shipped to South Africa in the meantime.The policy which was reflected in these recommendations was similar to the policy which the United States Government had adopted in fulfilment of the United Nations Resolution on the supplyof arms to South Africa. It would be necessary to convey thedecisions forthwith to the Government of South Africa, togetherwith the Governments of the United States and other countries concerned, and to make an announcement to this effect in Parliamentvery shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, it would be important to avoid any premature disclosure of the Governments intentions.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement about the policy to be adopted in relation to the supplyof arms to South Africa.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Governmentsconcerned of the action to be taken to give effect to thispolicy.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thenecessary announcement of the new policy to be made inParliament at the appropriate moment.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1964.
