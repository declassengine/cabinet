OverseaAffairsGreeceRhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 38thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the currentconstitutional crisis in Greece had its origin in a dispute between theKing of Greece and the former Prime Minister, M. Papandreou,about the action to be taken as a result of the discovery of a Left-wingpolitical faction within the armed forces. M. Papandreou hadobjected to a proposal by the Minister of Defence to conduct an inquiry into this incident; and he had proposed to dismiss theMinister and to assume the defence portfolio himself. The King hadbeen unable to accept this arrangement; and he had thereforedismissed M. Papandreou and had invited M. Novas to form a new government. As a result there had been popular demonstrations infavour of M. Papandreou; and, if a general election provedunavoidable, M. Papandreou might decide to campaign on an anti-Royalist platform. If it became clear that, in so doing, he hadthe support of the Communist Party in Greece, the crisis could develop on lines unfavourable to the West; and even Greek support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation might be called inquestion.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, as a result of a request by the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, that a UnitedKingdom Minister should visit Salisbury, the Minister of State for commonwealth Relations had undertaken this mission. His purpose would be merely to ascertain how the current discussions with theGovernment of Rhodesia about the future constitutional developmentof the Territory should proceed; and he would not attempt tonegotiate a final settlement at this stage.IndustrialDisputesRailways(previous reference:CC (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 6)3. The Minister of Labour said that the current dispute aboutbonuses for train drivers, which has led to the introduction ofworking-to-rule in the Southern Region of British Railways, derivedoriginally from the faulty methods by which the Railways board had sought to introduce the incentive bonus scheme. The annual conference of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (ASLEF) had rejected, in May, the latest of a series of proposals which had been worked out for this purpose; but, in response to the growing public discontent about the deterioration in services caused by the introduction of working-to-rule, the executive of the union had undertaken to recall the conference on 10th august and to recommend that negotiations on incentive bonuses shouldcontinue on the basis of &quot; the highest possible payment with theminimum relaxation of the agreement on single manning &quot;. He hadCC 40 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. The Opposition wouldmove a Motion of Censure against the Government on Monday,2nd August.
made it clear to them that the Government could not contemplatea situation in which working-to-rule would continue unabated untilthe 10th August; and it would be necessary to consider again, earlyin the following week, what action should be taken if the union hadby then failed to persuade their members to resume normal workingpending the outcome of the reconvened conference. It might prove necessary to institute a Court of Inquiry into the dispute; but it wouldbe desirable to defer action of this kind for as long as possible, since it might well cause the union to withdraw their offer to recall theannual conference and so exacerbate, rather than relieve, the presenttension.In discussion there was general agreement that, although the railwaymen were entitled to feel aggrieved about the anomalies andinequities of the present structure of their wage rates, the Governmentcould not afford to compromise on the basic issue which was at stake in the present dispute i.e., the introduction of incentive schemes inorder to increase productivity.Public ServicePensionsFullReckoning ofUnestablishedCivil service. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (65) 103) on the full reckoning for pension ofunestablished civil service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Staff Side ofthe National Whitley Council had requested in January, 1965, that discussions should be initiated on their long-standing claim for allunestablished service to reckon in full for pension purposes onsubsequent establishment. At present unestablished service reckonedin full if rendered after 14th July, 1949, and as to half if renderedbefore that date. In order to reduce the cost of the further concessionnow envisaged the Staff Side proposed that full reckoning should beintroduced by stages; and they were prepared both to waive theclaim that lump sums already paid on retirement should berecalculated and to accept a reasonable financial limit. They restedtheir claim on the comment of the Royal Commission on the CivilService, 1953-55, that on full reckoning no question of principle wasoutstanding and that the sole consideration was that of cost; andthey referred to a document issued by the Labour Party for the useof candidates in the General Election of 1964, which stated that theparty accepted the principle of full reckoning. To concede fullreckoning, however, would involve reopening conditions of servicerendered many years ago by individuals who in many cases (includingnearly all industrial civil servants) had had no expectation of establishment or pension at the time. It would also involve acceptingas pensionable the service in the 1939-45 War of individuals who had entered the Civil Service after the war, whereas service in the 1914-18War did not count at all; and it would undoubtedly go beyond thenormal practice of the good employer. Full reckoning, including therecalculation of past lump sums, would cost  310 million over a long period, of which  38 million would be incurred in the first year. The
Government did not appear to be under any obligation to give priority to expenditure on a scheme of this nature over other partsof their social programme. A modified scheme at a cost which couldbe accommodated seemed likely to create more grievances than itwould satisfy and might stimulate pressure for further concessions in this and allied fields. Proposals for a general increase in pensions for public servants, with effect from 1st January, 1966, would bebrought forward shortly, with a view to legislation early in thefollowing Session; and these might be regarded as having a strongerclaim on the Exchequer than an increase in payments which wouldbe limited to a particular section of those concerned. It was proposed,therefore, with the agreement of the Social Services Committee, toinform the Secretary-General of the Staff Side that, while the claim for full reckoning was not regarded as having no merit, it could notin present circumstances be given sufficient priority to justify detailed negotiations. It would also be necessary to resist pressure toundertake negotiations now with a view to introducing a scheme intwo or three years&apos; time.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was suggested, however, that the Governments decision shouldnot be conveyed to the Secretary-General of the Staff Side in theimmediate future, since current negotiations on pensions between theLondon Transport Board and the transport trade unions might be prejudiced if the unions, who were pressing for an extension ofcertain limited arrangements for reckoning the unestablished serviceof their members, were able to claim that the Government might beprepared at some future date to accord more generous treatment to public servants.Further discussion turned on the terms and timing of any statement of the Governments intention to increase public service pensions. On the one hand it was suggested that, if an announcementwere made considerably in advance of the introduction of thenecessary legislation, the Government would be criticised for notbringing it into effect before 1966 and would therefore be pressed to make the increases retrospective. On the other hand an indication of the Governments intentions given early in the Recess would allowtime for the disappointment of those (particularly among pensionersof the Armed Services) who advocated the principle of parity tosubside before Parliament reassembled. On balance, the leastdisadvantageous course might be to take the opportunity likely tobe offered in the Parliamentary debate on the cost of living on28th July to indicate that the Government were giving sympathetic consideration to an increase in public service pensions but to decline to discuss the proposals in detail on the ground that it would beimproper to anticipate The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (65) 103.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer(i) to arrange for the Government spokesman winding up the Parliamentary debate on the cost of living on28th July to indicate that the Government were giving sympathetic consideration to the question ofincreasing public service pensions but to decline todiscuss the Governments intentions in detail in anticipation of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament;(ii) to inform the Secretary-General of the Staff Side ofthe National Whitley Council after the debate thatin present circumstances the Government could not give sufficient priority to the introduction of fullreckoning for unestablished service to justifynegotiations for this purpose.Electoral 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeRegister Secretary (C (65) 104) about the frequency of publication of the electoral register.The Home Secretary said that under present law one electoralregister was published each year. From 1918 to 1926 there were tworegisters a year, the second having been abandoned in the latter year as a measure of economy. In 1946 the Oliver Committee on electoral registration (Cmd. 7004) had recommended the reinstatement of asecond register; and provision had been made accordingly in the representation of the People Act, 1948. In the following year,however, the second register had again been abolished by the electoral Registers Act, 1949, primarily on financial grounds. ThisAct had also provided that persons who became 21 years of age afterthe qualifying date for the present annual register but before the qualifying date for the abolished autumn register should have their names specially registered for voting at elections held after the dateof operation of the latter.The main criticism of the present arrangements was that a register compiled on the basis of a qualifying date of 10th Octoberwas four months out of date when it came into use on 16th february and up to 16 months out of date if it were used for an election heldearly in the following year. A sample survey carried out by theCentral Office of Information in 1958 had indicated that the registerwas just over 96 per cent accurate at the qualifying date and that itlost accuracy at the rate of a half per cent per month. On the basisof these statistics the register would be about 93^ per cent accurateon publication and 88 per cent accurate immediately before thepublication of the ensuing register. The cost of preparing one annualregister was at present  2-8 million for the whole of the UnitedKingdom; and this expenditure would be almost doubled if a secondannual register were restored. About half the cost was at presentmet by the local authorities, since the register was used for localgovernment, as well as Parliamentary, elections. But an autumn
register would be of no value for local government purposes; andlocal authorities might therefore expect the Exchequer to meet thewhole of the additional expenditure involved.The question of a second annual register was not specifically mentioned in the terms of reference of the Speakers Conference on electoral Law; but they were sufficiently wide to allow the conference to consider the issues involved and it was understood that they intended to do so. The conference were unlikely to report, however,in time for their recommendations to be given effect in legislation to be promoted in the next Session of Parliament. On the other hand,if a second annual register were to be restored and were to comeinto operation by the autumn of 1966, it would be necessary for legislation to be passed before the end of 1965.Discussion showed considerable support for the institution of asecond annual register. There was general agreement, however, thatit would be preferable that this change should be seen, if possible,to result from the work of the Speakers Conference, particularly since in the previous Parliament the Labour Party had rejected a proposal by the then Administration for the introduction of postal voting, onthe ground that it would anticipate a general review by all parties ofthe electoral arrangements, and the Government might therefore bevulnerable to criticism if they were now to institute a change inelectoral procedures before the Speaker&apos;s Conference had reported.Since the final report of the conference might not be available forsome time, the Speaker might be requested to arrange for theproduction, as soon as possible, of an interim report on the first part of the terms of reference of the conference, which appeared tocomprise the question of the electoral register. If, contrary toexpectation, the conference were to take the view that this issue wasnot within their competence, the Cabinet would need to considerwhether to reinstate a second register without more ado.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (65) 104.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to request the Speaker toarrange for the Speakers Conference on Electoral law to produce an early interim report on the first part oftheir terms of reference, including the frequency of thepreparation of electoral registers.ReformsRelating to young people in Trouble:Draft WhitePaper6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (65) 107) to which was annexed a draft White paper on young people in trouble.The Home Secretary said that the White Paper was based onan urgent review of the problems of young offenders, which hadbeen carried out by the Home Office in the light of the reports ofthe Labour Party Study Group, under the chairmanship of Lord
Longford, and of the Scottish Committee on Children and YoungPersons under the chairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon. There had been no consultation, however, with outside organisations; and it wastherefore suggested that the White Paper should be published as astatement of provisional proposals in order to encourage discussion and facilitate consultation. If the draft were approved, it would bedesirable to give the organisations most closely concerned a summaryof its proposals before publication.The proposals foreshadowed a first step towards the reformsadvocated by the Longford Group. They were based on the desireto remove children and young persons under 16 from the atmosphere of the courts and offenders between 16 and 21 from association withadult offenders. In the case of the younger age group questions of fact were seldom disputed; and the sole question at issue was usuallyhow best a child who committed offences or was in need of care,protection or control could be dealt with. It was proposed that the child should be brought in the first instance before a family council,who would consider this question in consultation with his parentsand, if possible, secure agreements on a method of treatment. If,however, the facts were disputed or agreement was not reached, thecase would go to a family court. Family councils would be appointedby local authorities and would be composed of social workers in thechildren&apos;s department, together with other individuals selected fortheir experience of children and their awareness of the problemsfacing the children and adults likely to come before them. Specialcourts would be constituted, consisting of panels of justices selected for their capacity for dealing with young persons. These, sitting asfamily courts, would deal with cases referred to them by familycouncils and would exercise the existing jurisdiction of magistrates&apos;courts in relation to questions of adoption, applications for consent to marry and, possibly, affiliation proceedings where the respondentwas under 21. Sitting as youth courts, they would exercise criminal jurisdiction in relation to offences alleged to have been committed by persons between 16 and 21, except as regards the more seriouscases which they would commit to Assizes or Quarter Sessions. Whenthey dealt with other indictable cases not appropriate to summary jurisdiction a legally qualified chairman would preside. The range of treatment available for children and young persons would be similar to that existing at present, subject to certain modifications,the most important of which would be the transfer of the majorityof approved schools from voluntary managers to local authorities,who would exercise a flexible control over the length of time whicha child spent in a school. Senior approved schools would be combined with borstals to form a system of youth training centresunder the control of the Home Office.Since it was necessary, in order to make an impact on the growing problem of juvenile delinquency, to start by dealing withmaladjustment in family relationships, it was proposed to accept inprinciple the concept of a family service and to appoint a smallindependent committee to review the organisation and responsibilities of the local authority social services and to consider what changes
were desirable to ensure the creation of an effective family service.The development of the preventive work which local authorities were already undertaking in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by Section 1 of the Children and Young Persons&apos; Act, 1963,would continue.In discussion it was explained that some members of the social services Committee had hoped to avoid the necessity of appointing a committee to consider the organisation of a family service; butthey had accepted, though with regret, the strong advice tenderednot only by the Ministers concerned with the relevant local authority services but also by a distinguished group of independent personsthat some form of independent inquiry was essential, since the localauthorities would be liable to be offended if proposals for there organisation of the services for which they were responsible werepromulgated, even provisionally, without consultation with them, ftwas desirable that the independent committee should complete its work as quickly as possible; but this should not be allowed to prejudice the effectiveness of their inquiry. In order to ensure thatthe coherence of the local services would be preserved, it was desirable that the committee should consider not only the services provided for families with children but also those relating to personsliving alone and to childless couples. It was suggested, and agreed,that the terms of reference of the proposed committee should refer to the local authority &quot;personal social services&quot;; but a suggestionthat the committee should be charged to consider what changes weredesirable in order to ensure &quot; an effective service for every family &quot;instead of &quot; an effective family service &quot; was not accepted.Discussion then turned to the proposals for dealing with young offenders. It was suggested that those sections of public opinion which had advocated reform of the means of dealing with young offenders would be disappointed that it was apparently proposed toshift the emphasis from the consideration of their circumstances byexpert social workers to an examination by bodies composedof persons without training in social work and probably ofpredominantly middle-class background. Since those most likely tohave understanding of the problems facing the families who would come before the councils would be parents from similar income groups who had succeeded in bringing up their children withoutfamily breakdown or delinquency, it would be desirable to ensurethat individuals of this kind were selected for the councils; andlocal authorities, in making their selection, should have these considerations in mind. They should be encouraged to arrange for family councils to sit in the evening, when it would be easier for working-class members and for parents to attend. In view of thepublic anxiety about offences committed by young persons it shouldbe made clear that the family councils would not deal with seriousoffences. In general, however, the public reaction to the White Papermight be expected to be favourable, as it had been to theGovernments acceptance of the somewhat similar measures recommended by the Kilbrandon Committee.b
In discussion of the text of the White Paper the following main points were made:(a) A different title should be sought, since &quot; Young People inTrouble &quot; might attract some ridicule.(b) The last sentence of paragraph 41 should be either omittedor amended. The proposals for after-care depended on the rapid expansion of the probation and after-care service; and there shouldbe no suggestion of complacency on this score.(c) It should be made clear that the White Paper itself and theproposed committee on a family service were concerned only with england and Wales.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposals in the draft White Paper were approved as a basis for consultation and public discussion; and the Home Secretary and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster might inform the organisations concerned, in advance of publication, on the lines proposed inparagraphs 4 and 5 of C (65) 107. The date of publication should beconsidered in the context of the programme for the publication of white Papers during the autumn, which the Lord President was preparing. It would be convenient if the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster would co-ordinate consideration by the Home Secretary,the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Ministerof Health of the membership of the committee on a family service;but the appointments should be made jointly by the Ministersdepartmentally responsible for the activities in question, who shouldalso undertake any necessary approaches to outside bodies. This,however, should be without prejudice to the allocation of departmental responsibility for whatever form of family servicemight eventually be adopted.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the amendments suggested in their discussion, the draft White Paper appended to C (65) 107.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to inform the organisations concerned of the proposals in the White Paper before publication.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (i) to inform the Local Authority Associations of theproposal to set up the committee indicated inparagraph 7 of the White Paper;(ii) to co-ordinate consideration by the relevantdepartmental Ministers of the selection of individualsto be appointed to the committee.(4) Invited the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for education and Science and the Minister of Health toarrange to appoint the proposed committee jointly.
parliamentary commissioner:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (65) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)7. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C (65) 106), to which was appended thedraft of a White Paper on the Parliamentary Commissioner.The Chancellor of the Duchy said that the White Paper gaveeffect to the decisions which the Cabinet had taken at a previous meeting. The draft would be improved by the addition of headingsto various sections; and the list of Departments to be subject to investigation by the Commissioner might be transferred to an Annex.In discussion there was general agreement with the text of theWhite Paper, subject to the amendments proposed by the Chancellorof the Duchy. It would be preferable however, that the list of departments to be subject to scrutiny by the Commissioner shouldbe retained in paragraph 7, since this would give greater emphasisto the scope of the Commissioner^ functions. In addition, the textshould be amended to explain why the Commissioner would act only at the instance of a Member of the House of Commons, rather thanat the instance of any Member of Parliament. For this purpose thewords &quot; as the representative House of Parliament&quot; might be inserted after &quot; House of Commons &quot; at the beginning of paragraph 6.The Cabinet  (1) Approved the draft of the White Paper attached toC (65) 106, subject to the drafting amendments proposedin discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the question of Ministerial responsibilityfor the White Paper and the ensuing Bill and to the timing of the publication of the White Paper.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1965.
