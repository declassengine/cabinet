The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet thatthe Governments of India and Pakistan had agreed to conform withthe resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations calling for a cease-fire in the operations in Kashmir; and hostilities had accordingly ceased at 11 p.m. (GMT) on the previous day. The credit for securing this result rightly accrued to the United Nations; butthe advice which we, together with other members of theCommonwealth, had given to the two Governments had undoubtedlyplayed a significant part in influencing their final decisions. TheGovernment of Pakistan had been particularly reluctant to accede to the pressure of the Security Council; and both in Pakistan and inIndia there was considerable resentment about the attitude which theUnited Kingdom had adopted towards the conflict. This was perhaps the most effective evidence of our impartiality; and we need not be unduly dismayed that the Soviet Government had now taken theinitiative in offering to mediate between India and Pakistan. It was unlikely that they would succeed; and we should reserve our owninfluence to reinforce the effort by the United Nations which would now be required to promote a political settlement of the dispute.The Commonwealth Secretary said that pressure was rising in rhodesia for a unilateral declaration of independence, particularly on the part of the farming community, who were anxious forcertainty about the country&apos;s political future before embarking onthe planting of crops for the following season. But, although it seemed increasingly probable that the Government of rhodesia would in fact adopt this unconstitutional course, it would benecessary to make one final effort to dissuade them. It was uncertain whether this would initially take the form of the proposed visit by himself to Salisbury or whether the Prime Minister of Rhodesia,Mr. Smith, would prefer to come to London for discussions withthe United Kingdom Government. We could not dismiss thepossibility that he would seek to bring the issue to a head by arriving in London at very short notice.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Political 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PresidentContributions   of the Board of Trade (c (65) 124) about the detailed provisions for implementing the Governments decision to require companies to disclose to shareholders any contributions which they made to political organisations.The President of the Board of Trade said that an Order underthe Companies Act had originally appeared to be the most appropriateinstrument for this purpose. The Ministerial Committee on economic development had subsequently decided, however, that it would be preferable to take the necessary powers in a Bill dealing generally
with the information required to be given in company accounts inaccordance with certain of the recommendations of the JenkinsCommittee. A suitable definition of political contributions had been drafted, which would comprise not only contributions to political parties but also contributions to any organisations which engaged inactivities likely to affect public support for a political party. TheBoard of Trade&apos;s Accountancy Advisory Committee, however, had said that it would be unreasonable to require auditors to verifyinformation of this kind in company accounts, both because thiswould involve the detailed examination of a large number of smallpayments and also because auditors could not be expected to decide whether an organisation did, or did not, fall within the definition inthe Bill. They had suggested, therefore, that the information shouldbe provided in the Directors&apos; Report to shareholders.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.Although the legislation would not be retrospective it would applyto all company reports issued after the Bill became law and would therefore ensure the disclosure of contributions made in the previous year. Moreover, presentation of the information in Directors&apos; Reportsmight invite more attention to the contributions than their inclusion in the accounts. Although the disclosure of contributions would notbe checked by the auditors, there was little reason to suppose thatDirectors would deliberately flout the terms of the legislation in viewof the penalties to which they would make themselves subject underthe Companies Act.In further discussion it was suggested that, although there wasno reason to suppose that the inclusion of a provision of this kindin the general Bill dealing with company accounts would cause anyserious deterioration in the relations between the Government andindustry, it would continue to be important to take all opportunities to strengthen those relations and it might therefore be desirable togive further consideration to the means by which the government might encourage the new organisation which had been established in the City in order to enable financial institutions to concert theirviews for presentation to the Government.The Cabinet-Approved C (65) 124.ForeignPolicy(previous reference:CC(65) 19thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign Secretary said that our foreign policy had three main objectives: to maintain the strength and cohesion of the atlantic Alliance; to promote a relaxation of tension between theWestern Alliance and the Eastern bloc and to make progress on disarmament; and to strengthen the United Nations.North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)The Atlantic Alliance was faced with four main problems:(1) France. President de Gaulle,had said that the Allianceshould continue but that major changes in its organisation were
required and that by 1969 there should be no troops under foreigncommand on the soil of France. His objective was probably an alliance dependent only on mutual guarantees, without any joint planning or organisation. We had no wish to quarrel with France;but we took the view, which the United States now shared, that inthe last resort NATO could exist without France. In the european economic Community the Five had always given way hitherto to french intransigence; but they were now standing firm against thelatest French demands. It was in our interest that they shouldcontinue to do so; although French views on the undesirability ofsupranational organisations might seem close to our own, a community which was wholly subservient to France would inevitablybecome progressively more inward-looking and less satisfactory asa partner in our politico-military policies in Europe. The presentdeadlock within the Community limited the scope of any initiativeto promote a wider Europe; but we should continue to pursue anypossibilities of functional co-operation, preferably on a multilateralbasis. We should also try to define more closely the concept of closerEuropean integration and the conditions which would make itsrealisation possible.(2) Germany. The position of Germany in NATO wouldbecome stronger as the French position in the Alliance declined. Theattitude of the Federal German Government was also important inrelation to developments in East/West relations and disarmament,since our NATO allies would be reluctant to commit themselves onthese issues against German opposition. The outcome of the recentGerman elections was not wholly satisfactory; but now that theelections were over the new Government might at least feel able toadopt a more positive and constructive attitude towards such questions as relations with the Eastern bloc and Germany&apos;s easternfrontiers. If we were to induce the Federal German Government tomake progress on these issues, we must do all within our power to foster Anglo/German understanding.(3) The United States. The power of the United StatesGovernment and their ability to intervene decisively were essentialto the preservation of order and democracy in many parts of theworld. But United States policy was not always well judged; andour best means of influencing it in critical situations was to preserveclose relations with the United States Government, while retainingour freedom to express criticism or disagreement when we thoughtit necessary to do so. Recent events in the Dominican Republic hadillustrated how a United States intervention which, by itself, mighthave alienated world opinion had been transformed, by the influence of the United Nations which we had done much to promote, into action which had yielded a more acceptable and not unsatisfactorysolution.(4) Eastern Europe and Disarmament. Progress towards suchobjectives as a reduction of forces and the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Europe would inevitably take time, since we had to
overcome the initial opposition of some of our NATO allies. real progress must also depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union; andthe Soviet Government might find it difficult to co-operate in thisrespect so long as problems such as Vietnam remained unsolved.Nevertheless, we had succeeded in promoting constructive action onsuch issues as the dispute about Article 19 of the United nations charter, which should ease relations with the Soviet Union; and theSoviet attitude towards the hostilities in Kashmir, culminating intheir offer to mediate between India and Pakistan, opened uppossibilities of closer collaboration, since the Soviet Governmentwould probably find it necessary to co-operate with ourselves andthe United States in this context and undoubtedly shared our jointconcern to avoid a conflict in the Indian sub-continent from which only China would profit. We must accept the fact that Russianinfluence in India might increase; but this was not necessarilycontrary to our long-term interests, since the Soviet Union was bound to play an increasingly important role in Asia.Our proposals for the creation of an Atlantic Nuclear Force(ANF) had been designed to provide some degree of satisfaction for german aspirations to become a nuclear power, without giving theFederal German Government effective control over nuclear weapons.They would also provide an appropriate method of internationalisingour own nuclear weapons. It now seemed likely, however, that Sovietobjections to the ANF would be maintained and that, if the force were established, the Soviet Government would make it their excuse for refusing to participate in a non-dissemination treaty. Moreover, it was now uncertain whether it would be practicable in any event to bringthe ANF into being; and the Federal German Government might therefore have to be satisfied with machinery for closer consultation on nuclear matters instead of a collective nuclear force. This could still leave open the way to a non-dissemination treaty; but it wouldconfront us afresh with the problem of bringing our own nuclearcapability within some system of collective control. Meanwhile, wemust continue to seek to promote disarmament by such means asthe extension of the Test Ban Treaty, the convening of a world conference and an increase in the authority of the United nations in maintaining international order, which would in itself be the most significant and practical contribution to progressive disarmament.Middle EastWe had inherited a position which we could not afford tomaintain indefinitely. We must therefore contemplate a gradual and orderly withdrawal from the Middle East; and we had already made some progress in this direction, e.g., by promoting co-operationbetween the Rulers in the Persian Gulf in order that they might bebetter able to rely on their own resources. But the Government of Iran remained apprehensive about any extension of the influence of the United Arab Republic (UAR) in this area; and they wouldrequire to be convinced that a settlement in the Persian Gulf wouldnot result in its becoming a base for UAR subversion of Iran. TheMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Thomson, was about to
pay a series of visits to certain countries in the Middle East in orderto explain our policy to the Governments concerned. His itinerarywould include Cairo; but there seemed little chance at present of inducing the Government of the UAR to be less hostile to our interests, particularly in Southern Arabia.South-East Asia and the Far east the Government of South Vietnam appeared to be succeeding,with United States assistance, in redressing the military balance inthe conflict in Vietnam; but there was still no indication that theGovernments of North Vietnam and the Chinese People&apos;s Republicwere willing to negotiate a political settlement. As regards the dispute between Malaysia and Indonesia we continued to maintain closecontacts with the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and theUnited States; but there seemed no present prospect of a satisfactory solution. In the longer term we must look to a Western withdrawal from the Far East; but it would be important to ensure, so far aspossible, that the vacuum would be filled by regimes which, although not necessarily pro-Western, would not be wholly under Chinesedomination.Over the whole field of foreign policy we no longer enjoyed thepower and influence which we had possessed earlier in the century.But, although we could not now act decisively in world affairs onthe basis of our own unaided resources, our influence would remainvery considerable so long as we acted in concert with our allies.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the light of our limited defence resources, it might become increasingly difficult for us to take effective international action evenin conjunction with our allies. In terms of both demographic and technological power the balance of advantage would tend to inclinein favour of other countries, which would not necessarily be deterredby poverty or a scarcity of economic resources from developing oracquiring sophisticated weapons systems. It would therefore be increasingly necessary to establish effective priorities in our politico-military policies. On the other hand we could not allow other countries to suppose that they could resort to aggression as a simplemeans of solving the problems caused by over-population andunder-development; and we must remain ready to oppose policies of this kind at some point provided that we continued to mitigateas&apos; far as po^ible, by the provision of aid and related measures, theeconomic conditions which created them.(b) If the Soviet Union were willing to become actively engagedin promoting a settlement of the dispute between India and Pakistan,we might hope for Soviet collaboration in other spheres, in relationto e.g., the progressive containment of China and the control of thesupply of arms by the Great Powers to smaller countries. Both theSino-Soviet dispute and developments within the Soviet Union itselfmight create an increasing community of interest between the soviet union and the West, even though we might have to reassess our
commitment to the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) if we were to secureSoviet co-operation.(c) There was some evidence that at least the Social DemocraticParty in Germany were prepared to contemplate a more positiveattitude in relation to the Soviet Union and East Germany, althoughneither they nor the other parties could yet afford to express suchviews in public. In these circumstances we should need to give further consideration to our policy in relation to the question ofGerman reunification. It could be argued that, if we sought topromote improved relations with the Soviet Government, we should accept that reunification could not realistically imply more than theco-existence of West and East Germany and we should not lend any encouragement to the West German aspiration to interpretreunification as, in effect, the absorption of East Germany. On theother hand the mere co-existence of two German States offered little prospect of solving the problem of Berlin; and the reunification ofGermany, if effected by acceptable means such as free elections,could be argued to be essential if we were to hope for lasting peace in Europe.(d) It would be dangerous to assume that the present deadlockin the European Economic Community (e.c.) provided an appropriate moment for a renewed attempt by the United kingdom to accede to the Community. At the same time our position inrelation to Europe might need to be reassessed. It could be argued that in terms of economic and technological potential the UnitedKingdom was no longer able to compete independently with othercountries and that the diminishing commercial value of our commonwealth connections should not be regarded as sufficientcompensation for our exclusion from the market represented by the eec. On the other hand, the European Free Trade Area offered usa market with a population of over 100 million; and the e.c. itselfcould not be represented as an obstacle to our exports in the light ofthe fact that, since its creation, our trade with the member countries of the Community had more than doubled, although we were not members of it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that progress towards a solution of the problems in Europe had beenslow, partly because we had to seek to carry our allies with us andpartly because the prospect of the German elections had inhibitedany realistic discussion of the issues involved since early in theyear. Now that the German elections were over we could look foran early resumption of international debate about East/west relations and the possibilities of a reduction of tension in Europe.In other respects the Government could point to a solid record of achievement in foreign affairs. We had greatly strengthened ourrelations with the United States; and, although we had sometimeshad occasion to express frankly to the United States Governmentour difference of view, they had not sought to attach political conditions to the assistance which they had given us in other respects.
Cabinet Office, SWA,24th September, 1965.We had clearly demonstrated our support for the United Nations;and our reputation in the Organisation had never stood higher. in vietnam it was largely due to our influence that the United states administration had eventually agreed to negotiations. Our effort had also been instrumental in securing the agreement between theGovernments of India and Pakistan on the Rann of Kutch. We hadbeen fully justified in putting forward our proposals for the ANF;and, although the force might not come into being, it did not represent the only means of placing our nuclear capability under international control, particularly since the question of collective defence arrangements East of Suez had still to be examined.In the light of the discussion about Germany and Anglo-german relations, it would be desirable that the Cabinet should give furtherconsideration to the complex issues involved as soon as the policyof the new Federal German Government became apparent.It was generally accepted that this was not an opportune moment at which to seek to reopen negotiations for United kingdom membership of the e.c.. Nor should we intervene in the currentdispute within the Community. We might in due course reassess our attitude to the Community and re-examine, in the light of developments in recent years, the conditions which the Labour party had hitherto attached to the United Kingdom accession. But weshould recognise from the outset that the principles of a plannedeconomy, to which the Government were committed, would not easily be reconciled with the economic doctrines from which the eec derived; and our approach to the question of membership ofthe Community should therefore be directed not merely to thequestion whether it would be to our advantage to join it but also tothe question whether we could succeed in insisting on whateverterms and conditions we felt that we must stipulate.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement and of the points made in discussion.
