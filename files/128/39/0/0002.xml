OverseaAffairsThe SovietUnionChineseNuclear TestIndonesiaSpain : NavalExercisesMineral rights in northern rhodesia(previous reference :C.C. (64) 1stConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.The Prime Minister said that the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee had given further consideration to the governments position if the Government of Northern Rhodesia, on achievingindependence, implemented their threat to expropriate, without compensation, the mineral rights of the British South AfricaCompany. The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General had advised that in that event the company might bring a successfullaw suit against the Government. Partly for this reason but mainly in order to preserve friendly relations with Northern Rhodesia theCommonwealth Secretary, who would attend the independence5375-21. The Foreign Secretary said that little was known with certainty about Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s removal from office; but itappeared that he had been deposed rather than resigned and thatthe most probable reason was his increasingly erratic conduct ofpublic affairs, coupled with his growing differences with the militaryauthorities. The most surprising aspect of the incident had been theapparently spontaneous reaction of surprise and hostility to the changeshown by the East European countries, particularly czechoslovakia and East Germany. It was the first time that such markedindependence of the Soviet Union had been shown on so wide a scale.It seemed unlikely that the successor regime, in which supreme authority was divided between two men, would last for long; but itwas impossible to say whether one of the two leaders or some thirdpersonality would ultimately prevail. It was improbable thatMr. Khrushchev&apos;s deposition would result in major changes in soviet policy, although there might be some modification in its methods.This was likely to be true also of Sino-Soviet relations, where thefuture direction of Soviet policy on the supply of arms to India wouldprovide the most reliable indicator.The Foreign Secretary said that the nuclear test recentlyconducted by the Communist Government of China, althoughdisturbing, did not imply that the Chinese authorities would be ableto manufacture nuclear weapons forthwith. They had only a limited number of bombers, mostly obsolescent; and, although they were known to be developing a missile delivery system, a short-rangesystem was unlikely to be developed before 1968 or a long-rangesystem before 1975. There had been very critical comment on the test from Yugoslavia and East Germany; one of the few favourablereactions had come from Ghana.The Foreign Secretary said that the Indonesian Government hadprivately renewed their overtures for a peaceful settlement of their differences with Malaysia and had suggested confidential discussions with ourselves for this purpose. This approach seemed sufficientlyserious in intention to justify a very tentative response. But there could be no question of our entertaining any commitment unless therewere adequate indications that the Indonesian Government were acting in good faith.The Foreign Secretary said that the Royal Navy had carried outcombined exercises with the Spanish Navy in each of the last six years. This year the exercises v/ere due to be held in the period3rd-12th November. Action to cancel them would be resented by public opinion in Spain and would be liable to have an unfortunate effect on Anglo-Spanish trade. Nevertheless, he had agreed with thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State for Defence that theexercises should be cancelled.
celebrations in the territory, would discuss with the local Governmentthe possibility of a compromise solution by seeking initially to persuade them to settle direct with the company but being ready,in the last resort, to offer some contribution from the UnitedKingdom.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:C.C.(64)lstConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Prime Minister said that the situation in SouthernRhodesia had been further considered by the Defence and overseas policy Committee. The Commonwealth Secretary had authorised astatement, which had been issued by the British High commissioner in Salisbury, that neither the Conservative Government nor her majesty&apos;s present Ministers could accept the method by which theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia proposed to ascertain african opinion on the issue of independence. The Commonwealth secretary had offered to visit Salisbury for discussions with the Prime Ministerof Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, provided that he could alsoconsult the African nationalist leaders who were in detention.Mr. Smith&apos;s reaction to this stipulation had been unfavourable; buthe had not yet finally rejected it. If the Commonwealth Secretarymet Mr. Smith, he would warn him privately about the very serious consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence by theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia. If, however, he did not succeed in visiting Salisbury, it might become necessary for this warning tobe issued by the United Kingdom Government in a public statement on the lines of the draft appended, as Annex C, to O.P.D. (64) 2.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was important that we should be seen to have taken allpossible steps to avoid unilateral action by the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia. It was therefore for consideration whether,before the referendum to be held in Southern Rhodesia on 5th November, Mr. Smith should be invited to come to London for discussions.(b) Any public statement should be in strong terms in order tobring home to the people of Southern Rhodesia the serious consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence. Such a warning would be welcomed by moderate opinion in SouthernRhodesia. On the other hand the statement should not threatenmeasures which we would not in fact put into effect.(c) The concept of &quot; rebellion &quot;, as a description of a unilateral declaration of independence, was of doubtfully precise legal meaning.But the action which would have to be taken in order to give effectto such a declaration would almost certainly be treasonable.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, ifnecessary, whether to invite the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, to visit London for discussions.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, ifnecessary, for a public statement to be issued on the linesof the draft appended, as Annex C, to O.P.D. (64) 2.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to examine, as a matter of urgency,the wording of that statement.
sIron and Steel        3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of nationalisation Power (C. (64) 5) about the nationalisation of the iron and steelindustry.The Minister of Power proposed that the Government should concentrate on nationalising 13 large undertakings, which comprisedover 90 per cent of the United Kingdom pig iron and crude steelcapacity. Since these included three concerns which were subsidiaries of major engineering groups, it would not be easy to avoid a hybridBill.Nationalisation might best be effected by the transfer of the shares of the companies concerned to a new Central Authority,which should be empowered to draw up schemes of reorganisationto be put into effect by Statutory Instrument. Previous precedentssuggested that compensation should be based on the Stock exchange value of the shares at some specified date; but this proposal mightbe open to criticism as underrating the true values of the companiesinvolved and would require further examination.It would be essential to secure control of the trading subsidiaries of the British Iron and Steel Federation, which handled the imports and shipping of iron ore, and also to safeguard the position of theCentral Authority in relation to the Federation. Since the companies to be nationalised accounted for about 95 per cent of the currentUnited Kingdom production of iron ore and controlled about 60 percent of workable reserves, there would be no need to provide for the nationalisation of ore in the ground; and this question could be left for later consideration as part of the question of the nationalisation of mineral rights generally.Even a simplified measure such as was implied by theseproposals would involve highly complex problems of drafting, someof which would require factual investigation and consultation withorganisations in the industry. It was doubtful, therefore, whether a properly prepared Bill could be ready for introduction before at leasthalf way through the Session, which would be late for a Bill of this magnitude. It would therefore be preferable that a firm statement ofthe Governments intentions should be made as soon as possible,possibly in the form of a White Paper, but that the Bill itself shouldbe introduced at the beginning of the second Session. An appropriatereference should be included in The Queen&apos;s Speech; and theGovernments policy could be elaborated during the Debate on the address, in the course of which it could also be made clear thatinvestment which was made by the industry in good faith up toVesting Day would be taken into account in the assessment ofcompensation.In discussion there was considerable support for the view thatthe balance of advantage, both political and economic, lay in introducing the nationalisation Bill in the first Session ofParliament. In that event, however, other legislation might have to be. deferred and it would be necessary to consider carefully the timing of the introduction of the nationalisation measure in relation toother Bills which would involve complex issues of drafting, such asrent control and leasehold enfranchisement. Moreover, the nationalisation Bill should not be allowed to jeopardise theintroduction of other measures, particularly in the field of social services, to which the Government attached high priority. Indeed,it might be politically advantageous to ensure an early SecondReading for some of these Bills in order that, if the Governmentsubsequently encountered undue opposition on the issue of the nationalisation of iron and steel, public opinion should be able to appreciate the extent to which social policies also might be at risk.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that priority should be given to the early introduction of a measure to nationalise the iron and steel industry.The necessary action for this purpose should now be further considered as a matter of urgency.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that a measure to provide for the nationalisation of the iron and steel industry should beintroduced during the first Session of the forthcomingParliament.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, would arrange for thenecessary work to give effect to Conclusion (1) above tobe put in hand forthwith.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C. (64) 3), to which was appended a draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Lord President said that the Cabinet would have a further opportunity to consider the draft before it was submitted to the queen on 29th October; but it was necessary to consider at oncewhat commitments should be undertaken in the Speech as regardsthe legislation to be introduced in the first Session of Parliament.It would not be possible to introduce in one Session all the Billsrequired to implement the policies outlined in the Labour Party&apos;sElection Manifesto. Equally, the absence of specific references toa particular topic in the Speech would not necessarily mean that the relevant legislation could not be introduced if time should beavailable. On this basis the draft appended to C. (64) 3 includedreferences to Bills dealing with the nationalisation of iron and steel(though not in terms firmly committing the Government to introduce a measure in the first Session), rent control, the Land Commission,leasehold enfranchisement, the reversal of the decision of the Houseof Lords in the case of Rookes v. Barnard, teachers&apos; pay, capital punishment, law reform, the Parliamentary Commisssioner andracial discrimination. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering with the Ministers concerned the order of priority amongBills which would entail significant expenditure.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The limitations imposed by pressure on Parliamentary time,which would be aggravated by the necessity to take the morecontroversial Bills in Committee of the Whole House, would imply that some major measures to which the Government were committed could not be introduced in the first Session. Others of less importance, which might be included in the programme if theywere available for early introduction, need not be mentioned in the speech; but Ministers would have an opportunity in the Debate onthe Address to explain the Governments intentions more fully and,in particular, to refer to policies on which work would be put in hand at once, even though legislation might not be practicable until thesecond Session of Parliament. Among the subjects which might bedealt with in this way were concessionary fares on buses, on whicha short Bill might be introduced early in the Session, and responsibility for the child care service in London, on whichundertakings had been given by the Labour Party while in opposition.(b) It would be very desirable to introduce in the first SessionBills on rent control and the Land Commission. But they might wellThe Queen sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament
CC. 2 (64)occupy considerable time both in preparation and in debate; and itwas important that, while the Government should be seen to beproceeding as rapidly as possible with these measures, other reformson which early action would be expected should not be delayed. Itmight be possible, for example, to introduce an early Bill on leasehold reform; and, while the resources of the Ministry of Housing shouldnot be diverted for this purpose from the major measures,consideration should be given to the possibility of making use of aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill, which had been introduced during theprevious Session but had failed to reach the Statute Book.(c) A measure on pensions, if only of an interim character, shouldbe introduced at an early stage in view of the Labour Party&apos;s pledgesduring the Election to accord priority to this problem; and anundertaking should be given to initiate a review of the problem ofcompensation for older occupiers of house property who weredisplaced by development schemes. In general, the measures on pensions and national insurance mentioned in paragraph 13 of thedraft should have priority over the abolition of National health service charges. A measure on pensions should precede any measure to implement the report of the committee under the chairmanship ofSir Geoffrey Lawrence on the remuneration of Ministers and members of Parliament.(d) It would be desirable to refer to a measure on monopolies and restrictive practices, which members of the Government hadcriticised the Conservative Administration for failing to introduceduring the previous Session. A Bill for this purpose was nearly ready;but, before undertaking a firm commitment to introduce it duringthe present Session, the Cabinet would need to consider its claims in relation to those of other measures which it would be essentialto introduce in the first Session.(e) The Government were committed to the establishment of aHighland Development Board; and, since the necessary legislation would occupy little time in the House of Commons, it should be mentioned in the Speech. Further consideration would have to begiven, however, to the proposal to introduce legislation on the teaching profession in Scotland, which could produce embarrassingrepercussions in England and Wales.(/) Consideration should be given to the means of ensuring, inrelation to the work of the Boundary Commission, equality of electorsas between one constituency and another.In further discussion a number of suggestions were made for theamendment of the text of the draft Speech.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the Bills mentioned in the draft of the queen&apos;s Speech should, if possible, be introduced in the first Sessionof Parliament. Further consideration should be given to the orderin which they should come forward and, in particular, to the possibilityof the early introduction of a short measure on leasehold reform andto the need to introduce interim measures on pensions and rent control.It would be helpful if the Lord President would consider with theMinisters concerned the questions which had been raised on the childcare service in London, the proposed legislation on the Scottishteaching profession and the problem of equal votes. Ministers who wished to propose amendments to the draft Queen&apos;s Speech should send them immediately to the Lord President for consideration bythe Committee on The Queen&apos;s Speech. He would himself discuss withthe Lord President, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andother Ministers the possibility of improving Parliamentary procedure,particularly for the purpose of dealing expeditiously with law reform and other uncontroversial measures.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Bills mentioned in the draft Queen&apos;s Speechappended to C. (64) 3, including a Bill for the nationalisation of iron and steel, should, if possible, beintroduced in the first Session of Parliament.(2) Invited the Lord President (i) to bring before them in due course a further draftof The Queen&apos;s Speech, revised in the light of their discussion and of amendments proposed by ministers;(ii) to consider, in consultation with the Home secretary and other Ministers concerned, the question ofresponsibility for the child care service in London;(iii) to consider, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Secretary of State for education and Science, the proposed legislation onthe teaching profession in Scotland;(iv) to examine with the Home Secretary and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government possible meansof ensuring equality of votes as between oneconstituency and another.(3) Invited Ministers to send to the Lord President immediatelyany amendments which they wished to suggest to thedraft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliamentappended to C. (64) 3.EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC. (64) 1stConclusions,Minute 2)*5. The Cabinet had before them a note setting out the headings of a Government statement on the economic situation and themeasures proposed for dealing with it.The First Secretary of State said that the purpose of thestatement would be to give a full and frank explanation of theeconomic situation which had confronted the Government on takingoffice; to announce the immediate steps which the Government were proposing to take in order to correct the trade imbalance; and togive an indication of the manner in which the Governments economic policies would be developed in the longer term. It was proposed thatthe statement should be issued on Monday, 26th October. Togetherwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer he would arrange for suitablepublicity to be given to it; and the Prime Minister would probablygive a further explanation of the Governments proposals on televisionthe same evening. The details of these arrangements, however, would depend to some extent on the need to give advance warning of theGovernments intentions to other Governments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the statement was designed to demonstrate to public opinion both in this country and overseas that we did not intend to rely either on borrowing or ondeflationary policies to help us to overcome our current difficulties.Preliminary indications suggested that, on the basis of the programme set out in the statement, we should be able to secure the interimfinancial support which would be required while the more fundamental remedial action began to take effect.The Cabinet then considered the individual headings of thestatement. In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Import restrictions. Decisive steps would be taken to reduceinessential imports, not as a protectionist device but as a strictlytemporary measure which was forced upon us by the nature of the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
CC. 2 (64)immediate situation. There were two methods by which reductions could be secured first, the imposition of quantitative restrictions;second, a system of temporary import charges. There were arguments for and against each of these courses. Quantitative restrictions wouldnot involve a breach of our international obligations in relation tothe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA); they would not necessarilylead to a significant increase in import prices; and public opinionappeared to be prepared for action on these lines. On the other hand it might be thought that they would become a more permanent feature of the Governments economic policy; and this might provokecorresponding retaliation by countries whose exports to us would beaffected. A system of import charges could more easily be shown to be non-protectionist and of a temporary character; it would be easier to arrange and could have a wider coverage; and it would havethe further advantage of yielding additional revenue. On the otherhand the imposition of temporary charges would constitute a breach of our GATT and EFTA obligations; by increasing import prices itwould cause the retail price index to rise by about 1 per cent; andit would therefore be liable to make it more difficult to implementan incomes policy.Neither course would be welcome to our trading partners,although a number of West European countries would not have stronggrounds for complaint in view of their own breaches of their GATTobligations. Both courses were likely to have adverse effects uponconsumers and the working population in this country. On balance,however, the Governments immediate objective of redressing thedeteriorating balance of trade could best be achieved by a systemof temporary charges.Final decisions on the scope and coverage of the charges had still to be taken; and the Ministers concerned would need to give urgent consideration to these questions. It seemed likely, however, that, onthe assumption that basic foodstuffs, raw materials and tobacco wouldbe excluded, about a third of the country&apos;s imports would be subjectto the charges. Exports from other EFTA countries of goods whichwere included within the final definition would have to be subject tothe necessary charges. The proposals could be introduced in a ways and Means Resolution in the very near future and in that event theycould probably take effect from the middle of November.(b) Export stimulation. The statement should comprise positiveas well as negative measures; and it would propose, for this purpose,that exporters should be relieved of some part of their present burdenof indirect taxation. The relief would take the form of a percentagerepayment of tax to exporters, based on their proportionateexpenditure on particular items, including vehicle duty, the excisetax on petrol and oil and purchase tax on stationery. It would bedesirable in principle that these benefits should extend to those firmswhose production contributed to savings in imports; and a general reference to this point might be included in the statement, althoughit would take time to prepare specific measures in this context.The cost of this proposal would be about  70 million. Therebates would be made retrospective until November; and, on theassumption that parliamentary authority was obtained before christmas, the first repayments to exporters should start in February1965. There was some risk that they might merely serve to inflateprofits instead of being used for reducing export prices; and, if so,they would be liable, in combination with the likely increase in retail prices as a result of the import charges, to increase the difficultiesof securing a satisfactory incomes policy. On the other hand it was essential to create confidence in the Governments determination topromote exports; and the modest system of rebates proposed wasb
directed to encouraging those industries which found the export tradeonly marginally profitable rather than providing an additionalincentive to the relatively small group of very large firms which were already well established in the export trade. Even so, the effect ofthe new proposals would need to be kept under careful review; andthe statement might include a warning that the Government wouldhave to consider taking appropriate action if it appeared that the concessions were being misused.In addition the statement would propose that a CommonwealthExport Council should be established immediately and that consideration should be given to other promotional measures, suchas the creation of co-operative selling arrangements overseas bysmaller United Kingdom firms.(c) Incomes policy. The measures proposed as regards imports and exports would not solve the underlying problems of the economy.These could only be tackled by the evolution of longer-term policies,designed to strengthen the basic competitiveness of industry, includingthe introduction of a policy for prices and incomes. The statement would indicate that, for this purpose, the Government would undertake immediate discussions with the Trades Union Congress.The Federation of British Industries and other organisations.(d) Government expenditure. The statement should foreshadowa searching review of Government expenditure in order to relieve the strain on the balance of payments and to release resources for more productive purposes by eliminating items of low economic and socialpriority. The credibility of the Governments intentions would be enhanced if reference could be made, in this context, to the reconsideration of some specific project such as the Concord aircraft.The Minister of A aviation, however, doubted the wisdom of referringspecifically to the Concord in the statement. An immediate announcement would not lead to immediate savings;  7 million hadbeen spent on the project already and at least twice as much wouldhave to be spent in addition, even if a decision to abandon it wastaken forthwith. Moreover, our relations with the French Governmentwould be adversely affected. In particular, there was no break clause in the agreement and the French authorities would be free to seek to recover, by way of damages, their share of the current expenditure,amounting to some  20 million. Three other inter-related Anglo-French projects might also be affected.On the other hand public opinion would be unimpressed if thestatement offered no specific example of prospective savings onprestige projects; and there was also some risk of undesirablespeculation if the initial project to be selected for this purpose wasnot precisely identified. On balance, therefore, the statement should indicate that, as a first step in relieving the strain on our resources,the Government would be entering into discussions with the FrenchGovernment on the Concord development programme; and theFrench Government should be given advance warning of this announcement. But there would be considerable advantage inindicating at the same time that we intended to maintain a designeffort in the field of supersonic transport.(e) Redeployment of manpower. The reallocation of resources for more productive purposes would be liable to lead to temporarydislocation amongst the working population. Immediate priority should therefore be given to the introduction of severance payments,transfer grants and other arrangements to enable manpower to beredeployed in accordance with technological change and more rapid development in the under-developed areas of the country. TheMinister of Labour would discuss these questions with his colleagues in the near future.(/) Social programmes. The statement would need to refer tothe close relationship which existed between the social programmes
Industrial 6.   The Minister of Labour said that there was no immediateDisputes prospect of a settlement of the current dispute in the docks. the docks dockers were demanding an increase of 25s. a week for time-paid workers and a 5 per cent increase for piece workers, whereas theemployers were only willing to concede an increase of 12s. 6d. a week to the former and a 3% per cent increase for the latter. He proposedto hold discussions with both parties in the near future, in the hopethat they might be induced to co-operate in establishing a Court of inquiry in connection with the dispute.Railways The Minister of Labour said that the outcome of the currentrailway dispute was still uncertain. It was possible that the unions would appeal to the National Tribunal.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.Railways 7. The Minister of Transport said that the undertaking in theLabour Party&apos;s Election Manifesto that major rail closures would behalted while regional transport plans were being prepared appeared likely to be misconstrued as implying not only that all rail closureswould be halted but also that those which had been approved by theprevious Administration but had not yet come into effect would be cancelled. He had no statutory power, however, to countermand thedecisions of his predecessor in this respect. Moreover, it would notbe in accord with the Governments policy of modernisation to retainservices which were uneconomic and little used. He proposed,therefore, to allow decisions taken by the Minister of Transport inthe Conservative Government to be put into effect but to considerC.C. 2 (64)to be unfolded in The Queen&apos;s Speech and the Governments economic policies. In particular, it would need to emphasise that these programmes would have to be financed by increased taxation.(g) International consultation. The statement should indicatethat the Government were undertaking the necessary discussions withother Governments on the international aspects of their proposals and were also arranging consultations with the International monetary fund in order to obtain additional borrowing facilities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be general agreement on both the immediate measures and the longer-term plans to be proposed in the Governmentsstatement. These measures involved obvious risks and difficulties, both at home and abroad. But the Cabinet recognised that the alternative course of taking either no action at all or purely restrictive action was unacceptable; and the Government would therefore go forward on the basis of the proposals envisaged, as amended in the light ofthe Cabinets discussion.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, theproposals contained in the note on a government statement about the economic situation.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange, as a matter of urgency, to submit to the Prime Minister the draft of a statement on this basis.
new applications by the Board of British Railways on their merits.The Chairman of the Board had the statutory right to publishproposals for closures; but these could not be implemented without this consent and he would not give this consent without consulting theother Ministers concerned.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas suggested that the Cabinet should take an early opportunity togive further consideration to the question of railway closures inrelation to a co-ordinated transport policy and that, until this policy had taken shape in regional plans, the permanent way should beretained even in those cases where it was clear that lines should be closed and services should be withdrawn.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Transport.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to bring his proposals for transport policy before them at an early meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd October, 1964.
