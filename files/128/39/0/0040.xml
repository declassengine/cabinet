The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that thestatement by the President of the United States on the previous day,that the United States Government were prepared to undertakeunconditional discussions directed to a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Vietnam, had introduced a new and more hopeful elementinto the situation. The Prime Minister proposed to issue a public statement that afternoon welcoming this offer, which was in keeping with the initiative which we ourselves had been seeking to promote.We should now intensify our efforts to elicit a favourable response from the Governments of the People&apos;s Republic of China and north vietnam.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinetthat the decision of the Federal German Government to arrange ameeting of the Federal Parliament in Berlin had provoked a markedreaction on the part of the Soviet Government. The access of theWestern Powers to Berlin had been subjected to fresh measures ofharassment; and the meeting of the Federal Parliament itself on theprevious day had been interrupted by low-flying Soviet aircraft.These events confirmed that we had been wise to question the original decision of the Federal Government to hold a meeting of the federal parliament in Berlin. Even so, we should be careful not to showundue concern about the Soviet reaction, which was perhaps nosharper than was to be expected in the circumstances; and, although we should associate ourselves with the other Allied Governments inprotesting to the Soviet Government about their infringement of western rights in relation to the City, we should seek to prevent the incident from assuming undue proportions. There were grounds forhoping that the Soviet measures might cease as soon as the present session of the Federal Parliament came to an end in the near future.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.CC 24 (65)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. It would be necessaryto provide time for the Debate on the Opposition Motion of Censureon the Governments decision to cancel the TSR-2 aircraft; and itwould therefore be necessary for the House of Commons tore-assemble, after the Easter Recess, on Monday, 26th April, insteadof Tuesday, 27th April.The terms of the Motion of Censure were discussed. It wasagreed that the Government should table no Amendment but shouldsimply invite the House to reject the Motion.
Military Aid 3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-to India and wealth Secretary (C (65) 60) about military aid to India and Pakistan.PakistanThe Commonwealth Secretary said that, since the Chinese attackon India in 1962, we had provided military aid to the indian government on a substantial scale. A continuation of such aid,although necessarily at a lower annual rate than in the precedingtwo years, was essential if we were to achieve our political objectives,namely to maintain close relations with India; to retain our influence over India&apos;s defence policies; to fulfil our assurances that we would assist India to meet a Chinese attack; to remain in partnership withthe United States in pursuing these policies; and to limit the spread of Soviet influence in the Indian armed forces. Moreover, continuedassistance to India as regards conventional arms might assist theIndian Government to resist internal pressures to manufacturenuclear weapons. If we gave military aid to India, however, similaraid would have to be given to Pakistan if we were to maintain ourrelations with that country. It was for these reasons that he proposedthat we should offer, in the case of India, to finance the constructionof an Oberon Class submarine costing  4^ million, and to supplyrefurbished Hunter fighter aircraft required by the Indian Air Force.We should offer as a gift four Hunters, which would be completed in 1965-66 at a cost of  0-5 million; and we should undertake toconsider sympathetically the question of financing a further 26Hunters, which would cost about  3 million. In the case of Pakistanwe should offer to finance an Oberon Class submarine and to supplycertain radar and electronic equipment to a value of  1 million. the timing of any announcement should be decided after consultationwith the United States Government, particularly in view of the impending visit of the President of Pakistan to Washington. It shouldalso be possible to defer publicity for our offers, in order that we need not appear to our creditor countries to be acting in a manner which was inconsistent with the demands of our present economicsituation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recognised thatthese proposals were substantially less expensive than those originallyput forward. Nevertheless, there had been a sharp increase in thelevel of military aid given by the United Kingdom to other countriesduring recent years; and in the case of the Indian sub-continent there could be no assurance that the present proposals would not bemerely a further stage in a process which could continue indefinitely.Moreover, continuing military aid to India and Pakistan would encourage an arms race between the two countries, which wouldaggravate still further the demands on us. Finally, military aid toIndia had to be weighed against our economic aid to the indian government, the need for which was also likely to increase. In thesecircumstances we should undertake only the minimum commitment which would serve to hold the position and should defer decisions on further requests until the military and economic implications ofour aid policies could be assessed in greater detail, particularly in thelight of the current review of our defence expenditure.
In discussion there was general agreement that if we refused all further military aid to India, we might inflict irreparable damage onour political and military relations with the Indian Government.There was therefore a strong case for agreeing to provide Hunteraircraft on the lines suggested by the Commonwealth Secretary. Asregards the submarines, India and Pakistan would certainly obtainthem elsewhere if we refused to supply them. The Soviet Union had offered substantial assistance to the Indian Navy; and, if this offerwere accepted, the close links which now existed between the royal navy and the Indian Navy would be jeopardised and the Sovietpenetration of the Indian Ocean would endanger both our ownmilitary dispositions in the area and our co-operation with the UnitedStates Government in its defence. Moreover, the submarines wouldbe built in the United Kingdom and would give valuable employment to the shipbuilding industry. On the other hand, the provision of a submarine for the Indian Navy was not related to the defence ofIndia against the Chinese threat; and in so far as it might commitus in effect to provide further substantial military aid, it would beheld to be inconsistent with the Governments intention, as evidencedby the measures to reduce private oversea investment which had been announced in the Budget Speech earlier that week, to neglect nomeans of easing the burden of our expenditure overseas. Before weincurred any commitment in this respect, therefore, we should examine its implications more carefully and explore the possibility that the United States Government might accept responsibility for meeting these requests from India and Pakistan.In further discussion it was suggested that economic aid was even more important than military aid in preserving our political relations with India and in countering Soviet influence in thesub-continent. There was general agreement that we should not reduce our economic aid in order to provide military aid; but itcould be argued that, given the political importance attached by theIndian Government to military aid, the provision of economic aidalone would not suffice to maintain our existing relationship with india.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, said there was general agreement that we could not afford to refuse all further military aid to India and that we should therefore agree tosupply Hunter aircraft to the Indian Government. The immediatecommitment should be limited to the four aircraft which would beready for delivery in 1965-66; but it must be accepted that we should,in fact, be committed to supply subsequently the balance of 26aircraft. A decision on the other requests, particularly the submarines,should be suspended until we had consulted the United StatesGovernment about the scope of the programme of continuingmilitary aid to India and Pakistan and its implications. these consultations might also deal with the method and timing of the communication to the Indian Government of the decision to supplyHunter aircraft.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that we should offer to supply Hunter aircraft to theGovernment of India on the basis indicated by the first secretary of State in his summing up of the discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, to consult the United States Government, on the lines agreed in the discussion, about the scope and implications of the rest of the programme of continuing military aid to India and Pakistan.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of defence aid to Indiaand Pakistan in the light of the consultations to beundertaken under Conclusion (2) above.Iron and Steel 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of nationalisation pQWer (C (65) 59) tQ which wag appended a draft White paper onIron and Steel Nationalisation.(previous reference:CC(65) 17thConclusions,Minute 3)The Minister of Power said that the draft White Paper was designed to emphasise that the iron and steel industry was unlikeany other part of the private sector in that it had been subject toa special, even if inadequate, measure of public supervision for thelast 30 years; to state the Governments case for nationalising themain part of the industry; to demonstrate that common ownershipshould bring real gains in industrial efficiency; and to outline theGovernments specific legislative proposals. The draft implied thatthe Governments objectives could not be achieved merely bystrengthening the Iron and Steel Board as had been proposed insome quarters; but it did not discuss the alternative suggestion thatthe Government should approach the problem by acquiring ashareholding of 51 per cent in the main steel companies, since thiswould detract from the positive presentation of the governments own proposals.The main points arising on the draft were as follows. First, itwould be inadvisable that the White Paper should make any special reference to the substantial savings in manpower which were thought to be obtainable from the rationalisation of the industry. Howeverthis topic might involve the Government in some embarrassmentduring the debates on the Bill; and he would decide how it shouldbest be dealt with in the light of further discussions with the TradesUnion Congress. Second, it was proposed that the safeguardingprovisions to be incorporated in the Bill in order to preventdissipation of the property and assets of the companies to be nationalised in the period until Vesting Day should apply in certaininstances to transactions entered into after 4th November, 1964, theday on which the First Secretary of State had announced theGovernments intention to nationalise the main part of the industry.Third, it was proposed that the National Steel Corporation shouldhave power to purchase compulsorily, with the Ministers consent,
CC 24 (65)land required both for iron ore working and for other purposes.This power was vested in most other nationalised industries andwould be required by the Corporation for the implementation oftheir development programme; but it might provoke objections onthe part of some local authorities. Fourth, the section on the british iron and Steel Federation (BISF) made it abundantly clear, inaccordance with the views expressed by the Cabinet in their earlier discussion, that the Government were determined to establishsatisfactory arrangements as regards the industry&apos;s central tradingactivities, if necessary by legislation.The Speaker had deferred a ruling on whether the Bill wouldbe hybrid, until it had been published and he could therefore enterinto the necessary consultations; but the advice received from theother authorities whose views had been sought suggested that nodifficulty should be encountered on this score.The Cabinet then examined the draft White Paper. In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Paragraph 2. It was intended to sound Parliamentaryopinion on the Governments proposals by means of a debate ona Motion seeking the approval of the House to the White Paper.It was essential that, if the Government failed to carry the Motion,this should not be construed as an implied defeat for theGovernments legislative proposals themselves. From this point ofview it would be advisable to delete the statement that legislationembodying the Governments proposals would be presented toParliament this Session.(b) Paragraphs 10-14. It was generally agreed that Section IIIdid not present a wholly convincing case for nationalising the ironand steel industry. A large part of the Section was devoted tocriticising the present arrangements without giving a clear indication of the benefits which would result from public ownership. there might be advantage, therefore, in concentrating the arguments inparagraphs 11-13 in a separate Section, which would be devoted toanalysing the weaknesses in the present organisation of the iron andsteel industry. This should include a specific reference to the amountof public funds which had been injected into the industry in recentyears; and it should also bring out more clearly the difficulty whichprivate enterprise would encounter in finding the very substantialcapital sums which would be required in order to support theindustry&apos;s next major expansion programme. A rearrangement onthese lines might also overcome the presentational difficulty of explaining the Governments policy on steel prices in the light ofthe declaration by the Restrictive Practices Court that the industry&apos;recent pricing policies had been contrary to the public interest. it seemed likely that the nationalised sector of the industry would be obliged to follow a common pricing policy; and, while this wouldhave regard to the public, rather than to private, interest, it wouldbe inadvisable to draw specific attention to this possibility in theWhite Paper. It was further agreed that paragraph 10, the first
sentence of paragraph 11 and paragraph 14 should be omitted fromthe new Section.(c) Paragraphs 15-17. These paragraphs, which described theGovernments objectives in nationalising the industry, would thenform the introduction to the next Section of the White Paper, whichshould be devoted to the Governments specific legislative proposals.It was suggested that more emphasis might be placed on the opportunities which would be afforded by public ownership of theindustry for rationalising its structure and operation in ways whichwould not only improve its productivity but would also releasevaluable resources of manpower for more economic employmentelsewhere. On the other hand it might be dangerous to imply thatthe industry&apos;s inflated labour force could be substantially reducedexcept over a long period. The first step would be to seek to secure a reorganisation of the negotiating machinery of the industry; andthis process, which would involve delicate negotiations with theunions concerned, would be liable to take a considerable time. Theprospect of a substantial reduction in the labour force could perhaps be more appropriately foreshadowed by a more specific reference tothe major structural and technological changes in the industry whichwould be required in the coming years. The reference to the exportpotential of the industry in paragraph 15 id) was unsatisfactory inthat it failed to specify the ways in which the Government intended,by means of nationalisation, to increase exports of iron and steel.If it was impracticable to elaborate this point in detail, it would be preferable to give less prominence to exports in the White Paper andto confine any reference to this subject to an expression of hope that,despite recent trends, improvements could be secured.(d) Paragraph 18. As at present drafted, this paragraph mightconvey the impression that the Government had approached thequestion of nationalising the industry by selecting certain namedcompanies which they wished to take into public ownership; andthis might reinforce the suspicion that the Bill would be a hybridmeasure. It would be preferable, therefore, to indicate at the outsetthe objective criteria by reference to which the Government had decided that a company should, or should not, be nationalised andto indicate that it was in the light of these criteria that the companiesspecified in the paragraph had been chosen. The particular case ofRichard Thomas and Baldwins Limited, which was already publicly owned, should be dealt with separately.(e) Paragraph 25. Doubts were expressed about the desirabilityof applying the proposed safeguarding provisions to transactionsentered into after a date as early as 4th November, 1964, unless there was sufficient evidence that the companies to be nationalisedhad dissipated their property and assets between that date and thedate of publication of the White Paper. On the other hand adequateevidence to this effect might not be forthcoming since there wouldbe great difficulty in ascertaining whether such transactions had, orhad not, taken place; yet there was a real risk in some cases thatthey might have been concluded, at least on a provisional basis. Itwould therefore be wiser to anticipate this risk on the lines proposed
in the White Paper, while making it clear that the safeguardingprovisions were not intended to hamper the normal and legitimateoperations of the companies concerned.(/) Paragraph 44. The White Paper should contain no referenceto the possibilities of further legislation in relation to the tradingactivities of the BISF, other than that implied in the statement thatthe Government proposed, in the first instance, to try to secure their objective by negotiations. The threat of further legislation should bekept in reserve for use during the debates on the Bill, if the subsequent reactions of the Federation showed this to be necessary.(g) Paragraph 46. It was agreed that the last two sentences ofthis paragraph should be deleted.In further discussion some doubts were raised about the advisability of announcing in the White Paper the terms on which compensation would be paid to the shareholders of the companies to be nationalised. On the other hand, since the terms ofcompensation would not be affected by the date on which they were published, the Government might be criticised for unnecessarilywithholding the relevant information from those personally affected.Moreover, it could reasonably be claimed that the compensationprovisions formed an integral part of the nationalisation project andshould therefore be published together with the remainder of theGovernments legislative proposals. The timing of the publication ofthe White Paper would need to be further considered at a later date in the light of the general climate of opinion at home and overseasin relation to the country&apos;s economic situation as well as of theParliamentary timetable in the weeks following the Easter Recess.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power to redraft the White paper on Iron and Steel Nationalisation appended to C (65) 59in the light of the points made in the discussion.(2) Agreed to give further consideration to the timing of thepublication of the White Paper at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,8th April, 1965.
