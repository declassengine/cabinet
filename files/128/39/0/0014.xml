primeministers visit toWashingtonand Ottawa2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the outcome ofthe discussions which, together with the Foreign Secretary and theSecretary of State for Defence, he had conducted with the Presidentof the United States, President Johnson, and other members of theUnited States Administration during his visit to Washington earlier in the week.The visit had been conducted in a very cordial atmosphere; andthere had been no attempt on the part of the United StatesGovernment to confront us with the need to take unacceptable&quot;decisions at short notice. As a result we had achieved our main purpose of making clear our basic policy on defence and of preparing the way for further and more detailed discussions.President Johnson and his colleagues had been particularlyinsistent on the value of the world-wide military role played by theUnited Kingdom and on the importance of our continuing to dischargethat role in collaboration with the other members of theCommonwealth whenever possible. They appreciated the burden which it imposed on our economy; and, since defence expenditure was imposing a similar strain on their own balance of payments, theyhad been particularly interested to be informed of the measures bywhich we hoped to reduce the cost of our defence programmes and5586-2a 2C.C. 14 (64)Oversea 1    The Colonial Secretary said that the primary purpose of his visit to Aden had been to create a favourable political climate ratherAden than to discuss our military base, which had played only a subsidiarypart in his discussions. He had therefore visited various parts of theFederation and had met leading personalities both in the FederalStates and in Aden, including leaders of the political parties andtrade unions and some of the individuals at present held in detention.He had reaffirmed that our policy was directed towards theestablishment of a fully independent Arab State by 1968 at the latestand that, within the limits of our resources, we would continue toprovide aid in order to promote stability and prosperity in the area.He had encouraged discussions between the Adeni and federal governments; and at the end of his visit they had issued a joint declaration looking to the creation of a unitary State on a democraticbasis. He had welcomed this declaration and had undertaken that,in preparation for a new constitutional conference to be held at thebeginning of March, we would assist the two Governments in studying the further problems which would need to be examined before a unitary State could be brought into being, particularly the necessaryprovisions guaranteeing human rights.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the colonial secretary.
to transfer resources from military to civil use. President Johnsonhad indicated his political sympathy with the steps which we hadalready taken to rectify our balance of payments; he had welcomed the prospect of close collaboration between the United States andthe United Kingdom on future economic policy; and he had willinglyendorsed our suggestion that both countries might profit from a detailed examination of the possibilities of closer co-operation in defence research and development and in weapons production.As regards the future nuclear role of the Atlantic Alliance therehad been complete agreement on the objectives involved, namely, tosatisfy the nuclear aspirations of the Federal German Republic, toprevent the further proliferation of national nuclear capabilities andto open the way for further initiatives towards disarmament. On themeans to be adopted in order to realise these objectives, however,there remained some difference of view, at least in so far as the UnitedStates Government had not abandoned their advocacy of a mixed-manned surface fleet. On the other hand, they had shown a welcomedegree of readiness to consider our own alternative concept of an atlantic Nuclear Force (A.N.F.); and it should now be possible forthis project to go forward for discussion in greater detail with theother members of the Alliance. The United States Government hadadmittedly indicated that any force of the kind which we had inmind should, in their view, comprise not only national contributions by both the United Kingdom and the United States but also a mixed-manned surface fleet element, to which the United Kingdom should contribute. We had made it clear that our position on this issue was wholly reserved. At the same time we had secured a very valuablerecognition by the United States Government that there would beno question of their waiving their veto in relation to such a fleet,whether now or at any time in the future; and this vital assurancehad been publicly reflected in the joint communique issued at the endof the discussions.President Johnson had also shown a lively awareness of the risks of a proliferation of nuclear capabilities elsewhere than in Europe,particularly in India as a result of the recent detonation of a nucleardevice by the Communist Government of China. He had thereforeendorsed our tentative suggestion that it might be necessary, at somepoint in the future, to seek to establish, in relation to the Indian Oceanand the Far East, some kind of arrangement for nuclearinterdependence corresponding to the concept which we were trying to promote in relation to Europe.The United States Government had been anxious that we shouldmake some positive contribution to their operations in Vietnam byway of a limited military presence on Vietnamese territory. In replywe had emphasised the heavy burden which we were already carryingin assisting the Government of Malaysia to resist Indonesianaggression and subversion; and we had also warned the United StatesGovernment of the potentially embarrassing situation which might arise if they took any action to force the issue in Vietnam and socompelled us to activate our role as co-Chairman of the 1954Conference. We had therefore continued to resist their pressure for
sa United Kingdom military presence in Vietnam and had merelyundertaken to increase slightly the various types of support facilitywhich we already provided in the form of training facilities for south vietnamese troops, etc.President Johnson had shown interest in our policy towardsBritish Guiana in the light of the recent election which had resultedin the fall of Dr. Jagan&apos;s Government. We had therefore informed him, as we had already informed Dr. Jagan himself, that, regardless of the result of the election, we were not prepared to concedeindependence to the Colony until the racial communities had shownthat they could live and work together in peace.The discussions had ended with a communique which revealeda welcome measure of agreement on all the main issues concerned.In particular, its concluding reference to &quot; continuing discussions atall levels, both within the Alliance and in wider internationalassociations, in pursuit of nuclear and conventional disarmament andall measures to reduce world tension &quot; should be of considerable political value to the Government in so far as it clearly implied thatthe United States Government recognised that our right to participate in all major international negotiations must be accepted on its merits and did not derive solely from our possession of an independentnuclear deterrent.The Foreign Secretary said that future progress in negotiating agreater degree of interdependence within the North Atlantic Alliancemight be eased by the fact that the United States Government were no longer as unanimously in favour of the concept of the mixed-manned surface fleet as they had been only a few months before;but it would still depend mainly on the reactions of the federal german Government to our project for an A.N.F., in the form inwhich it had emerged from the Washington discussions. The GermanGovernment were themselves divided on the issues involved; andthey were acutely aware that, if the French Government, in the person of General de Gaulle, sought to compel them to choose betweensome new and closer form of Atlantic nuclear interdependence andan independent Franco-German nuclear force, they might be exposed to serious political embarrassment in the months immediately preceding the forthcoming Federal election. They might well prefer,therefore, to evade this unpalatable choice; and in that event it mightbe possible to postpone a final decision on the form of an A.N.F.until the late autumn of 1965. Meanwhile, we should proceed topromote multilateral discussion of the issues involved by means of appropriate international negotiations in the near future; and it was satisfactory that the United States Government, although apparentlystill anxious to ensure than any A.N.F. would comprise a mixed-manned surface fleet element, had assured us that during these further negotiations they would be content to sponsor this concept on theirown responsibility and would not seek to influence the federal german Government to support it against their better judgment.The Secretary of State for Defence said that his own discussions with the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara, had
convinced him that the United States Government were genuinelyprepared to explore, rapidly and in detail, the possibilities of closercoroperation with the United Kingdom in relation to defence research and development and weapons production; and, although measures for this purpose could not be expected to produce substantial economies in the near future, they should yield very significant savings in the longer term, particularly if they could be supplemented by arrangements for shared logistic support. Moreover, the UnitedStates Government had shown themselves not unsympathetic to our desire to reduce the level of our ground forces in Germany. they wished to achieve a similar economy themselves; and; although itwas unlikely that the susceptibilities of the Federal GermanGovernment would allow either the United States or the UnitedKingdom to withdraw troops from German territory in the nearfuture, this would remain the agreed objective of both Governments,which they would hope to pursue in the context of wider efforts tosecure a relaxation of East-West tension by a progressive reductionin the European force levels of both the North Atlantic treaty organisation and the Warsaw Pact. The United States government agreed with us in regarding the contribution which we made to peace and stability outside Europe as more important than our Europeanrole; and we could look to them to support in principle any measuresIwhich we might seek to adopt in accordance with these priorities,whether in relation to our oversea bases or otherwise.The Prime Minister said that the visit which, together with theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary, he had subsequently paid to Canada had been very rewarding. They hadreceived a very warm welcome from the Canadian Government andhad held useful discussions both with the Cabinet as a whole andwith individual Ministers. Largely as a result of their currentpreoccupation with the political tension in French Canada theCanadian Government were particularly sensitive to the probablereactions of the French Government to our project for an A.N.F.Nevertheless, they had expressed great interest in this concept andhad undertaken to examine it with an open mind. They had been no less aware than the United States Government of the risk of afurther proliferation of nuclear weapons which was inherent in therecent Chinese detonation of a nuclear device; and we could count on their support in any attempt which we might eventually make topromote the concept of nuclear interdependence in areas outside europe.The discussions in Ottawa had also comprised a useful exchangeof views on the economic situation and on the prospects for UnitedKingdom exports to Canada, which remained at a disappointing low level. It was urgently necessary to improve our competitive positionin the Canadian market.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of these statements andcongratulated the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary,the Secretary of State for Defence and the commonwealth secretary on the successful outcome of their discussions in washington and Ottawa.
SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:C.C. (64) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (64) 25), proposing that a parliamentarymission should visit Southern Rhodesia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there would be advantage in sending a parliamentary mission to visit Southern Rhodesia inan attempt to conciliate the extreme views held by Europeans andAfricans. A mission of this kind might help to resolve the deadlockif the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Smith, continuedto be reluctant to visit the United Kingdom for further discussions;it would represent a useful new initiative, with considerablepresentational value both in the United Kingdom and in the united nations; and it would emphasise the bi-partisan approach to theproblem in this country. It would be undesirable to stipulate that other members of the Commonwealth should be represented on themission, since it was unlikely that this would be acceptable toMr. Smith. The mission should therefore be composed of two labour members of Parliament (not in the Cabinet), one conservative and one Liberal; and at least the chairman should be a PrivyCouncillor. The mission should preferably not be given specific termsof reference; and its purpose might be described as being simply &quot; to visit Southern Rhodesia &quot;. There should be no advance commitment that it would present a public report to Parliament. If the proposal were agreed and were acceptable to the Leader of the Opposition andthe Leader of the Liberal Party, it would be communicatedconfidentially to Mr. Smith. He might seek to stipulate in advance that the mission should not have access to the African nationalistswho were at present in detention. If so, it would be preferable thatthe mission should resolve this issue for itself after its arrival in southern Rhodesia.In discussion there was general agreement in principle with thisproposal. The following main points were made:(a) It could be argued that there would be advantage in including one or more representatives of other Commonwealth countries inthe mission. This proposal might be put forward if Mr. Smith rejected the concept of a purely United Kingdom mission, since, if he alsorefused a mission with Commonwealth membership, the intransigenceof his attitude would have been made doubly clear.(b) The experience of earlier missions of this kind in relation to kenya and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland suggested thatit would be preferable not to seek to make precise stipulations aboutthe individuals to whom the mission should have access, since it was probable that the mission itself, once it had arrived in SouthernRhodesia, would achieve agreement to a wider range of discussionsthan might be acceptable in advance. For the same reasons therewould be advantage in not handicapping the mission by precise termsof reference. .0n the other hand it might prove impossible to persuade the Government of Southern Rhodesia to accept the mission withoutgreater precision on these points.
(c) The composition of the mission might be further considered,in consultation with the Leaders of the other two parties, when there actions of the Government of Southern Rhodesia to the proposal in principle were known.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that a proposal on the lines indicated inC. (64) 25 should be made to Mr. Smith at an appropriate moment.If he rejected it or sought to stipulate unacceptable conditions forits operation, it would be necessary for the Cabinet to consider thematter further. In any event we should reserve our right to publish the proposal, if necessary.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (64) 25 for thedespatch of a parliamentary mission to SouthernRhodesia.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to bring the matter before them again in the light of the reactions of thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Smith.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th December, 1964.
