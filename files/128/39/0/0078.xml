oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference:CC (65) 38thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Minister of Overseas Development asked whether therewas substance in the recent Press statement that at an earlier stage of the conflict in Vietnam the United States Government had rejected a proposal for negotiations by the Government of north vietnam.The Prime Minister said that, while the facts were not fullyknown to the United Kingdom Government, the episode had takenplace before the present Administration assumed office and hencebefore an understanding had been reached with the United StatesGovernment on this issue.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Prices andIncomesPolicyPay of the armed Forces(previous reference:CC (65) 61stConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda bythe First Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C (65) 144) and by the Secretary of State for Defence (C (65) 148)on the pay of the Armed Forces. They also considered a supplementary memorandum by the First Secretary of State andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (65) 154), reporting their further discussions with the Secretary of State for Defence.The First Secretary of State said that the Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for defence and himself to discuss whether alternative solutions might be devised which would offer a compromise between the divergentconsiderations which had emerged in the discussion on the pay ofthe Armed Forces at the meeting on 16th November. They had discussed the possible basis for a reference to the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) but had not been able to reach agreement. Annex A of C (65) 156 set out the conditions on whichthe Secretary of State for Defence would reluctantly be prepared toconsider a reference to the Board, although remaining of the opinionthat such a reference represented the wrong procedure for the determination of the issues involved. On the other hand it was essential that any settlement should be reached in the light of the wider national interest and in such a way as to avoid prejudicing thenational incomes policy. It would therefore be preferable to adoptthe proposals set out in Annex C of C (65) 154, whereby the matter should be referred to the Board on the basis of an interim increaseof 7 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1966, an increase whichwould be consistent with what was proposed by the Chancellor ofCC 62 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
the Exchequer in relation to the pay of the Higher Civil Service andhad been recently granted in relation to the pay of railway workers.The Board would be able to produce a report on a reference of this nature within two months.The Secretary of State for Defence said that on furtherconsideration he doubted whether the Armed Services would be ableto accept a reference to the Board even on the basis of the terms in annex A to C (65) 156; and there was a serious risk that action ofthis kind would provoke a very strong reaction against theGovernments policy. He remained firmly of the opinion that theBoard could not be expected to form any considered judgment onthe size of the correct increases in pay for individual groups of servicemen in a period of two months. Indeed, if they suggestedthat there should be an average increase of any figure other than18-1- Per cent which had been indicated by the &quot; Grigg&quot; formula,they could only do so on an entirely arbitrary basis. The onlyrealistic form of reference to the Board would be to ask them whether it seemed to them that the increases in pay resulting from theapplication of the &quot; Grigg &quot; formula were compatible in principle withthe general policy on prices and incomes. If the Board said that intheir view the increases were so compatible, it was essential that theGovernment should then be prepared to make the payment in full,since otherwise there was no point in a reference to the Board. Onthe other hand, if the Board said that the increases were notcompatible with the general policy, the Cabinet would have to decide how large an increase should be given, bearing in mind that any decision would be essentially arbitrary until a new system of settling the pay of the Armed Services was worked out. As regards theproposed interim award, the pay of other ranks had not been adjusted in the light of increases in civilian pay since July 1963. by april 1966 they would therefore be no less than two years and eight months in arrears in relation to their civilian counterpart; andthis would justify an increase of nearly 9\ per cent. He felt strongly,therefore, that the initial increase should be 9^- per cent.Nevertheless, even on this basis, he still considered that a reference to the Board would be the wrong course. Indeed, if the outcome were an increase in Service pay less than that provided bythe &quot; Grigg &quot; formula, he would regard a Cabinet decision, takendeliberately and defended in the light of the economic and financial situation, as less dangerous than a reference to the Board. But it remained his view that the right course was to increase Service payon the basis of the &quot; Grigg &quot; formula and to present this in a way which would be less embarrassing to the Governments policy on prices and incomes. So far discussion had proceeded on the basis ofthe percentage increase in basic rates alone; but, if account were taken of all emoluments, the percentage increase which would be involved would be not 18-^ per cent but \2\ per cent, since manyallowances were not being substantially increased. Moreover, itcould be argued that, although only two years would have elapsed since the last pay increase, other ranks were two years eight months in arrears in relation to the pay of their civilian counterparts and
would therefore be entitled under the norm to an increase of nearly94- per cent. An increase of 3 per cent over and above this would be fully justified in terms of the criteria laid down in the prices and incomes policy for increases in excess of the norm.In discussion there was general agreement that any reference tothe Board should be of the rather general character suggested bythe Secretary of State for Defence. The main consideration was tosecure from the Board guidance on the question whether they regarded a settlement on the basis of the &quot;Grigg&quot; formula as acceptable within the terms of the general policy on prices and incomes. They should not be encouraged to examine the issue indetail, although they must be free to give reasons for their views and, if they regarded an increase as unacceptable, to indicate the broad extent of the incompatibility. The Board would essentially beexpressing a view on the conflict between inherited commitments,based on systems of fair comparison, and the principles now laiddown for incomes policy. They should be given until the middle ofJanuary to report; and their report should be made in the first placein confidence to the Government in order that the Cabinet might then reach a decision. It should be made clear that the Board werebeing asked for an advisory opinion rather than for detailed recommendations, and there would be no question, therefore, of theGovernments being committed to accepting their proposals. If theBoard reported by mid-January, there would be time for decisions to be taken and included in the Defence Estimates; a supplementary estimate should be avoided, if possible. It would be necessary to announce that the reference was being made to the Board, since thiswould be bound to become known. The question whether theBoard&apos;s report should be published could be considered when it hadbeen received. In these circumstances there would be no questionof announcing any interim increase to take effect on 1st April, 1966.There was also general agreement that further thought shouldbe given to the whole question of the manner in which thearrangements for settling wages and salaries based on straightcomparisons with movements in earnings in other occupationsshould be integrated into the incomes policy. In the public sectorthere were many arrangements of this kind; since adjustments tended to be made relatively infrequently and in arrears, they were apt to appear substantial. Moreover, the basis on which &quot; faircomparisons &quot; were made was not uniform in all cases. There mightbe a case for referring to the Board for advice not only the &quot; Grigg &quot;system for settling the pay of the Armed Services but also the whole range of similar public sector settlements. The ministerial committee on Economic Development should therefore discuss atan early date the whole problem of integrating the system of &quot; faircomparisons &quot; into the new structure of the incomes policy: andany further reference to the Board on the question whether the&quot; Grigg &quot; formula needed to be modified or replaced as a whole asthe basis for determining Forces pay in the longer term should be deferred until such discussion had taken place.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the National Board for Prices and incomes should be asked to advise on the acceptability in relationto the general incomes policy of the pay increases proposed for the Armed Services on the basis of the&quot; Grigg &quot; formula.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence toagree the terms for this reference and to make thenecessary arrangements.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider the problems raised in relation to theGovernments policy on prices and incomes by thesettlement of wages and salaries in the public sector by reference to comparisons with earnings in other occupations, including the possibility of seeking advice from the National Board for Prices and Incomes on this general issue.Prices andIncomesPolicyPay of theHigher CivilServiceDoctors&apos; and dentists&apos;Remuneration(previous reference:CC(65) 16thConclusions)*4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer about the pay of the Higher Civil Service(C (65) 146) and a memorandum by the Minister of Health(C (65) 147) about the effect of decisions on the pay of the higher civil Service on the attitude of doctors and dentists to thenegotiations on their remuneration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the standing advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service (the franks Committee) had embarked on a general review in January1965. At that time he had indicated to Lord Franks that the time was inauspicious for such a review in the context of the prices and incomes policy; but the Committee had proceeded and had reportedin September. They had recommended an increase which averaged3  per cent per year for the 8,000 staff involved. Only in the case ofone grade was the recommended increase in excess of the norm.The Committee had said that they had had regard to the general economic situation and that this had led them to modify views basedon other considerations about the pay of the highest grades in theCivil Service.Although the increases were within the &quot; norm &quot; in percentage terms, the absolute amounts were considerable between  6 and  10a week in many cases. Experience in relation to, e.g., the judges&apos;salaries had shown that increases of this order tended to evokeconsiderable public criticism. It might be impolitic, therefore, toaccept the recommendations of the Franks Committee in the formin which they had been submitted. On the other hand it would be undesirable to reject them completely or to modify them by some* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET
arbitrary amount. The wisest course, therefore, might be to announce that the Government endorsed the recommendations inprinciple but that the timing of their implementation must be adjusted in the light of the country&apos;s economic circumstances. Onthis basis the only immediate increases which should be given wouldbe 34- per cent at Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary levels asfrom 1st September, 1965, the full recommendations being implemented as from 1st September, 1966. This action might be unwelcome to the Civil Service, who might fear that the Governmentwere once again using their position as employers to enforce in thepublic sector an incomes policy which elsewhere would depend largely on consent. It might also cause offence to the franks committee. On balance, however, it should be less objectionablethan any other course.The Minister of Health said that he was concerned about theeffect of such action on the confidence of doctors and dentists inthe work of the Review Body which had been established to make recommendations on their remuneration. He had had considerabledifficulty in persuading them to allow their pay claim to be submittedto the Review Body; and a rejection of the Franks recommendations would almost certainly lead them to believe that the Governmentwould also reject the recommendations of the Review Body. Fromthis point of view, however, the proposal to accept the Franks report but to postpone its operative date would be less damaging thanarbitrary changes in the recommendations; and, if this course were adopted, he would do his best to reassure the medical and dentalprofessions.In discussion it was suggested that it might be unacceptable thatthe pay of the Armed Forces should be referred to the national board for Prices and Incomes if the recommendations of the franks Committee were accepted without such reference. the franks Committee had based their recommendations on the samesystem of comparison with movements in analogous salaries as was involved in the &quot; Grigg&quot; formula which determined adjustments of Service pay. Moreover, the pay of senior officers in the ArmedServices was settled by reference to the salaries of Civil Servicegrades covered by the Franks Committee&apos;s recommendations.Public opinion would not readily understand why substantial increases in higher Civil Service salaries were granted without reference to the Board when the pay of the Armed Services wasbeing so referred. On the other hand the recommendations of the franks Committee were different from the results of the operationof the &quot; Grigg &quot; formula. They had been made as the result of an up-to-date study by an independent Committee which claimed tohave taken account of the national economic situation, whereas theproposed increases in Service pay followed from the automaticapplication of a formula devised several years earlier. Moreover,the increases in Civil Service pay proposed by the Franks Committeewere below the norm in most instances and there was therefore little
case for referring them to the Board. It was not clear, however,how far the Franks Committee had in fact taken account of thegeneral prices and incomes policy; and it was desirable that theBoard should be given the opportunity to ensure that the criteriaapplied by the various independent committees on wagedetermination were consistent with general policy on incomes. a reference to the Board for an advisory opinion on the consistency ofthe Franks recommendations with that policy would, moreover,protect the Government against the charge that they were seeking to take unfair advantage of their position as the main employer inthe public sector.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the Board should be invited toconsider the recommendations of the Franks Committee and toadvise whether those recommendations were consistent with thegeneral policy on incomes, even though it was recognised that thiscourse might be unwelcome to the Civil Service Staff associations and might also give offence to the Franks Committee itself. As inthe case of the Armed Services the Board &apos;s report should be madeto the Government and the Board should not initially publish it.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the recommendations of the Franks Committeeon the Pay of the Higher Civil Service should be referredto the National Board on Prices and Incomes and invited the First Secretary of State to make the necessary arrangements for this purpose.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explain thereasons for this decision to Lord Franks.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of the issues involvedin the light of the report from the Board.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 61stConclusions,Minute 1)5. The Prime Minister said that a group of the Ministers mostimmediately concerned was now meeting daily in order to keep thesituation in Rhodesia under close review and to take decisions onthe day-to-day action which was required. Issues of substance would,of course, be brought before the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the outcome ofhis visit to New York in order to attend discussions on Rhodesia atthe Security Council. Our intention at the outset had been to seek the active support of the Council in making effective the measureswhich we were taking in order to deal with the illegal declarationof independence (i.d.i.) in Rhodesia. The immediate objective of ensuring non-recognition of the illegal regime had been secured byan interim resolution which had been tabled by the representativeof Jordan. Thereafter, we had tabled a resolution whereby theSecurity Council would agree that arms should not be supplied to rhodesia and that the measures taken by the United KingdomGovernment should be fully supported by other nations.   This
resolution, however, had attracted criticism on two main counts first, that the United Kingdom Government were responsible for creating the present situation by the action which they had eithertaken or omitted to take over a period of years and specifically bytheir agreement to the allocation to Rhodesia of a disproportionateshare of the Federal armed forces on the dissolution of the formerFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland; second, that the measureswhich we were now taking were inadequate to deal with the position which had developed. In these circumstances our objective hadbeen to promote, if possible, an agreed resolution, i.e., a resolution which would attract a minimum of seven votes and would not besubject to veto. Failing that, it was important that we should atleast secure that no resolution which was unacceptable to us, e.g.,because it advocated the use of military force, should receive thenecessary majority of votes, since there were strong political arguments against our having recourse to our power of veto inorder to defeat such a resolution. We could count on the opposition of four of the member countries of the Security Council, includingourselves, to a resolution in unacceptable terms; but we should need to attract one more vote in order to deprive any resolution of thenecessary majority. This might be obtained either from Bolivia orUruguay, or failing either of these, from Jordan or Malaysia.The views of the more extreme section of opinion in the united nations had found expression in an alternative resolution tabled bythe representative of the Ivory Coast. This had to be in termsacceptable to the Afro-Asian bloc, since otherwise the Soviet union would be likely to exercise their power of veto. But it at leastomitted any reference to the use of armed forces; and we might stillhope, therefore, to avoid any resolution which proposed resort to force. Nevertheless, the Ivory Coast draft resolution might stillincorporate various features which we should find embarrassing. Inthe first place it sought to assign a special role to the Organisationof African Unity (OAU); and, while we need not object to a reference recognising the special interest of that Organisation, wecould not agree that the Security Council should invoke their assistance in terms which implied approval in advance for any measures which the OAU might decide to take. The seconddifficulty arose from the suggestion in the resolution that after the defeat of the rebellion, a new Constitution on the basis of universalsuffrage should be introduced forthwith, since, while we could accept this as the eventual objective, we could not commit ourselves onthe timing of action to this end. The third difficulty related to theadditional measures which the resolution judged necessary in orderto deal with the present situation, particularly the proposal for thecomplete rupture of economic relations with Rhodesia, includingthe imposition of an oil embargo. While we should have preferred to deal with this suggestion by promoting a study, within the united nations, of the implications of such measures, we might be able toaccept a form of words requiring member countries to do all theycould to implement sanctions of this kind, provided that, when the
issue came to the vote, the United Kingdom representative made itclear that no useful purpose would be served by carrying out such measures before careful prior study of the consequences for other member States. Finally, it was important to us that the resolutionshould not be worded in terms implying that the situation in rhodesia called for action under Chapter VII, rather thanChapter VI, of the Charter of the United Nations, since resolutionsunder Chapter VII were mandatory whereas resolutions under chapter VI had the force of recommendations only.In short, there appeared to be a reasonable prospect that noresolution which might make it necessary for us to use our vetowould be acceptable to a majority of the Security Council; and itwas even possible, though at present unlikely, that we might succeed in securing the adoption of a resolution in terms which we should regard as satisfactory. In the longer term, however, we might need to consider whether, if it were not possible to bring the rebellion toa speedy end, it would be to our advantage to disclaim furtherresponsibility for Rhodesia and to leave the United Nations to dealwith the situation.The Prime Minister said that it would be necessary to keepdevelopments at the United Nations under continuous review, sinceany question of using our veto would need very careful considerationby the Cabinet as a whole. For the rest, we should not lightlycontemplate abdicating our responsibility for Rhodesia, howeverserious the difficulties at the United Nations in which we might be involved as a result.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary.HousingProgramme1965-70:Draff white papers(previous reference:CC (65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Wales and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (65) 151), covering a draft White Paper on thehousing programme 1965-70; and a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (C (65) 152), covering a draft White Paper onthe Scottish Housing Programme.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theWhite Paper was intended to elaborate on that part of the national plan which dealt with housing. It set out the objective of building500,000 houses a year in the United Kingdom by 1970, more or lessevenly divided between the public and private sectors. As regardsthe public sector it explained the Governments decision to increasethe amount of subsidy on housing provided by public authorities onthe basis approved by the Home Affairs Committee on 4th August(H (65) 20th Meeting, Item 2). There might well be criticism of this large additional subsidy to council tenants; and it was for this reason that paragraphs 39 and 40 of the White Paper discussed the tenancyand rent policies of local authorities. As regards the private sector,
the White Paper set out the measure of agreement which had beenreached with representatives of the building industry, the building societies, local authorities and insurance companies about possiblearrangements to use the level of mortgage advances as a means ofregulating the volume of private house-building. It now seemed clear that agreement on this issue could be reached without involving the Government in providing the building societies with anyguarantee about the flow of funds available to them. It was alsosatisfactory that representatives of the building industry were now prepared to engage in discussions on practical issues such as the availability of land for the house-building programme.In, discussion a number of drafting amendments were suggested to the text of the White Paper; and the following main points weremade:(a) Further consideration should be given to the terms on whichimprovement grants were given for existing houses; but this wouldrequire amending legislation.(b) It would be desirable to expedite the work of the Committeewhich was considering possible ways of reducing the costs of private house purchase in order that the Government might be seen to be seeking to assist those who bought their own houses.(c) The expenditure on housing subsidies arising from theproposals in the White Paper could be accommodated within thelimits of public expenditure which had been agreed by the cabinet for the period up to 1970 (CC (65) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 3).(d) The increased house-building programme would create alarge demand for new schools in certain areas; and, in view of thelimitation on total expenditure on education, there would be virtually no provision for replacing sub-standard schools in the next few years.(e) The attempt to restrict loans for new housing by arrangements with the building societies, the insurance companies and local authorities might be frustrated by the actions of other financial institutions or the creation of new institutions to meetdemand. It was not clear, therefore, that the outcome of thediscussions referred to in paragraph 27 of the draft White paper would be effective in regulating the volume of private building.The Cabinet (1) Approved the text of the White Paper on the housing programme 1965-70 and the Scottish housing programme,subject to the amendments made during the discussion.(2) Invited Ministers to inform the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment of any further drafting amendments whichthey wished to propose.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th November, 1965.
