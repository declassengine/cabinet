The national plan(previous reference:CC(65) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (65) 116) to which was appended a selection ofthe most important chapters of the draft National Economic Plan.The First Secretary of State said that the draft of the completePlan had been prepared in consultation with all the Departmentsconcerned. Some further revisions were necessary as a result of theeconomic and financial measures announced by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on 27th July. The chapter on agriculture had notyet been circulated, since it had not been possible to complete it until after the discussion on agricultural policy by the ministerial committee on Economic Development on 28th July, when decisions on long-term policy had been taken.A suitable version of the draft had been circulated to themembers of the National Economic Development Council (NEDC)on a personal basis and on the understanding that organisations ofemployers and trade unions would not be consulted. Redraftingin the light of the discussion in Cabinet and of the comments of theNEDC would continue up to 12th August, when the text wouldhave to be sent to the printers. Proofs would be available fromthe printers on 20th August; and final Ministerial authority for publication would be needed in the week beginning 22nd August,if the Plan were to be published on 16th September as was atpresent contemplated. A short, popular version, designed for thegeneral reader, would be published at the same time.It was perhaps debatable whether, in the light of the current economic situation, it would be wise to seek to adhere to thistimetable. If the measures which had been adopted to deal withour difficulties resulted in a relatively slow rate of economic growthover the next 18 months, it might prove to be impossible to ensuresufficient acceleration in later years to achieve the full objective ofa 25 per cent increase in national output between 1964 and 1970.Nevertheless a period of relatively slow growth would notnecessarily be an inappropriate time at which to publish a plan9designed to encourage industry to take the necessary measures to achieve a faster rate. For this reason there was no justification forrevising either the target for increased output or the date by whichit should be achieved. The question of publication on 16th Septembercould, of course, always be reconsidered if there were any unexpecteddevelopments before that date.The Prime Minister said that suggestions for drafting amendments should be sent direct to the First Secretary of State;the Cabinet should confine their present discussion to major issues of policy and presentation.CC 44 (65)Parliament 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the summer recess.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It could be argued that the chapter on the balance ofpayments would be vulnerable to expert scrutiny, since the forecastincrease of 5  to 5\ per cent a year in the volume of exports mightbe judged excessively optimistic in the light of present trends.Moreover, even on these assumptions, it would be difficult to ensure a sufficiently favourable balance to provide for the repayment ofour indebtedness to the International Monetary Fund by 1970. Onthe other hand, industry believed that an increase in exports of this size could be secured; and it was important that the Governmentshould be seen to take a reasonably optimistic view if industrialistswere to be encouraged to plan for a sufficiently rapid rate of growth.It would be no less important, however, to emphasise the efforts which would be needed to achieve such a result.(b) It could be argued that the means for giving effect to thePlan did not match the sophisticated planning apparatus in othercountries and that the draft text did not sufficiently indicate theextent to which the Government would take deliberate action toensure that it would be fulfilled. On the other hand the element ofGovernment intervention in the economic plans of otherGovernments, e.g., France and Japan, was often overstated; and ourown National Plan would not compare unfavourably with similarprojects in other countries.(c) The increase of 4  per cent a year in the level of public expenditure had been fixed on the assumption of an increase of25 per cent in national output over the period in question. If this were not achieved, the proposed growth in public expenditure wouldbe very high in relation to national income and might not besustainable unless rates of taxation were increased. The reference to taxation in paragraph 76 of Chapter 1 might therefore need to bere considered.(d) The outline of the Plan in Chapter 1 did not sufficientlyrelate the prospects of economic growth to developments in world trade, which would have important implications for the success ofthe Plan. It would also be desirable to include some reference toconsultations with the Commonwealth on trade policies and onforward economic planning.(e) It would be desirable to set the Plan more clearly in the context of the Governments policy of encouraging the modernisation of industry and promoting social policies which would liberate themation&apos;s energies. It might also be desirable to emphasise the need to restrict the growth of private consumption in order to provideresources for additional public expenditure and investment. On theother hand there should be no suggestion that the Plan was astatement of the policies of the Labour Party, rather than theGovernment; and it would be inadvisable to overstress the restriction on the growth of private consumption.(/) Reference to periodical revision of the Plan in future years was confined to a guarded statement in paragraph 61 of Chapter 1.This should suffice to avoid any commitment to publish a completere-assessment every year. It would be important, however, to retain
freedom to revise individual targets from time to time in order toprevent the Government from being identified with estimates which,in the light of developments, had become out of date or unrealistic.(g) The statistics relating to defence expenditure in the plan should be re-examined in order to ensure that they were consistent with the Governments declared intention of confining the defence programme in real terms to the level of the 1964-65 estimates. but any attempt to include a specific estimate of the consequentialreduction in defence expenditure overseas would pre-judge the outcome of the Defence Review as regards the extent to which our political commitments overseas might have to be reduced in orderto secure the necessary economies in total.(h) The passages dealing with the level of overseas aid would need to be reconsidered in the light of the Cabinets final decisionon this matter.(*) The reference to the provision of new incentives toinvestment, in paragraph 41 of Chapter 1, should be re-examined,since the Chancellor of the Exchequer had indicated that theGovernment contemplated discussions with industry on this subjectbefore decisions were taken.(/&apos;) The statement that coal output was expected to decline to170-180 million tons in 1970 would be the first public indication ofthe Governments intentions in this respect. It would be important,therefore, to be able to show that specific steps were being takento absorb the labour which would become redundant.(k) The reference to the Governments policy on prices and incomes might be strengthened on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinistets speech in the House of Commons on 2nd August.(/) It might be desirable that the capital expenditure on public housing should be excluded from Table 18.1, summarising total public expenditure, on the grounds that only the figure of total capital expenditure on housing, both public and private, would be relevant and significant. On the other hand, the deletion of a majoritem of public expenditure from this table might be misleading. Thepoint should be further considered.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the Plan should be published in mid-September, notwithstanding the present economic situation andthe measures which had been taken to deal with it. There was alsogeneral agreement that we should maintain the target of 25 per centgrowth by 1970, on the grounds that the Plan could not be simplyan extrapolation of past economic trends but must be designed toencourage industry to aim at a higher level of output. Although theestimate of the increase in exports was optimistic, it was essentialto attain it; and the necessary policy steps must be taken. Individualchapters of the Plan should be adjusted, where necessary, to take account of the effects of the economic measures recently announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, particularly the postponement of certain projects of capital investment. He would undertake, in
consultation with the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Labour to approve the final text for printing towards the end ofAugust.The Cabinet (1) Approved the general outline of the National Plan as setout in C (65) 116.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to revise the text of thePlan in the light of the discussion and of any further amendments submitted to him by Ministers.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofLabour would approve the final text of the Plan forprinting at the end of August.computer industry(previous reference:CC(65) 32ndConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Technology (C (65) 115) and by the Minister of Pensions and national Insurance (C (65) 117) dealing respectively with assistanceto the computer industry and with requirements for the computernetwork for the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.Assistance to the computer industry the Minister of Technology said that the Government were committed to policies which would ensure the existence of aflourishing United Kingdom computer industry and a number of measures to this end had already been announced. It was clear,however, that these would not be sufficient to enable the industryto withstand the increased severity of competition from the UnitedStates and that some degree of preference for the United kingdom industry was necessary. Government requirements for computersrepresented no more than about 10 per cent of the present UnitedKingdom market but the direction in which Government orders were placed exerted an influence on other potential purchasers and if arising share of Government orders were to be placed with UnitedStates companies this would severely damage the reputation of theUnited Kingdom industry. Because of our international commitmentsit would be impracticable to increase the existing tariff preference of 14 per cent and the Government should therefore decide thatcomputer needs in the Government sector should as a matter ofpolicy be met by computers of United Kingdom manufacture except where no United Kingdom produced model could do the job or where it would involve more than 12 months additional delay.Such computers should be defined as any computer manufactured inthe United Kingdom having not less than a specified UnitedKingdom content by value. This would include computersmanufactured by certain United States subsidiaries established inthe United Kingdom and it would be open to other such subsidiariesto qualify by increasing the extent of their manufacture in this
country. In the absence of open competitive tendering it would benecessary to maintain a check on the prices at which UnitedKingdom computers were offered by ascertaining the prices being charged to commercial users. These could in turn be checked againstcurrent prices for United States models and by the information available to the Computer Advisory Unit. A policy on these lines would be required for a minimum period of three years and couldbe reviewed thereafter.Meanwhile officials should be required to prepare a report ona batch ordering system for requirements in the Government sectorwhich would provide for the aggregation and the standardisation,as far as practicable, of Government requirements. The ministers responsible for nationalised industries should press them to followthese proposals as a matter of national policy and consideration should be given to the inclusion of the hospital organisation.Attempts to persuade the computer industry to adopt a morerational pattern of organisation had been made but offered no prospect of success unless more powerful measures were brought tobear. The possibility of doing so was however very limited since in existing circumstances it would be impracticable either to threaten to withdraw Government aid unless the firms concerned pooledtheir interests or, alternatively, to nationalise the industry. It waspossible, however, that the current negotiations of the UnitedKingdom companies with French interests in computer developmentmight lead to closer links between the United Kingdom firms andthis issue should therefore be further considered in the light of the outcome of the proposed development of a large Anglo-Frenchcomputer.The Prime Minister suggested that there would be advantage inthe establishment of a co-ordinating committee, which might meetmonthly under the chairmanship of a senior official of the Ministryof Technology, to ascertain and co-ordinate the long-term requirements for computers in nationalised industries and in thepublic sector generally. The committee might also consider therequirements of the universities and of research establishments whichwere supported by Government funds. Its activities should enable theGovernment to influence the purchase of United.Kingdom computersin a considerably wider field than that of Government requirements.In discussion there was general agreement with the PrimeMinisters proposal. In considering the degree of preference to be afforded to United Kingdom industry it was argued that thereshould be some limitation on the price differential, having regardto the existing degree of preference afforded by the 14 per centtariff and the 10 per cent surcharge, since otherwise there would notbe sufficient pressure upon the industry to make itself competitive.Furthermore, too large a degree of preference might in many instances counterbalance altogether the short-term savings to be gained by the installation of a computer as compared with existingmethods. On the other hand, it was maintained that it would be
impracticable to lay down a clear figure in existing circumstancessince this might well be evaded by the current practice of UnitedStates firms in offering computers, e.g., for educationalestablishments, at a very substantial discount.The following main points were also made:(a) The proposed margin of 12 months in favour of a UnitedKingdom produced model would provide an excessive degree ofprotection for the industry. It would also create delays in thenecessary modernisation of our administration and, perhaps to an unacceptable extent, in the field of research and education. On theother hand, some account must be taken of the practice of UnitedStates industry in installing a model and testing it subsequentlyin situ, whereas it was United Kingdom practice to complete testingbefore installation.(b) Where Government Departments or Government assistedinstitutions paid a higher price for United Kingdom models than for imported models, it would be appropriate for the additional cost to be borne on the Vote of the Ministry of Technology ratherthan on the Votes of the Departments concerned.(c) The qualifying figure for the United Kingdom content of computers manufactured by foreign subsidiaries in the UnitedKingdom would be a matter for further discussion between ministers concerned.(d) The degree of Government assistance proposed for theindustry made it necessary to contemplate further pressure for the rationalisation of its structure. Meanwhile the Government should consider the acquisition of a minority shareholding in the firms concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that there was general agreement that further measures ofassistance were necessary for the United Kingdom computer industry. It was also agreed that these need not be the subject of apublic statement. Preference should be given to United Kingdomcomputers in the sense defined by the Minister of Technologyprovided that the price differential was not more than 25 per cent.A committee of Ministers should be set up to consider claims forexceptions to this rule, and to the proposed 12 months&apos; delay, eitherwhere the Minister of Technology considered that a further degreeof preference in money or in time was necessary in the interestsof United Kingdom industry or where proposals for a lesser degreeof such preference were advanced because of particular requirements,e.g., on operational grounds. A co-ordinating committee in respectof requirements in the public sector should also be established onthe lines which he had proposed. Meanwhile the Minister of technology should pursue the question of acquiring a minorityshareholding in the United Kingdom firms concerned.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 115, subject to a limit in normal circumstances of a preference in price of 25 per cent for united Kingdom computers.
(2) Invited the Minister of Technology to arrange for theestablishment of a committee for the co-ordination of purchases of computers in the public sector on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theestablishment of a committee of Ministers to consider any proposals for individual exceptions to the generalpolicy on the lines indicated in his summing up.(4) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State and the Chancellor of theExchequer, to consider the possible acquisition of a minority shareholding in the United Kingdom firmsproducing computers.(5) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation withother Ministers concerned, to define the qualifications for a United Kingdom computer in accordance with thegeneral principles set out in C (65) 115.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Technology, to consider the Voteprocedure for bearing the additional cost of buyingUnited Kingdom computers.Computers for the Ministry of Pensions and National insurance the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, said that he was concerned at the prolongeddelay in placing an order for the first of a series of computers tobe installed for the payment of National Insurance short-term benefits. In the field of social benefits, we could not contemplate the possibility of a deterioration in the service to beneficiaries whichcould result from the use of less than fully reliable equipment, whilethe delay was expensive in terms of eventual savings foregone. Thetenders for the necessary computers had now been evaluated andthe Remington Rand UNIVAC 494 computer system not only hadthe advantage over competing systems of affording a greater saving in administrative costs but was the only tendered system which was fully reliable. The extent of the advantages had been considered by officials and the proposal to purchase this computer was supportedby the Treasury and by the Stationery Office. Officials had also considered the possibility of using the English Electric LEO-Marconi(EELM) installation with the substitution of reliable disc files formagnetic card files (which were unreliable) but this was estimated to be much more costly either than the EELM system with magneticcard files or than the UNIVAC 494. The possibility had subsequently been raised of using a new and improved form of disc files with theLEO 326 but delay would be involved while the new disc files,which were not yet in production, were tested and if any of the alternatives were then found acceptable, the equipment would need to be obtained from the United States. Delay in installation wouldinvolve a consequential delay in completing the national coverage
with a postponement of savings in money and manpower. Theestimated staff saving when the system was complete was of theorder of 5,000. After considering the general criteria proposed bythe Minister of Technology for the purchase of computers forGovernment Departments there appeared nevertheless to be a clearcase for ordering the UNI VAC 494.The Minister of Technology said that the proposal was contraryto the general policy which the Cabinet had just approved.Furthermore, it was important that there should be full compatibilitybetween the computers used by the Post Office, the Board of InlandRevenue and the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. ThePost Office had already installed LEO computers and it was desirablethat similar computers should be installed by the Ministry ofPensions and National Insurance. It was also important to note that the original tender for a UNIVAC computer had been for theUNIVAC 490 which was inferior in performance to the LEO 326and that the UNIVAC 494 now advocated had not been fullytested.In discussion it was suggested that expenditure of the orderinvolved should in any case be postponed for a period of six months in pursuance of the Governments policy, announced the previousweek, for the deferment of certain public expenditure in the context of the current economic situation. Moreover, further consideration was required of the extent to which the total saving in money and staff which would be secured by the installation of a completecomputer system for work on National Insurance short-term benefitsjustified the heavy capital cost of the computers in presentcircumstances, quite apart from the expenditure of foreign currencywhich would be involved. Examination of the papers had alsorevealed certain inconsistencies in the figures of performance andforeign exchange cost relating to the various alternative computersand the delay should therefore be used to reach agreement on thefigures and to evaluate the new and improved form of disc filesproposed for the LEO 326.The Cabinet (7) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider, in the light of the points made in discussion, thecost, and expenditure of foreign currency, involved inthe alternative computer systems in relation to the savings in manpower and money which would be secured.(8) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, to arrange for the necessary testing of the new form of disc files proposed for the LEO 326computer.(9) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting in the light of the outcome of Conclusions (7) and (8).
CoalIndustry(previous reference:CC(65) 35thConclusions,Minute.5)4. ihe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of power (C (65) 110) about proposed increases in coal prices.The Minister of Power said that in February the National coal board had thought that their 1965-66 deficit on revenue account would be about  40 million; but they now estimated it to be inthe region of  55 million. Of this sum  30 million would be met bythe capital reconstruction which the Cabinet had approved on1st July. The Board proposed that the balance of  25 million shouldbe recovered by price increases from 1st September and that, inorder to further the policy of concentrating production on economiccoalfields and of eliminating uneconomic pits, the increases for industrial coals should vary according to the coalfields concerned.Thus, the price of industrial coals from the Yorkshire and EastMidland fields and from Scotland would not be raised but coalsfrom other fields which contained a large number of uneconomicpits, e.g., South Wales, Durham and Northumberland, would be subjected to price increases of varying amounts. The Board had originally intended to increase prices from 1st April; but, with theagreement of Ministers, action had been deferred. A decision was now urgent, since postponement of the increase was resulting insubstantial, cumulative losses.The First Secretary of State said that in the limited context ofthe coal industry&apos;s finances there might appear to be a good case for the proposed increases, although the reverse could be true if theyhad the effect of reducing the consumption of coal. In the widercontext, however, they would be bound to have a damaging effecton the Governments prices and incomes policy and on the credibility of that policy for the remainder of the year. It wouldbe preferable, therefore, that they should be deferred for a further period and that other means of financing the Board&apos;s deficit shouldbe adopted.In discussion, it was suggested that the application of price increases on a discriminatory basis to coals produced in uneconomicpits might, by increasing the fuel costs for industries in areas suchas Northumberland, Durham and South Wales, react adversely onthe Governments policy of selective regional development. Moreover,the prospects for the coal industry itself in those areas, particularlyin South Wales, would be seriously damaged.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a division of opinion on whether the proposed price increases should be introduced on the date suggested. But the method bywhich it was suggested that the increases should be applied raiseda new principle which should be considered in greater detail by the ministerial Committee on Economic Development in relation to theGovernments plans for regional development. Thereafter, theMinister of Powets proposals could be considered further by theCabinet, if possible at their next meeting.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider, as a matter of urgency, the implications of thecoal price increases proposed in C (65) 110 in relation tothe Governments plans for regional development.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion in the light of the outcome of Conclusion (1).Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd August, 1965.
