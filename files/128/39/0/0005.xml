Control of 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the FirstOffice Secretary of State (C. (64) 10) on the control of office building.Building j,^e p-rst Secretary 0j State said that it was necessary to follow up the action that had been taken to deal with the immediate problemof the balance of payments by announcing equally decisive steps inrelation to the domestic economy. It would take some time to formulate and to implement many of the policies required for thispurpose; but the difficulties caused by the rapid growth of office building, particularly in the London area, presented an obvious case for immediate action. He proposed, therefore, with the agreementof the Minister of Housing and Local Government and of the Ministerof Public Building and Works, that an announcement should be made during the Debate on the Address that the Government intended tocontrol new office development, initially in the London metropolitan region, on lines similar to the Board of Trade&apos;s existing control overindustrial building. This action would be designed to halt the rapid growth of offices and so to enable the Government to examine withthe Greater London Council the whole problem of employment inLondon in relation to the housing, transport and other services required.A Bill would be introduced under which both new office building and a change of use of existing premises in prescribed areas wouldrequire an Office Development Permit from the Board of Trade inaddition to normal planning permission. The area designated in thefirst instance would be the London Metropolitan Region. The control would be applied with particular stringency in the Greater london council area; and no permits would be granted except in very specialcircumstances. A permit would be required for new building, even ifplanning permission had been granted, unless a contract had been entered into before the date of the statement. A permit would also berequired in the case of any change of use, unless planning permissionhad been given before the date of the statement. In the rest of theMetropolitan Region a permit would be required for new building or change of use in all cases where planning permission had not beengiven before the date of the statement. Compensation would not be payable where a permit was withheld.The Minister of Housing said that office building in London had increased by 50 per cent since 1947; and some 21 million sq. ft. of new buildings were currently envisaged, of which 14 million sq. ft. hadalready received planning permission. The concentration of new office building in the metropolitan area was illustrated by the fact that,whereas 114 million sq. ft. had so far been constructed in London,the comparable figure in other major cities was less than 10 millionsq. ft. In deciding the basis on which the permits were to be issuedthe Government would be taking the first steps in planning a morerational development of the London area; and it would be important,therefore, that the statement should indicate clearly the ways in which.C. 5 (64)Broadcasts 1.   The Prime Minister said that Ministers should considerby Ministers carefully any invitations which they received to broadcast or to appear on television, particularly on specially arranged programmes, sincesubjects which might initially appear to be uncontroversial might beheld to entitle the Opposition to a right of reply. Debates with members of the Opposition should be avoided; but participation innews programmes could on occasion be helpful. Invitations to broadcast or to appear on television should be referred to his PrivateOffice in the first instance.In addition the Prime Minister reminded Ministers of the need to safeguard the confidential nature of their deliberations and toprevent any premature or unauthorised disclosure of the Cabinetsdecisions.
developers in different parts of the London Metropolitan Region,would be affected.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that the buildingindustry would need to be assured that the proposed control of office building would not reduce the total demand on their industry, althoughit would lead to a redistribution of that demand amongst different parts of the economy. Moreover, the Government should indicatethat they were prepared to apply the same restraints to their own plans for new offices.In discussion there was general support for the proposed controlover office building. While there was a strong case for relieving the pressure on building resources caused by new office building, the mainargument to be deployed in support of the new control should bethe need to deal with the long-term problems associated with thedevelopment of the London Metropolitan Region. At the same timeoffice construction in other parts of the country should be encouraged,and further consideration should be given to the measures by whichthis could best be achieved.There would be considerable pressure for compensation,particularly from those developers who had already received planning permission. The pressure might be reduced by emphasising thetemporary nature of the measures now proposed; but this involved the risk that developers would assume that they would receive compensation if, when the temporary control ended, they were stillrefused a permit. It would therefore be advisable to make it clear thatno compensation would be payable in any circumstances. Thisdecision would inevitably result in some hard cases; but they wouldhave to be accepted.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Note by Officials attached to C. (64) 10 appeared tosuggest that most of the office development now under consideration would eventually have to be permitted in order to provide for the replacement of old premises, the improvement of space standards and an increase in general efficiency. On the other hand there couldbe no guarantee that, when the temporary control was lifted, the developments subsequently approved would be the same as thosewhich were in contemplation when the control was initiallyestablished.(b) The restriction of new building would confer a scarcity valueon offices already constructed, which would tend to be reflected in higher rents. This possibility would need to be kept under careful review.(c) The control should be subject to a minimum limit, whichwould allow the construction of buildings for local services tocontinue.id) It would not be easy to find time for the proposed Bill inview of the already heavy programme of legislation facing theGovernment in the forthcoming Session. But room might be found for it in the early part of the Session; and every effort should be madeto secure its introduction by the middle of December.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be general agreement that legislation should be introduced for controlling office building, initially in the London metropolitan region, and that it should take effect retrospectively from the dateof an announcement to this effect, which should be made in the very near future. The public presentation of this measure should emphasise the need to deal with the growing problems of housing, transport andother services in London. Compensation would not be payable incases where an Office Development Permit was withheld.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in discussion, theproposals in C. (64) 10.
CC. 5 (64)Parliamentary 3. The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the first fourBusiness        days 0f the Debate on the Address.School 4.   The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thatBuilding it was necessary to decide whether to publish the results of the schoolSurvey building survey which had been undertaken in 1962; and, in view ofthe criticism which the Labour Party had levelled against the previous government during the General Election campaign for their refusal to publish this survey, it might be desirable that government spokesmen should make some reference to the matter during the debate on the Address. The reluctance of the previous Governmentto publish the material derived from the survey could be understoodin the light of the inept nature of the undertaking. The first part ofthe report of the survey consisted of an analysis of the replies of localeducation authorities to a questionnaire designed to ascertain whether any of 13 named defects were present in their maintained schools.This analysis had indicated that the large majority of schools weredefective in several of these respects; but, since the significance ofthe defects varied with the circumstances of individual schools, thepublication of the figures would be misleading unless they were accompanied by a full explanatory statement. The second part of the survey had called for an estimate of the cost of remedying the defectsand had produced a total figure of  1,300 million. This sum, however,was wholly unrealistic in so far as it implied that all the work couldbe done at one time and that other relevant circumstances wouldmeanwhile remain unchanged. Allowance had in fact been made foran expenditure of  80 million in the school building programme for1965-66; but of this sum  50 million would be required to provide forthe increasing school population and only  30 million would beavailable for remedying defects. If the results of this part of the surveywere published, therefore, the Government would be pressed toincrease the amount allotted to the remedying of defects; but it wouldbe premature to undertake a commitment to this effect in advanceof consideration of the many other claims on the building industry.In all the circumstances it might be best either not to publish theresults of the survey at all or, if this were thought inadvisable, to publish the first part but not the estimate of the cost of making good the deficiencies which it purported to reveal.In discussion it was suggested that the Government would inevitably be subjected to pressure, which they would find it difficultto resist, for the publication of the results of the survey and that thebalance of advantage probably inclined in favour of publishing them at once rather than at a later stage when responsibility for thecontinuance of the situation which they revealed might tend to be attributed to the Government in office rather than to the Governmentwhich had been in power when the survey was carried out. Moreover,since the Opposition would be aware of the estimate of the cost ofremedying the defects, it might be less embarrassing to publish itforthwith than to have to face the suggestion that it disclosed a situation with which the Government were not prepared to deal. Itwould be necessary, however, to couple the publication of the figureswith an explanatory memorandum drawing attention to the unrealisticnature of the basis on which the survey had been undertaken.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, on balance, the results of both parts of the surveyshould be published. The draft of an explanatory memorandum should be submitted to the Committee on Social Services; and, until it had been examined, it would be preferable to refrain from any public or parliamentary indication of the Governments intentions in this regard.
The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science to circulate to the Social Services Committee, for consideration at an early meeting, the draft of an explanatory statement which might be published with the results of the school building Survey.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd November, 1964.
