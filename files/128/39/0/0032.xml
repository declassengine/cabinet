Prices and incomes PolicyDoctors&apos; PaySituation inGeneralPractice(previous reference:CC(65) 13thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (C (65) 43), to which was appended the draft of a letter to besent to the Chairman of the Genera! Medical Services Committee(GMSC) on the medical profession^ proposals for a &quot; FamilyDoctors&apos; Charter &quot;.The Minister of Health said that on 24th March a conferenceof doctors&apos; representatives would decide whether or not the undatedresignations of general practitioners from the National health service, which had been collected by the British Medical Guild as aresult of the profession^ strong reaction to the recent report by the review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, should besent in on 1st April to take effect on 1st July. The GMSC had alsosubmitted proposals for a new &quot; Family Doctors&apos; Charter &quot;; and thedecision of the meeting on 24th March would turn in large part onthe terms of the Governments reply to these proposals. The draftappended to C (65) 43 was therefore designed to go some way to meetthe profession by indicating the Ministers willingness to enter into negotiations about a new type of contract of service and new methodsof remuneration. On the separate question of the quantum of remuneration, however, the profession wished to negotiate in futuredirect with the Government, whereas the Government should maintain their view that this issue should, as hitherto, be referredto the Review Body for advice. Since there seemed no prospect of immediate argument with the profession on the point, it shouldexplicitly be set on one side in the letter; and there would then be reasonable grounds for hoping that the rest of the letter would be suffiently positive in tone to avoid the implementation of the threat of mass resignations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was important thatthe letter, which was likely to be made public, should be regardednot merely as a tactic of negotiation but primarily as a means of drawing the attention of public opinion to the strength of theGovernments case in this matter. For this purpose it should describe the background against which the present situation must beconsidered, particularly the fact that the existing system of remuneration had stood for nearly 17 years; and it should emphasise that it was not reasonable for the profession to seek to require theGovernment to give an answer of substance within a few days of receiving proposals for a fundamental alteration of its provisions.The letter should also stipulate that, before there could be anyquestion of discussing with the profession their proposals for a new type of contract of service and a new system of remuneration it wouldbe necessary to define clearly their concept of their obligations and responsibilities under the National Health Service.In discussion it was agreed that, while it would be desirable to deploy these arguments at an appropriate point in public discussionof the doctors&apos; proposals, it should be left to the discretion of theMinister of Health to decide how far he should press them in theletter to be sent to the GMSC. It would be more important that the
letter should establish the principle that there was a clear link between cash remuneration and other conditions of service and thatmodifications in e.g., doctors&apos; hours of work would therefore haveto be taken into account in the Review Body&apos;s future assessment of increases in remuneration.In detailed discussion of the draft letter annexed to C (65) 43the following main points were made:(a) The first sentence of the first paragraph should be expanded to make it clear that the unconditional addition of  5^ million to the pool of remuneration for 1965-66, which had already been concededby the Government, implied that doctors would be receiving aconsiderable increase in net income from 1st April next.(b) The second sentence of the first paragraph might be amended in order to emphasise that the profession were making very far-reaching proposals for substituting a completely new contract ofservice and system of remuneration for that which they had accepted in 1948 and again, in the light of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos;and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, in 1960; and that the Governmentcould hardly be expected to enter into commitments upon theseproposals when they had only received them in the last few days andhad had no opportunity to examine them in detail.(c) The fourth paragraph of the draft should be expanded to remind the profession that they had supported the appointment ofthe Review Body.(d) There was some danger that the last two sentences of thefourth paragraph of the draft might be interpreted as suggesting thatan alteration in the system of remuneration would automaticallyresult in an increase in the amount. These sentences, however, couldbe allowed to stand if the fifth paragraph were amended to make itclear that the Minister was prepared to negotiate on other matterscovered by the proposed &quot; Charter &quot;, provided that it was understoodthat he would not be ready to agree to new levels of remunerationotherwise than on the recommendation of the Review Body.(e) In the penultimate paragraph the words &quot; fixing levels of remuneration &quot; should be substituted for the words &quot; pricing the contract&quot;.(/) The first sentence of the last paragraph might be regardedas implying that, if discussions on the new type of contract of serviceand the new system of remuneration could be concluded in a shortertime than at present appeared possible, the revised arrangements could be brought into effect before 1st April, 1966. The sentence should therefore be redrafted to make it clear that those arrangements would not be implemented before the end of the period for whichthe Review Body&apos;s recommendations in 1963 had been intended to last.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, ifthe Minister of Health&apos;s fears were realised, the letter, as amended,might well not suffice to prevent the resignation of a large numberof doctors from the National Health Service. In that event theGovernment would face the prospect of a temporary disruption of
the Service and, possibly, a protracted dispute with the medical profession. Nevertheless, the Cabinet agreed that, as amended in discussion, the letter annexed to C (65) 43 constituted a justifiableand defensible position for the Government to adopt in as much asit showed that they were ready to be conciliatory but were notprepared to yield to pressure. The Minister should take theopportunity of the debate in the House of Commons on the following day to present the Governments case in greater detail.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Health to send to the Chairmanof the General Medical Services Committee a letter in theterms of the draft annexed to C (65) 43, amended to take account of the points made in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th March, 1965.
