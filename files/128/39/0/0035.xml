Foreign Policy 2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary dealing respectively with the Atlantic Nuclear Force(C(65) 48), the Middle East (C(65)49), Europe (C(65)51) and possible links between the European Free Trade Association and theEuropean Economic Community (C (65) 52).The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should regardthese memoranda as the basis for a wide-ranging discussion overthe whole field of our foreign policy.Discussion took place under the following heads:VietnamThe Foreign Secretary said that the only objective of the presentUnited States military operations was to arrest the infiltration of menand arms from North Vietnam to the South. The United StatesGovernment were not seeking to overthrow the Government of north Vietnam or to enable the Government of South Vietnamto occupy Northern territory. In his recent discussions with thePresident of the United States in Washington he had obtained an assurance that the United States Government would inform us inadvance if at any time they judged it to be necessary to intensifytheir present military measures (e.g., by bombing Hanoi) in orderto achieve their objective; and this would enable us to consider thepolicy which we should adopt in that event and to make such representations as we saw fit to the United States Government before they took the action which they contemplated. Meanwhile we mustmaintain our efforts to promote an agreed settlement of the conflictin Vietnam. For this purpose we were taking all the measures whichwere open to us; and the projected mission of Mr. Patrick gordon walker to South-East Asia might throw further light on the means by which a settlement might be achieved. As yet, however, there wasno indication that the Communist Powers concerned were diposedto modify their view that there was no issue for negotiation andthat the dispute could only be solved by the complete withdrawalof United States forces from South Vietnam. In present circumstancesthis would not accord with our own interests or the interests of other friendly countries; and it was also clear that our attempts to findCC 19 (65)Trades Union 1.   The Prime Minister said that in recent discussions with congress members of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) it had emerged thatthe TUC felt that they were not always informed of developments in Government policy, in which they were directly concerned, except on such issues as labour relations and incomes policy. It was desirable, therefore, that Ministers should make arrangements toensure that the TUC would be kept in touch, as appropriate, withthe more important activities of their Departments.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.
a basis for negotiation would not be furthered if we dissociatedourselves from the measures which were currently being taken bythe United States Government.In discussion it was suggested that in the long term it would benecessary to contemplate, as part of any peaceful settlement in thearea, the unification of North and South Vietnam and that any actionwhich we might take, or endorse, in the interim should not be inconsistent with this ultimate objective. On the other hand there appeared to be no early prospect of a permanent settlement; and,on the analogy of Germany and Korea, the division of Vietnam mighthave to continue for a long time. It would be premature at this stage to try to foresee the solution which might ultimately have to beadopted; but in the meantime we must bear in mind the concern ofa number of Commonwealth Governments in South-East Asia thatthe United States Government should not, by withdrawing from thearea, leave them exposed to Communist subversion or attack.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the discussions which the Foreign Secretary had recentlyundertaken in Washington had been helpful in influencing the policyof the United States Government. We must continue our efforts to seek a possible basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in vietnam and, although the prospects in this respect might not appearvery hopeful, they were slightly more encouraging than they hadbeen only a few weeks before. But, if there were any fresh indication of a further intensification of the fighting, the Cabinet would haveto give further consideration to the policy which we should thenadopt.Atlantic Nuclear ForceDiscussion then turned to the memorandum by the foreign secretary (C (65) 48) on the Atlantic Nuclear Force (ANF).It was suggested that one of the advantages which we had seen in proposing the ANF was the probability that it would be less objectionable to the Soviet Government than the earlier proposalfor a Multilateral Force (MLF). It now appeared, however, that soviet opinion was as opposed to the ANF as to the MLF. On theother hand the Soviet authorities could be expected to appreciate that, whereas the Federal Government of Germany, althoughforbidden by Treaty to manufacture nuclear weapons, were under no such prohibition as regards their acquisition, it was an essential feature of the ANF project that the nuclear Powers would undertake not to disseminate nuclear weapons and the non-nuclear Powers,including the Federal German Government, would undertake not toacquire them. From this point of view the ANF project should benot without certain attractions for the Soviet Government; and,although they would naturally oppose any proposal to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, their hostility to the ANFmight be intended largely as a bargaining counter.The retention of a United Kingdom nuclear capability East of suez was envisaged as an interim measure, pending a longer termsolution of the problem of providing some form of assurance to thenon-nuclear Powers, such as India, against a Chinese nuclear threat.SECRET
Without such an assurance the Indian Government might wellembark on the manufacture of nuclear weapons; and in that eventother countries would follow their example. Our objective should therefore be to arrest this process of proliferation by seeking topromote some form of collective nuclear security in Asia, to whichwe might contribute our own nuclear capability East of Suez.The Middle east the Cabinet next considered the memorandum by the foreign secretary on the Middle East (C (65) 49).The Foreign Secretary said that most of the Governments in theMiddle East were genuinely trying to modernise their economies and to improve the standard of living of their peoples. The bitterhostilities which divided them, whether between the Arab States and israel or between one Arab State and other, were not based on any real conflict of interests. The United Kingdom, however, no longerhad the power, as in the 19th century, to impose solutions; and,indeed, there were no clear-cut solutions which could resolve theproblems of the area. In these circumstances our policy must be to try to reduce the tension in the area in the hope that in the longer term the interests which the Middle East countries had in commonwould prevail over their traditional hostilities. It was in this spiritthat we were seeking to maintain a balance in the supply of arms to Israel and to her Arab neighbours and to dissuade Syria and the lebanon from action in relation to the Jordan waters which would provoke Israel.In discussion it was agreed that it would be necessary to give further consideration to our policies in the Middle East in the lightof the outcome of the current review of our defence commitmentsoverseas. In particular, we should need to examine the value of theCentral Treaty Organisation (CENTO) since, although our overflyingrights in Iran were currently of vital importance for the reinforcement of our forces in the Far East, the political value of the organisation in the longer term was less certain. We should also need similarlyto review our military commitments in relation to Kuwait andthe Persian Gulf in terms of the importance of maintaining stability in the area and ensuring the continued supply of oil from the middle east. It seemed clear that, if we were to achieve the necessaryeconomies in defence expenditure, our commitments in the middle east would have to be reduced; but it was essential that this shouldbe achieved by planned and deliberate judgment rather than by changes of policy adopted at short notice and without duedeliberation.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of foreign policy at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th March, 1965.
