Rhodesia(previous reference :CC (65) 60thConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Prime Minister said that the situation was somewhatmore favourable than might have been expected before the illegaldeclaration of independence (i.d.i.) was actually made. Theinter-departmental machinery had worked effectively and themeasures which had been devised in advance had been quickly andsmoothly put into effect. The firm stand of the Governor, withadvice from the Chief Justice, had been of the utmost value; andso far we had been able to maintain communication with him. Therepressive action taken by the illegal regime had also been helpful in gaining general support in the United Kingdom for the actionwhich the Government had taken.It was now urgent that the Orders-in-Council which were contemplated under the Enabling Act should be made as soon aspossible. We should consider whether an Order might be made which would amend or revoke some of the more objectionablepowers taken by the illegal regime, such as those imposing press censorship. It was doubtful, however, whether we should seek toannul the power of restriction, since the United KingdomGovernment might otherwise be held responsible for acts of violencein Rhodesia.The situation in the Security Council of the United nations was delicately balanced; and neither our own resolution nor thatput forward by the representative of the Ivory Coast seemed likelyto be acceptable in its present form. It was possible that theForeign Secretary might secure amendments to the latter whichmight enable us to vote for it. But in any event, there would beno question of our using the veto, without prior reference to theCabinet. The Foreign Secretary was also seeking agreement onthe establishment of a United Nations Working Party to examinethe effectiveness of general economic sanctions and, specifically, of oil sanctions. We should reserve our position until such a working party had reported, since it would be inadvisable for us to imposesuch sanctions in advance of other countries.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was increasingdifficulty in maintaining our communications with the Governor.For the rest, we should maintain our current measures; but weshould avoid at this stage those which would operate too harshly,since these would be likely to consolidate support among theEuropean population in Rhodesia for the illegal regime, whereasour aim should be to divide such opinion. Meanwhile we were inclose touch with Commonwealth Governments in East and central africa on the situation.In discussion there was general agreement that at this early stage drastic action against the illegal regime might be unprofitable.It would be unwise, however, to allow our partial restrictions tocontinue indefinitely at their present level, since Rhodesian opinion might increasingly be reconciled to them. We should therefore seekprogressive and cumulative increases in pressure and should consider shortly, if there were then no signs of internal opposition
to the illegal regime, whether yet further measures would bedesirable. In particular a great deal would depend on the progressive financial stringency which should develop in rhodesia  a result both of action taken by the Banks and of a decline in public confidence, since the effect of such pressures might beexpected to take effect more quickly than economic sanctions andthey would be seen in Rhodesia to flow from the action taken bythe illegal regime rather than to be directly attributable to theUnited Kingdom Government. In considering our own further measures, we must continue to have regard to their possible impact on the economic position of Zambia and on the maintenance ofour own copper supplies.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) A number of Rhodesian diplomatic officers attached to ourEmbassies abroad had declared themselves loyal to the Crown.There were current difficulties, however, in relation to one officerat the Washington Embassy who continued to support the illegal regime.(b) We should consider whether there would be advantage in arranging for a representative of the Government to visit thosecountries whose position was of most importance to the measuresto be taken against Rhodesia, in order to promote a better understanding of the Governments policies.(c) The exchange control measures in respect of Rhodesiansterling balances would have to be operated flexibly and wouldhave to take account of the needs of Malawi and Zambia tocontinue to import certain goods from Rhodesia. We might have toaccept that certain imports should be paid for in dollars rather thanin sterling.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that weshould maintain a close watch both on the situation in Rhodesia andon the effect of our economic measures on other countries and onthe United Kingdom itself. He would consider the most appropriatemachinery for enabling the necessary consultation and decisions onthe wide ranges of issues involved to be quickly carried out.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and of thepoints made in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider theestablishment of the necessary committee machinery forthe consideration of the economic effects of our measures against Rhodesia both in the United Kingdom andabroad.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, toconsider the desirability of arranging for a representativeof the Government to visit certain countries in order toimprove their understanding of our position in relationto Rhodesia.
Prices andIncomesPolicyArmed ForcesPay2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (65) 144)and a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence(C (65) 148) on the pay of the Armed Forces.The First Secretary of State said that since 1960 the pay ofthe Armed Forces had been settled by biennial reviews. These wereto adjust the pay of officers to take account of movements incertain Civil Service salaries and to adjust the pay of other ranksto reflect changes in average earnings in certain industries (theso-called &quot; Grigg &quot; system). The latest review was likely to result inan increase of about 181 per cent as from 1st April, 1966, andwould cost over  50 million. The system had been introduced asthe only way in which the pay of the Armed Forces could be kept in line with civilian pay generally and, although there was no legalcommitment by the Government to make an adjustment alongthese lines in 1966, there was clearly a strong moral commitmentsince recruitment to the Armed Forces had been conducted on thebasis of such a pay award. Moreover, the Armed Forces represented a special case amongst employees since they were under military discipline and were not able to take action of the kind open to civilian workers to secure pay increases. Nevertheless, there was the strongest political objection to the Government raising the pay ofthe Armed Forces by over 9 per cent a year simply on the basis of comparability with increases in the earnings of certain workers inthe Civil Service and industry. It was an essential part of the prices and incomes policy that pay increases far in excess of the normshould not be paid solely on grounds of comparability (although this was one factor to be taken into account). If an increase of this order were given by the Government without prior examination by the National Board for Prices and Incomes then our policy inthis field would have to be completely re-examined. Great difficulty had already been caused by the large increases given to postmenand to teachers. The Government could not accept a further payaward of this order in the public sector without reference to theBoard.It would however be equally impossible for the Governmentto interfere arbitrarily with the operation of the &quot; Grigg &quot; system,particularly in view of the attitude which had been taken by theLabour Party when the previous Administration had amended theoperation of the system in 1962. An arbitrary reduction in theamount of the pay increase to the Armed Services could only bejustified if earnings in the public sector generally were held strictlyat their existing level and this in turn would require more drastic action in the private sector than was involved by the present policy. The National Board for Prices and Incomes should therefore be asked to examine the increases arising from the&quot; Grigg &quot; system against the criteria for exceptional increases in pay set out in the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy(Cmnd. 2639); and to advise whether the &quot; Grigg &quot; increase shouldbe applied in full in April 1966 or should be modified in any way.6717-1a 3
If the Board reported in favour of applying the &quot; Grigg &quot; system,then the Government should accept the award; but there wouldthen be ample justification for their doing so. The present systemof settling the pay of the Armed Forces was not howeversatisfactory. It did not distinguish sufficiently between differentgrades and qualifications in the Armed Forces and the Board mightwell recommend greater discrimination in the application of pay increases. They could not be expected to reconsider in detail the pay of every grade in the Armed Forces but they could suitably advise on the general approach. Since the pay increases would not, in anycase, fall due until April 1966 there was adequate time for the matter to be reviewed; in this respect the position differed from that whichhad made it necessary to grant the increase in the &quot; M &quot; rate in theGovernment service before the system as such was referred to theBoard. There was adequate justification for referring the pay of the armed Services to the Board since a new policy in the field of incomes, which was exemplified by the establishment of the Board,had been introduced since the &quot; Grigg &quot; system was approved. Therewas no reason why the Armed Forces should be regarded as being in a different position from other workers. Many members of theForces were, in fact, much better paid than industrial workerswhose pay claims were being referred to the Board or delayed byother means. The reference would certainly involve a change in theexisting arrangements for settling pay in an important sector of thepublic service but this was an inevitable consequence of thedevelopment of the prices and incomes policy which wouldincreasingly involve interference with the established procedure for arbitration. In the circumstances a reference to the Boardrepresented the only legitimate way out of the acute dilemma whichfaced the Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the issue shouldbe referred to the Board. It was clear that the policy of basingpay in the public service on fair comparisons could not be easilyreconciled with the policy of maintaining a norm of 3^ per cent forpay increases under the prices and incomes policy. But in additionto the difficulties for the prices and incomes policy which would be created by a pay increase of 18^ per cent to the Armed Services, theeconomic and financial position of the country was such that it wasimpossible to contemplate an increase of  50 million a year in thecost of Armed Services pay. It seemed likely that the estimatesproposed by Departments for 1966-67 would show an increase of as much as 11 per cent over 1965-66. In these circumstances therewere strong arguments for the Government deciding arbitrarilywhat could be afforded for the next two years for pay increases for the Armed Forces; but in view of the difficulties of such action the best course was to refer the proposed increases to the Board.Nevertheless, the financial and economic situation was worse thanin 1962 and the Government must have full regard to this in taking their ultimate decision.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the present systemof settling the pay of the Armed Forces admittedly had defects, not
the least being the long time-lag in making adjustments equivalentto those in civilian employment. He had, in fact, tried to reduce the size of the increase which would have to be given under theexisting arrangements in April 1966 and so mitigate the political difficulty by proposing that an interim award should be made during1965. But it had not proved acceptable that a long-term agreement should be re-opened during the period that it was in force. It was reasonable that the Board should be asked to consider whether abetter system could be devised, provided that the increase of18-J per cent were granted in April 1966. There was, however, strong objection to the reference of the current increase to the Board. Inthe first place serious practical difficulties would arise. It would be quite impossible for the Board to carry out any thorough reviewof the pay of the Armed Services in relation to the criteria set outin the White Paper on Prices and Incomes in the course of two orthree months. Moreover, in other references to the Board the case for the employees was put by their trade union. But the armed forces had nobody to represent their interests before the Boardunless the Ministry of Defence did so. The Board would consequentlybe put in the impossible position of arbitrating between the Ministryof Defence and the Treasury. Moreover, the pay increase for officers was based on increases in the pay of certain Civil Servants who, itwas contemplated, might receive a further 3-1 per cent increase inJanuary 1966; and there had been no suggestion that the pay increases for these Civil Servants should be referred to the Board.In the second place, it would be morally wrong to withholdfrom the Armed Services pay increases equivalent to those whichhad already been received by millions of workers in civilianemployment. The members of the Armed Services had been recruitedon the basis that their pay would be settled on a particular basis and it would be wholly wrong to change this basis towards the endof a two-year period merely because its results were unpalatable tothe Government. The Armed Forces were entitled to increases in pay of the order proposed and the Government could not devolvetheir own responsibility on the Board. The number of men recruitedor re-engaged was not reaching the target necessary to maintainthe Armed Forces at the desired level and when the conclusions ofthe Defence Review were announced, anxiety in the Services about their future would be intensified. They were already overstretchedin relation to their commitments and the belief that the Governmentwere not prepared to honour their obligations on pay would leadto a serious risk of complete failure of recruitment. In thesecircumstances a reference to the Board, which could only be seen as an attempt to reduce the size of the pay award, would also be strongly criticised by the Opposition and lead to serious political controversy.In discussion the following arguments were put forward infavour of referring the proposed award to the Board:(a) A pay award of 9 per cent per annum was so far above thenorm that it would completely undermine the Governments incomes
policy. It had always been recognised that the attempt to restrain the rise in money incomes would require a change in the generalclimate of opinion and that serious difficulties would have to be faced in order to achieve this.(b) The new policy also inevitably involved interference withthe long established methods of pay settlements. In particular,further consideration would have to be given to the whole system of&quot; fair comparisons &quot; as a basis for settling the pay of employees inthe public sector.(c) The establishment of the National Board for Prices and incomes introduced a fundamentally new factor into the whole situation which could not be ignored in any major pay settlement.The Government was already intervening directly or indirectly to restrain increases in pay, both in nationalised industries and in private industry, not least by restraining price increases whicheffectively restricted the ability of employers to raise wages.(d) If the gradual approach to a prices and incomes policy werefrustrated, it would be necessary to consider more drastic measuressuch as the introduction of measures to hold incomes at their existing level perhaps, accompanied by seriously deflationary policies.The following arguments were advanced against a reference tothe Board:(e) The Armed Forces were the most vulnerable section of thecommunity in relation to pay since they were wholly dependent on government decisions and had no trade union to represent their interests. The &quot; Grigg &quot; arrangements for the pay of the ArmedServices together with similar independent arrangements for theCivil Service, represented a defence for public servants against theirexploitation by the Government in times of economic difficulty.Although it would be desirable to improve the system in future itwould be wrong to penalise the Armed Services at the present timewhen their pay had admittedly fallen well behind that of comparableoccupations, including the Civil Service.(/) It had always been recognised that, in the early months ofthe incomes policy, there would be a transitional period in which many difficulties would arise. The proposed award to the ArmedServices was an inherited and an inescapable moral commitment,since it merely represented what other people had already secured.If the prices and incomes policy proved effective in future inrestraining the rise in money incomes, the &quot; Grigg &quot; system for the armed Services would not create difficulties.(g) The Board should not be asked to deal with a matter whichwas a firm responsibility of the Government since it affected thedefence and security of the country.In further discussion it was suggested that a possiblecompromise might be to announce that there would be an interim increase of 7 per cent in Armed Services pay in April 1966(representing the &quot; norm &quot; of 3\ per cent for two years). At thesame time the question whether any additional increase would be consistent with the criteria for exceptional increases in incomes should be referred to the Board.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the present arrangements for determining the pay of the Armed Forces must be reconsidered and that it mightbe appropriate to ask the National Board for Prices and Incomesto do this. There was also general recognition of the serious dilemmaposed for the Government by the conflict between past commitments in relation to public sector incomes and the requirements of the newprices and incomes policy. Full weight must clearly be attached tothe extent to which the Government were morally committed tothe adjustment of the pay of the Armed Forces by April 1966 underthe existing systems and it would be necessary, if any reference were made to the National Board, to have regard to this factor.The Cabinet would wish to give further consideration to the matter at a subsequent meeting in the light of the arguments advanced in discussion. Meanwhile, the First Secretary of State, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence might consider whether a compromise might be found which wouldreconcile the differing considerations.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence toconsider in the light of the discussion whether analternative solution might be devised which would offer a compromise between the divergent considerations.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th November, 1965.
