Sir winston churchill(previous reference:C.C.(65)2ndConclusions,Minute 1)h The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish, at their first meeting after the death of Sir Winston Churchill on 24th January,to send a message of sympathy on behalf of the Government as awhole to Lady Churchill and the other members of Sir Winston&apos;sfamily.In accordance with the wish expressed by The Queen the earl marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain were making the necessary preparations for the Lying-in-State ceremony in Westminster Hall on27th-29th January and for the State Funeral in St. Paul&apos;s Cathedralon 30th January. Ministers would be advised in due course of thearrangements which were being made to enable them to be present on these occasions.There would be no national mourning during the remainder ofthe week; and Ministers should feel free to attend public and socialfunctions in so far as these were clearly related to the conduct ofpublic business. They should also continue to take part, as appropriate,in political activities connected with current by-elections, although they might well feel that they should refrain from public political controversy on 30th January, the day of Sir Winston&apos;s funeral. Itwould be appropriate, however, that they should decline purely socialinvitations, other than of a private nature, for the remainder of theweek.On the previous day Lord Avon had proposed in the House ofLords that, as a continuing memorial of Sir Winston&apos;s name, anannual Churchill Day should be instituted on the anniversary of someappropriate occasion in Sir Winston&apos;s life. This proposal might meritfurther consideration in due course; but it would be wise to allow someinterval to elapse before pursuing it in order to judge how muchpopular support it would command.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement about thearrangements to be made in connection with the death ofSir Winston Churchill.(2) Endorsed the proposal that a message of sympathy should besent to Lady Churchill.JirBamentary 2.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet that, sinceParliament would be adjourned during Sir Winston ChurchilFsLying-in-State, it would be necessary to effect some re-arrangement ofParliamentary business. It was proposed that the revised order ofbusiness should be as follows:Monday, 1st February: Second Reading of the Control of Officeand Industrial Development Bill and of the Kenya Republic Bill.
Tuesday, 2nd February: Remaining stages of the consolidate fund Bill, followed by a debate on a Motion by the Opposition on theaircraft industry and a debate on a Motion on the Import Duties(Various Goods) Order.Wednesday, 3rd February: Second Reading of the War DamageBill; and remaining stages of the Superannuation (Amendment) Bill.Thursday, 4th February: Debate on an Opposition Amendmentof Censure, followed by the remaining stages of the Kenya RepublicBill.Friday, 5th February: Private Members&apos; Motions.Monday, 8th February: Second Reading of the Museum ofLondon Bill (in the House of Lords); remaining stages of the Rivers(Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Bill; and a Motion on sea fisheries Order.The Gas Bill would be presented during that week.The Prime Minister said that it would also be necessary to arrangefor the release of certain statements which would otherwise have beenmade in Parliament. It would not be possible to defer for a furtherweek his own projected statement on export incentives and othereconomic measures; and the President of the Board of Trade would therefore arrange for details of the proposals as regards exportincentives to be made public as soon as Commonwealth and foreign government had been given sufficient advance information about our intentions. Some subsequent occasion would have to be found for the publication of the other elements in the comprehensiveeconomic statement which he himself had originally intended to make.In addition the Secretary of State for Defence should now publish the statement about the grounding of the Valiant bombers which hehad had it in mind to make in Parliament on the following day.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and bythe Lord President.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th January, 1965.
