CC. 10 (64)Pensions(previous reference:CC. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C. (64) 18) and by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (64) 19) on the possibility of advancing the dateof payment of National Insurance benefits.The Minister of Technology said that, in accordance with the cabinets directions, an inquiry had been conducted into thepossibility of using computer services to enable the date from whichpensioners&apos; order books could be amended in order to incorporate the new rates of benefit to be brought forward from 29th March.If the maximum use could be made of the Governments availablecomputer capacity, it might be possible to advance the date by someeight weeks, although there would be a number of attendant risks.A more reasonable estimate, based on a less intensive use of theGovernments computer resources, would be an acceleration of threeweeks; but even this could not be regarded as a certainty.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that, forthe reasons given by the Minister of Technology, she had investigatedan alternative method of making payments to pensioners before29th March, whereby Post Offices would be instructed to pay amultiple of the amount printed on pensioners&apos; order foils, the totalof the extra sums payable being related roughly to the amount whichthe pensioner would have received if it had been practicable to advance the date of payment. There would be strong pressure for makingadvance payments of this kind not only to National insurance retirement pensioners but also to widows of all classes and to warand industrial disablement pensioners, to whom also it would otherwise be impossible to pay the increased awards until the endof March. The pensioners in all these categories would number about-2- million. Some anomalies might be inevitable, since some pensionersentitled to payments would receive too much because the figure which the Post Office would multiply would include elements in their pensions that were not being increased, while others would receivetoo little because of the operation of the earnings rule and yet othersmight receive no additional payments at all for largely accidentalreasons. The legislation providing for advance payments would therefore need to give the Minister wide discretion in settling theconditions for entitlement; and any complaints about the inequitiesof the scheme would have to be justified on the grounds that theywere administratively unavoidable.The advance payment of increased pensions would create difficulties for the National Assistance Board. Normally, the board would be obliged to take account of such an advance paymentreceived by a recipient of assistance by reducing, and possiblyeliminating, his assistance in the week in question. This could be overcome, in the case of recipients of assistance who were alsosupplemented pensioners, by giving the Board statutory authority to disregard for assistance purposes any advance payments of national insurance or war pensions. This, however, would leave without additional relief about half a million people on National Assistance
who were not in receipt of National Insurance benefits but were forthe most part worse off than retirement or war pensioners. In thesecircumstances the Board would wish to bring forward the date for theoperation of the improved assistance scales to 25th January. suitable arrangements could then be made whereby, for all practical purposes,all recipients of assistance would receive an increase in their incomewhether from National Insurance benefit or from National Assistance.The cost of paying on three occasions double the amount on the face of all pension orders (which would be equivalent to bringing forward the date of payment to 7th December) would be  60 million in the case of National Insurance retirement pensioners; and thethree payments would be made just before Christmas, near the endof January and near the end of February. Further investigation had shown that contributions could be increased from the first week inFebruary rather than 8th March as suggested in C. (64) 18, providedthat the Post Office could accept the administrative and financialconsequences of deferring certain requirements of their own in orderto give priority to the printing and issue of the new insurance stamps.On this basis some  40 million of the total cost of  60 million couldbe offset by contributions; the proportion borne by the exchequer would be about  10 million; and the balance of about  10 million would be met from the National Insurance Fund. The cost of paying the discretionary  4 bonus already agreed for recipients of national assistance, together with the cost of increasing National Assistancerates from 25th January, would be no greater than the original estimate of the cost of granting the  4 bonus, namely,  6 million.If widows were also given three double payments and disablementpensioners one double payment (i.e., pending the increase in theunemployability supplement on 25th January), the cost to theExchequer would be  2 million. The Exchequer would also have tomeet the cost of further special lump sum payments of national assistance, amounting to  1 million. Thus, the total cost to theExchequer of advance payments in respect of all categories of national insurance and National Assistance beneficiaries, after taking accountof an earlier increase in National Insurance contributions than hadbeen expected, would be about  13 million. By contrast, if the increasein National Insurance benefit was not accelerated, the exchequer would still have to pay  6 million by way of the discretionary bonusto recipients of National Assistance, together with an additional 10^ million if the National Assistance scales were to be improvedon 25th January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet hadalready approved additional expenditure of  18 million in 1964-65in respect of the discretionary National Assistance bonus, the earlierintroduction of short-term benefits and the advancement of the date for the abolition of the widows&apos; earnings rule. In the present economic circumstances there were the strongest objections to imposing on theExchequer, in addition, the cost of the proposals which had beenoutlined by the Minister of Pensions.In discussion it was suggested that the Government would attractmore criticism than credit by introducing a scheme of advance
The Cabinet Agreed that, with the exception of the concessions already agreed and indicated in paragraph 5 of C. (64) 19, theintroduction of increased National Insurance benefits and improved National Assistance scales should not take effect until 29th March, 1965.secret --4 a 3payments which might, by its nature, produce inequitable anomalies.Moreover, they had already effected very significant improvements in social benefits since assuming office less than six weeks earlier,particularly by authorising an increase in National Insurance benefits which was greater than was required by the rise in average earnings and the Retail Price Index since the last improvement. This should suffice to hold the position while they prepared further improvements in benefits, particularly the Income Guarantee scheme. In any eventa large number of retirement pensioners were not in acute financial difficulties; and, if it was judged that the remainder genuinely neededadditional relief before the end of March 1965 it would be preferable to bring forward the date for improving National Assistance paymentsthan to make advance payments of the new National insurance benefits.On the other hand the additional measures which had alreadybeen agreed, particularly the discretionary National Assistance bonus,had evoked considerable criticism in view of the anomalies whichthey had created, especially in relation to retirement pensioners whowere not eligible for National Assistance; and it might be desirableto try to allay this criticism to some extent by advancing, at leastby a few weeks, the date on which the improved National insurance benefits would be payable. Moreover, there was now a general expectation that payment of these benefits would in fact be accelerated; and there would be widespread disappointment andcriticism if, after all, the Government decided to adhere to 29th March,1965, as the effective date. It would also be difficult to conceal thefact that the National Assistance Board would think it right to increasethe scales for assistance from 25th January, 1965.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in seeking to strike a balance between these conflicting considerations,the Cabinet should have due regard to the change in our economic circumstances which had taken place since their earlier discussionof the questions at issue, as evidenced by the sharp increase in bank rate on the previous day. Rightly or wrongly, foreign holders of sterling would be considerably influenced by the extent to whichthey felt confidence in the Governments economic policies as a whole and by the Governments firmness in adhering to decisions once taken.It was no less relevant that an exhaustive examination had revealedno means of overcoming the administrative difficulties in the way ofadvancing the date of payment of the increased benefits without therisk of creating indefensible anomalies. For these reasons it appearedinevitable that the Cabinets earlier decision should stand.
2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the increaseof 2 per cent in Bank Rate which had been made on the previous day had been rendered inevitable by the increasing strain to whichsterling had been subjected during the preceding week. The need for action had not become fully apparent until the week-end; and, since it had then emerged that the increase should preferably take effect at the opening of business on the morning of Monday, 23rd November,there had been no opportunity to inform the Cabinet collectively ofwhat was proposed. But those members of the Cabinet who had attended the Ministerial discussions on defence and foreign policy at chequers during the week-end had been consulted and had endorsed the proposed increase.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the immediate effectof the increase appeared to have been salutary but that it would remainimportant to convince oversea holders of sterling that theGovernments long-term economic policies were sound. From thispoint of view it was unfortunate that action which we had had totake in an attempt to repel an external threat to sterling in the shortterm would be liable to exert a disinflationary influence on the domestic economy and to that extent would appear to be inconsistent with the Governments view that such reduction of internal demandas was required should be sufficiently achieved by the recentlyimposed import surcharges and increases in taxation. Nevertheless,it was essential that we should sustain the strength of sterling untilthe import surcharges had had an opportunity to exert their full effect; and for this purpose an increase in Bank Rate had been shown to be essential.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Onthe other hand the disinflationary implications of the increase wouldbe liable to make it more difficult to reach agreement with the tradeunions on an effective incomes policy. In addition, they would notbe easily reconciled with the Governments declared intention toensure the continued provision of finance on favourable terms for social purposes, particularly housing. Any systematic attempt tointroduce differential interest rates, however, would be liable to imposeheavy additional demands on the Exchequer; and it would be preferable to defer for as long as possible any decision about therates to be charged by the Public Works Loan Board to localauthorities, since there might be alternative means of easing the impact of the increase in Bank Rate on the cost of local authority housing. It would also be desirable to seek to dissociate theGovernments long-term policy in relation to advances by building societies, which might well require legislative sanction, from any changes in the interest rate for those advances which might be requiredin the short term by the increase in Bank Rate.The Cabinet Took note of the recent increase in Bank Rate and of thepoints made in their discussion.EconomicSituation
CC. 10 (64)european free trade association(previous reference:CC. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Ministerial Meeting ofthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in the previous weekhad provided convincing evidence of the shock which our unilateraldecision to introduce import surcharges had inflicted on both officialopinion and popular sentiment in the other member countries of theAssociation. It had appeared at one point during the meeting thatthe other members might well invoke Article 31 of the Treaty, whichwould enable them to adopt retaliatory measures against us; andit was only with considerable difficulty that we had avoided this risk.The disintegration of the Association would be gravely damaging to our interests, not least because it would also endanger any prospectof our negotiating a closer relationship with the European economic community if we wished to do so; and it had therefore been essentialto devise some means of allaying the criticisms which the other member countries of the Association had expressed and of renewingthe cohesion of the Association itself. For this purpose we had been obliged to undertake to begin to reduce or to abolish the importsurcharges in a matter of months. Formally, this allowed usconsiderable latitude; but it was clear that, in fact, we should beexpected to make some degree of reduction in the surcharges by thetime of the next Ministerial meeting (which had only with difficultybeen postponed to February 1965); and if, at that point, we were unable even to offer the prospect of a reduction in the near future,the Association might well be finally disrupted.The President of the Board of Trade endorsed the foreign secretary&apos;s assessment of the situation and said that, at the minimum,it would probably be necessary for us to undertake, at the Februarymeeting, to make some reduction in the surcharges by not later thanJune.In discussion it was suggested that the resentment of the other member countries of EFTA had probably been prompted less bythe technical breach of the Treaty which was implicit in our unilateralimposition of the import surcharges than by their concern about the impact of the surcharges on their export trade. But this was inevitableif we were to rectify our balance of payments; and any prematurereduction of the surcharges would therefore recreate the problem byre-admitting imports which would have been merely deferred ratherthan eliminated. On the other hand it was politically essential tomaintain EFTA as an effective organisation; and we should thereforebe prepared at least to consider by the end of February the possibilityof making some reduction in the surcharges shortly thereafter as a means of testing the market. If this showed that it would probablybe necessary to retain some form of import restriction for a moreprolonged period, it would be desirable to consider substitutingimport quotas for the surcharges.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasnot necessary to seek decisions on these questions at the present justice; but the Cabinet should keep the matter under close review
and should give further consideration to the issues involved beforethe February meeting of the EFTA Council.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe President of the Board of Trade.(2) Agreed to give further consideration to the level of importsurcharges and related issues before the meeting of theCouncil of the European Free Trade Association inFebruary 1965.buccaneer aircraft(previous reference:C.C. (64) 8thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had agreed to defer a decision on the export of the 16 Buccaneer aircraft which werebeing manufactured for the South African Government, pending further consideration of our own requirement for aircraft of this type.A subsequent review of defence policy had established that therewas no United Kingdom requirement for the 16 aircraft in question;nor were there any acceptable foreign purchasers. To cancel the contract would therefore involve the loss of an export order worth 25 million and might also involve us in a liability to pay compensation to the South African Government at least to the extent of the 11-5 million which they had already disbursed. In addition it might precipitate a serious problem of redundant labour at the factoryconcerned. To allow the contract to be completed, however, wouldbe in line with the policy which the Cabinet had already approved in relation to the supply of other weapons to South Africa, namely that new orders should be refused but that existing commitmentsshould be fulfilled. It would be implicit in this decision that the exportof spare parts for these aircraft should also be permitted.African opinion would probably understand, and at leastacquiesce in, a decision in this sense. Any adverse reaction by theSouth African Government to a limited concession of this kind wouldnot necessarily be serious if it were confined to the simonstown agreement, since the value of this Agreement had already beenreduced by the statement by the Prime Minister of South Africa,Dr. Verwoerd, that it could be cancelled unilaterally by the SouthAfrican Government. In that event we should have to face the costof reproviding the Simonstown facilities, if we judged it necessaryto do so. Our interests might be more seriously jeopardised, however,if the South African Government decided to cancel the air stagingand overflying rights on which we relied for access to the high commission territories. These territories were also dependent on other forms of co-operation by South Africa, particularly in the economicfield, which might similarly be put at risk.
In discussion there was general agreement that the export of the16 aircraft should be permitted in accordance with the contract. Inaddition the following points were made:(a) The South African Government might decline to accept our decision unless they were allowed to order a further 16 buccaneer aircraft which they were known to be contemplating, on the groundthat the force in question should be uniform, not composite. But nocontract for the additional aircraft had yet been signed; and it didnot appear that the South African Government had any legalentitlement to break the existing contract if they were not allowedto acquire the full 32 aircraft. This assumption, however, should be confirmed.(b) An agreement to permit the export of spare parts for the limited number of aircraft to be delivered, on the ground that thesupply of a reasonable quantity of spare parts was implicit in the contract for the manufacture of the aircraft themselves, might lead the South African Government to claim a corresponding right to thesupply of spare parts for naval equipment of United Kingdommanufacture, whereas the Cabinefs earlier view had been that suchspare parts should be supplied only to the extent to which they werespecifically envisaged in the contracts in question. Any claim of thiskind would have to be considered on its merits and in the light ofthe United Nations&apos; resolution on the supply of spare parts to SouthAfrica.(c) A refusal to permit the export of the further 16 aircraft wouldnot endanger employment in the factory concerned. Existing ordersfor Buccaneer aircraft would ensure the continuation of productionuntil 1968; and the Royal Air Force might have a further requirementextending beyond that date.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the export of the 16 Buccaneer aircraft for whichthe South African Government had signed a contractshould be permitted and that this authority shouldcomprise, in addition, the necessary spare parts.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General, to give further consideration to thepossibility that the South African Government wouldhave grounds of action, possibly extending to the cancellation of the contract, if they were not allowed to contract for the purchase of a further 16 buccaneer aircraft.(3) Subject to the action to be taken under Conclusion (2) above,invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the South african government immediately of the decision recorded atConclusion (1) above.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce thisdecision in the House of Commons on the following day.
5. The First Secretary of State said that the MinisterialEconomic Development Committee had now considered the Cabinefssuggestion that an inquiry should be arranged into the most effective means of reducing congestion in the docks. They had reached theconclusion that an independent investigation would be liable to be misunderstood, and perhaps resented, by labour in the docks; andthey had therefore recommended that the review should be entrusted to an interdepartmental committee of officials.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Labourand other Ministers concerned, to arrange for an interdepartmental committee to be established in order to investigate the most effective means of reducing congestion in the docks.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th November, 1964.Docks(previous reference:C.C.
