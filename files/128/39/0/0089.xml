OverseaAffairsFranceBechuanalandThe Cabinet Took note of these statements.Leasehold 2.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord PresidentReform of the Council (C (65) 184), the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-Generaland the Solicitor-General (C (65) 185) and the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (65) 186) on leasehold reform.The Lord President recalled that the Labour Party election manifesto had pledged the Government to &quot; change leasehold law to enable householders with an original lease of more than 21 years to buy their own houses on fair terms &quot;. In order to implement the pledge it was necessary to find means of enabling a leaseholder toenfranchise on terms which did not involve paying for the house,which in social equity already belonged to him. The ministerial committee which had considered the problem under his chairmanshiphad accordingly attempted to divorce the value of the house fromthat of the land. The proposals put forward by the majority of theCommittee would give to the leaseholder who acquired the leasewhen it had more than 21 years to run, and had occupied the house for three years, the right to an extension of the lease to 999 years ata modernised ground rent, and the right to enfranchise at the market value of the freeholder^ interest reduced by the extension. Aleaseholder who bought the lease with 21 years or less to run wouldhave the right to enfranchise, but not to an extension of the lease. Thefreeholder would have the right to resist enfranchisement orextension on the ground that he wanted to occupy the property andwould suffer greater hardship than would the leaseholder by inability1. The Foreign Secretary recalled that after the first ballot forthe election of the President of France he had informed the Cabinetthat, while the immediate outcome might be to increase our owndifficulties in relations with France, in the longer term the outcomemight be favourable to us. The reactions to the election of president de Gaulle on the second ballot with a majority of 55 per cent seemed likely to bear out this forecast. It might well be that the european economic Community would also experience greater difficulties with france in consequence. It seemed probable however that afterPresident de Gaulle ceased to hold office the authority of the FrenchParliament would be increased. Indeed it might well be that an assembly with a majority hostile to General de Gaulle would be elected in 1967.The Colonial Secretary said that the agreement of the PrimeMinister of Bechuanaland had now been obtained to the admissionof United Kingdom troops in uniform in order to guard the BBCtransmitter at Francistown. The Ministry of Defence were being so informed in order that the move of troops might begin immediately.
to do so. He would be entitled to have the ground rent brought up to date on the extension of the lease, and thereafter every 30 years,and to redevelop during the extension on buying out the leaseholdersinterest. The scheme would apply to houses with a rateable value ofnot more than  400 in London and  200 in the provinces, and to future as well as to existing leases. It would have the advantage of enabling the leaseholder to enfranchise at a price not including thevalue of the house, to obtain a saleable asset; and, if he could not afford to enfranchise, to enjoy security of tenure at a ground rent.Some members of the Committee, however, were critical of the999-year extension of the lease on the grounds that it would effect a drastic transfer of value from the freeholder to the leaseholder;benefit in particular the leaseholder who did not wish to remain inoccupation and could realise his gain in cash; increase the cost ofredevelopment; and make leasehold so unattractive as an investmentthat as a means of providing owner-occupied housing it might notsurvive.A particular problem arose on the application of the scheme to public authorities. Although the point was not mentioned in the manifesto, a number of Labour Party candidates had undertaken,on the basis of official Party guidance, that enfranchisement would apply against local authorities, and it was arguable that, since theeffect of the existing system was equally unjust whether thefreeholder was a private individual or a public authority, and some local authorities holding scattered freeholds as investments wereindistinguishable from a private landlord, it would be impossible tojustify excluding local authorities from the scheme. On the otherhand, their inclusion would have serious consequences for theGovernment^ policy on land and housing. Some solution might perhaps be found by drawing a distinction between leaseholds owned by local authorities purely as investment and those purchased witha view to redevelopment or provided by the authority on managedestates.If the Cabinet. considered that the proposals outlined inC (65) 184 went too far, there were possible alternatives, which would preserve the principle of enfranchisement and would either give anextension of the lease for only 21 or 50 years, or give no fixedextension but enable the leaseholder to remain as a statutory tenantat the end of the original lease at either a modernised ground rentor a rack rent, according to the length of the lease he had purchased.Proposals on these lines might reduce the undoubted political difficulty of securing the passage of a measure which could berepresented as confiscatory. It might not be possible to secure aSecond Reading of the Bill until the Land Commission Bill had completed its Committee Stage in the House of Commons, perhaps in May, but it might be desirable to publish the Bill before Easterand to indicate the Governmenfs intentions in a White Paperpublished in the New Year.The Lord Chancellor said that the proposed scheme went beyondthe Governmenfs commitments and, because of its confiscatory effect,
CC 73 (65)would be open to strenuous opposition. It was not disputed that theoriginal freeholder had little or no equitable claim to the reversionof the house, but the proprietary interests would normally have changed hands since the original bargain was struck, and theproposals would apply to persons who had bought their interests at prices reflecting the freeholder^ right to the reversion of the house.As the Annex to C (65) 184 indicated, when the lease was near itsend and the site had high development value, the benefit conferred on the leaseholder would be considerable. A freeholder who had recently bought the reversion at a high price for redevelopment would find a great deal of what he had paid for transferred to the leaseholder.The incidence of gain or loss would be arbitrary and fortuitous, andsome of those who would suffer, for example, charities, the universities and the Church Commissioners, could enlist influential support. Itwould be hard to justify in principle expropriating one privateindividual for the benefit of another without compensation when itwas the practice for a public authority requiring property in theinterests of the community to compensate the owner at market value.The extension of the lease for any fixed period was not an appropriateway of remedying the acknowledged grievances, since a shortextension would not benefit the leaseholder and a longer one. even of 21 or 50 years, would have much the same effect upon values as a999-year extension. There were, however, other means of reducingmarket value for the purpose of enfranchisement,, and arrangements could be made for the leaseholder to pay the capital sum over aperiod. Further consideration should be given to these possibilitiesand to the alternative scheme B in paragraph 10 of C (65) 184.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, as  minister responsible for housing, he was anxious that neitherenfranchisement nor the extension of the lease to 999 years should apply against local authorities or in new towns. Leasehold was a valuable form of public ownership which made it possible to extendowner-occupation while keeping the ownership of land in publichands. It facilitated comprehensive redevelopment and the propermanagement of estates, and was the basis of the growth of housing associations which the Government were concerned to encourage. Ascheme which virtually confiscated the rights of the landowner wouldmean the loss of these benefits. It would be possible to justify a distinction between public and private landowners, though probably not to distinguish between freeholds held by local authorities for different purposes; but the 999-year extension, which was the basicdifficulty in the proposed scheme, was not necessary for the purposes which the Government sought to achieve. It would be feasible toprovide for enfranchisement on acceptable terms without prejudicing the public ownership of land or leasehold development for owner-occupation by applying the concept of the &quot; fair rent &quot; embodied inthe Rent Acts to the assessment of a fair market value to be paid onenfranchisement. This might be the market value excluding the valuedue to scarcity and to the maintenance or improvement of the houseby the leaseholder and his predecessors.
In discussion there was general agreement that provision mustbe made for enfranchisement at a price which the leaseholder couldbe expected to pay: enfranchisement at market value would not beaccepted by the Governments supporters. The means provided for reducing the price of enfranchisement must, however, have regardnot only to the strong political feeling on the subject, but also toconsiderations of equity. The 999-year extension, though attractiveas a matter of presentation and against the background of thepractice of new towns and of some private landlords, was too extremein its effects and was not essential to achieve the desired objective.Other means of reducing the price below the market value should accordingly be sought. The solution must have regard to the moderate, though rising, amounts charged in recent years by landlordsin Wales, and to the need to give security of tenure, whether by anextension for a shorter period than 999 years or otherwise, toleaseholders who would have retired by the time their leases expiredand would be unable to pay either a substantial capital sum or amuch enhanced ground rent. The price might be based on the capital value in modern terms of the existing ground rent, as was the practice in Wales, or, alternatively (since a calculation depending on bringing the ground rent up to date would reflect capricious variations in theoriginal ground rent) leaseholders might be given a freehold subjectto a rent charge which could be redeemed at a stated number of yearspurchase. A useful precedent might be found in the Scottish systemof enfranchisement which in effect reduced the amount of the capitalpayment by providing for a continuing payment similar to a rentcharge. Further consideration should be given to the extension ofthe lease to 29 years, or to such period as would cover the life of theexisting house; but, if satisfactory means of securing a suitable price for enfranchisement could be found, it might be unnecessary toprovide for any extension of the lease, since the leaseholder could obtain security by exercising his right to enfranchise. It would bedesirable in principle to apply any new proposals against localauthorities, but whether it would be practicable to do so would depend on the nature of the proposals and their probable effect onthe leasehold system.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that provision must be made for occupyingleaseholders to enfranchise at something less than the market valueof the freeholder^ interest, but they considered the 999-year extensionof the lease an unnecessarily drastic means of reducing market value.The Ministerial Committee should therefore examine, in the light oftheir discussion and in particular of the need to give security and stability to the leaseholder who had occupied his house for aconsiderable number of years, the desirability of providing for a shorter extension of the lease and the means of assessing a fair price for enfranchisement. The scheme should, if possible, apply againstlocal authorities but a decision on this must await consideration ofnew proposals. It was essential that a Bill should be introduced duringthe present Session, but the timing of its introduction would have tobe considered in the light of the progress of other major measures.
Prices andIncomesPolicy(previous reference:CC (65) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2)scottish teachers&apos;Salaries3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C (65) 182) and by the First Secretary of Stateand Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (65) 187) on the salaries of Scottish teachers.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that English, Welsh and scottish teachers had all received salary increases in April 1963, theEnglish and Welsh teachers just under 7 per cent to last for two yearsand the Scottish teachers 10 per cent to last for three years. Englishteachers had received a further increase of 13 per cent from 1st April,1965, to last for two years. The negotiating body on Scottish teachers&apos;salaries had agreed recommendations for an increase of 15 per cent for Scottish teachers from 1st April, 1966, to last for two years.Scottish teachers&apos; salaries were regulated by orders made by theSecretary of State. Regulations had to be published in draft and40 days allowed for representation; after an Order was laid, therewas a further period of 40 days during which Members of parliament could pray against it. An increase of 15 per cent was necessary inorder to bring Scottish teachers up to a level comparable with Englishteachers and to make good the extent to which their salaries had fallenshort of those of English teachers over the last three years. Moreover,there was a shortage of teachers in Scotland. If he did not accept the negotiating body&apos;s recommendations, there would be a considerablevolume of protest, including strikes by Scottish teachers as well asprayers in Parliament. The proposal that the matter should bereferred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI), withan interim increase in the meanwhile, was not attractive since thiswould make necessary two separate sets of regulations and woulddouble the number of opportunities for protest and parliamentary discussion.The First Secretary of State said that he would be prepared toagree that, following the precedent set by the English teachers,Scottish teachers should receive an increase of 13 per cent, to last for two years; this would in his view do substantial justice to the claims of the Scottish teachers, though it would have presentationaldifficulties for the Government. There was no doubt that the increaseCC 73 (65)A White Paper should be published in the meanwhile, and it wouldbe convenient if the Ministerial Committee could bring further proposals before the Cabinet shortly after the Recess.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Legislation on Rent, land commission and Leasehold Enfranchisement to consider urgently further proposals for leasehold enfranchisement onthe basis indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing upof their discussion.
of 13 per cent for English teachers earlier in the year had prejudicedthe Governmenfs efforts to achieve the objectives of prices and incomes policy. He would not wish to press the proposal for a reference to the NBPI in the face of the objections of the Secretaryof State for Scotland, but there were grave objections to an increaseof 15 per cent at this point.In discussion the following points were made:(a) At a time when the average rise in industrial earnings was runnin at an annual rate of 8 to 9 per cent, to ask the scottish teachers to accept 13 per cent to last for two years would mean thatthey would be getting significantly smaller increases than other groups. This would not only be unfair to Scottish teachers but alsotend to discourage other staff associations and unions from entering into long-term settlements. On the other hand it was argued that thevalue of long-term settlements was questionable in the context ofthe prices and incomes policy. After the NBPI had reported on the references on the pay of the Armed Forces and the Higher CivilService, and after the payment of the last instalment due under thecurrent long-term agreement for the non-industrial Civil Service,there would therefore be advantage in having a re-examination of future arrangements for public service pay, which should include areassessment of the advantages and disadvantages of long-termsettlements in the public sector.(b) The fact that English teachers&apos; and Scottish teachers&apos; salariesfell for review at different dates increased opportunities for&quot; leap-frogging&quot;, and it would be desirable to arrive at anarrangement whereby in future the salaries of the two groups of teachers moved in step. The salaries of English teachers were due fortheir next review on 1st April, 1967. One possibility might be to reach a one-year settlement for Scottish teachers, which would make it possible for the salaries of English teachers and Scottish teachers tobe reviewed simultaneously early in 1967, with a view to keepingthem level thereafter. But a one-year settlement designed to bringthe Scottish teachers to something like parity with English teacherswould not be less than 10 per cent and might be 13 per cent or more;and a settlement as high as this to last for only one year would createserious difficulties of presentation in relation to the prices and incomes policy.(c) Another possibility might be to refer the issue to the NBPIfor a quick decision on the amount of the increase required at1st April, 1966, to bring the Scottish teachers to a point where their salaries could be reviewed at the same time as the salaries of Englishteachers in 1967. In view of the statutory proceedings with whichthe Secretary of State for Scotland was required to comply, thiswould mean asking the Board for a report by early February. It was,however, questionable whether so circumscribed a reference shouldbe put to the Board; it would be preferable to ask them to considera general reference covering the position of teachers on both sides of the Border. If it were merely a question of deciding the right figure to bring the Scottish teachers into line with the English teachers,
this could well be determined by the Ministers mainly concerned. Onthe other hand the discussion had shown that this problem involved a number of difficult issues on which it might well be useful to havea ruling by the Board.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould not be generally satisfactory to accept the 15 per cent increaserecommended or to make a settlement for one year only, or to make an immediate reference to the NBPI. In these circumstances the most acceptable course might be to increase the salaries of Scottish teachersby 13 per cent from April 1966, the new salaries to stand for twoyears, and to ask the Board to consider whether this increase putScottish teachers in a fair relationship with English teachers; if not,what further adjustment was required to achieve that objective; and what arrangements should be made to ensure that in future the salaries of English and Scottish teachers came up for reviewsimultaneously, in order to minimise the risk of &quot; leap-frogging &quot;.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to make regulations to increase the salaries of Scottish teachers byan average of 13 per cent from 1st April, 1966.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Secretary of State for Education and science, to determine the terms of a reference to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd December, 1965.
