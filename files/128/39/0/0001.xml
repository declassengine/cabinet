9 AEconomic 2.   The  First Secretory  of State  said  that  the  economicSiiuation situation was serious. It appeared to have been deteriorating forsome time; and there was a prospect of a large and continuingdeficit on the balance of payments. There was no question ofa financial crisis in view of the reserves and borrowing rights at our disposal. Nevertheless, immediate remedies were required.First, it was necessary to deal with a situation in which imports were too high and exports were not rising sufficiently fast.It was easier to restrict imports than stimulate exports; butaction for both purposes should be planned simultaneously inorder that the Government might be seen to be not merelyrelying on measures of restraint but also taking positive stepsto maintain and increase economic growth. Balanced proposals were therefore being worked out and would be circulated for ministerial consideration in the near future. In the longer termadditional measures would be required in order to make fundamental changes in the direction of the economy and to rectify a positionin which an excessive proportion of our resources was being usedSECRET5375-1 a :C.C. 1 (64)Procedure 1.   The Prime Minister congratulated his colleagues on theirsuccess in the recent General Election and welcomed them as members of his new Administration. He invited their attention tothe Note on Questions of Procedure for Ministers (C. (64) 1), whichhe had circulated that day, and asked them to be guided by it. Inthe conduct of public business it was particularly important thatas many issues as possible should be settled by direct dealing betweenthe Ministers concerned; that questions requiring collectiveconsideration should initially be referred, whenever possible, to theappropriate Committee; and that only the most important or urgent matters should be submitted to Cabinet, and then only with adequatenotice, save in an emergency. These principles, however, should be balanced against the need to ensure full collective endorsement ofany major decision of policy; and it would be incumbent uponMinisters, both individually and collectively, to satisfy themselves that any major decision which they proposed to take would command the support of the Government as a whole.In addition, the mutual trust which was the foundation of collective responsibility depended largely on the ability of aGovernment to safeguard the private nature of their deliberations;and it was important that all Ministers should bear this factconstantly in mind. Until the new Government had taken stock oftheir position and of the problems which confronted them it wouldbe desirable that Ministers should refrain, so far as possible, from public statements, interviews with the Press, appearances on television and so forth.In accordance with the accepted convention the papers of conservative Cabinets and Cabinet Committees had been withdrawn to the Cabinet Office; and Ministers would understand that, except where commitments to third parties required some degree ofcontinuity of policy, these papers, together with the correspondingdepartmental records, would not be available to them. In all other respects, however, the services of the Cabinet Office would be whollyat their disposal.Ministers in charge of Departments should give particularthought to the functions which might most suitably be discharged by their junior Ministers. Practice would necessarily vary from one department to another, in the light of circumstances; but it was desirable in principle that the fullest use should be made of theservices of junior Ministers and that they should be kept ascontinuously as possible in touch with issues submitted for decisionto the Heads of their Departments.
on non-remunerative projects for purposes of defence or nationalprestige. This would require the co-operation of the large spendingDepartments; and the industrial dislocation which would inevitablyresult would need to be mitigated by appropriate measures, includingthe early implementation of the Governments proposals in relationto severance pay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the short-term problem of financing the current deficit on the balance of payments should be capable of being resolved by recourse to the facilities which other Central Banks would place at our disposal. In the longer term we might need to invoke our right to draw on theInternational Monetary Fund. But the willingness of other countries and international institutions to lend us money would necessarily depend on the energy and resolution with which we were seen to betackling the problem of redressing the balance of the economy.In this connection it was very relevant that, even on the assumption of an annual increase of 4 per cent in the Gross National Product, itwas doubtful whether the public spending programmes which theGovernment had inherited from their Conservative predecessorscould be financed on the existing basis of taxation. If theGovernments own proposals were now to be superimposed, it wouldbe essential that other items of expenditure should be reduced oreliminated. Departments would shortly be asked to submit their1965-66 Estimates to the Treasury; and, in so far as they includedprovision for new policy proposals, these should be indicatedseparately from the commitments incurred by the conservative administration. It would then be possible for the Government toestablish rational priorities and to begin to reduce the pressureimposed on our resources by projects of little economic value.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be important to give as high a priority as possibleto proposals for expenditure on social services, which constitutedtransfer payments rather than fresh claims on national resources.(b) It would be difficult to submit proposals for expenditure by the new Ministry of Technology until the area of its activitieshad been defined; but its claims should not be prejudiced on that account.(c) All Departments concerned would be consulted on themeasures affecting them in relation both to public expenditure andto the redistribution of resources in the longer term.(d) A revision of the arbitration machinery might prove to bea desirable element in measures designed to reduce temporaryindustrial dislocation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be necessary to inform the country of the economic position at an early date but that a statement for this purpose must be accompanied by proposals for adequate counter measures. Theseproposals should not be deflationary in emphasis but should bedirected to restoring the country&apos;s competitive strength and promoting expansion on a selective and orderly basis. When theywere ready they would be submitted to the Cabinet for approval;and they would then be embodied in a public statement by theGovernment, which could be followed by, or perhaps coincide with,discussions with the Trades Union Congress, the Federation ofBritish Industries and related organisations. Meanwhile, it was desirable that Ministers should not make individual statementsabout the current situation or the measures which the Governmenthad in mind for dealing with it.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister and ofthe points made in this discussion.
Mineral Rights 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by thein Northern Commonwealth Secretary (C. (64) 2) about the mineral rightsRhodesia       owned by the British South Africa Company (Chartered) inNorthern Rhodesia, to which was annexed a historical summaryof the problem.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Northern rhodesia government claimed that the Chartered Company&apos;s title to therights in question was invalid and that the United KingdomC.C. 1 (64)Southern 3.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that they mightRhodesia soori be required to confront major decisions of policy in relationto Southern Rhodesia. He had himself discussed the issues involved with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith,during the latter&apos;s recent visit to London for negotiations with theConservative Government; but he had refrained from giving any commitment about the attitude of the Labour Party, if they came into power.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, on the conclusion ofthe discussions with the United Kingdom Government to which thePrime Minister had referred, an agreed communique had beenissued stating, among other things, that independence for SouthernRhodesia must be based on the general consent of the populationof the Territory and that the United Kingdom Government were entitled to be consulted about the means by which this consentwas to be obtained. On the day of the General Election Mr. smith had informed the Conservative Government that he had arranged to convene a meeting with the African Chiefs in the very neat-future in order to ascertain whether independence on the basis ofthe present Constitution would be acceptable to African opinion.He had invited the United Kingdom Government to send observersto that meeting. The Conservative Government had replied thatthis procedure was not in accordance with the understanding whichthey had reached with Mr. Smith and was not acceptable to them.He had now informed Mr. Smith that the new Government took the same view as their predecessors on this issue. Since he proposedto visit Northern Rhodesia in the following week in order torepresent the United Kingdom Government at the independencecelebrations, it might be appropriate that he should thereafterproceed to Southern Rhodesia in order to make wholly clear to thelocal Government not only the conditions on which Her Majesty&apos;snew Ministers considered that Southern Rhodesia might obtain her independence but also the probable reactions of the United KingdomGovernment to a unilateral declaration of independence. But hecould only express a willingness to meet Mr. Smith for this purposeprovided that it was agreed that he should also discuss the situation with the leaders of the main political Parties, Mr. Nkomo and theReverend Sithole, who were at present in political detention.The Prime Minister suggested that the Defence and overseas policy Committee might give further consideration to the issues involved before the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s departure forZambia.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretaryabout Southern Rhodesia.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the issues involved to be further considered by the ministers concerned.
Government had acted wrongly in the past by recognising it. they therefore argued that the United Kingdom Government were solely responsible for compensating the Company when the rights wereextinguished; and, if no settlement were reached before the Territorybecame independent at the end of the week, they intendedsubsequently to expropriate the Company without compensation.If agreement were not reached and the Northern rhodesia government expropriated the Company, this would have serious consequences for relations between the two countries. It would alsobe liable to damage the Territory&apos;s international credit, particularly with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.Finally, it might lead to further measures of expropriation by theGovernment of Northern Rhodesia, which could endanger UnitedKingdom supplies of copper. It was therefore highly desirable thata settlement should be reached.There were objections in principle to any payment by theUnited Kingdom Treasury of compensation to a United Kingdomcompany expropriated by another Government. On the other hand it could be argued that the case of the Chartered Company wasunique and would not constitute a precedent. Moreover, any UnitedKingdom contribution to a settlement could be arranged in such away that there would be no direct payment by the United kingdom to the Company. Although the Government of Northern Rhodesiadenied any responsibility, they were prepared to make a &quot; good willcontribution &quot; of  2 million towards a settlement, provided thatwe made at least an equal contribution. The Company&apos;s claim hadbeen successively reduced; and the Company were now prepared toagree a settlement at  8 million. If they could be induced to accepta further reduction to  4 million, it might well be right that weshould match the contribution of  2 million which the Governmentof Northern Rhodesia were prepared to offer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the matter was onewhich the Northern Rhodesia Government should decide for themselves. Once they had taken over the Chartered Company&apos;srights they would be gaining some  7 million a year from theroyalties; and they might be expected to appreciate that it wouldbe in their interest to forgo an initial instalment of these revenuesin order to secure a clear title and to ensure that they would receivethe full royalties without question in the future. There was therefore no case for the United Kingdom Government to contribute to thecompensation of the Company; and the risk of damage to theinternational credit of the Territory if the local Governmentexpropriated the rights should not be exaggerated, particularly sinceNorthern Rhodesia would have less need to invoke that credit onceshe had taken over the royalties.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that the 1950Agreement with the Chartered Company, which had been made bythe previous Labour Government, had provided that the UnitedKingdom Government would ensure, &quot; so far as it is possible to doso &quot;, that, when they ceased to be responsible for Northern Rhodesia,a successor Government would abide by the Agreement. This factormight be relevant to the current decision.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould not be unreasonable that the Government, having only justtaken office, should ask the Government of Northern Rhodesia fora little more time to enable them to reach a decision, particularly since the Commonwealth Secretary would be visiting northern rhodesia at the end of the week and would be able to discuss thematter with the local Government. Meanwhile, the issues involved should be further examined by the Ministers immediately concernedin the light of the Cabinefs discussion.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th October, 1964.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, as a matter of urgency, the legal aspects of the problem of the mineral rights owned by the British South Africa Company(Chartered) in Northern Rhodesia, with particular reference to the 1950 Agreement.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theCommonwealth Secretary, in the light of the lord chancellor&apos;s opinion, to seek to submit proposals for asettlement to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeeon Wednesday, 21st October.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to urge upon theGovernment of Northern Rhodesia the need to allow the United Kingdom Government more time in which toconsider a settlement.
