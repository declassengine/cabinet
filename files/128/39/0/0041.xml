Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Easter Recess.Oversea affairs vietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)FederalGermanRepublic:Berlin(previous reference:CC (65) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CC(65) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of thePeople&apos;s Republic of China had now rejected our suggestion thatMr. Patrick Gordon Walker should visit Peking during his tour ofthe Far East and had also rebuffed our request to the countries concerned for their views on the situation in Vietnam, on the grounds that, since we were not prepared to condemn United Statesretaliation against North Vietnam, we were no longer entitled to beregarded as co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference. They had adopted an equally uncompromising attitude towards an attempt by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to devise a meansof mediation in the Vietnamese dispute. We had replied to theChinese note asking them to reconsider their unconstructive answer;but, even if Mr. Gordon Walker&apos;s tour had to be confined to non-Communist countries, it might nevertheless prove valuable andshould therefore go forward.Meanwhile, the Soviet Government had proposed that aconference should be arranged about Cambodia; and, since this might afford the opportunity for private discussions about Vietnamwith the other interested Governments, the balance of advantageprobably inclined in favour of endorsing this project. It might bepossible for the Prime Minister, during his forthcoming visit to washington, to ascertain whether the United States Governmentwould be prepared to modify the objections to such a conference which they had previously entertained.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Berlin had now returned to normal; and this confirmed our impression that themeasures which the Soviet Government had recently taken to harassthe inhabitants had been no more than a political demonstration in response to the decision of the Federal German Government tohold a meeting of the Bundestag in the city. While it would be disadvantageous to appear to surrender the right of the Bundestagto meet in Berlin, it would be politic that occasions of this kind should be relatively infrequent in future. We had therefore informed the Federal Government that we could not endorse a suggestion thatthe Bundesrat should also meet in Berlin this year; and it seemed probable that the United States and French Governments wouldadopt the same attitude.The Prime Minister said that the situation in Southern Rhodesiaappeared to be deteriorating afresh; and we must now reckon withthe possibility that the Government of the Colony might make a unilateral declaration of independence immediately after theforthcoming general election.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it could be inferred thatthe Prime, Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Smith, had been
unable to carry his Party with him in pursuing certain tentativeproposals for a settlement which he had initiated in private discussionwith the Lord Chancellor and himself before they left SouthernRhodesia at the end of their recent mission. The United kingdom high Commissioner in Salisbury had been instructed to seek urgentclarification of Mr. Smith&apos;s intentions.In discussion it was suggested that after the forthcoming electionthe moderate and extremist elements in the Rhodesia Front Partymight still fail to reach agreement on the policy to be pursued; andit should not be assumed, therefore, that Mr. Smith had yetabandoned his proposals. Meanwhile, however, it would be necessaryto review the measures which we should take if the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia made a unilateral declaration of independence in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for afurther review of the measures to be taken if theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia made a unilateral declaration of independence in the near future.BBC Finance 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C (65) 61) on the finances of the British broadcasting corporation (BBC).The Postmaster-General said that, as a result of decisions takenby the previous Government, the BBC had expanded their services.But no financial provision had been made to cover this expansion:and the Corporation had consequently incurred a deficit which was increasing at the rate of about  300,000 a week. The ministerial committee on Broadcasting had therefore examined a proposal bythe BBC that the combined television and sound licence fee shouldbe increased from  4 to  6 and the sound only fee from  1 to  1 5s.The Committee had felt, however, that such a large increase wouldbe generally resented and might also be regarded as incompatible withthe Governments policy as regards prices and incomes. They had therefore recommended that the increase in the combined licenceshould be limited to  5 (and to  1 5s. for the sound licence). Inaddition, however, the Corporation should be required to exercisecertain economies, particularly by deferring work on colour television; but the planned expansion of the coverage of BBC 2 neednot be affected. By these means the BBCs deficit could be containedfor a year or two; and, meanwhile, there should be a comprehensive review of their finances and development plans. Such a review wasthe more necessary because the Corporation could not depend in thefuture, as in the past, on an annual increase in the number of viewersto provide increased licence revenue: it was estimated that, whateverincrease in licence fees might be made on the present occasion, ifthe present system continued unchanged the licence fee would
shortly have to rise by 10s. a year to cover the BBCs expenditure.The proposed review would therefore examine alternative means by which the Corporation might obtain additional revenue, includingthe possibility of including some measure of advertisement in their programmes; and it would also need to study both the possibilityof countering the evasion of licence fees and the question of imposingsome control on the manner in which the BBC used the resources at their disposal. This would not imply, however, any infringementof the Corporation^ Charter or any attempt to supervise the content of their programmes.In discussion it was agreed that some increase in the licencefees was essential in order to reduce the BBCs deficit. It was proposedthat action might be deferred until the projected review had beencompleted and had established how large an increase in licence feeswould be required. There was, however, general agreement that therate of increase of the deficit was such that an immediate decision was needed. It was also suggested that an increase in the combinedfee to  6, as well as being inconsistent with the Governments policy as regards prices and incomes, would be liable to be particularlyresented in those parts of the country which were not yet fully coveredby BBC transmissions. On the other hand it would be embarrassingif, after a relatively small increase at the present stage, the reviewdemonstrated that a further increase would have to made after ashort interval. The balance of opinion, however, was in favour ofan increase in the combined licence to  5 (and in the sound licence to  1 5s.) as an interim measure, pending the outcome of the review.It was agreed that the inclusion of advertisements in the BBCsprogrammes might yield a substantial additional revenue. But this possibility would raise an important issue of principle in the lightof the Labour Party&apos;s declared policy on commercial television. Onthe other hand, a majority of viewers preferred independent television, which they regarded as a free service, to the BBC forwhich a licence fee had to be paid. Moreover, an arrangement bywhich the BBC would derive some revenue from the display of advertisements need not necessarily imply that they would operate on a commercial basis, as did Independent Television. For example,the proposed fourth channel might be used mainly to give effect tothe Governments proposal for a &quot; University of the Air &quot; but might also be devoted to remunerative advertisement material in periodsnot required for educational broadcasts. The inclusion of advertisements in the Corporation^ Light programme might alsocontribute to solving the problem of the &quot; pirate &quot; radio stations.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Further measures should be considered to deal with evasionof licence fees, which undoubtedly took place on a considerable scale.For example, the owner of a receiver might be made responsible for ensuring that it was licensed; this would place the onus for complying with the licence regulations on the companies which rented receivers.There might also be a requirement that an intending purchaser must
produce a licence before he could buy a receiver. And the BBC shouldbe more active in ensuring that viewers were aware of the licenceregulations.(b) The failure of the recent Vienna Conference on colour television to reach agreement implied that an interval wouldbe unavoidable before further progress could be made in thedevelopment of colour television. In any public statement of theGovernments intentions about the licence fees, therefore, it shouldbe made clear that it was technical difficulties rather than restrictions imposed by the Government which would make it necessary for the bbc to defer work on colour television.(c) It was suggested that the aged and the poor relied mainly on sound broadcasts rather than on television and that the soundlicence fee should therefore remain at  1. On the other hand the vast majority of sound receivers were now transistor equipments, ownedpredominantly by younger people who could well afford to pay a modest increase in the fee.(d) The area covered by BBC 2 was being rapidly expanded.Although an increase in licence fees would be resented in those areasof the country which did not yet receive this programme, it wouldbe impracticable to operate a system of licence fees based on regional differentiation. There were also administrative difficultiesin the way of conceding a reduced rate of licence fee to pensioners.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that there should be an immediate increasein the combined licence fee to  5 and in the sound licence fee to 1 5s. At the same time the proposed review of the BBCs financesand development plans should be put in hand; and its results shouldbe submitted to Ministers during July, together with the outcome of the parallel examination by the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting of the policy issues in connection with the future of educational broadcasting and the associated possibility of financingfuture developments by the inclusion of a certain amount ofadvertisement material in the BBCs programmes.The statement which the Postmaster-General proposed to makein Parliament about the increase in the licence fee should be revised in order to take account of the points made in discussion; and itshould give more emphasis to the positive aspects of theGovernments policy for broadcasting and television.The Cabinet Approved C (65) 61, subject to the points made in discussion and in the Prime Ministers summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,13th April, 1965.
