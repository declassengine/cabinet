OverseaAffairsFranceVietnam(previous reference :CC (65) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that President de Gaulle now seemed likely to stand again for election on the second ballot. It was probable that he would gain a majority of over 60 per cent of the votes cast; and this might go some way to restoring the prestigewhich he had forfeited by his failure to gain election on the firstballot. The immediate outcome might be to increase our owndifficulties in relations with France and, therefore, with the european economic Community, since President de Gaulle might now beexpected to react to the personal rebuff which he had received bypursuing all the more strongly his individualistic policies, which weredetrimental to our interests. In the longer term, however, the outcomemight be in our favour, in so far as the demonstration of a genuinepolitical Opposition in France should make it increasingly difficult for the French Government to pursue a wholly unilateral course.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the SovietGovernment had drafted a joint message which they proposed thatthey and we, as co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, should issueon the hostilities in Vietnam. This draft, which they had publishedbefore we could consider it, was little more than a statement of theextreme Soviet case and indicated, no doubt, the extent to which theSoviet Government were under increasing pressure from the Peoples&apos;Republic of China in relation to their public attitude on Vietnam.He therefore intended to send to the Soviet Government, and to publish, an alternative draft, which would more adequately reflectour own point of view. In the upshot we should seek to agree withthe Soviet authorities a suitable joint message.Rhodesia(previous reference :CC (65) 68thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent proposal of theForeign Ministers of African countries at the meeting of theOrganisation for African Unity (OAU) that diplomatic relations withthe United Kingdom should be broken off if we had not brought the illegal regime in Rhodesia to an end by 15th December might,in respect of the foreign countries concerned, raise particular difficulties for us with the United Arab Republic (UAR). It appeared that at present they felt bound to break off relations in accordancewith the resolution but that they hoped that this would not lead toany exacerbation of feeling between the two countries. It might be helpful in influencing their decision if those commonwealth countries which had doubts about the wisdom of complying with theresolution were to make their views known to the UAR.In discussion there was general agreement that we should notappear to be excessively concerned about the resolution or appearunduly eager to make concessions in order to enable the memberSECRET 3CC 69 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was proposed that Parliament should be adjourned on22nd December for the Christmas Recess and should reassemble on25th January.
countries of the OAU to extricate themselves from the difficulties and embarrassments which they had now created for themselves.On the other hand, it would be inadvisable to threaten retaliatorymeasures, e.g., a suspension of aid, unless they were clearly justifiedin particular circumstances.In further discussion of the Governments longer term objectives in relation to Rhodesia, it was suggested that we should make it clearthat we would have no dealings with the illegal regime and would notbe prepared to make any substantive concessions in negotiation withthem in return for their withdrawal of their illegal declaration of independence. It was agreed that at an appropriate point, when thesituation had developed further, it would be necessary for the Cabinetto give more detailed consideration to these issues.FairfieldsShipyard(previous reference :CC (65) 66thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The First Secretary of State said that following the cabinets decision on 30th November negotiations had been continued with aview to forming a new company with both Government and private capital to acquire the assets of Fairfields, and to take over theoperation of the shipyard, leaving the existing company to go into liquidation. It had been agreed that the assets should be acquiredon the basis of a valuation. The work in progress in the yard hadbeen valued at  800,000 and the fixed assets of the yard at  1-1 million. In addition there were, on the same site, the engineeringworks owned by the subsidiary, Fairfield-Rowan, where the assetshad been valued at  2-6 million. There appeared, however, to be areasonable chance that other buyers could be found for these.Agreement had been reached with Sir Isaac Wolfson on the composition of a new Board of Directors which would includeleading figures from the shipbuilding and shipping industries with aGovernment nominee as Chairman.A major difficulty, however, had now appeared. The Receiverhad believed that he had the power to sell the assets at the best pricehe could obtain for them and to inform the creditors of the companythat he had done so before the liquidation of the company. This wouldhave enabled the new company to take over the shipyard withoutany interruption of work. The Government&apos;s legal advisers, however,had now formed the view that the Receiver did not have the power tosell the assets in advance of the liquidation of the company. Counsefsopinion was being obtained on this point; and further consideration was also being given to the possibility that the formal liquidation of thecompany could be followed almost immediately by the sale of the assets in order that any substantial interruption of work in the yardmight still be avoided. It was not yet certain how far this could beachieved.In addition no firm agreement had yet been reached with SirIsaac Wolfson about the basis of the financial arrangements for thenew company. Sir Isaac Wolfson now seemed to desire that hisparticipation in the finance should consist of loan capital to a largerextent than seemed desirable if the new company were not to beburdened with heavy interest charges. Here again discussion was still continuing. There seemed some possibility that Lord Thomsonof Fleet might consider participation in the venture.
SECRET 5CC 69 (65)In these circumstances it might well be disadvantageous for theGovernment to become sole owner of Fairfields shipyard; and, if no alternative appeared to be practicable, it would be necessary to acquiesce in the closure of the yard. The best solution, however, would still be for the Government to contribute 50 per cent of the capital sum required and for the other 50 per cent to be found by privateenterprise. If, however, it were found that a consortium of private firms was prepared to subscribe the whole of the capital which was needed to ensure the continued operation of Fairfields, this wouldbe an acceptable solution, since the Governments primary concernhad always been to maintain the modernised shipyard in being inthe belief that it would be able to play a useful part in a rationalisedshipbuilding industry on the Clyde. The Governments immediateobjective, therefore, should be to seek to avoid the immediateliquidation of the company and to endeavour to persuade firms withships building in the yard or on order to refrain from withdrawingfor a further week or so while negotiations continued. Meanwhile,discussions with the Trade Unions had succeeded in eliciting from them firm assurances that they would co-operate with the newmanagement in revising the existing methods of working in the shipyard, particularly by agreeing to greater flexibility between thevarious crafts employed.In view of the publicity which had already been given to thepossibility of Government action in relation to Fairfields it mightbe desirable to make a brief interim statement in Parliament that afternoon, which would emphasise that the Government had been concerned with the risk that a modernised yard would be forced to close and that consultations on possible ways of preventing this were continuing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be a mistakefor the Government to acquire the yard without the co-operation ofprivate enterprise or to embark on changes in the management which,despite their other merits, might not be consistent with the long-term objective of promoting a rationalisation of the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde. It might therefore be desirable that the ShippingMortgage Finance Corporation, which was financed by theExchequer and had wide contacts in the shipping industry, should now be invited to pursue the negotiations with private interests onthe Governmenfs behalf.The Minister of Labour said that the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation had represented to him that it was objectionable that oneshipbuilding yard should be accorded preferential treatment by theGovernment in advance of the Report of the Geddes Committee ofEnquiry on Shipbuilding; that, if the labour employed in the shipyardhad to be discharged, it could be absorbed easily in other yards onthe Clyde; and that any suggestion that the new managementenvisaged for Fairfields would be authorised to modify national agreements and practices affecting labour in the shipyard (e.g., by introducing higher wage rates in the hope of obtaining a relaxation of restrictive practices) would be liable to provoke extensiverepercussions elsewhere in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The belief that Government money might be available toassist Fairfields might have encouraged the Bank of Scotland andother creditors to hope that they could escape from the full loss whichthey were likely to incur. If necessary, they should be disabused ofthis idea.ib) It was unfortunate that the Government were largely dependent at this stage on the attitude taken by Sir Isaac Wolfson,who might well see advantage in allowing Fairfields to go into liquidation in order to secure the assets at a low price.(c) There was a danger that any attempt to invoke the good offices of the Shipping Mortgage Finance Corporation in order towiden the search for private capital might involve delays which would lead to the loss of the orders at present held by Fairfields.id) Too much attention should not be paid to the views of the shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, who no doubt feared theintroduction of a new and dynamic management into Fairfields.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the Government shouldcontinue their efforts to avoid the closure of Fairfields. The first secretary of State should take full responsibility for the continuanceof the negotiations. He should discuss with the Chairman of theShipping Mortgage Finance Corporation the possibility of theiracting on behalf of the Government in seeking to make arrangements with private firms to provide either all the capital needed to buy and operate Fairfields shipyard or to enter upon a joint venture with theGovernment. The Cabinet accepted that a final decision could notbe delayed much longer and that it might not be possible to avoid the closure of the yard. It would not be desirable for the Governmentto acquire Fairfields unless a reasonable share in the new enterprisewere taken by private capital; and, if this could not be found beforeorders for the new ships were withdrawn from Fairfields or beforethe skilled labour force was dispersed, the Government would haveto accept closure, however much they might regret it. It would be important, if this happened, to make it clear that the responsibilitylay on the creditors or on the unwillingness of private capital to engage in this enterprise and to show that the Government had doneeverything which they reasonably could in Order to ensure thecontinued operation of the yard and the employment of itsworkpeople. For this reason it would be desirable for the first secretary to make a short statement to the House of Commons toset the matter in perspective. The First Secretary of State and thePresident of the Board of Trade should also discuss the problem with Mr. Geddes.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State, in conjunction with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Secretary of State for Scotland, to continuenegotiations for the formation of a company to take overFairfields shipyard on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.
Training ofJustices ofthe peace in Englandand wales and thePosition of ex oflicioJustices ofthe Peace5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (65) 174) about the training of Justices of the peace in England and Wales and the position of ex officio Justices.The Lord Chancellor said that he proposed to publish on22nd December a White Paper announcing the Governmenfsacceptance of the recommendation of the 1948 Royal Commissionon Justices of the Peace, recently endorsed by the National AdvisoryCouncil on the Training of Magistrates, that Justices should berequired, as a condition of their appointment to the Commission ofthe Peace, to undertake a course of training, the first part to becompleted before they adjudicated and the second within a year of appointment. The training would be organised by Magistrates&apos; CourtsCommittees on the basis of a syllabus prepared by the NationalAdvisory Council. The scheme would not require legislation, andthe additional cost over and above that of existing voluntary trainingschemes would be negligible. The introduction of obligatory trainingwould throw into relief the problem of those who became Justicesby virtue of holding some other office, in particular of mayors andchairmen of County and District Councils. The Royal commission had recommended that the chairmen of Councils should cease to beJustices ex officio, but not mayors, in view of their traditionalresponsibility in the past for keeping the peace. It was clear, however,that only persons selected for their suitability and trained for thepurpose should serve as Justices. Where civic heads were suitablefor selection they could be considered for appointment by normalmethods, but the introduction of obligatory training made itimpossible to justify any longer the continued existence of theex officio Justices. Their abolition might give rise to some difficultyin the City of London where an alderman, unlike other lay Justices,sat alone, but there did not appear to be sufficient grounds for making an exception here. The abolition of the ex officio Justice wouldrequire legislation, which would possibly not be practicable inthe present Session. It was proposed in the White Paper merely toindicate that the Government had the question under consideration and to ask that ex officio Justices should not exercise their right toact as magistrates regularly unless they completed the first stage ofthe training course. It was recognised that the abolition of theex officio Justice would aggravate the problem of securing a properpolitical balance on the Bench, and he proposed to discuss this withthe chairmen of the Advisory Committees in the New Year.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposal tointroduce obligatory training for lay Justices, but it was suggestedthat it would be unwise to abolish the ex officio Justice, whose service as a magistrate helped to identify the Bench with the local community.The abolition of the only elected element on the Bench wouldsharpen criticism of the selection of Justices by a close and anonymousoligarchy whose recommendations seemed to perpetuate the predominantly conservative character of the Commission. In Scotland,where the elected Baillie made a useful contribution to theadministration of justice, there was no question of abolishingex officio Justices, and abolition in England and Wales might cause
some embarrassment. It was pointed out, on the other hand, thatthe continued presence on the Bench of ex officio Justices was inconsistent with the desirable development of a better selected and better trained magistracy. Justices who were personally selected fortheir work and who in future would have to devote some time to training for it, might well feel some resentment if they were requiredto sit with ex officio Justices who were neither selected nor trained;and the fact that ex officio Justices could include persons with a criminal record made it more difficult to effect the removal from the bench of ordinary Justices who committed criminal offences. TheWhite Paper itself did not, however, commit the Government to theabolition of ex officio Justices, but merely asked those Justices not toact as magistrates regularly unless they completed the first stage ofthe training course. It might be wise to rest on this position and to defer legislation until the Lord Chancellor had had an opportunityto consider further how the system of selecting Justices might be improved.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that Justices should be required to undertaketraining during the first year after their appointment. This plainlycalled in question the position of the ex officio Justices, but, in viewof the doubts which had been expressed about the wisdom of abolishing them, a decision on this question should be deferred untilthe Lord Chancellor had further considered the problem of securing a system of selection which would ensure that the Bench wasrepresentative of all classes in the community. A memorandum onthis aspect of the matter should be brought before the Cabinet indue course. In the meantime the passage in the White Paper referring to ex officio Justices was acceptable and the White Paper could bepublished.The Cabinet (1) Approved the publication of a White Paper on the lines ofthe draft annexed to C (65) 174.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to bring before them in due course proposals for improving the arrangements forselecting Justices of the Peace in England and Wales.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of ex officio Justices in thelight of (2) above.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C (65) 173) on the status of the UnitedKingdom diplomatic representative at the Vatican.The Foreign Secretary said that Her Majesty was represented atthe Holy See by a Minister, while there was no diplomatic representation of the Vatican in this country. In earlier discussionhe had suggested that the Government should seek the approval ofThe Queen for a proposal to be made to the Holy See that diplomatic representatives with the rank of Ambassador should be exchanged.It now appeared that the acceptance of a Papal diplomaticrepresentative in this country would be repugnant to some sectionsDiplomaticRelationswith the vatican
7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations (C (65) 175) on the negotiationswith the Irish Republic for the establishment of a free trade area between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that negotiations had been going on for about a year and were nowapproaching the stage when final decisions would have to be taken.About a dozen points of substance were still the subject of disagreement and some of them were of considerable difficulty. Apartfrom any economic advantage which might flow from the agreementFree TradeAreaAgreementwith theIrishRepublicCC 69 (65)of non-Roman Catholic opinion here. A suitable alternative mightbe to raise the status of our Minister to that of Ambassador, withoutany change in the representation in the United Kingdom of the vatican. It appeared that this might be welcome to the Holy Seeand there were practical reasons in favour of it. The junior status of our representative was an inconvenience to the proper dischargeof his duties and furthermore it might be appropriate to raise hisstatus in view of the growing importance of the Vatican in world affairs in the promotion of peace, disarmament, the war againstpoverty and support for the United Nations. There were, however,arguments to the contrary, notably the doubts expressed by the archbishop of Canterbury about such a move.In discussion it was argued that the opposition in the UnitedKingdom to the appointment of a United Kingdom Ambassador tothe Holy See derived from outmoded religious views and that these should not prevent our taking a step which would accord with theinterests of our foreign policy. It was however the general view thatto take such a step at the present time would arouse opposition inthe United Kingdom which would be injurious to the steadyimprovement of relations between the Churches. It would thereforebe preferable to await the further development of the work of reconciliation being done by the Secretariat for Christian Unity andby the various denominations and not to raise at this stage thecontroversial issue of our secular relations with the Vatican.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasthe general view of the Cabinet that we should not at this stage takethe step contemplated by the Foreign Secretary in view of the damage which this might cause to the ecumenical movement. It would,however, be open to the Foreign Secretary to bring this proposalforward at a later date in the light of the improvement of relationsbetween the denominations, if he then judged it desirable in theinterests of our foreign policy.The Cabinet Agreed that at the present time it would not be appropriate to raise the status of Her Majesty&apos;s Representative at the holy See to the rank of Ambassador.
it would also have a political importance in improving relationsbetween the two countries. It was clear that the Irish Prime Minister,Mr. Lemass, wished agreement to be reached but it was not certainthat all his colleagues did. If agreement on the outstanding pointswas not reached in the Ministerial discussions the following week,there was a serious risk that the negotiations would be abandoned.This would be most unfortunate. Our partners in the European free trade Association and the other Commonwealth countries whichmight be affected had been kept informed and had been understandingabout the proposed agreement. He therefore recommended that everyeffort should be made to settle the outstanding issues by makingconcessions on some of the points which the Irish regarded asparticularly important.The President of the Board of Trade said that the agreement would give greater advantages to the Irish Republic than to Britain.The Irish already had free access for industrial goods and would obtain substantial concession on their agricultural exports to Britain.We, however, would only obtain free entry for industrial goodsgradually over a period. We should lose our guaranteed preferencewell before we obtained free entry for our goods and the Irish werereserving the right after five years to except a significant part of thetrade from the agreement. It would, therefore, be wrong for us tomake further substantial concessions to the Irish on the outstanding points during the discussions the following week.The Minister of Agriculture said that the proposed agreementcontained substantial concessions to the Irish Republic on their exports of agricultural products and it would be surprising if theIrish Minister of Agriculture were not strongly in favour of securingthe agreement. Further concessions on agricultural products would raise great difficulties, both with home farmers and with theCommonwealth.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that onbroader grounds it would be in our interest to complete theagreement even though the balance of economic advantage might be slightly on the Irish side. But the balance of advantage might be altered if we were to give way on a large number of points at issue;and we should therefore be ready to accept the possibility that final agreement would not be reached in the Ministerial talks the following week and that a further round of negotiations might be needed inJanuary.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,in conjunction with the President of the Board of Trade andthe Minister of Agriculture, to continue the negotiationswith the Irish Republic on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th December, 1965
