OverseaAffairsThe Congo(previous reference:CC. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Foreign Secretary said that, although the recent rescueoperation organised by the United States and Belgian governments had undoubtedly saved the lives of many Europeans, Africans andAsians in the Congo, the situation remained precarious. The forcesof the Congolese Government were not sufficiently numerous to occupy effectively the country through which they were advancing;and an unknown number of Europeans must still be in considerablejeopardy. There was no possibility, however, of arranging a secondrescue operation, particularly since many African Governments hadbeen sharply critical of the earlier operation of this kind and anyattempt to repeat it might therefore merely endanger the lives of europeans elsewhere in Africa.In discussion there was general agreement that this situationresulted largely from the withdrawal of the United Nationspeace-keeping force, which had itself been due to the failure of themembers of the United Nations to agree on its continued financing.There appeared to be no prospect of reinstating any United Nationsmilitary presence in the Congo; but it was for consideration whether we should attempt to promote some kind of conciliation procedure in order to stabilise the situation. In particular, it would be desirableto let it be publicly known that we should welcome any proposal bythe Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a mediatorin the dispute and that we also looked with favour on the recentsuggestion by the Organisation for African Unity to despatch a mission to the Congo in order to establish the facts about the causes of the civil war and to explore the basis of a possible solution.The Cabinet Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange forthe Governments attitude towards the developments in the congo to be made publicly known on the lines indicated intheir discussion and for the Opposition to be appropriatelyinformed.General Grants       2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerto Local of Housing and Loca] Government (C. (64) 21) and by the ChiefAuthorities -Secretary, Treasury (C. (64) 22), about the general grant to localauthorities.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thegeneral grant period ran for a minimum of two years at a time. Thenew period would begin in April 1965; and, if local authorities wereto be informed of the grants which they would receive in time forthem to take this allocation into account in fixing rate demands forthe same period, the necessary Order would have to be approved bythe House of Commons before Christmas. The estimates by localauthorities of the probable expenditure during each year on theservices involved had been reduced by Departments, in agreementwith the Treasury, to amounts which might be regarded as realisticSECRET5510-6 a 2
in the light of the policies which the Government had inherited fromthe previous Administration. This involved a reduction of  17 million in expenditure for the first year and of  20 million for the second year. The reduction in the first year was acceptable; but in thesecond year it would imply an increase in the burden on the ratesand would therefore be contrary to the declared policy of theGovernment, which contemplated a progressive transfer ofexpenditure from rates to taxes. It would be impracticable to legislate for a general reduction of the burden on rates or for achange in the education grant system until the following Session;and this would not affect the rates until 1967-68. It would be possibleto seek statutory power to change the grant system to an annualbasis and to calculate the grant for 1966-67 afresh next year; andthis possibility might be further explored. The only immediate courseof action open to the Government, however, was to make thenecessary Order on the basis of the estimates for 1966-67 submittedby the local authorities, thus allowing them a margin of  20 million to allow for the development of services. On this basis theExchequer grant for that year would be increased by  11 million or 12 million.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that this proposal raised animportant issue of priorities in public expenditure. When theGovernment took office the forward estimates for the relevant expenditure of local authorities involved an increase of 5^ per cent a year. Those estimates were based on an increase of 4 per cent ayear in the Gross National Product (G.N.P.) and, even so, could only have been financed by increases in taxation. It was clear, however,that the Government could not rely with certainty on an increase of4 per cent in the G.N.P. in each of the next two years. Nevertheless,the estimates of local authority expenditure agreed with theDepartments concerned envisaged an increase of 6 - 7 per cent in thefirst year and 5 - 6 per cent in the second. The proposal of the Ministerof Housing and Local Government would now raise expenditure inthe second year by no less than 7-3 per cent. It followed that, untilthe general level and the priorities of public expenditure had been determined, it would be improvident to permit an additional 20 million of expenditure in respect of the services in question for1966-67, unless the Ministers concerned were prepared to guarantee that compensating savings would be provided in respect of other services for which they were responsible.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The restraint imposed by the two-year grant system on theGovernments freedom of action as far ahead as 1966-67 wasembarrassing at this early stage in the life of the Government, when there had not yet been an opportunity to carry out the enquiries which were an essential preliminary to the determination of priorities in public expenditure. From this point of view there might be advantage in seeking statutory authority to introduce an annualbasis for the grant system. On the other hand the system had hithertooperated reasonably well and to the satisfaction of the localauthorities; and the reductions made by Departments in the estimates
CC. 12 (64)of expenditure submitted by the local authorities had been shown by experience to be broadly justified. Moreover, the present systemrestricted the Governments freedom of action only in respect of grants for existing services. If new responsibilities were laid upon local authorities by legislation, the statutes could also provide forfurther Exchequer grants to meet the appropriate part of theadditional expenditure involved.(b) It could be argued that the proposal of the Minister of housing and Local Government would not involve any increase in public sector expenditure but would imply only an adjustment in theproportion of this expenditure borne respectively by the Exchequerand by the rates. On the other hand the proposal would permit thelocal authorities to increase their expenditure to a level which was higher than the economy could reasonably be expected to sustainwithout either compensating economies or an increase in taxation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the issues involved should be further clarified by discussion in the public sector Programmes Committee and should thereafter be submittedafresh to the Cabinet as a matter of urgency.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the issues raised by C. (64) 21 and 22 to be further consideredby the Public Sector Programmes Committee as rapidly as possible.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Children^Service inGreaterLondon(previous reference:C.C. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had invited the Future Legislation Committee to consider which Bill or bills would have to be excluded from the legislative programme for1964-65 if the proposed Bill conferring certain of the functions of achildren&apos;s authority on the G.L.C. were introduced in January. TheFuture Legislation Committee had not found it possible at this stage to suggest which Bills at present in the programme the Governmentwould be unlikely to be able to proceed with, since this would dependon when the major Bills those on Iron and Steel, Rent, land commission and Severance Payments were ready for introduction.There was a risk that any one of these four would have to be deferredif it came forward late, since otherwise more Bills would reach theHouse of Lords in June and July than the Government could expect to see passed. If, however, the Bill on the children&apos;s service in greater London could be ready for consideration by the legislation committee not later than 19th January and was not then expectedto attract substantial opposition, it should be possible to find timefor it in the House of Commons. If, on the other hand, it was not ready until later, it would not only impede the progress of major
Bills but also be unlikely to be enacted in time to become effectivebefore the London boroughs assumed the whole range of children&apos;authority functions on 1st April, 1965.In discussion it was pointed out that, before a draft Bill couldbe produced, it would be necessary to consult the local authorities concerned. But to consult them otherwise than on the basis of a firmundertaking to legislate would be likely to make them uncertainabout the wisdom of continuing to prepare plans for the operation ofthe children&apos;s service on the basis that the boroughs would beresponsible for the whole range of children&apos;s authority functions.On the other hand no firm decision to legislate could be taken untilthe extent to which the boroughs would support the proposals couldbe determined. The Members of Parliament who sat for Londonconstituencies did not appear to be strongly in favour of legislation at this point; and there was a risk that the Bill might appear to theHouse of Commons to be based on political considerations which took inadequate account of the difficulty of making new arrangements at so late a stage. It would also have to be borne in mind that thenecessity to pass the Bill by the middle of March at the latest would leave little time for its consideration in the House of Lords, whereit might well encounter opposition.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were disposed to agree to the introduction of the proposed bill, provided that, in the light of the Home Secretary&apos;s consultations with the local authorities concerned, it did not appear likely toexcite substantial opposition. The consultations should therefore takeplace on the basis that the Government were considering whether to legislate and wished to be informed of the authorities&apos; views before reaching a decision. The matter should be submitted to the Cabinetafresh as soon as the consultations were completed.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to consult the local authorities concerned, on the basis indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, about the proposal toconfer certain child-care functions on the Greater london council and to report the result to the Cabinet as rapidly as possible.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st December, 1964.
