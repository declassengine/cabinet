The Foreign Secretary said that in the latest round of negotiations within the European Economic Community (e.c.) theFrench Government had been concerned to press financial proposals in connection with agriculture which would have been of maximumadvantage to themselves. The other five Governments had sought to extract, in return, concessions which would have emphasised andenhanced the supra-national character of the Community. As a result the negotiations had ended in a deadlock; and it was not clear how the two parties to the dispute would now react. The repercussions ina wider context, e.g., in relation to the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations, could not but be unfavourable; and we should thereforerefrain from appearing to derive any satisfaction from the presentsituation. On the other hand it was not impossible that circumstances would now develop in such a way that the question of UnitedKingdom participation in the Community might be re-opened; andwe should be prepared for this possibility.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that there was evidence of growing tension in Iraq between President Arif and afaction which was disposed to lean further towards the United arab republic; and there was some risk of a coup d&apos;etat in Baghdad,designed to overthrow the present Government. It was unfortunate that these disturbed conditions might delay the ratification by the iraqi Government of the new agreement which they had recently concluded with the oil companies.The Foreign Secretary said that an opportunity had recentlyarisen to establish informal contact with the Government of north vietnam and to seek to ascertain their attitude towards the proposal,to which they had as yet made no formal reply, that theCommonwealth Mission on Vietnam should visit Hanoi. As a result the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, Mr. Harold Davies, M P, would probably arrive in Hanoi that day; and further developments must now await his report.In discussion there was general agreement that, since there appeared to be no prospect that any of the parties to the hostilities in Vietnam would relax their efforts of their own accord, it wasincumbent on us to seek to promote the purposes of theCommonwealth Mission by whatever means were open to us.commonwealth immigration(previous reference:CC(65) 6thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the lord president of the Council (C (65) 90 and 91) and by the Home Secretary(C (65) 92 and 93) on various aspects of Commonwealth immigration into the United Kingdom.The Lord President said that it was necessary to reach early decisions on recommendations arising from Lord Mountbatten&apos;s6572-1a 1Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
recent mission to certain Commonwealth countries if the Governmentwere to fulfil their undertaking to make a statement of government policy and issue a White Paper before the Recess. Lord Mountbattenhad been commissioned to explain to; other commonwealth governments the problems created in the United Kingdom by thepresent scale of immigration and to consider what new measuresmight be adopted, particularly in the countries of origin, to regulate the flow of immigrants. His recommendations had been consideredby the Commonwealth Immigration Committee, who were preparedto endorse them subject to certain modifications set out in C (65) 90.The Cabinet then discussed the issues involved under thefollowing heads:workers the Lord President said that the current issue of immigrationvouchers for workers was some 20,000 a year, of which some 14,000were taken up in 1964. It was however to be expected that a much higher proportion would be taken up if the number of vouchers weredrastically reduced. The Committee considered that the figure of10,000 vouchers a year recommended by Lord Mountbatten for thefuture level of immigration was too high and that a more realisticfigure would be 7,500. This should be considered in relation to thenumber of aliens admitted for employment, of whom some 9,000 were allowed to take up permanent residence in 1964. This was, however,an exceptionally high figure and the average in recent years had been of the order of 6,000. The Committee recommended the abolition of category C vouchers, which related primarily to unskilled workers;and the Minister of Labour had suggested that Category A and Bvouchers should be issued according to a restricted list of eligibleoccupations. These would be:(i) doctors, dentists and nurses;(ii) qualified teachers;(iii) graduates in science or technology with two years post-graduate experience;(iv) non-graduates with certain professional qualifications andtwo years&apos; experience after qualifying;  .(v) persons with the offer of employment in hospitals;(vi) persons with offers of employment in public transport.It would be impracticable not to reveal publicly these classificationsand the criteria required. Some members of the Committee howevertook the view that by restricting categories of Commonwealthemployment voucher holders to those with special qualifications of value to this country, we should not only be treating these countriesless favourably than foreign countries but also attracting from them the skilled-professional workers whose services they badly neededthemselves. In addition we were committed to make special provisionfor immigrants from Malta for the succeeding two years; and we also had a special responsibility for the remaining Colonial territories,some of which might suffer undue hardship from the imposition ofrigid and limited categories of employment.
ftCC36 (65)In discussion it was suggested that, while the social and political difficulties must necessarily impose a strict limit in presentcircumstances on the numbers who could be admitted, there wouldbe little difference in the level of social difficulties caused by the admission of 10,000 as compared with 7,500 and the shortage oflabour made it desirable to admit the higher figure. This conclusion was reinforced by the special considerations relating to Malta andthe remaining Colonial territories. On the other hand, in consideringthe number of immigrants admitted for employment it was necessaryto bear in mind that the admission of each Commonwealth immigrantworker involved on average the admission of a further fivedependants. The true comparison was therefore between 60,000 and45,000. Moreover the dependants imposed a particularly heavy strainin present circumstances on housing and on educational facilities andit was necessary for social reasons to regulate the pace of entry, inorder to give the necessary time for the assimilation of immigrantsinto the community.In further discussion the view was widely expressed that commonwealth immigrants should at the least be no less favourablytreated than aliens. While such comparison might reasonably be related primarily to the conditions of entry, and in no aspect was itenvisaged that the treatment of Commonwealth immigrants shouldbe less favourable, regard must also be had to the total numbers ofeach who were admitted. On this view, it was suggested that theproposed figure of 7,500 might compare unfavourably with the admission of over 42,000 alien workers during 1964, of whom over9,000 had been accepted for permanent residence, particularly when allowance was made for the fact that a considerable proportion ofthe Commonwealth immigrants would not remain as residents ofthe United Kingdom. On the other hand, it was accepted that thefigure for aliens in 1964 was substantially above the average in recentyears; and in comparing these figures due regard must be paid to the much higher number of dependants admitted in respect of eachimmigrant Commonwealth worker. It could properly be maintained,therefore, that, on any fair basis of comparison, the total number of commonwealth immigrants accepted was substantially larger thanthe number of alien immigrants.Discussion then turned to the categories of employment forwhich provision should be made within the total number of workerswhich might eventually be agreed. It was urged that our responsibilities to Malta and to the remaining Colonial territoriesnecessitated adequate provision for the admission of unskilled workers and that these should not be restricted to employment in hospitals or public transport. While it might be acceptable to statethat current social difficulties required a limitation on the totalnumber who could be accepted, such an argument would be incompatible with a division of the vouchers * into categories of individuals of particular value to the United Kingdom economy.Furthermore, undue emphasis on the admission of professionalworkers in the categories proposed would deprive Commonwealth
countries of the skilled personnel of whom they were so greatly in need and would in effect constitute technical assistance in reverse.On the other hand many of the professional individuals concerneddid not become permanently resident in the United Kingdom; andtheir experience while in this country constituted a form of trainingof considerable value to them and to their countries on their return.It appeared, in the light of experience over the previous few years,that the total number of professional individuals accepted in the fourcategories proposed might average approximately 5,500 a year andthat this would enable adequate provision to be made for the admission of a limited number of unskilled workers to meet special needs both overseas and in this country.Consideration was also given in discussion to the proposalsrecently put forward by the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago,Dr. Eric Williams, for the establishment of a training scheme in thatcountry to provide for the training of Commonwealth immigrants to meet employment needs in the United Kingdom. It was the general view, however, that provision of such special training was notrequired in the present circumstances, having regard to the types ofworker who might be admitted. Moreover, a scheme of this kind would be unlikely to be welcome to other Commonwealth countries concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet might agree that the conflicting considerationscould best be met by agreement to admit annually 8,500 workers, a figure which should be regarded as allowing for our commitment to malta over the next two or three years. This might suitably be met by the admission of 1,000 Maltese immigrants a year within the totalof 8,500; but there should be no public statement to that effect, nor should the total figure otherwise be divided into quotas for separatecountries. Nevertheless, on the basis of recent experience in relationto the admission of professional workers, such a figure should make adequate allowance for the admission of unskilled workers and so would provide for the special needs of the remaining colonial territories. There was general agreement that the four categories of professional workers proposed in C (65) 90 should be accepted and made public. There should, however, be no separate categories ofemployment, whether on the basis of the proposals in C (65) 90 orotherwise, for the admission of unskilled workers, whose admissionshould be governed by the date of their applications. In the light ofthe recent statistics of the admission of foreign workers it would notbe necessary to impose additional restrictions on their admission inorder to continue to give preferential treatment to commonwealth immigrants. If, however, it later appeared that the number of foreign workers accepted for settlement was likely to average more than some,000 a year, the issue should be further considered by the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that 8,500 vouchers a year should be issued for commonwealth immigrants on the conditions indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
(2) Invited the Home Secretary to keep under review the numberof aliens accepted for permanent settlement in the UnitedKingdom and to bring the matter before them if itappeared that the average was likely to rise above 6,000a year.DependantsThe Lord President said that it was estimated that approximatelyhalf a million dependants of Commonwealth immigrants already inthis country were entitled to entry under the provisions of theCommonwealth Immigration Act, 1962. If a substantial proportionof this number were to seek admission in the near future, a very heavy strain would be imposed on housing and other services; and theCommittee had therefore considered whether there might be a moratorium on their admission. They had concluded, however,that this would be contrary to our commitments and henceunacceptable. Nevertheless, while the legal right of entry shouldbe preserved, the Committee considered that admission should infuture normally be confined to wives and to children under 16, andthat the concessionary extensions set out in Command 1716 shouldbe withdrawn, although the Home Secretary should retain the discretion to admit other dependants on compassionate grounds. TheCommittee had considered various alternatives for verifying theclaims of dependants for admittance and had concluded that the best course would be to require immigrant workers to register before a specified date the names and particulars of all their direct dependants.These could then be checked in the country of origin; and certificatescould be issued to the dependant immigrants, which they would need to produce on arrival in the United Kingdom in order to secureadmittance. Legislation would be needed to enable immigration officers to refuse admittance to dependants arriving without suchcertificates of registration; and the Home Secretary should have a discretionary power to waive this requirement in compassionatecases.The Home Secretary said that it would be a breach of faith toimpose any special conditions, whether relating to housing accommodation or otherwise, for the admission of the dependants of Commonwealth immigrants already settled here although suchconditions could reasonably be imposed on future immigrants. It was however essential to take powers to enable the Government drasticallyto reduce evasion.In discussion there was general agreement that the admission ofthe dependants of immigrants already settled should be confined towives and to children under 16, subject to the Home Secretary&apos;sdiscretion to allow exceptions in compassionate cases. various proposals were discussed for the prevention of evasion, including a requirement that new entrants, on admission to the United Kingdom,should be required to be in possession of passports specifying their dependants. It was suggested, however, that such requirements werewidely open to evasion and might, indeed, lead to the admission of
even larger numbers of so-called &quot; dependants &quot;. Immigration officersalready had power to refuse the admission of dependants of whosebona fides they were in doubt; and in considering admission theymight suitably take into account whether or not such dependantspossessed a certificate of registration on the lines proposed.In further discussion it was urged that the admission of dependants of new entrants should be conditional on the provisionof a certificate that adequate accommodation was available for them.It was however the general view that such a requirement would be impracticable in current circumstances and that the first step mustnecessarily be the wider registration of multi-occupied houses. TheCity of Birmingham already enforces such registration; and it mightbe desirable for national legislation to be passed extending such powers to other local authorities. It would then be possible to considerthe imposition at a later date of a requirement that dependants must,as a condition of admission, show that adequate housing was availablefor them on arrival.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that there was agreement that the admission of dependants, bothof Commonwealth immigrants already here and of future immigrants,should be confined to wives and to dependants under 16, save for admission at the discretion of the Home Secretary in compassionatecases. Immigration officers should use their existing powers normallyto refuse admittance to persons of whose bona fides they were in doubt; and in exercising those powers they should take intoconsideration whether or not the individuals possessed a certificate of registration of their status as dependants. Further consideration should be given by the Commonwealth Immigration Committee tothe need for additional powers for this purpose, whether by legislation or otherwise. Since it seemed doubtful whether the half milliondependants of immigrants who were already here would in fact allclaim admission to the United Kingdom, save perhaps over aconsiderable number of years, it would be preferable that this figure should not be used as a basis for public discussion.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the admission of dependants of commonwealth immigrants should be restricted in the manner indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(4) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the commonwealth immigration Committee to consider, in the light of their discussion, the need for further powers to enable suchrestriction to be made effective.(5) Invited the Minister of Housing, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to consider whether proposals relating to legislation for the registration of multi-occupied houses should be submitted to the Home AffairsCommittee.Students and visitorsThe Lord President said that encouragement should be given to arrangements whereby Commonwealth Governments might vouch
CC36(65)for the bona fides of students. When they completed or gave up theirstudies they should be allowed to take up work only if they wouldhave qualified for a voucher of admission. To ensure that they lefton completion of their studies a new general power to repatriateCommonwealth citizens without criminal proceedings or a courtrecommendation should be used. To meet the problem of students who left their studies for general employment, the most practical solution would be to compel the registration with the police of thosestudents whose bona fides were in doubt. This might, however, beconsidered inappropriate for Commonwealth citizens and would besubject to strong Commonwealth criticism. Other methods of keeping in touch with students might therefore be preferable. TheCommonwealth Immigration Committee agreed with theMountbatten Mission&apos;s recommendation that the stay of visitorsshould be limited to six months, subject to freely granted extensionsif good cause were shown.The Home Secretary said that consideration should be givento amending Section 2 of the Commonwealth Immigration Act, 1962,in order to provide a more limited definition of the kind of educational establishment to which students could be admitted.In discussion there was general agreement that powers shouldbe taken to impose a tighter control on Commonwealth students, onthe understanding that in practice such powers would be sparinglyused.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that power should be taken to require Commonwealthstudents whose bona fides were in doubt to register withthe police.(7) Agreed that the stay of Commonwealth visitors should normally be limited to six months.(8) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the commonwealth immigration Committee to consider the desirability of amending Section 2 of the Commonwealth ImmigrationAct, 1962, on the lines advocated by the Home Secretary.Conditions of entryThe Lord President said that the Mountbatten Mission had recommended that there should be a general power to imposeconditions of entry on all Commonwealth citizens, including voucherholders and entitled dependants. The Committee agreed with thisrecommendation but considered that the power to require registrationwith the police should not be exercisable unless expressly conferred by a statutory instrument subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The general power might also be used to obtainphotographs.The Cabinet (9) Agreed that power should be taken to impose conditions of entry in the manner recommended by the commonwealth immigration Committee.
RepatriationThe Lord President said that the Committee agreed with therecommendation of the Mountbatten Mission that there should bepower to repatriate Commonwealth citizens without the necessity ofa criminal conviction or the recommendation of a court of law. they considered, however, that the immigrants should have the right tomake representations to an independent authority after a qualifyingperiod of residence. Aliens acquired such a right after two years&apos;residence; and it might be felt that Commonwealth immigrants shouldhave a somewhat greater right in this respect.The Home Secretary said that the power to repatriate shouldcontinue until the immigrant had been resident in the UnitedKingdom for five years, after which period he could exercise hisstatutory right to register as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies and the power to repatriate should no longer be exercisableagainst him. The Commonwealth immigrant should have the samefacilities for appeal as an alien; and, if he had been lawfully residenthere for more than two years, he should be able to make representations to the Chief Magistrate, except where a breach of security was involved or where a criminal court had recommendeddeportation. The Home Secretary would, however, not be bound bythe Chief Magistrate^ view, even though he might normally give effectto it.In discussion it was suggested that the taking of such powers might increase the risk of arbitrary expulsion by certain Commonwealth countries of United Kingdom citizensnow resident there. It was the general view, however, that the general power of repatriation should be taken but that in order to putCommonwealth immigrants in a preferential position in relationto aliens, they should have the right to make representations to theChief Magistrate after six months&apos; residence here.The Cabinet (10) Agreed that there should be power to repatriateCommonwealth citizens within their first five years of residence in the United Kingdom without the necessityof a criminal conviction or the recommendation of a courtof law, subject to their right of representation to the ChiefMagistrate after six months&apos; residence.Health checksThe Minister of Health said that it would be impracticable for effective health checks for immigrants entering the United kingdom to be carried out in all the countries of origin. The national health authorities could not be relied upon to produce reliable certificates;and it would be costly and impracticable to send United Kingdomteams of doctors to all the countries from which immigrants came.Such checks should therefore continue to be carried out in the UnitedKingdom; and power might be taken to impose a condition onimmigrants that they should accept medical treatment on arrival.
In discussion it was urged that, while medical certificates fromthe country of origin would not be entirely effective, they mightnevertheless have some value, particularly for presentational purposes.The Cabinet (11) Agreed that immigrants should be required to pass a medicaltest in the country of origin and that it should be madea condition of entry that immigrants for permanent residence might be required, if necessary, to undergomedical treatment on arrival in the United Kingdom.(12) Invited the Minister of Health to consider the manner inwhich health checks on Commonwealth immigrants mightmore effectively be carried out in future at UnitedKingdom ports of entry.Voluntary Liaison committees the Lord President said that the proposed White Paper on immigration should also announce positive measures for further government action on the integration with the community of commonwealth immigrants already in this country. The Committeewere considering various proposals to this end in the fields ofeducation, employment, housing and health. Meanwhile, they considered it desirable to encourage the development or establishmentof voluntary liaison committees in each local authority area wheresubstantial numbers of Commonwealth immigrants had settled andto strengthen the existing machinery at national level for dealingwith these problems. It was, therefore, proposed that the national committee for Commonwealth Immigrants and the commonwealth immigrants Advisory Council should be replaced by a new national committee. The Committee&apos;s functions would be to provide advice on particular problems, to promote research and to stimulate andco-ordinate local effort. It should also, where necessary, be empoweredto recruit and train staff who could be made available as full timepaid officials for the voluntary local liaison committees. Theprovisional estimate of the total cost of the scheme was  70,000 a year.Discussion showed general agreement with this proposal.The Cabinet (13) Approved C(65)91.Immigration of Asians from East africa the Home Secretary said that there was a considerable numberof individuals of Asian origin in the newly independent countries of east Africa, who, if they chose to come to this country, would notbe subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigration Act,1962, since they were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.The numbers involved might be of the order of 250,000; and there might be objection in admitting them to the United Kingdom freelywhile contemplating more stringent restrictions on other categories of Commonwealth immigrants. On the other hand legislation
12SECRETdepriving them of their existing rights and status would be difficultto justify.The Prime Minister said that the issues involved could best be examined in the first instance by the Commonwealth ImmigrationCommittee and referred to the Cabinet, if necessary, in the light ofthe Committee&apos;s conclusions.The Cabinet (14) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the problems raised in C (65) 93 to be considered by the commonwealth immigration Committee.TimingThe Lord President said that the Government were committed to making a Parliamentary statement and issuing a White paper before the Summer Recess. Discussion with commonwealth governments would be necessary beforehand. It might accordingly be appropriate to arrange for the White Paper to be issued, and astatement to be made, in the first week in August. A draft of theWhite Paper might meanwhile be considered by the commonwealth immigration Committee, together with detailed proposals for the changes in the voucher scheme, and in the operation of existingimmigration controls, in the light of the Cabinets conclusions. these changes might be introduced about the middle of September.Consideration should also be given to the legislation which would berequired for introduction in the following Session. This should, ifpossible, come into force before the end of the year. Alternatively itwould be necessary to extend the period of the commonwealth immigration Act, 1962, for a further limited period.The Cabinet (15) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord President and the Home Secretary, to informCommonwealth Governments of their decisions on thefuture admission of Commonwealth immigrants.(16) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the commonwealth immigration Committee to prepare a White Paper on theGovernments policy on Commonwealth immigration.(17) Agreed that the White Paper should be issued, and that a parliamentary statement should be made, shortly beforethe Summer Recess.(18) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the commonwealth immigration Committee to consider detailed proposals inrelation to the administrative arrangements and thelegislation which would be required in order to bring into effect their decisions on changes of policy relatingto Commonwealth immigration.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th July, 1965.
