The Prime Minister said that in the discussion of SouthernRhodesia at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, the AfricanPrime Ministers had spoken with restraint but with great firmness.They proposed that the United Kingdom Government should at oncesummon a constitutional conference; if Mr. Smith, the southern rhodesian Prime Minister, did not agree and did not release the african nationalist leaders, the United Kingdom Government shouldsuspend the present Constitution and impose direct rule. The AfricanPrime Ministers were supported by all the other Prime Ministers atthe Meeting except those of Australia and New Zealand. We had described the discussions which were taking place with Mr. Smithand the five principles on which we were seeking his agreement. Ifthese negotiations were successful a constitutional conference would naturally follow. It was however unrealistic to suppose that we couldcompel Mr. Smith to accept our orders and we could not contemplate the use of force. It was clear that the African Prime Ministers would insist on some advance by the United Kingdom Government beyondthe position set out in the communique issued after the 1964Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting; if this were not acceptedthey might well leave the Commonwealth. He therefore proposed tooffer, for inclusion in the final communique, an undertaking that, ifthe discussions with Mr. Smith did not lead to a constitutional conference in a reasonably short time, the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to consider whether to promote such aconference in order to ensure Rhodesia&apos;s progress to independence on a basis acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole. There was some risk that this would lead to a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), but on balance this seemed unlikely. Mr. Smith&apos;attitude was at present reasonable and the danger of a UDI had forthe time being receded. An undertaking in these terms would not commit the United Kingdom Government as regards the date for a constitutional conference and although the present situation couldnot continue indefinitely it should not be necessary to consider callingsuch a conference until towards the end of the year. Nor would theUnited Kingdom Government be finally committed to calling a constitutional conference if, in the circumstances at the time, itappeared that to do so would have disastrous results.In discussion there was general agreement that an undertakingon the lines described by the Prime Minister was the minimum whichwas likely to be agreed by the African Prime Ministers and that it didnot involve an unacceptable commitment for the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister said that the proposal for a CommonwealthMission on Vietnam was supported by all the commonwealth countries except Tanzania and Kenya. The opposition of these twocountries seemed-to be due partly to strong Chinese influence amongstsome members of their delegations, and partly to a desire not to 34 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
commit themselves in advance of the forthcoming Afro-AsianConference in Algiers, which they regarded as more important thanthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting. They had beencorrespondingly affected by recent events in Algeria and might nowbe having second thoughts about their position. One important result might well be a decline of Chinese influence among the Afro-Asianmembers of the Commonwealth. The initial negative responses from moscow, Peking and Hanoi need not be taken to represent the finalposition of the Governments concerned. The establishment of theMission could widen the rift between the Soviet Union and China andit was not to be excluded that the Russians might be pressing theNorth Vietnamese to receive the Mission in Hanoi. The view of theCommonwealth Prime Ministers was that the very fact that commonwealth countries had divided views about Vietnamstrengthened the position of the Commonwealth as a whole on this issue. President Nkrumah of Ghana was in favour of the Missionvisiting those Governments who would receive it and the general feeling amongst the Commonwealth Prime Ministers was that weshould stand by the initiative taken, in the hope that the pressures ithad generated would in time work on the Soviet and north vietnamese Governments. The United States Government had welcomed the establishment of the Mission and there was reason tobelieve that it would lead to a more flexible American attitude and a willingness to negotiate terms not only for a conference on Vietnambut also for a cease-fire in advance of a conference. A working party was considering guide lines for the Mission and Ghana had putforward proposals which were extremely reasonable on almost all points. Subject to agreement in the working party, these would be put to the plenary meeting and they might well receive unanimousendorsement including that of Tanzania and Kenya.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statementsAlgeria The Foreign Secretary said that the overthrow of the AlgerianPresident, Ben Bella, by the Vice-President and Minister of Defence,Colonel Boumedienne, appeared to be due to personal rivalries.Boumedienne had the support of the Army and the Police but therehad been some spontaneous demonstrations in favour of Ben Bella.The attitude of the new Government was still uncertain but it seemed likely that they would be more concerned with Arab and Islamicaffairs than with the Soviet Union or China. The new Governmenthad been immediately recognised by the People&apos;s Republic of China,no doubt in the hope that this would encourage the AlgerianGovernment to hold the Afro-Asian Conference as planned. In ourown case it did not seem that any formal act of recognition would benecessary if the new Government maintained itself in power.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th June, 1965.
