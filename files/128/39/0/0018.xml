2. The Prime Minister invited the attention of his colleagues to the memorandum which he had recently circulated as C. (64) 31.Recent experience had underlined the importance of maintainingcomplete discretion about the deliberations of the Cabinet and its committees; and Ministers might wish to bear particularly in mind the suggestion that, on any occasion when they granted interviewsto the Press, they should be accompanied, for their own protection,by their Departmental Press Officers.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C. (65) 4) about comprehensivesecondary education.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that theOpposition had elected to raise the subject of comprehensiveeducation in the debate on Supply on 21st January. He proposed todiscuss the subject during the debate on the lines set out in his memorandum and to announce his intention to send a circular toLocal Education Authorities (L.E.As.) requesting them to submitplans for the -reorganisation of their secondary schools oncomprehensive lines and to indicate that the legislative basis for theadoption of the comprehensive principle would be provided by theintroduction of a Bill in the next Session of Parliament.1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that Sir winston churchill, who had recently suffered a cerebral thrombosis, was nowgravely ill. If he did not survive, it would be appropriate thattributes should be paid to his memory in Parliament; and thenecessary arrangements for this purpose would be made. In so faras individual Ministers might wish to commemorate in a similarway Sir Winston&apos;s association with their respective Departments inthe past, they should feel free to do so; but it might be convenient if any supplementary tributes of this nature were co-ordinated bythe Prime Ministers Press Secretary at No. 10.Since it would be inappropriate in these circumstances toproceed with the despatch of any controversial parliamentary business which could be deferred without undue inconvenience, thestatement on export incentives and other economic measures whichhe had had it in mind to make on that afternoon would be deferred for the time being.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.a 2
There was a good case on educational and social grounds forthe abolition of the segregation of children by 11-plus selection andfor the adoption of the comprehensive principle, to which theGovernment were committed. In recent years a substantial numberof L.E.As., catering for two-thirds of the children of secondary schoolage, had been planning the reorganisation of their schools with theobject of eliminating selection at the age of 11. These schemesvaried in merit; and it was desirable that a national policy shouldbe announced in order that the Department of Education and Sciencemight be in a position to advise authorities at an early stage of theirplanning. For the most part the comprehensive principle would haveto be implemented by using the existing stock of buildings. Twosecondary schools might be used as the junior and senior departments of a single comprehensive school; or pupils could move from a primary school to a junior comprehensive school and thereafter, stage 13 or 14, at the wish of parents who were willing to keep them at school until 16, to a grammar school with an extended range of courses; or pupils staying beyond 16 could move at that age to ajunior college. Purpose-built comprehensive schools could beprovided where new buildings were needed to accommodateincreasing numbers; but they need not be of the size which had beenadopted in London.Objections would be raised to the comprehensive principle onthe ground that it involved &quot; destroying the grammar schools &quot; or that separate grammar and modern schools provided bettereducation for the children in both. But grammar schools would notcease to provide their traditional type of education because they also provided for a wider range of children, some of whom mightbe found to benefit from studies of an academic type; and therewas no reason why either academic or non-academic children shouldsuffer from being educated together, provided that comprehensiveschools were well staffed and organised. It would also be alleged that the adoption of a national policy of comprehensive educationwould deprive L.E.As. of their autonomy. But, in view of the mobility of the population, the need to limit local divergencies in education justified the central Government in requiring L.E.As. toadopt a uniform principle, although variations of local circumstancesuggested that they should be given considerable latitude in theirchoice of method and timing. Special problems arose in relation to direct grant schools, which should eventually either be absorbed in the local authority system or be treated in the same way as independent schools. There was reason to think that some of them would be willing to broaden their basis voluntarily; but for thetime being no action need be taken in this regard beyond ensuring that their numbers did not increase. The denominational voluntary schools were unlikely to be hostile to the comprehensive principle;but they would wish their own problems to be taken into account in the course of reorganisation. The non-denominational voluntary schools, which included some of the most distinguished grammarschools in the country, might also not wish to be absorbed into theL.E.As&apos;. schemes; and their position would have to be considered
in the context of the plans of the relevant authorities. In some areasreorganisation might have to proceed slowly; but, once the principleof comprehensive education was accepted as setting the normalpattern, particular problems should in time be capable of solution.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals inC. (65) 4. The following main points were made:(a) Expenditure on education was already rising at the rate of6 per cent per annum; and any further increase could only be atthe expense of other services. It would therefore be desirable toensure that L.E.As. were not encouraged to proceed in such a way that a demand was created for the diversion of additional resources to secondary education, either by increasing the allocation for education as a whole or by reducing the amounts available for theimprovement of primary schools or the expansion of higher education. Since, however, the increasing expenditure on educationalready approved was designed to provide for the additionalchildren who would have to be catered for in secondary schools asa result both of the current tendency to remain at school until 16and of the raising of the school-leaving age in the relatively nearfuture, it should be possible to make some provision forcomprehensive schools within this allocation. The adoption of the comprehensive principle need not in itself necessitate additional expenditure; and, although reorganisation might proceed faster if local authorities could be given financial help in overcomingparticular difficulties, inability to find the extra money would not prejudice its quality.(b) It should be emphasised that the acceptance of the comprehensive principle involved the abolition not only of theexisting methods of selection of 11-plus but of the segregation ofwhich the 11-plus test was the instrument; and it should be made clear to parents that comprehensive schools made available to themore intelligent children, as to others, a wider range of courses than was normally available in grammar schools.(c) It was desirable that Government spokesmen in the debate should avoid being drawn into giving details of the government&apos;s policy towards direct grant schools. It would be sufficient to say thattheir numbers would not be allowed to increase.(d) It was proposed to announce, in answer to a Question in theHouse of Commons, that the principle of comprehensive educationwould also be applied in Scotland. It was not, however, a controversial issue north of the Border.(e) Any reference to legislation should avoid using terms whichcould be represented by the Opposition as a threat to theindependence of L.E.As. or to the freedom of choice of parents. Itwould be better not to legislate until a need to do so could be demonstrated by the response of L.E.As. to the proposed circular;and there should be no need for legislation immediately, since, while some amendment of the Education Act, 1944, might facilitatereorganisation, particularly where it became necessary to close
schools, it was not essential for this purpose. It would be preferableat the outset to emphasise the Governments confidence, based onthe growing acceptance of the comprehensive principle, that localauthorities would respond voluntarily to the request to submit plans for reorganisation and to indicate that the Government did not intend to introduce legislation unless it proved to be needed. Itwould be desirable, however, to be ready to admit, if necessary, thatthe Government would be prepared to legislate if they judged thatthis would help L.E.As. in implementing a policy of comprehensiveeducation.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (65) 4 and invited theSecretary of State for Education and Science to be guided,in speaking in the Parliamentary debate on 21st January,by the points made in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th January, 1965.
