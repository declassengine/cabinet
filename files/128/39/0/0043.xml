EconomicSituationCreditControl(previous reference:CC(65) 8thConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statements by the first secretary of State and the Chancellor of the exchequer on the decision to call for special deposits.1. The First Secretary of State said that the statistics of advancesby the London clearing banks at 21st April, 1965, which would shortly be published, would show an unexpectedly large increase during the previous five weeks. It was difficult to ascertain with any certainty the reasons for this movement; but there was some reasonto think that it was attributable mainly to the demands of manufacturing industry rather than personal borrowers whoseborrowing had already been restricted during the last few months.If the increase in bank lending were to be announced without anyreaction by the Government, this might adversely affect international confidence in sterling. After consultation with the Prime Minister,who was paying an official visit to Rome, the Chancellor of theExchequer had therefore authorised the Bank of England to announceforthwith that they intended to call upon the London clearing banksto place special deposits with the Bank of England to the value of1 per cent of gross deposits, \ per cent by 19th May, and the second\ per cent by 16th June. The Scottish banks were similarly beingrequested to make special deposits totalling \ per cent of grossdeposits, in two instalments of \ per cent. The effect should be toreduce by about  90 million the amount available for bank advances.The banks had already received indications of the governments views upon the priorities to be observed in their lending; and thereshould be no need to supplement or modify this guidance. It wouldbe desirable, however, to seek to ensure that this new measure of credit control would not be misinterpreted as being inconsistent withthe Governments basic policies. He would therefore arrange, among other things, to reassure representatives of the trade unions, whom he would be addressing on 30th April, that it remained theGovernments objective to achieve a controlled and steady rate of expansion and that the call for special deposits was no more thanone instrument by which the Government could seek to ensure the regulation of demand which was essential for this purpose.In discussion The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that theGovernor of the Bank of England would be calling the attention ofthe Chairman of the London clearing banks to the undesirability ofan excessive rise in bank lending. For the purposes of economic planning, assumptions had been made about the amount of theincrease in bank lending in 1965-66 which would be consistent withthe Governments economic objectives; but it was not proposed to prescribe any public limit or advances. The existence of a separatebanking system in Scotland made it possible to impose smaller calls for special deposits upon the Scottish banks than upon the Englishbanks; but it would not be possible to discriminate between different areas within England and Wales.
2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer described to the Cabinetthe provisions on compensation for the nationalisation of iron andsteel companies which were to be outlined in the White Paper to bepublished on Friday, 30th April at 3.30 p.m.There were five possible bases of compensation as follows, the resultant cost of re-nationalisation being as indicated in each case:(i) the values on the basis of which the industry had beende-nationalised in 1953 (estimated cost  264 million);(ii) values at de-nationalisation, adjusted to take account of profits reinvested and other funds accumulated and heldsince 1953 (estimated cost  620 million);(iii) current net worth of the interests nationalised (estimatedcost  800 million);(iv) values based upon the capitalisation of earnings over aperiod (estimated cost  680 million if the period was tenyears):(v) Stock Exchange values.The cost of compensation on the basis of Stock Exchange valueswould depend upon the choice of base dates. If compensation was based on average values over the six months before October 1964,the estimated cost would be  470 million; on the basis of averagevalues during the six days before The Queen&apos;s Speech in which thedecision to re-nationalise the industry was announced, the estimatedcost would be  445 million; on the basis of average values over thethree years before October 1964 the estimated cost would be  597million; on the basis of average values over the five years before october 1964 the estimated cost would be  533 million. these estimates comprised the companies to be nationalised whose shareswere quoted on the Stock Exchange. The compensation values forthe unquoted companies to be nationalised would have to be arranged by special agreement; they would add  70- 120 million to each of theabove estimates.The most appropriate basis for compensation appeared to beprovided by Stock Exchange values, which reflected the marketsestimate of commercial and political prospects. In adopting this basis the Government would be following the example of their predecessors when the iron and steel industry was first nationalised.If so, compensation should be based on average values over thefive years from October 1959 to October 1964, since this period would cover not only fluctuations in the trade cycle and their effects uponthe industry but also movements of public opinion about the prospects of re-nationalisation. To take a shorter period for example, the six days before The Queen&apos;s Speech would be less costly; but it couldbe argued that the values of shares during that period did not represent a fair assessment of the real value of the companies,because the views of the Stock Exchange during that period hadbeen unduly influenced by fears of re-nationalisation. On thehypothesis of a five year period, however, it would be reasonable,in addition, to allow compensation to be based upon average valuesover the six months from May to October, 1964, in cases where thisIron and SteelNationalisationCompensationProvisions(previous reference:CC(65) 26thConclusions,Minute 4)
would provide a higher valuation. This alternative would in practiceapply only to Messrs. Stewart and Lloyd, the average value of whoseshares over the five year period would not fairly reflect current assetvalues by reason of changes in the company during the period.Holders of iron and steel shares would be offered compensation in a fixed interest Government stock. The exchange of securitieswould be treated as an involuntary realisation for purposes of thecapital gains tax; and no tax charge or loss allowance would ariseuntil the new stock was sold. The liability to tax thereafter shouldrestrain selling of the new stock to some extent.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposed terms of compensation held a reasonable balance between the interestof the Exchequer and the need to ensure that the basis ofcompensation was demonstrably fair. Since the publication of theseproposals would inevitably lead to considerable movements of stock exchange prices, it was essential that their secrecy should be completely preserved until the White Paper was published.The Cabinet Approved the inclusion in the White Paper on Iron and steel nationalisation, to be published on Friday, 30th April, ofthe provisions for compensation proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.J.30th April, 1965.
