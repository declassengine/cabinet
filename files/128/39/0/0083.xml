Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 66thConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth Secretary^discussions with the Zambian Government suggested that therewas a slightly more hopeful prospect of reaching agreement on theterms on which United Kingdom forces might be stationed in Zambia.But the continuing pressure of African opinion had produced a progressive hardening in the attitude of the Zambian Government;and this might continue.Meanwhile, the Cabinet might consider whether there shouldbe some mitigation of the decision, which had been taken at their previous meeting, to suspend the payment of United Kingdompensions to pensioners in Rhodesia pending the restoration of a legal Government. The argument of principle against authorisingsuch payments was clear; but the effect on public opinion in theUnited Kingdom was questionable, since there were also arguments,on humanitarian grounds, in favour of authorising payment in casesof hardship. Such payments might be made through a Rhodesianbranch of a United Kingdom bank or perhaps through the Governor.In discussion there was general agreement that, in principle, thebalance of argument was against a relaxation of the earlier decision,particularly since some of the pensioners were known to be strongsupporters of the illegal regime and any apparent weakening of theGovernment^ determination to institute harsher measures to bringthe regime to an end might have damaging repercussions on publicopinion both inside and outside Rhodesia. It could, indeed, be argued that, even in cases of hardship, the pensioners affected should look to the illegal regime to mitigate the circumstances in which they now found themselves as a result of the illegal declaration of independence. It was the general view, however, that on bothhumanitarian and political grounds it would be preferable to seek to make arrangements for payment from the United Kingdom tocontinue at least in cases of hardship. The details of any such arrangements would need further consideration. It might be desirable,for example, to enlist the assistance of the Churches in Rhodesiain connection with the disbursement of payments.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be desirable to seek to devisearrangements whereby United Kingdom pensions might continue to be paid to pensioners in Rhodesia in those cases where this was desirable on humanitarian grounds.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of State, Commonwealth relations office, to give further consideration to the details of such arrangements.CC 67 (65)Parliament j.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The Adult 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeOffender        Secretary (C (65) 164), to which was attached the draft of a white paper on The Adult Offender.The Home Secretary said that the Government might be liableto incur criticism from liberal opinion if they did not soon make adistinctive contribution to the reform of the penal system; and,since there was no immediate prospect of introducing a criminla justice Bill, it was proposed that a White Paper on the Adult Offendershould be published as a counterpart to the White Paper on young offenders which had been published in August. The new white paper should set the Governments main proposals for legislationagainst the background of current thinking and action on penalproblems. The central feature of these proposals was the introductionof a system of parole which would enable long-term prisoners whom there seemed to be some prospect of reclaiming to return to societyafter they had served a third of their sentences, but subject to recallto prison for a further third if they misbehaved. The sentences ofpreventive detention and corrective training for persistent offenderswould be abolished, the courts being empowered to imposed on apersistent offender a longer sentence, subject to a statutory maximum,than that appropriate for the offence of which he was convicted.Prisoners in this category would also qualify for parole but wouldbe liable to recall for the whole of the remainder of the sentence.The White Paper, which it was hoped to publish during the week beginning 5th December, would also give an account of the progressof the prison building programme and of other matters important to penal policy, such as the arrangements for keeping prisoners intouch with their families.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It might be preferable to omit the opening sentences of thedraft White Paper and to confine the introductory paragraph tofactual statements. On the other hand, these sentences struck a note of humanity which set the tone of the whole document; and theyshould be retained.(b) The reference in paragraph 2 to keeping certain prisoners in detention for life might be thought retrogressive; and it shouldbe made clear that a prisoner would be detained for life only afterthe most careful consideration and where this was essential for theprotection of the public.(c) Consideration should be given to including in paragraph 13some account of the case for abolishing preventive detention or atleast for making it clear that the previous Administration had announced their intention to abolish this form of sentence.(d) The tone of paragraph 19 on long-term prisoners should bere considered in conjunction with that of paragraph 2. As drafted,the passage appeared to lay too much emphasis on making conditions for long-term prisoners humane and tolerable a description it wasto be hoped applied to the conditions of all prisoners and too little on the problem of preventing deterioration of character whichwas the real justification for the provision of special conditions for
men detained for very long periods. It was arguable that a man whom it was necessary for the protection of the public to detain for morethan ten years must be mentally ill and should be detained in hospitalrather than in prison. But there were men serving sentences of 30years for robbery or espionage whose sanity was not in doubt, andsome convicted of offences, such as child murder, who might haveto be detained for the remainder of their lives and yet had not beenfound to be mentally ill. The drafting of the paragraph should therefore be revised in order to lay emphasis on the prevention ofthe deterioration of character to which long-term prisoners would otherwise be liable. In particular, the word &quot; unhappily &quot; should be deleted from the second sentence.(e) The references in paragraphs 24 and 25 to visits to prisonersappeared unduly cautious. A man&apos;s family was often the most effective agent for his reformation; and it was of primary importance that he should be kept closely in touch with them. For this purposeweek end parole early in the sentence might be valuable; and it wasnot clear why it was necessary for a prisoner to serve for as longas a year before he became entitled to receive accumulated visits fromhis family. There were disadvantages, however, in allowing homevisits early in the sentence: they tended to unsettle the prisoner andto make it more difficult for him to adjust himself to the prisonregime. Any further reduction of the qualifying period for receivingaccumulated visits would create administrative difficulties becauseof the shortage of prison staff. Further consideration would, however,be given, in the light of the discussion, to the arrangements for family visits and to the possibility of imparting a more positive toneto the paragraph in question.(/) It might be desirable to make a stronger reference inparagraph 24 to the possibility of paying prisoners normal wages,in order that they might contribute to the support of their families and perhaps to the compensation of their victims. Even allowing,however, for savings on national assistance and on the cost ofmaintaining men in prison, the payment of normal wages wouldinvolve annual expenditure of some  6 million, for which no provision could at present be made.(g) The proposals for the development of after-care would contribute to the growing pressure on the country&apos;s resources forthe recruitment and training of social workers; and it would benecessary to ensure that these plans were pursued with a properregard to the resources available.(h) It would be desirable to include in the White Paper some reference to the work and the point of view of prison officers, who might otherwise feel that their problems and their contribution tothe progress of penal reform had been disregarded.(/) The Labour Party&apos;s Study Group, under the chairmanship of Lord Longford, in their report &quot; Crime a Challenge to us All &quot;had suggested certain reforms in the Home Office, designed to givenew impetus to the development of policies outlined in the report.
While it was not necessarily appropriate to refer in the White paper to plans for this purpose, it was desirable that the recommendations should be considered; and a memorandum upon them might usefully be brought before the Home Affairs Committee.(j) It was not proposed to publish a White Paper relating to scotland; but, since some of the proposed developments in Englandand Wales would affect Scotland, it would be desirable to indicatethat consideration would be given to the adoption of appropriateparallel arrangements in that country.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to give further consideration tothe terms of the draft White Paper on The Adult Offenderin the light of their discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the early publication of the White Paper.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to bring before the Home AffairsCommittee in due course a memorandum on theproposals in the report &quot; Crime A Challenge to us All &quot;for strengthening the organisation of the Home Office.industrial disputes :BakeryIndustry(previous reference:CC (65) 66thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (65) 166) on the prices and incomes policy.The First Secretary of State said that the threatened strike inthe bakery industry might be averted on the basis approved by theCabinet at their previous meeting, namely, the grant of an interimwage increase of 3^- per cent from 1st January, 1966, coupled witha reference of the union&apos;s claim for a further increase to the national board for Prices and Incomes. Even so, the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes would have suffered some damage. Any wage increase would inevitably involve a further increase in the price of bread, would make it extremely difficult to persuade other unions to accept a reference to the Board or to observe the principles ofthe policy and would help to foster a sense of injustice among thosegroups, such as the armed forces, which could not, or traditionallydid not, seek to influence wage negotiations by the threat of strike action. In these circumstances it was important that the Governmentshould avoid making any further concessions if the bakers refusedto cancel their strike, especially since one large bakery firm had agreedto hold the price of bread at its present level for the rest of the sixmonths period recommended by the Board.The Minister of Labour said that there appeared to be little chance at present that the strike would be cancelled on the basis which had been approved by the Cabinet; and he had made it clear to both the employers and the union that the Government were notprepared to go further. It appeared, however, that at least a numberof the employers would be content to pay substantially higher wages,
provided that the price of bread were increased; and we could not exclude the possibility that, despite the Governments policy, asettlement might be reached on this basis.In discussion it was recognised that, embarrassing as asettlement of this kind v/ould be, it would provide further evidenceof the need to place the Governments prices and incomes policy on a statutory basis and would therefore be less damaging than if theGovernment were to accept or condone an overt and deliberatebreach of that policy. Meanwhile the Ministers concerned were considering what preparations should be made against the possibilityof a national strike in the bakery industry; and the Cabinet shouldtake an early opportunity to consider, on the basis of a memorandum to be circulated by the First Secretary of State in consultation withthe Minister of Labour, the longer term implications of the dispute in this industry for the Governments prices and incomes policy asa whole.The Cabinet Took note that the First Secretary of State and the Ministerof Labour would circulate a further memorandum on theGovernments prices and incomes policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd December, 1965
