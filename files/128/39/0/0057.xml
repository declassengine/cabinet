SubjectEconomic Situation
EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (65) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister (C (65) 113)covering a draft of a Parliamentary statement to be made by theChancellor of the Exchequer on additional economic measures.The Prime Minister said that over the previous few days he andthe Ministers in charge of the economic Departments had been considering what measures should be taken in view of the seriouspressure which had developed on sterling. The fundamental problem was a lack of confidence in the future of the United kingdom economy and of the sterling parity. It was not primarily a problemof speculation against the pound although that had contributed to it.The essential problem was that we had sterling deposits of some 4,000 million which had been held in London since the war, mainly by Commonwealth countries. If a lack of confidence in sterlingdeveloped it was natural for part of these reserves to be withdrawn.There was a serious risk that unless strong action were taken whichwould convince financial circles overseas of our determination torectify the balance of payments, further heavy withdrawals wouldtake place.The measures taken already had improved the situation and the deficit in 1965 was expected to be less than half that of 1964.Nevertheless it seemed that the rise in exports was now levelling off and the best estimates which could be made suggested that on present policies there would be a significant deficit even in the second halfof .1966. If we continued restrictions on imports of the present order the deficit might only be of the order of  100 to  150 million a year.But further measures were needed to reinforce existing policies.The measures proposed in the draft Statement were designed toproduce an improvement in all factors affecting the balance ofpayments. Stringent controls had already been introduced on thecapital account and the further measures now proposed were expectedto save  45 million in a full year. The improvement in export credit facilities might produce results greater than were estimated. But themain measures were designed to attack on a selective basis the over-heating which existed in certain parts of the economy and which was having an effect both on our ability to produce goods for export andon the demand for imports. The measures proposed to reduce expenditure in the public sector would be unpalatable. The previous administration had embarked on programmes of expenditure,particularly on construction, which were at present beyond our resources to carry out in full. It was therefore proposed to postponefor a period projects which were not essential. Most of the cuts would fall on the periphery of public expenditure. Schools, houses andhospitals as well as industrial building and projects in high unemployment areas would all be exempted. Local authority expenditure however had risen very greatly and the postponement of the less essential projects would be both sensible, in that it would facilitate the earlier completion of more important works, and popularwith ratepayers. These measures should not cause unemployment, but would lead to a desirable redeployment of labour. In the private
sector, control would be introduced over major projects which werenot essential to the national economy and this should make it easier to defend the postponement of public works.It would also be wise to announce now the postponement ofcertain schemes of social importance which the Government had originally contemplated introducing in the near future. As a resultof the public expenditure review which the Cabinet was undertakingit seemed clear that it would not be possible to find room for theabolition of the remaining health charges, or the introduction ofassistance for private mortgages, in 1966. Nor did it seem possibleto work out a scheme for the income guarantee which would be bothattractive and financially practicable within the limits of social securityexpenditure which were envisaged. If the Government intended inany case to postpone these projects for a time, it would be well to announce this now in the context of the economic difficulties. Therewas no doubt that a reduction in public expenditure both on existingprojects and on new schemes would be regarded overseas as the clearest proof of the Governments intention to get the economy in balance. This would have a far greater effect on confidence thanincreases in taxation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the problem was not simply a temporary lack of confidence in the pound but a seriouslack of confidence overseas in the future of the country. We were continuing to live on borrowings and this situation could not be corrected without a slowing down in the rate of growth of the economy. A reflux of money into London would remove theimmediate difficulties, but as long as the current balance of paymentswas in deficit the economy would be unstable. The level of demand at home was too high to achieve the balance of payments surplus which was essential if we were to begin to repay our borrowings.It was not certain that even the measures suggested in the draft statement would suffice to ensure that our payments were in balanceby the end of 1966.The First Secretary of State said that expert advice was that itmight not be possible to hold the position in the next few weeks unlessconfidence was restored. It might be argued that a change in theexchange rate was necessary to deal with the problem; but ministers were agreed that this possibility should be ruled out. The measuresto be adopted at this point of time should be aimed at achieving themaximum possible effect on confidence overseas for the minimumdamage to the economy at home. Long-term measures for improving the balance of payments in 1966 were of little use if they would not also be likely to restore confidence immediately.In discussion the view was expressed that the measures proposed were contrary to the policy which the Government had previouslyadvocated for the expansion of the economy and that it would be preferable to adopt other means to meet the situation. It was thegeneral view that a change in exchange rates was not acceptable,would not in any event avoid the necessity for other unpalatablemeasures to restore the balance of the economy and might moreoverlead to yet further withdrawal of funds. Measures must therefore be
devised to restore confidence in sterling, to rectify the deficit in thebalance of payments and to enable us to repay our borrowings. Itwas however open to question whether the measures proposed were adequate, or correctly devised for this purpose and it would be damaging if they had before long to be further reinforced. A decision was urgently necessary since expectations had been raised that further measures would be taken and the postponement of an announcementmight of itself have serious consequences.The following points were also made:(a) It could be argued that private consumption ought to be restricted rather than public investment programmes. On the otherhand, the use of the regulator would place further burdens on alcohol,tobacco and petrol on which taxes had already been increased in theearlier Budgets. Moreover, it would increase the cost of living andso lead to additional wage claims and to further strains on the attempt to keep rises in wages in line with increased productivity.An increase in income tax and surtax would, apart from requiringa further Finance Bill which would be difficult to introduce at thispoint in the session, in any case be unacceptable at home and fail to restore confidence abroad.(b) There was a risk that the postponement of public expenditure and the restrictions on private building and hire purchases would lead to a substantial down-turn in the economy by reinforcing theeffect of the measures already taken. There was evidence that therate of growth in the economy had slowed down already and it couldwell be that the result of these measures would be a period ofstagnation after which it would be necessary to reflate the economy.On the other hand, it could be argued that further mild restraint onthe total level of demand was still needed; and that it would be easy to relax the restrictions or to use the regulator if a down-turnseemed likely later in the year.(c) It could be argued that the measures taken in relation to imports and exports would not deal with the fundamental problem.If the position were so serious it would be desirable to introducedirect control of imports, if necessary through quotas, with the aim off reducing the level of imports by some  200 million. It was, however,possible that the retention of the surcharge, which was currentlyholding imports to something like their 1964 level, might createfewer international difficulties, particularly with the commonwealth and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) than theintroduction of quotas. It would not be possible for the Cabinet totake a final decision on this until the reactions of other countries could be assessed, perhaps in September.(d) It would be easier to defend the adoption of the measuresif, at the same time, a substantial cut were made in the defence programme, and particularly in the oversea expenditure involved,The defence Budget could not however be reduced beyond the figurenow envisaged for 1966-67 unless decisions were taken to reduce
existing commitments overseas. The Defence Review would not havereached a stage which would enable such decisions to be taken untilthe autumn.(e) It could be argued that much sterner measures were needed to restrict the growth in wage rates, profits and prices. There was nodoubt that a six months&apos; statutory freeze on wage increases wouldhave more effect on confidence overseas than any other measure. Acomplete freeze of this kind would however be unenforceable andwould only increase the difficulties of a long-term policy. It might,nevertheless, be worth considering whether it should be madecompulsory for wage claims to be submitted to the National board for Prices and Incomes. A much firmer policy might have to beadopted by the Government on wage issues in the future.(/) It would be essential for the Government to show itsdetermination to take action to eradicate restrictive practices on bothsides of industry. The Committee of Enquiry under Lord Devlin intodock working might well provide an occasion for resolute action.(g) It could be argued that the policies proposed were broadly similar to those which had been used by the previous Administration.It would appear that the Government was relying on deflationarypolicies and the creation of unemployment to solve the economic problem. On the other hand, it could be demonstrated that therewere major differences between the policy proposed and that of theprevious Administration, including the selective nature of the cuts in expenditure to preserve measures of industrial or social importance,the discrimination in favour of areas of high unemployment, thelarge reduction in the defence programme and the adoption of thelong-term expansion programme, both for the economy as a whole and for public expenditure programmes in particular.(/?) The effect on the construction industry of the postponement of public sector projects and the introduction of building licensingshould not be under-estimated. It would be likely to cause majordislocations in the programmes of large contractors even if therewere differences of view about the extent of unemployment whichwould arise in the building industry, ft would be wrong to suppose that in six months&apos; time it would be possible to bring forwardprojects in such a way that there would be no disturbance. It wouldbe desirable to give some reassurance to the building industry thatit was not intended to create a large fluctuation in output or to weaken in any way the drive for increased productivity.(i) It would be essential to use the breathing space secured bythe present measures to begin discussions internationally and inparticular with the United States on long-term measures to underpinsterling. It would also be important to make arrangements for the repayment of the present short-term loans. We should however seek an alternative to continued reliance on financial support from theUnited States and other foreign banks, having regard to the consequent constraint imposed on our oversea policy.Summing up the discussion to this point The Prime ministers aid that grave anxiety had been expressed by the Cabinet aboutthe need to adopt the measures proposed in the Draft Statement.
There was however general agreement on the need to restore confidence in sterling and redress the position of our balance ofpayments and though doubts had been expressed on the adequacyor suitability of the measures proposed the balance of opinion wasthat they should be adopted. The control of imports in future was an issue which would require further consideration. It would also benecessary for the Cabinet to discuss more fully and with more adequate time the longer-term economic problem and he would consider how best this could be arranged.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it might be preferable for the Statement in Parliament to be made by the Prime Ministerrather than himself in order to give added weight to the significance of the Statement and in view of the extent of the measures involvedin other departmental fields.In discussion it was recognised that there were also political arguments in favour of this course. On the other hand it was important to maintain the standing of the Chancellor of theExchequer in dealing with the financial problems facing the countryand the balance of opinion was in favour of his making the statement.The Cabinet then considered the text of the proposed Statement.A number of drafting amendments were agreed and in addition thefollowing main points were made:(/) It should be made clear that the postponement of publiccapital projects did not apply to industrial projects or those bearing on the modernisation of industry and research relevant to it.(k) It was recognised that there would be special cases wherethe postponement of the starting date of new contracts for six months would prevent the completion of projects already in hand, wherepostponement would involve waste or where other special factorsoperated. Such cases would have to be considered individually. the wording in the Draft Statement was intended to leave the possibilityof individual exemption open but it would be undesirable to drawspecific attention to it.(/) The reference to loan sanctions for local authorities shouldbe expanded to cover grants.(m) An additional paragraph should be included dealing with government expenditure in 1966-67.(n) The reference to a reduction of  500 million by 1969-70 in defence expenditure should be to  400 million, which was slighty more than the target saving at constant prices. On the same basis the saving in 1966-67 would be about  100 million.(o) The Minister of Works said that he would prefer theminimum limit for licensing of private investment projects to be 150,000 rather than  100,000 in order to enable the administrationof the scheme to be handled at headquarters. The general view,however, was that a limit of  100,000 would be preferable on
economic grounds and that this should be capable of being administered by the Ministry&apos;s headquarters provided there wereconsultation with Regional Boards.(p) Expenditure by the gas and electricity industries onpromoting the sale of their products appeared to be rising excessivelyand reference should be made to its possible reduction.(q) A reference should be included to action to improve theefficiency of the docks and access to them.(r) The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance suggestedthat the postponement of the income guarantee might be made more acceptable by an indication of the Governments longer-term socialpolicies through the amalgamation of the National Assistance board with her Ministry to form a Ministry of Social Security. There was however general agreement that while this might be considered at alater stage it would be premature to take an immediate decision onsuch an issue.(s) The reference to restrictive practices in the conclusion shouldbe omitted since it was not practicable at this stage to includeanything significant about incomes and prices generally.The Cabinet (1) Approved the Draft Statement attached to C (65) 113 asamended during the discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make thestatement in Parliament that afternoon.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th July, 1965.S
