Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (65) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theGovernment of Rhodesia had now replied to the message which hadbeen sent to them as a result of the Cabinets discussion earlier that day and had indicated that they welcomed his proposal to pay a visit to Salisbury in a fresh attempt to break the deadlock in thenegotiations on Rhodesia&apos;s constitutional advance. They had confirmed that he would be free to meet anybody whose views he regarded as relevant.The Cabinet Took note, with satisfaction, of this statement.Iron and steel nationalisation(previous reference:CC (65) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3)*2. The Prime Minister, resuming the discussion at the cabinet meeting earlier that day, said that, since it would be necessary tosettle the text of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament in the near future, the Cabinet must now seek to reach a final decisionon the question whether the Bill to nationalise the iron and steelindustry should be included in the Legislative Programme for the1965-66 Session of Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that, if this measure were deferred,the Government might find it difficult to explain why legislation which had been accepted as urgent a year ago had lost something of its urgency during the interval. Moreover, certain of theGovernments supporters would be reluctant to accept deferment ofa project to which they attached considerable importance; and theGovernment might be criticised for failing to honour a politicalpledge which had figured prominently in the Labour Party&apos;s election manifesto, while retaining in their legislative programme other measures which were politically less significant. Finally, defermentwould raise considerable practical proble ms, in the sense that, ifthere were any substantial interval of time before the proposalsadumbrated in the recent White Paper were put into effect, it wouldbecome increasingly difficult to secure the continued co-operationof the industry in maintaining the precautions against thedissipation of assets which had been made, and had been voluntarilyaccepted by the industry, in anticipation of early legislation. Thecase for such legislation was further reinforced by the fact that, asa result of the recent ruling by the Restrictive Practices Court inrelation to the maximum prices operated by the Iron and Steel Board,it might be necessary in any event to introduce a measure affectingiron and steel during the forthcoming Session; and the Governmentwould be the more vulnerable to criticism if they failed to take this opportunity to enact the more radical measures of reform which hadbeen contemplated in the White Paper.On the other hand it could be argued that the nationalisation of the industry was now not as urgent as several other measurescontained in the legislative programme for the next Session; and it* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET
could reasonably be maintained that a proper allocation of legislativepriorities in relation to the Governments economic policies wouldnot accord a very high place to the Bill to nationalise iron and steel.If so, the Government would not necessarily be held to displaypolitical strength if they now sought to insist on including in theforthcoming legislative programme a measure which, public opinion might consider, remained debatable on merits and was no longer off first urgency. Indeed, it was now generally assumed by publicopinion that the Bill to nationalise the iron and steel industry wouldbe postponed; and the Government would be liable to suffer moreseverely in terms of popular esteem if they insisted on retaining theBill in the legislative programme at the expense of other measureswhich would contribute more effectively to the realisation of the policies of the Labour Party than if they proposed its deferment foran interval.These considerations of policy were reinforced by the practical difficulty of accommodating the necessary legislation within a legislative programme for the forthcoming Session which was alreadyoverburdened. There was little doubt that, if the Governmentproceeded with the Bill to nationalise the iron and steel industry,it would be necessary to jettison several other Bills, e.g., the LocalGovernment Finance Bills, the Housing (Financial Provisions) Billsand the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Old Cases) Bill. In place ofthese important and politically attractive measures the Governmentwould be undertaking to enact a Bill which would be bitterlycontested at all stages in both Houses and would place the maximum of strain on their supporters. Admittedly, one of the measurescontributing to the congestion of the legislative programme was theproposed Bill on Commonwealth Immigration; and one section ofthe Governments supporters might be disposed to criticise a decisionwhereby the legislative programme was held to be unable to accommodate so important a policy measure as the Bill to nationalisethe iron and steel industry but could nevertheless find room for thepolitically arguable Bill on Commonwealth Immigration. It couldnot be assumed, however, that, when the Cabinet reviewed thelegislative programme as a whole, it would be found possible in any event to retain the latter Bill in face of the competition of other measures which could claim higher priority on both social andeconomic grounds.A more serious objection to the omission of the measure to nationalise iron and steel from the forthcoming legislative programme was the fact that it would not be possible for the industry to remainin a state of indefinite suspense on the basis of the arrangementsoutlined in the recent White Paper. The industry would realise thatthose arrangements, particularly in so far as they inhibited anydissipation of assets, were not reinforced by any sanction butdepended upon the co-operation of the industry itself. In so far asthe industry saw fit to take advantage of the interval provided bydeferment of the Bill to redispose their assets it would be impossiblefor the Government thereafter to introduce a measure of nationalisation except on the basis of a hybrid Bill; and this would
LegislativeProgramme1965-66(previous reference:CC (65) 35thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (65) 133) on the Legislative Programme1965-66.The Lord President said that it was now necessary to review thelegislative programme for the coming Session in order both to avoid giving undertakings in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament which the Government might be unable to fulfil and toestablish priorities so that Parliamentary Counsel might concentrate on drafting those Bills which must be introduced early in the Session.CC 53 (65)be liable to be an even more protracted and contentious measurethan the Bill at present in question. Moreover, the compensationarrangements envisaged in the White Paper would becomeprogressively out of date and inapplicable. It was for consideration whether the Government should take statutory powers to enforce the safeguards against dissipation of assets in the interim period before legislation to nationalise the industry was introduced. Butthere would be considerable objections to any compromise of thiskind; and it might be wiser to leave it to the industry to appreciate that, to the extent to which they sought to evade the intentions ofthe White Paper in the interval before a new Bill was introduced,it wouid be open to the Government to claim that compensationprovisions which might have been reasonable in 1965 were no longerappropriate in the changed circumstances which would obtain at alater date. This should prove a considerable deterrent to any attemptto frustrate the purposes of the White Paper.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared to be the preponderant view of the Cabinet that it wouldbe preferable that no mention should be made of the Bill to nationalise the iron and steel industry in The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament but that he himself should explain in his speech in the Debate on the Address the reasons for which theGovernment had decided to defer action in this respect. He would emphasise that this decision entailed no more than the postponement of the Bill; and it might be necessary to make it clear that if, as aresult, the eventual legislation had to take the form of a hybrid Bill,the Government would be prepared to face this situation on thebasis of an assumption that, if the industry had sought to evade inthe interval the safeguards against redisposition of assets which hadbeen contained in the White Paper, the Bill would seek to invalidatetransactions of this kind so far as possible and the Governmentwould be entitled to reconsider the other arrangements embodied inthe White Paper, particularly the terms of compensation.The Cabinet Agreed to defer, in relation to the legislative programme for the 1965-66 Session, the introduction of legislation to nationalise the iron and steel industry.
The programme approved by the Cabinet in July, together with otherBills which it had since become necessary to add, had been reviewed by The Queen&apos;s Speeches Committee. It would be impossible totake in a single session all the Bills concerned and the Committeehad therefore sought to identify those which, however desirable,could not be given priority and to arrange the remainder into groups to be introduced, respectively before Christmas, in January and later.The Committee considered it necessary to relegate to the reserve listBills on Superannuation and Pirate Broadcasting and to hold backBills on Overseas Aid, Criminal Justice, Children and National Parks.Without these, the programme was estimated to occupy 82 days onthe floor of the House of Commons, or 87 if the Investment GrantsBill were too late to be taken in Standing Committee; there would normally be some 56 days available. If it were desired to pass allthe Bills in the programme, it would be necessary to shorten therecesses and arrange an extended autumn Session, but it seemedpreferable to plan the programme on the basis that Bills should be passed by the end of July, and to seek to reduce it accordingly. TheCommittee recommended the addition to the programme of a colonial Enabling Bill, to enable the Government to conferindependence, or a new status short of independence, on a colonial territory by Order in Council. It was unlikely that such a Bill couldbe introduced much before the following Easter, but although itmight initially take more time than Bills providing individually forthe independence of Colonial territories, it was worth introduction in the present Session in the hope that it would save some of thoseBills which would otherwise be required before the Summer Recess.In discussion the following principal points were made:(a) The Investment Grants Bill could be sent to StandingCommittee if it were introduced in February. If not, it would haveto be taken on the floor of the House of Commons, ft would bea substantial Bill, including provisions for the continuation of powers under the Local Employment Acts and it might also be necessaryto introduce a separate Bill for the establishment of the proposedfndustrial Reorganisation Finance Corporation.(/;) In view of the heavy pressure on the Parliamentarytimetable, the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill might be deferred,ft was not required for the purpose of reducing the number ofvouchers, which had already been done by administrative action, andit would in any event be necessary to have a major Bill in a laterSession to put immigration controls on a permanent basis. On theother hand, a Bill was necessary to check evasion, the extent of whichwould become apparent from the figures which it was customary to publish from time to time, and the Government would be liableto be criticised if, after the consultations carried out by LordMountbatten&apos;s Mission and the publication of a White Paper, theydid not take steps to prevent evasion and to provide for medicalchecks which they had declared to be necessary. A substantial bodyof opinion was, however, critical of the White Paper, as was opinion in some of the dependent territories, and it was difficult to argue thatthe Bill was of such urgency that it must be included in the legislative
programme in preference to other important measures. On balance,the best course seemed to be to defer the Bill to the 1966-67 session and to justify doing so in the course of the debate on The Addresson the ground of the greater urgency of other Government measures.(c) The Overseas Aid Bill was required if aid was to be puton a proper statutory basis. Aid could continue for another year under the Appropriation Act, but the Bill was also required to giveeffect to the decision announced in the White Paper on overseas development: The Work of the New Ministry (Cmnd. 2736) toestablish an overseas service pensions fund for the proposed corps of specialists. The Bill should therefore be included in theprogramme though not with priority over Bills required early in the session. Consideration should be given to the inclusion in it of theprovisions of the Indus Basin Development Bill.(d) The Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill should,if possible, be combined with the corresponding measure for Englandand Wales.(e) It would be desirable to secure the passage during the session, if possible in the spring, of the Colonial Independence(Enabling Powers) Bill as a means both of saving time otherwiserequired for separate Independence Bills and of facilitating thedevelopment of a policy of conferring on dependent territories a newstatus short of independence.(/) The Criminal Justice Bill and the Children Bill were majormeasures of social reform. The former was urgently needed as a means of reducing overcrowding in prisons and enabling constructivework to be undertaken. The Children Bill would implement policies which the Government had recently announced in the White paper on The Child, The Family and The Young Offender (Cmnd. 2742),and it would be unfortunate if progress could not be made with this aspect of the Governments social policy. Although the criminla justice Bill could not be ready for some time because work on it had had to be suspended in favour of Bills required before Christmas,it might, nevertheless, be possible to secure its passage later in the session. There was little prospect, however, of time being found forthe Children Bill, and it seemed preferable to devote the coming months to consultation with local authorities and others concerned,some of whom had reservations about the proposals, with a viewto the introduction of a Bill early in the 1966-67 Session.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill shouldbe omitted from the programme for the coming Session, on theunderstanding that it should be made clear in the Debate on the address that it had merely been deferred to the 1966-67 Session onaccount of the volume of more urgent legislation which it wasnecessary to pass in the coming Session. The Bills on Children and national Parks should also be deferred. The Bills on Oversea aid and Criminal Justice should remain in the programme, but could notbe given priority in drafting over Bills required early in the Session.
The Colonial Independence (Enabling Powers) Bill should be fittedinto the programme if possible, and it might become necessary to add a separate Bill on the Industrial Reorganisation finance corporation. It was recognised that it was unlikely that all the Billsremaining in the programme could be passed and that preferencemust be given to those most urgently needed. The Lord president should keep the programme under review in order to ensure themaintenance of suitable priorities.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Commonwealth Immigrants, Children and national Parks Bills should not be included in thelegislative programme for 1965-66.(2) Took note that it might be necessary to add to theprogramme a Bill on the Industrial ReorganisationFinance Corporation.(3) Subject to (1) and (2) above, approved the legislative programme annexed to C (65) 133.(4) Invited the Lord President of the Council to keep theprogress of the legislative programme under review.Queen&apos;s Speech       4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lordon the President of the Council (C (65) 134) to which was attached the prorogation or   ,   .    . -       ,0       . .       n      i-Parliament      draft 0* * he Queen s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There would be advantage in the conflation of paragraphs and 8 of the draft to eliminate the duplication in references to therecent Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.(b) Reference should be made to the meeting of the FirstCommonwealth Medical Conference.(c) It was suggested that there should be mention of the Murder(Abolition of Death Penalty) Act in view of the importance of this measure. It was, however, the general view that since The Queen&apos;sSpeech could not properly mention a Private Members Bill, such a reference would not be appropriate.Certain other amendments were agreed.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs, to consider in the light of thediscussion the conflation of paragraphs 3 and 8 of thedraft.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) and to the amendments agreed in discussion approved the draft annexed to C (65) 134.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd October, 1965.
