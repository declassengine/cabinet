2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPublic Building and Works (C (65) 94) on the redevelopment of the whithall area, to which was appended the draft of a proposedParliamentary statement on this subject. An amended draft of this statement was circulated during the discussion.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that the plans for the redevelopment of the Whitehall area which had been preparedby Sir Leslie Martin and Professor Colin Buchanan were far reachingand might not be fully realised for half a century; but, if theGovernment failed to endorse the general principles involved,piecemeal development of the area would effectively prevent the realisation of a bold and imaginative scheme. He therefore proposedto announce that the Government accepted the reports as the framework within which the future development of the parliament square and Whitehall areas should take place, particularly as regardsthe concept of a precinct in and around Parliament Square, fromwhich traffic not serving the area should gradually be withdrawn;FutureGovernmentBusiness(previous reference:CC (65) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5)Development ofWhitehall area-CC 37 (65)1. The Lord President of the Council recalled that he had been invited to review, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, the forward programme of publication of departmental White Papers.In so far as these were likely to provoke political controversy it wouldbe undesirable that they should be published during the final weeks of the current Session or early in the Recess; and their release should therefore be deferred until mid-August. Thereafter they should bepublished at appropriate intervals. On this basis he would circulate,for consideration by the Ministers concerned, a list of the white papers in question and the dates of publication proposed.In discussion it was suggested that, although the Governmentwere largely committed to publication before the Recess of a white paper on Overseas Aid, it might be desirable to defer action in thisrespect until September, when it would be possible to consider theprogramme of aid, which imposed a considerable burden on thebalance of payments, in relation both to other proposals which madeheavy demands on resources, e.g., the forward housing programme,and to the Economic Plan, which was timed for publication aboutthe same time.The Prime Minister said that further discussion of this question should be postponed until the Minister of Overseas Developmentcould express her views and the Cabinet had had an opportunity toconsider, at an early meeting, the future programme of public expenditure as a whole.The Cabinet Took note of the Lord Presidents statement about the forward programme of publication of departmental white papers.
the need to develop the Bridge Street site for Parliamentary purposes and as Government offices; and the importance of carrying outfeasibility studies of the project for building a riverside tunnel fromthe Embankment to Lambeth Bridge and of the related roadproposals.It would be important to make it clear that, in so far as further government building was involved, this must be consistent with theGovernments policy of restraining the growth of office employmentin London and that during the currency of the present restrictionson office building in the metropolis the development of the area inquestion would be carried out in conformity with that policy. In fact,however, there need be no conflict between the proposals in thereports and the Governments policies in this respect. Even ifdecisions were taken immediately it would not be possible to startconstruction on the Bridge Street site until 1968; the site would notbe redeveloped, and available for staff to be moved from the presentForeign Office building, until 1971; the rebuilding of the ForeignOffice itself could not be expected to be completed until 1975; andit would be at least 1980 before the Great George Street site couldbe redeveloped. During this period the policy relating to the controlof office building in general would inevitably be modified; and itwould be unrealistic to seek to make the Governments endorsement of an imaginative long-term scheme conditional on the observance of restrictions which might well have been substantially changedbefore it came to fruition. Moreover, Whitehall and parliament square constituted the administrative centre of a city which was atonce the capital of the United Kingdom and the centre of theCommonwealth; and their development should be accepted as being in a class apart from the development of other sites for office building.Finally, experience had shown that the cost of accommodating civilservants in leasehold buildings dispersed throughout London wasunnecessarily high; and on grounds of economy and efficiency theyshould be housed in Crown buildings. This policy need not imply any increase in the total number of civil servants in London as awhole; it would merely denote a greater degree of concentrationwithin the Whitehall area.The Minister of State, Board of Trade (Mr. Darling) said thatthe proposals in C (65) 94 foreshadowed an increase of office accommodation which might well conflict with the government&apos;s policy and would be liable to constitute an embarrassing precedent in relation to office building projects in the private sector which theGovernment were concerned to seek to restrain. It would thereforebe preferable to amend the proposed statement to indicate that theGovernment building contemplated in this area would be subject tothe same restrictions as other office building in London.In discussion there was general agreement that the imaginativequality of the proposals for the development of the centre of thecapital over the next 30 years should not be obscured by the need to have proper regard to current restrictions on office building andto the financial exigencies of the immediate economic situation. Whilethe timing of the expenditure involved and the manner of the
proposed development must take these difficulties in account, theGovernment should declare their firm intention to develop this area in the longer term in accordance with the principles of Sir LeslieMartin&apos;s report.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Any substantial expenditure on construction would not be incurred before 1968. A statement of policy on the lines proposed would not, therefore, imply any premature degree of financial commitment.(b) In principle it would facilitate the conduct of government business and be conducive to economy in expenditure if those departments which remained in London were concentrated in the whithall area and were accommodated in Crown buildings ratherthan in rented premises. This need not imply, however, any changein the policy of dispersing Government staffs from London tothe provinces to the maximum possible extent; and the proposed statement should emphasise this fact. It might also include with advantage some statistical information about the high cost ofmaintaining Government Departments in rented accommodation andthe economies which might ultimately be achieved by building newCrown offices. But, in order to give effect to the undertaking inthe proposed statement that during the currency of the present restrictions on office building in London development would becarried out in conformity with this policy, the Bridge Street siteshould not be developed to a greater capacity than 300,000 square feet, even though the building might be designed to be capable of extension at a subsequent stage.(c) The concentration of Government staffs in the Whitehallarea would imply the vacation of offices elsewhere in London; andit would be necessary to ensure that this did not provide opportunities for evasion of the Governments plans for the limitation of office accommodation in London as a whole.(d) The wording of the proposed statement should not be suchas to prejudice the rebuilding of the Foreign Office block as soon aspossible. On the other hand work on this project could not beginuntil the major part of the staffs concerned had been rehoused inthe new building on the Bridge Street site. It would be preferable,therefore, to combine the first two sentences of the fourth paragraphof the proposed statement in order to make it clear that both siteswould be redeveloped as soon as practicable.(e) The proposals relating to the rerouting of traffic in the westminster area were less precise and more arguable than those concerned with site redevelopment. In particular, the proposedriverside tunnel would require further study before its feasibilitycould be decided. It might also prove impossible to remove trafficaltogether from a precinct in Parliament Square. The statement should therefore, be amended to emphasise the need for furtherconsideration of the proposals relating to traffic before decisions
could be taken. Meanwhile, however, it was important that thecurrent efforts for the improvement of the traffic flow in this area should be continued as a matter of urgency.(/) The statement should also refer to the part to be played inthese developments by the Greater London Council.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas broad agreement with the proposals in C (65) 94; and the draft statement should now be further considered, in the light of thediscussion, by the Ministers primarily concerned. Agreement inprinciple did not, however, commit the Government to any decisionon the precise timetable for the construction of the government offices involved, which would require further examination whendetailed plans and estimates were available.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 94 in principle.(2) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and other Ministers concerned, to revise thedraft statement in the light of the discussion.land commission(previous reference:CC(65) 13thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet considered memorandaLand and Natural Resources (C (65) 96 and policy in connection with the establishment of with particular reference to betterment levy; aChancellor of the Exchequer (C (65) 100) on capital gains tax; and a note by the MinisterResources (C (65) 95) to which was appendedon the Land Commission.by the Minister of102) on problems ofa Land Commission,memorandum by the betterment levy andof Land and Naturala draft White PaperBetterment levy and capital gains taxThe Minister of Land said that the proposal to create a land commission was based on the concept that development value which was created by the community should be recovered for thecommunity, provided that the landowner retained a sufficientproportion of that value as an incentive to put his land on themarket. In conformity with this concept it was proposed that development value should be subject to a single betterment charge,levied by the Land Commission, and not to capital gains tax inaddition to the betterment levy. If this arrangement were adopted,there might be a progressive rate of levy. But, although there wouldbe no difficulty in providing in legislation for the rate to be raised from time to time, any attempt to prescribe the dates on which itwould be increased might provoke undesirable fluctuations in thesupply of land; and it could be argued that it would be equallyunwise to announce the amounts of the proposed increases. Thebalance of advantage, however, seemed to incline in favour ofspecifying the amounts involved, but not the dates on which theywould take effect.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be undesirable to remove development value from the scope of capital gains tax and to subject it only to betterment levy. During the recentParliamentary debates on the Finance Bill the capital gains tax hadbeen presented as a comprehensive tax, which should apply to everytype of capital gain; and the Government had successfully resistedattempts by the Opposition to confine it to a limited field. To adopta different policy in relation to development value would thereforeexpose the Government to charges of both indecision and breach of faith. Moreover, it would involve withdrawing reliefs given in theFinance Bill to owner-occupiers and small taxpayers; and theGovernment would face determined opposition in the House ofCommons to the imposition on the whole of development value ofa levy which, unlike capital gains tax, would take no account of individual means and would comprise an element of retrospection.Persons in substantially similar positions would be treated differently the property-dealing company from the land-owning company, theowner of land from the owner of shares in a land-owning company.The valuable distinction between the short-term and long-term gainsof the speculator would be lost, as would the advantage that the weight of the capital gains tax would increase gradually over aperiod. The administrative problems which would ensue would beformidable.In discussion it was suggested that the proposal would not makea formal breach in the comprehensive nature of the capital gains tax,since this would continue to be chargeable on increases in existing use value. Only the special increment of value resulting from thegrant of planning permission would be affected; and, unless thisincrement were charged wholly to betterment levy, not only would the principle of retaining a due proportion of development value forthe community be obscured but the rates of levy which it would be practicable to charge at the beginning of the Land Commission^operations would be so low that it would be difficult to convincepublic opinion of the necessity for the establishment of theCommission. The general public would expect to see development value charged solely to levy as a means of fulfilling the Governmentspledge to reduce the price of land. Moreover, there was a risk that,if the levy were seen as an addition to capital gains tax, there wouldbe pressure that individual ability to pay, a consideration which wasproperly relevant to taxation, should also be applied to the levy,despite the fact that the levy was directed to the wholly differentsocial purpose of recovering for the community a reasonable partof the additional wealth which the community had helped to create.From this point of view a distinction could reasonably be drawn between the exemption of an owner-occupier from capital gains tax on the increased value of his house, which was intended to enable him to meet the cost of replacement, and the imposition of levy onthe development value of his surplus land; and, while administrative difficulties would undoubtedly be encountered if betterment levy were
made the sole charge in the latter case, it was not clear that theywould be any less if it were combined with capital gains tax.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour ofsubjecting development value solely to betterment levy and not tocaptial gains tax. It was agreed that the rate of the levy shouldinitially be 40 per cent, rising to 45 per cent and 50 per cent, at intervals which should not be publicly specified.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the development value of land should be exempt from capital gains tax and made subject to bettermentlevy; and that it should be increased at intervals, whichshould not be specified in public, from an initial rate of40 per cent to 45 per cent and, subsequently, 50 per cent.Permanent endowment land of charitiesThe Minister of Land said that charities held land in three categories functional land, which was directly used for the purposesof the charity; permanent endowment land, which had been givenin perpetuity in order to provide the charity with income and was subject to restrictions on sale; and land which was held as an investment and was not subject to restrictions. It had been agreedthat functional land, but not investment land, should be exempt frombetterment levy. The question now at issue v/as whether permanentendowment land should be similarly exempt. It had not been found possible to distinguish between one charity and another, or one sale and another, on the basis of the social value of either the charityor the particular transaction, without raising the question whetherpurposes which the Government did not regard as socially valuableshould nevertheless be recognised as charitable. But to exempt thepermanent endowment land of all charities on the ground that, bydefinition, it served a social purpose would be contrary to theprinciple that increases in the value of land created by the community should not accrue solely to the owner, a principle which appliedequally to charitable as to other landowners. Moreover, theGovernment would be open to political criticism if they introduced the Bill in a form which permitted, for example, Eton College toretain the full market value of the development land which theyowned in London but did not enable a local authority to retain thedevelopment value of its land for its own social purposes.In discussion it was pointed out that, since the control of thesale of permanent endowment land exercised by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science, the Charity Commissioners, theChurch Commissioners and the Courts ensured in practice that money realised by the sale of permanent endowment land was appliedto charitable purposes, it was possible to distinguish charities fromother landowners on the ground that their purposes had forgenerations been recognised to be deserving of encouragement.Moreover, while there might be political criticism of the exemption of individual charities, charities as a whole commanded considerable
-2bpublic sympathy arid support; and Members of ail Parties would find themselves under embarrassing pressure from the supporters of smalllocal charities in their constituencies if their endowment lands weremade subject to betterment levy.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the permanent endowment land of charitiesshould be exempt from betterment levy.White paper in discussion of the draft White Paper, the following main points were made:(a) As a matter of presentation it might be useful in the historicalsurvey in Section I to refer, although preferably without suggestingany sympathy with the feudal system, to the fact that originallyownership of land had carried with it obligations to render service.(b) Section IV on the Land Commission^ powers of acquisitionhad been revised in order to bring out more clearly the governments proposals for developing the Land Commission^ functions and powers in stages and so to avoid creating unnecessary alarm aboutthe operations of the Commission in the initial stage. From this pointof view, however, paragraphs 14 and 17 might be further improved by minor drafting amendments.(c) The absence in paragraph 20 of any indication of intentionto make the more rapid procedure for compulsory purchase, as wellas the new vesting procedure, available to all bodies with powersof compulsory purchase would be likely to attract criticism from local authorities. It would not be appropriate, however, to commit the Government to any such intention in advance of a thorough examination of compulsory purchase procedures, possibly by anindependent committee. But it could be disclosed, if necessary, thatthe Government had compulsory purchase procedures generallyunder consideration.(d) The reference in paragraph 22 to leasehold enfranchisementshould be examined at a later stage, when decisions of policy onthis subject had been taken.(e) The third sentence of paragraph 24 should be amended to read: &quot; Where this is not possible, however, with the consent ofMinisters the Commission themselves will have power to providehouses for disposal direct.&quot;(/) The last sentence of paragraph 24, which referred to thepossibility of using some of the proceeds of the Commission^activities to finance cheaper mortgages, should be omitted in favourof some more general statement about assistance to owner-occupiers.(g) The passage in paragraph 36 discussing the means by whichadditional assistance might be given to local authorities as a resultof the operations of the Land Commission should be omitted. Itwould be unwise- to canvass the problems before the current
discussions with local authorities had been completed; but it mightbe possible to give some informal indication of the governments intentions when the White Paper was published.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the amendments proposed in discussion shouldbe considered by the Minister of Land and Natural Resources inconsultation with the Ministers concerned; and, if agreement on a form of words could not be reached, the matter should be referredto the Lord President. Otherwise, the draft White Paper was approved. At present it was proposed that it should be published inSeptember; but the precise date would need to be further considered in connection with the programme for the publication of other white papers likely to appear in the autumn.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Land and Natural Resources todiscuss with the Ministers concerned the amendments tothe draft White Paper which had been suggested in discussion and, if agreement was not reached, to refer the matter to the Lord President of the Council.(4) Subject to Conclusion (3) above, approved the draft white paper appended to C (65) 95.(5) Took note that the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Minister of Land and natural resources, would consider the date of the publication ofthe White Paper in the context of the programme for thepublication of other major statements of government policy.Education(previous reference:CC (65) 6thConclusions,Minute 7)Public Schools4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Education and Science (C (65) 88 and 99) about the publis schools.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that on17th December, 1964, his predecessor had announced that he proposed &quot; to set up an educational trust with a view to the integration of the public schools within the State system ofeducation.&quot; His own proposals for achieving this objective had subsequently been approved in principle by the Social services committee; but the Committee had considered that further action should be deferred until the autumn. It would be desirable, however,to give some interim indication of the Governments intentions;and he therefore proposed to announce, in answer to a parliamentary question, that the Governments preparations for setting up a publis schools Commission to advise on the best way of integrating thepublic schools into the State system of education had reached an advanced stage; that he now proposed to invite the views of interested parties; that he also intended to take into account the study byDr. Lambert of boarding school education as a whole; and that he hoped to establish the Commission in the next Session of Parliament.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th July, 1965.The Commission might be established early in 1966 and couldbe expected to take some two years to complete its work, includingthe implementation of pilot schemes. Thereafter, it should be possibleto embark on a major plan of integration by the autumn of 1969.No major charge to public funds would be involved until the finalstage of this plan. The ultimate cost would depend upon theGovernments policy decisions; but the maximum expenditure wouldbe of the order of  23-24 million if all boarding places wereeventually taken over by the State.Discussion showed general agreement with the terms of theannouncement proposed, on the understanding that this did not imply any decision on the detailed proposals which the Social services committee had recommended until they had been further consideredby the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 88.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science to circulate in due course his proposals on the future of thepublic schools.
