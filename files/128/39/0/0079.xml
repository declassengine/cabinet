CC 63 (65)London 1.   The Cabinet considered  a memorandum  by  the  FirstTransport       Secretary of State on London Transport Fares (C(65) 153).FaresThe First Secretary of State said that earlier in the year theLondon Transport Board had proposed to increase fares by anaverage of 10 per cent from May 1965. The Government had at thattime requested the Board to postpone the increase while a thorough examination was made of the possibility that more extensivemeasures of traffic management and restraint would improve theconditions under which the Board operated. The government undertook to make good to the Board the loss of revenue from notraising fares; and this would cost just under  4 million until the endof 1965. An examination had been carried out by the Departmentsconcerned together with the Greater London Council and theLondon Transport Board; but it had not resolved the basic problemsof transport in London and it was clear that for this purpose more time was needed. He himself, together with a minority of themembers of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development,thought it would be desirable to delay any decision on fare increases for a further six months and to use the time to work out proposalsfor the longer-term solution of London&apos;s traffic problems. An increasein fares would be much more acceptable if it could be presented aspart of a series of measures dealing with the whole traffic problem.Even on the basis of an increase in fares averaging 10 per centLondon Transport would still be running at a loss in 1966; and thiswould have to be met by a subsidy of some kind. This course would therefore make the worst of both worlds.A majority of the Committee, however, took the view that faresshould be increased in January 1966 by 10 per cent. They did notconsider that there was any evidence that solutions of the long-term problem could be devised in the course of a few months or that therewas any hope of enabling London Transport to pay its way withoutperiodic increases in fares. They thought that it would be wrong to finance a deficit of London Transport from the Exchequer andtherefore from taxpayers throughout the country.It was necessary for the Cabinet now to decide whether thereshould be a further delay in increases of fares, with an extension ofthe Government^ subsidy for a further six months, or whether itwas undesirable to continue to hold down fares,. Due weight shouldbe given to the possible effect on incomes policy of a substantial increase in London. The Government had been making strenuous efforts, both in the public and private sectors, to restrain price increases in order to improve the chances of restraining the rise in incomes. It was particularly important at the present time to lengthenthe period of time between wage claims; and stability of prices overthe next few months would be especially valuable.The Minister of Transport said that the study for whichthe Government had asked in May on the possibility of improving the conditions under which London Transport operated in central london and on possible economies in the services provided by
London Transport had been completed by mid-October. But thisreport showed that it was not likely that in the foreseeable futurethere would be any great improvement in the present position,although it could be prevented from becoming worse. In thesecircumstances there seemed little to be gained from delaying stillfurther some increase in London fares, particularly since the Londonstandstill was embarrassing in relation to fare increases elsewhere inthe country and was also adding  1 million a year to the deficit ofBritish Railways in respect of London commuter services. Therewas little evidence to suggest that an increase in fares would leadto a major loss of traffic or to any serious increase in the use ofprivate transport in Central London itself. Indeed, a great part ofthe problem facing London Transport v/as the loss of off-peak traffic which followed directly from the increase in car ownership, but wasnot associated with times and places of serious congestion. He v/asabout to put to the Ministerial Committee on Transport Policies amemorandum about possible ways of restricting the use of cars in central London, particularly by commuters; but there were serious difficulties in all possible courses.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said thatthe Ministerial Sub-Committee on Transport Policies were meetingon the following day in order to consider the fundamental problems affecting London Transport. The Sub-Committee had not been ableto discuss these problems earlier because the necessary basicinformation was only just becoming available. Although theSub-Committee had considered that an increase in fares would not make their task more difficult, they had not had before them anyprecise information about the effects of an increase on either london transport revenue or traffic congestion. He himself considered thatthere would be advantages in deferring the increase for a further period while the Sub-Committee formulated recommendations on policy, even though they might ultimately conclude that fare increases were inevitable. It would be particularly awkward to announce anincrease in fares just when the Greater London Council had appealedfor the use of public transport rather than private transport byChristmas shoppers.In discussion varying views were expressed about the desirabilityof a further delay in increasing fares. On the one hand it was argued that increases were unavoidable from time to time; and it would be wrong to propose yet further delay. It could also be maintained thatthe Government were beginning to treat nationalised industriesdifferently from private industry as regards price increases. On theother hand it was suggested that the information about trafficdevelopments in the longer term was still inadequate and that itwould therefore be wrong to take a decision about an increase in fares at this time, particularly in view of the possible effect on incomes policy.The Prime Minister said it was difficult for the Cabinet to forma final view on fare increases when the Ministerial Sub-Committeeon Transport Policies were on the point of considering thefundamental problems of transport policy in London. It would be
Prices andIncomesPolicyArmed forces pay(previous reference :CC (65) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (65) 158) setting out draft terms of reference to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes on the pay of the armed forces.The Prime Minister said that, since the meeting of the Cabineton 18th November, the Chiefs of Staff had expressed considerableconcern about the proposed reference of the increase in the pay ofthe Armed Forces to the Board. They had emphasised the risk to service morale and to recruiting prospects while the Board were considering the question; and they had expressed the view that the reference might be interpreted as a breach of contract in relation tothe terms on which Servicemen had been recruited. The cabinet would wish to take full account of these views in deciding the wording of the terms of the reference to the Board, which had nowbeen agreed, as indicated in C (65) 158, subject to residualdisagreement on the inclusion of the final phrase which mentioned&quot; the commitment to the Services represented by the system ofbiennial reviews&quot;.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the absence of any reference to the Governments commitment to the Services, asexemplified by the &quot; Grigg &quot; system of biennial reviews, would be liable to intensify the doubts which would be raised in any event bythe reference to the Board.CC 63 (65)desirable, therefore, that a decision should be deferred for a fortnight;and in the meantime the Sub-Committee should report whether they considered that in the course of six months there was reasonablehope of finding effective ways of dealing with the problems ofLondon Transport. It seemed to be generally agreed that there was little prospect that London Transport would be able to cover thewhole of their costs from fare revenue in the foreseeable future andthat there were serious objections to meeting the deficit indefinitelyfrom the Exchequer. What was now required, therefore, was an appraisal of the possibilities of raising additional revenue by charges of one kind or another for the use of cars in London, which couldbe used to subsidise London Transport and might at the same timehelp to reduce congestion in Central London. The possibility ofconfining such additional charges to cars owned by commercialconcerns and car-hire firms should not be excluded.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Transport policies to report as soon as possible on the prospects of findingsolutions to the fundamental problems of london transport within a period of six months.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of London Transport faresin the light of this report.
The First Secretary of State said that it was important not topre-judge the issue presented to the Board. Moreover, theGovernment were not committed to adopting the rates of pay arisingfrom the &quot; Grigg&quot; formula, although they were committed toreviews being held on the basis of that formula.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in addition to these objections, no similar reference to a commitment was to be includedin the proposed reference to the Board of the Franks Committeerecommendations on the pay of the Higher Civil Service, although itcould be argued that the extent of the commitment here was at least as great as in the case of the &quot; Grigg &quot; formula. These terms ofreference had already been communicated to the National Staff Side.After discussion the Prime Minister suggested, and it was agreed,that the most appropriate means of dealing with this point wouldbe to include, at the beginning of the terms of reference, a statement that-&quot; The Government are committed to carrying out a reviewof Service pay at two-yearly intervals in accordance with theprocedure described in Cmnd. 945.&quot;The Cabinet then considered the procedure for giving evidence to the Board. It was agreed that the Ministry of Defence should prepare a memorandum about the &quot; Grigg &quot; system and the problems involved in recruiting and retaining sufficient men to meet the commitments of the Services. Relevant factual information fromother Departments should be included in the same memorandum,which should be confined to a factual statement of the position andshould not seek to argue points of view. If it proved impossible toreach agreement between the Departments concerned on the text ofthe evidence, the matter should be remitted for further considerationby the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,and, if necessary, by the Cabinet. Officials of the Ministry ofDefence and of other Departments concerned would give oral evidence at the request of the Board; but it would be.important toavoid creating any impression that the Board were in any senseexpected to adjudicate between Departments or. to do more thangive an advisory opinion on an issue on which the. final decisionrested with the Cabinet:It was ,agreed that..it,would, be.desirable that the reference tothe Board should be announced..by the First.

Earnings-related short-term benefits(previous reference :CC (65) 60thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C (65) 157) on the implications for the public sector of thechange in the basis of contracting out proposed by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, recalled that, at the Cabinetsprevious discussion, the Minister of Pensions had explained theadvantages that would flow from the changes in the arrangements for contracting out of the graduated national insurance pension schemewhich she had proposed in connection with the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefits. The Cabinet had, however, been concerned at the effect of these changes on employees in the public sector and had invited him to give further consideration to their implications. The changes proposed by the Minister would most seriously affect the half million civil servants and members of the armed Forces who did not contribute towards their occupational pensions and had earnings of over  14 a week. These would pay upto approximately 5s. a week extra in contributions and their totalpension provision would at the same time be reduced by up to 120 at the maximum. These numbers would be balanced by anotherhalf million, earning less than  14 a week, for whom a reduction inpension provision would be offset by a reduction of up to 5s. a week in contributions.Elsewhere in the public sector, occupational schemes werecontributory and adjustments could be made both to the occupational contribution and to pension provision which would help to offset the effect of the changes in the national insurancearrangements. It would be necessary to amend the Police and firemen&apos;s schemes in order to enable such adjustments to be made.There would, however, still be a substantial number of marriedwomen, especially teachers, who would have to pay up to 6s. a weekmore in contributions. Employees in the public sector would gainadditional cover for widowhood; on the other hand they were unlikely to benefit directly from the provision of earnings-relatedsickness and unemployment benefit.The disadvantages for employees in the public sector resultedessentially from the application of the principle that public service pensions must be abated in respect of national insurance graduatedCC 63 (65)(2) Agreed that a single memorandum of evidence, describing the factual position in relation to Service pay, should besubmitted to the Board on behalf of the Government.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to announce the referenceto the Board of the pay of the Armed Forces and of the franks Committee&apos;s recommendations on the pay of theHigher Civil Service in the House of Commons on25th November and to agree the text of his announcementwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Defence.
pension. The necessary negotiations between employing authoritiesand employees would take time; and, while the Treasury would enter upon them with an open mind, it was not possible to predict theiroutcome in particular, whether some modification of the principleof abatement might have to be conceded. In the meantime, if theeconomic advantages of earnings-related unemployment benefit werenot to be deferred, it was necessary to reach an early decision onthe changes proposed by the Minister, which were both logical andprobably inevitable.In discussion it was pointed out that, despite the case in equityfor increasing the contribution of the higher paid contracted outemployee, this would inevitably provoke a strong reaction when itwas associated with a concurrent loss of pension rights, as would bethe case in respect of civil servants and members of the armed forces earning over  14 a week. It was argued that the effect onthe Armed Forces would be particularly unfortunate and that, toensure that no one was worse off, it would be necessary for theMinistry of Defence to pay the additional contributions as well as topay service pension in full. The effect of the changes on civil servants and the Armed Forces could only be satisfactorily mitigated by somedeparture from the principle of full abatement, and it was argued that some modification of this principle was justified on grounds of equity, both as it applied to the abatement of pension and to the abatement of pay during sickness. It was also pointed out that thefigures for increased contributions quoted in C (65) 157 were notsolely related to pensions but included the additional \ per cent thatwas being charged for earnings-related short-term benefits; that theydid not reflect the possible reduction of 4d. in the flat rate contribution; that the figure of  120 quoted as being the maximum amount that would be lost in pension rights represented the extreme case which would not occur for 47 years; and that the extra cost ofthe change to the Police and Firemen would be greater thanindicated.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the absence of an indication of the extent to which a modification of the principle of abatement might be conceded in negotiation it was difficult to reach conclusions on the Ministersproposals, since their full effect would not be known. The localauthorities in particular would have to know the attitude of theGovernment before embarking upon negotiations.(b) The pension arrangements for civil servants and the armed forces could not now be represented as preferential, since they werepart of the general terms of service.(c) It would not be practicable to accept employees in thepublic sector from the proposed scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits.(d) To make good the extra cost of the changes to employees inthe public sector would cost the Exchequer some  6 million a yearinitially. An addition of this order to the effective cost of theMinisters proposals could hardly be contemplated, nor could a
road safety(previous preference:CC (65) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2)Trial GeneralSpeed limit of 70 m.p.h.on all Roads4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (65) 156) which proposed the imposition of certainspeed limits on roads.The Minister of Transport said that he proposed to take two main steps in the immediate future to deal with the problem ofmultiple accidents on the motorways. The first was to institute an ad hoc advisory speed limit of 30 miles per hour (m.p.h.) on lengthsof motorway where weather conditions were particularly bad. Theselengths would be indicated by flashing electric signs at the side ofthe road, which the police would operate as necessary. The secondmeasure was to introduce for a trial period of four months a limit of 70 m.p.h. on all unrestricted roads, including motorways. No direct evidence was available about the effect of introducing such a speed limit; but there was reason to expect some reduction in both drivingspeeds and the number of accidents. Neither measure involvedsubstantial expenditure; and the local authorities and other organisations mainly concerned had been consulted. While there might be some opposition from motoring interests, public opiniongenerally was in favour of imposing speed limitations on a trial basis.His proposals had been considered and endorsed by the HomeAffairs Committee and, subject to the Cabinets approval, he proposed to make a statement the following day in the House ofCommons.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The temporary and advisory limit of 30 m.p.h. in bad weather conditions might be too high for safe driving and impossibleto ensure. It might therefore be preferable merely to advise motoriststo drive slowly under such conditions.CC 63 (65)corresponding saving be achieved by reducing the benefits proposed.On the other hand some limited modification of abatement mightsuffice for purposes of negotiation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to give further consideration at their next meeting to the implications for public service employees of theproposals made by the Minister of Pensions. In the meantime theChief Secretary, Treasury, should consider to what extent some modification of the principle of abatement might be conceded in negotiation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider in themeantime to what extent some modification of theprinciple of abatement might be conceded in negotiation with the employees&apos; associations.
(b) The 70 m.p.h. limit was too high for a number of roadswhich were at present unrestricted and, indeed might be argued tobe too high for safe driving on the motorways also. It might be preferable to introduce categories of speed limits according to thenature of the roads concerned; and these might well be extended by imposing different speed limits on the various traffic lanes in.motorways.(c) Further consideration should be given to the need to impose restrictions on cars, and particularly on lorries, moving from onelane of a motorway to another.(d) The application of the proposal for an advisory speed limit of 30 m.p.h. on motorways in bad weather might have to be modified in its operation in Scotland in view of the very small mileageof motorways which had so far been completed there.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that furtherconsideration should be given by the Home Affairs Committee tothese suggestions, particularly as regards the need for heavy vehiclesto keep to particular traffic lanes on motorways. The Cabinet werein broad agreement with the remaining proposals for a trial period;but their effectiveness would have to be considered in the light of experience.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (65) 156.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Home Affairs Committee to consider, in the lightof the discussion, the advisability of imposing further restrictions on road traffic.Cabinet Office, S.WJ,23rd November, 1965.
