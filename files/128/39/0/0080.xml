Earnings-Related Short-Terrn Benefits(previous reference :CC (65) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a note by the chief secretary, Treasury (C (65) 157) on the implications for the public sector of the change in the basis of contracting out proposed by theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it had emerged fromthe Cabinets previous discussion that the Ministets proposals foreliminating the anomalies in the present arrangements for contracting out would be liable to provoke strong reactions among a large bodyCC 64 (65)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) A Motion had been put down for debate by a back benchMember of the Opposition censuring the Governments policy on rhodesia. It was for consideration whether this Motion should bemerely opposed or whether an amending Motion should be tabled,not on behalf of the Government, but by a Private Member. Therewas general agreement that the matter should be left for decision bythe Prime Minister with the Ministers primarily concerned.(b) The draft Rating Bill, which was due to be published on thefollowing day, had only come before the Legislation Committee onthe preceding Tuesday; and an issue of policy, which was to beconsidered by the Cabinet under a later item on the agenda, had still not been resolved. The delay in reaching decisions on the content of several Bills was beginning to jeopardise the timetable for theGovernments programme of legislation in the current Session.(c) Lord Silkin had introduced an Abortion Bill in the Houseof Lords. This went further in a number of respects than the earlier proposals for reform which had been put forv/ard by the AbortionLaw Reform Association. In particular, it sought to legalise abortionon grounds connected with the social conditions in which the motherwas living; and the effect of such a provision could be regarded asremoving, in effect, any restraint on abortions. Moreover, the general council of the British Medical Association had recently set up acommittee to consider the reform of the law relating to abortion andhad called upon the Government to refrain from any action in this regard pending the committee&apos;s report. There was general agreement that in these circumstances the Governments spokesman should maintain an attitude of strict neutrality towards Lord Silkin&apos;s Bill.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the points raised in discussion.(2) Agreed that the Government spokesman should adopt an attitude of strict neutrality towards the Abortion bill introduced by Lord Silkin in the House of Lords.
of employees in the public sector, who would be required to payhigher contributions in return for lower pensions; nor, apart fromacquiring cover for widow&apos;s benefit, would they gain any significantadvantage from the new earnings-related short-term benefits.Moreover, the Cabinefs decision on the pay of the Armed forces had now exposed a new area of sensitivity in this connection. TheMinisters proposals, therefore, raised acutely the difficult andcontroversial problem of abatement of public service pensions by reference to National Insurance provision which had lain unsolvedsince 1948. Although the change proposed by the Minister was probably inevitable, and the abatement issue must therefore be facedsooner or later, it was arguable whether this was the appropriate time for raising it. If the changes in contracting out were deferred until the Ministers review of national insurance pension provision was complete, it might then be possible to offer the public serviceemployee a better bargain. There was a strong case for leaving the contracting out arrangements unchanged for the time being and forconfining the immediate legislation to earnings-related short-term benefits and the small earnings-related contribution of a half per cent which was needed to cover the cost.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that theChief Secretary&apos;s proposal would not entirely avoid the difficultieson abatement and would create further difficulties of its own. Thepublic service employee would have to pay up to 2s. Id. a weekmore for earnings-related short-term benefits from which he was unlikely to receive any great advantage. All the anomalies andinequities of the present arrangements, which the Government had themselves criticised, would be perpetuated; and there would be considerable difficulty in increasing graduated contributions to help to finance the next general increase in benefit so long as the presentcontracting out arrangements remained. If the next increase in benefits had to be paid for solely by increases in the flat rate contribution, this would limit the amount of increase that could begiven, would impose hardship on the lower paid contributors andwould be expensive to the Exchequer by reason of the additionalproportionate Exchequer supplement thereby attracted. Moreover, the changes in contracting out would incidentally produce extra income which would enable an all-round reduction of 4d. to be made in the flat rate contribution; and this, in turn, would yield a saving of  8million in the Exchequer^ proportionate supplement. Thus, the changes in the arrangements for contracting out which she proposedmight well prove no more expensive to the Exchequer than aperpetuation of the present arrangements, even taking account of the concessions which might have to be made in negotiation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The original proposal to introduce earnings-related unemployment benefit for economic reasons had now been expanded to include changes which, however desirable, had no economicjustification. In view of the difficulties which they raised and thelarge numbers in the public sector who would be adversely affected,it was doubtful whether the Ministers proposals in regard to
CC 64 (65)contracting out should be grafted on to the proposals for earnings-related short-term benefits, since a better opportunity might lateroccur in the context of a new national insurance pension scheme.(b) A contribution increase of no more than one-half per cent for the contracted out might prove tolerable. On the other hand theissue of principle would not be evaded even in relation to the abatement of pension, since the half per cent contribution for earnings-related short-term benefits would, for technical reasons, qualify the contracted out for a small graduated pension also. The difficultyof negotiation on abatement could therefore not be avoided.(c) If any concession were to be made to mitigate the effect ofthe Ministers proposals on public service employees, this would haveto take the form of a modification of abatement rather than ofcompensating improvements in pay.(d) There might be some precedent in the arrangements madein T 948 whereby abatement in respect of the flat rate national insurance pension was applied only to civil servants becomingestablished after that date.(e) The Chief Secretary&apos;s alternative proposal represented a major change in the Ministers proposals on which she had alreadyconsulted the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and other interested bodies. It was arguable whether the intrinsic advantages offered bythe Ministers proposals should be set aside by reason of difficultiesexpected in negotiation, especially since these would not be entirelyavoided by the alternative proposal.(/) It would not be practicable to achieve an economy in theMinisters proposals, in order to compensate for the cost of anynegotiated settlement with employees&apos; associations, by omittingprovision for earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance, since the latter hadbeen mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet appeared to be faced with a choice between two courses.The Ministers proposals for changing the basis of contracting outhad certain clear advantages; but the extent of their attendantdisadvantages depended on the degree to which it might be possibleor necessary to make concessions in negotiation with employees inorder to achieve a fair settlement, possibly on the lines of the concession made to existing civil servants in 1948. On the other hand,the Chief Secretary&apos;s alternative proposal, i.e., to leave the contracted out arrangements unchanged and to charge only the additional \ percent for short-term benefits, while raising the difficult issue ofabatement in a less acute form, would be accompanied by its owndisadvantages; and these also required further study. The social services Committee should accordingly consider urgently whatconcessions might have to be made in order to achieve a settlement with the employees&apos; associations if the Ministers proposals were adopted. They should also consider the implications of the chief secretary&apos;s proposal and should report to the Cabinet where thebalance of advantage lay.
The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Ministerial Committee on Social Services toconsider urgently the relative advantages of the alternative proposals for those contracted out of the graduated pension scheme, in accordance with the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Industrial 3.   The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet of the disputes current position as regards the dispute in the bakery industry. ABakery Industry , ,      ,     .   , . .        .       n ,       . ,    . .proposal by the industry to increase the price of bread had been referred earlier in the year to the National Board for Prices and incomes. At that time the Bakers&apos; Union had already put forward a claim for higher wages. The Board had reported that the proposed increase in the price of bread was not justified; and with considerabledifficulty it had subsequently been agreed with the industry that thepresent price should be maintained for a period of six months ending on 6th March, 1966, subject to review on 6th December. It was probably in consequence of this agreement that the bakery firmswere resisting any increase of wages in response to the Union&apos;claim. The Union had resisted the proposal that their wage claim should be referred to the Board; and, although there had at onestage been indications that they might be prepared to considerabandoning the present strike if a Court of Enquiry were appointed,they had finally proved unwilling to do so. Nor had repeatedsubsequent discussions between himself and the Minister of labour on the one hand and the President and the General Secretary ofthe Union on the other enabled any agreement to be reached on a reference to the Board. The Union&apos;s current demand was that theyshould receive an immediate increase of 20s. a week on basic rates,before they were even willing to start negotiations. This would entailan interim wage increase of between 84- and 9 per cent; and totalearnings might be substantially higher in view of the amount of overtime which was normally worked in the industry. In thesecircumstances he had decided, in agreement with the Minister ofLabour, to take the initiative in referring the wage claim to the Boarddespite the Union&apos;s opposition; but it seemed clear that, if theUnion&apos;s claims were not conceded, there would be an extensionof the current strike to a large part of England and Wales.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould not at this stage take any further initiative to resolve thedispute or promote emergency arrangements to increase available supplies of bread, save that in accordance with normal practice theMinister of Labour would ask the Executive of the Union to discuss with him whether means could be found of bringing the strike to anend.
LocalGovernmentFinanceR.ate Rebates(previous reference :CC(65) 51stConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (65) 160) and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (65) 159) on the rate rebates to be provided in theforthcoming Rates Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were twooutstanding questions of policy; (i) whether the &quot; threshold &quot; of rateliability above which the amount payable would be abated by two-thirds should be  6 10s. or  7 10s.; and (ii) whether the income limit for relief for a single person should be  7 or  8 a week. With thehigher threshold and the lower income limit there would be savings of  3- 4 million to the Exchequer and of  1- 1-J million to the rates.The reduction in the relief given to individuals by raising thethreshold to  7 10s. would be 13s. 4d. a year or only 3d. a week. Asto the income limit,  8 a week would imply a substantially largerdifferential between the level for the single person and that for the married couple than applied in the fields of income tax, national insurance and national assistance; and it was significant that, whilethe Committee on the Impact of Rates on Households (the AllenCommittee) had said that rates pressed particularly hard on singleretired householders, they had quoted figures to show that the averageincome of all retired single householders was substantially below 7 a week. In relation to the substantial relief which either set of proposals would give to the individual ratepayer the differencebetween them was not sufficient to justify additional expenditure ata time when economy in public expenditure was particularly important.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thepurpose of the rebate scheme was to reduce the proportion of household income which was absorbed by rates in the lower income groups, where rates bore particularly heavily. The original proposal had envisaged the threshold at a level of  5; but, in deference to theviews of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had agreed that itshould be raised to  6 10s. This would reduce the numbers whoqualified for relief by some 150,000; but to raise the threshold to 7 10s. would exclude a further 100,000. As regards the income limit,the greater differential in favour of the single person could be justified by the fact that it was on single persons, particularly widows andwidowers of retirement age, that the burden of rates fell most heavily.Under the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposals a single personwith an income of  8 a week and a rate bill of  40 would be devotingSECRET 7CC 64 (65)The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of State.(2) Agreed that no special measures should be taken by theGovernment at this stage to increase the supplies of breadwhich would be available to the public in the areasaffected by the strike in the bakery industry.
7 - 5 per cent of income to rates, compared with an average of 2 - 6per cent for all income groups. To reduce the income limit from 8 to  7 would debar a further 150,000 householders from relief-with the result that nearly 400,000 of an estimated 2-4 millionbeneficiaries would be excluded from the scheme. It was not worthcreating an additional category of hardship in order to save  3- 4 million out of a total cost of  23 million to the Exchequer.In discussion is was suggested that it would be wise to fix a relatively low income limit at the outset in view of the power whichthe Rating Bill would confer on the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment to vary the limit by Order and of the fact that thescheme would be open to the criticism that it operated unfairly asbetween one individual and another because the test of income tookno account of capital resources. Moreover, the reliability of the figuresquoted by the Allen Committee v/as open to doubt. In particular, itwas not clear that there were large numbers of people at the lowerend of the income range who would be eligible for rebates, becausemost of those with incomes of about  6 a week would be in receiptof national assistance. On the other hand elderly people with smallincomes, whom the scheme was designed to assist, constituted thesection of the community whose needs appeared to be greatest andfor whom, given the deferment of the income guarantee scheme, littlerelief was being provided. The publication of the Survey of retirement pensions in January would reactivate pressure on behalf of the considerable numbers who were now living below national assistancelevel but were unwilling to claim assistance; and it would be desirablethat the Government should be in a position to point to some effective means, such as the present proposals, for helping them.After further discussion it was suggested that the income limitwould have greater significance for the single person of small meansthan the figure set for the threshold of rate liability. The saving of 2 million resulting from raising the threshold to  7 10s. should therefore be made; but the income limit should be fixed at  8 a week for a single person.The Cabinet Agreed that, for purposes of the Rating Bill, the minimum rate liability should be  7 10s. a year and the income limit for full relief for a single person  8 a week.EducationPublic Schools(previous reference :CC (65) 37thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Education and Science (C (65) 155) on the establishmentof a Public Schools Commission.The Secretary of State for Education and Science recalled thatThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament had stated theGovernments intention of setting up a Public Schools Commissionto advise on the best way of integrating the public schools with theState system. It remained to consider the scope and terms of reference of the Commission. It was proposed to define public schools for this
purpose as independent schools in membership of the Headmasters&apos;Conference, Governing Bodies&apos; Association or Governing Bodies ofGirls&apos; Schools Association. The effect of this would be to excludedirect grant schools and private schools not in membership of the bodies in question. It was desirable to exclude the direct grant schoolsbecause they were already in a sense part of the public sector andtheir role in local schemes for comprehensive education should be worked out in direct negotiation with the local education authorities.The private schools presented no urgent problem, but it was proposedthat the Commission should be asked in general terms to recommendwhether any action was needed in respect of them. The tasks explicitlylaid on the Commission would be to collect information about the schools, with an emphasis on the provision and the need for boardingeducation; to work out with those concerned the part which individualschools should play in national and local schemes of integration; to initiate, if it so wished, but subject to the approval of the Minister,experimental schemes; and to recommend a national plan forintegrating the public schools with the maintained sector. Inorder to obviate the risk of the Commission making unacceptablerecommendations, it was desirable also to specify the objectivesto which they should have regard. These should include satisfying the need for boarding education; reducing the divisive influence ofthe schools by providing for a socially mixed entry and a progressivelywider range of academic attainment; and ensuring that in the longrun entry to public schools should cease to be dependent on parentalmeans.It was proposed that the Commission should consist of a paidhalf-time Chairman, and possibly Deputy Chairman, and abouttwelve others drawn from, but not representing, the interested parties,with one or two independent members. The servicing of theCommission by the Department of Education and Science might cost some  55,000 a year. The cost of the experiments perhaps 100,000 in the first year and not more than  400,000 in the second was expected to be borne by the local authorities. Expenditureresulting from the Commission^ recommendations could not arisefor two or three years. As to other measures in relation to publis schools, there appeared to be little to be gained by applying the teacher quota, although the Commission should be asked to examine this possibility. The question of eliminating tax privileges was underdiscussion with the Treasury; but the abolition of the relief from rates which those public schools which were charities enjoyed in common with other charities would appear to be invidious. Thequestion of persuading the Oxford and Cambridge colleges to givefewer places to students from public schools would be pursued in thelight of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into OxfordUniversity, under the chairmanship of Lord Franks.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be important to make clear, as paragraph 4 (e) ofthe proposed: terms of reference did, that the Government would notconsider acceptable recommendations which amounted to no more
than an extension of the scheme for the entry to public schools ofa proportion of pupils from State schools recommended by theCommittee on Public Schools (the Fleming Committee).(b) The questions of tax privileges and of rating relief raisedissues of policy which would need to be considered in a wider context.Rating relief for public schools might be considered in conjunctionwith the problem of the re-rating of the Oxford and Cambridgecolleges.(c) It would be desirable to include among the members of theCommission persons from outside the educational system withpractical experience of administration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in agreement with the terms of reference and the guiding principles which it was proposed to give the Public SchoolsCommission. The Secretary of State for Education and Science should show them in confidence to the prospective Chairman of theCommission and feel free to accept any minor amendments of draftingwhich he might suggest; but any major amendment would need to bereferred to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Approved, subject to minor amendments of drafting, theterms of reference for the Public Schools Commission setout in the Annex to C (65) 155.Cabinet Office, S.W.125th November, 1965
