Prices and incomes(previous reference:CC(65) 33rdConclusions,Minute 7)1. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet had been invitedto reassemble rather earlier than had been contemplated at their last meeting in order to take stock of developments in the economicsituation. During August sterling had begun to recover strength;and this process had been reinforced by the publication of the statistics of exports during July, which had been exceptionallyfavourable. As a result it was now reasonable to hope that the deficit on the balance of payments in 1965 might be rather less than the 300 million which had been contemplated hitherto and that in 1966we should achieve a balance on external account at a rather earlier date than we had so far expected. At the same time the measureswhich the Government had taken earlier in the year were now beginning to exert a visible effect; and it should be possible in thenot too distant future to initiate some degree of reflation of the economy. On the other hand unemployment was still lower thana year ago; the pressure of demand within the economy remainedhigh; and there was a continuing risk that speculative pressureagainst sterling might be renewed. In these circumstances it was essential that the improvement in our balance of payments shouldnot be endangered by any excessive rise in our costs of production;and it was no less important politically to anticipate any undue risein the cost of living. It would now be appropriate, therefore, to intensify the Governments policy in relation to prices and incomesby giving it a degree of statutory foundation; and for this purpose it was proposed that as soon as possible after Parliament resumedlegislation should be introduced giving the Government power:(i) to require notification of any intention to increase prices or charges and to require notification of claims relating topay, hours of work or other major improvements interms of employment, together with the prospective termsof settlement of wage claims;(ii) to refer to the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI), in the national interest:(a) any price, whether existing or proposed; and(b) any claim or settlement;(iii) to require the proposed price or pay increases to be deferred until after the Board had reported;(iv) to give the Board power to collect all necessary information and to call witnesses to give evidence.These proposals were not only desirable on merits but wouldalso serve to reinforce the revival of international confidence in sterling, which could now expect to command the support of otherCentral Banks against speculative attack if the Governmentsconcerned were convinced that we were resolved to take adequatesteps to maintain the basic improvement in our economy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer endorsed the Prime ministers statement. Despite the recent recovery of sterling, there was no scope for any relaxation of our efforts to rectify the imbalance on
our external account, since our reserves were insufficient to withstandany renewed speculative attack on sterling and we could no longerafford to borrow abroad for this purpose. The level ofunemployment, although gradually rising, was still very low; andthe continuing pressure of demand within the economy made itdesirable to take the further steps now proposed in order to keep ourcosts of production under reasonable control.The First Secretary of State said that the policy of voluntaryrestraint of prices and incomes, on which the Government hadembarked earlier in the year, was probably proving more effective than was commonly supposed. On the other hand it was not possibleto quantify its results or to demonstrate the extent to which, if itwere not in operation, prices and incomes might rise. It wastherefore desirable for the further development of the policy thatthe Government, while retaining the voluntary principle as its essential foundation, should now take statutory powers to enforcean interval for consideration before any proposal to increase prices or incomes could become effective; and this was the purpose of thenew measures now proposed. The principle of advance notificationshould not only provide the Government with valuable informationbut should also reinforce the authority of both the employers andthe trade unions in resisting unreasonable claims; and it was clearlypreferable to&apos; any attempt to impose a complete ban on all increases in prices and wages, which would be wholly unrealistic on both political and administrative grounds. It would not be easy to enforce the new policy; but such sanctions as it might incorporate mustappear to relate to incomes no less than to prices; and the policy must be seen to apply not merely to the public, but also to theprivate, sector. It was essential to launch the policy forthwith, sincethe annual conference of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) was due to be held in the next few days and it would be unwise to allow the TUC to discuss prices and incomes policy on the basis ofincomplete knowledge of the Governments intentions. It was uncertain how far they would endorse the new policy; but there were grounds for hoping that they could be persuaded to acquiesce in it,although both they and the employers were more likely to offer their co-operation if the proposed measures could be shown to be notmerely desirable in the interests of the Governments plan for thedevelopment of the economy in the longer term but also requiredby the exigencies of our immediate financial situation.In discussion there was general agreement in principle with theseproposals. The following main points were made:(a) It could not be assumed that speculative pressure on sterling would not recur at some point in the future. The measures nowproposed should reduce this risk by stabilising the costs of productionand so increasing the competitive power of our exports. If thebalance of payments nevertheless deteriorated again, it wouldprobably be necessary to take direct remedial action, e.g., by way of restraint on imports; but there should be no question of any further action to compress internal demand in order to rectify any externalimbalance.
(b) In this connection it would be important that suchrefiationary measures as the Government might adopt in thecoming months should not recreate the external imbalance whichwe were now beginning to rectify. All possible measures should therefore be taken to improve our exports; and from this point ofview it was arguable whether the present proposals to stabilise prices and incomes would suffice or whether they might need to be intensified at a later stage. On the other hand the measures whichthe Government had taken in recent months to control transactionson capital account should do much to prevent a further deterioration in the balance of payments; and, provided that these measures were maintained in force, that we succeeded in keeping production costsunder control and that we adopted a critical attitude towards defence expenditure, it should be possible to embark on a process of controlled reflation in due course without undue danger.(c) The scope of the measures now proposed in relation to prices might need further consideration, since it would beimpossible to refer every price increase, however insignificant, to the nbpi. It might therefore be necessary to draft the new legislation in terms which would give the Ministers concerned power to decide,by Order in Council, which price increases should be referred forconsideration by the Board.(d) The prices charged by nationalised industries, e.g., in the caseof coal, would have to be referred for consideration by the NBPIno less than the prices charged by firms in the private sector. But itwould not always be easy to reconcile this principle with the requirement imposed on the nationalised industries to attain specifictargets in terms of the return on capital employed.(e) Public opinion might well expect dividends to be subjected to at least the same degree of control as was now envisaged for wagesand incomes generally. To some extent the proposed restraint on prices should prevent excessive increases in dividends; and this process should be reinforced in the longer term by the combined effect of the capital gains tax and the corporation tax. If excessiveincreases in dividends nevertheless persisted, further fiscal action might become appropriate; and this could, if necessary, be made clear.(/) If it became necessary to adopt some sanction, againstprice increases which the NBPI judged to be excessive, a systemof price control might be instituted, either as part of thelegislation envisaged to put the NBPI on a statutory basisor by means of a separate Bill. On the other hand this would tend to attract attention to the question of a correspondingsanction in relation to wage increases; and there could be no questionof seeking to impose a statutory control on wages, since it would be unacceptable in principle and unenforceable in practice.(g) Further consideration would have to be given to the position,in relation to the new policy, of arbitration tribunals and comparablebodies which at present enjoyed a relatively independent status in
deciding the remuneration of individual staffs and professionalorganisations. It would not necessarily be practicable to allow themto retain indefinitely their present degree of independence; but itshould prove possible to arrange some accommodation between their functions and those now envisaged for the NBPI.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement on the action now proposed to make theGovernments policy in relation to prices and incomes more effective.It was essential, however, that it should be presented not as a furthermeasure of restriction required in order to reinforce international confidence in sterling in the short term but as a positive developmentof the Governments policies for the planned and controlled increaseof incomes within an economy which would be able to expandwithout fear of adverse repercussions on sterling if otherGovernments were convinced of our ability to keep our costs and prices under control and to increase the competitive power of our exports. It would be desirable, from this point of view, that theproposed measures should be reinforced, as rapidly as possible, bysteps to emphasise the importance of an increase in productivity andto identify all sections of the working population with theGovernments policies for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Approved the measures proposed to place the government&apos;s policy in relation to prices and incomes on a statutory basis.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Labour, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to arrange for theGovernments intentions in this connection to becommunicated, at the appropriate point, to arbitrationtribunals and similar bodies; and to consider how thefunctions of these bodies might best be related to those now envisaged for the National Board for Prices and incomes.CommercialPolicyImports ofCottonTextiles(previous reference:CC(65) 30thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (C (65) 122) on the detailed arrangements forrestraining imports of cotton textiles after the end of 1965.The President of the Board of Trade said that preliminary discussions had been held with the Governments of India, pakistan and Hong Kong about possible quota arrangements for cotton textiles after 1965 on the lines approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 13th May, 1965. In the light of these discussions he now suggested that India and Hong Kong should retain their presentcountry quotas; that there should be a global quota for othercountries; and that Pakistan should be offered the option of retainingher existing country quota or participating in the global quota. India
and Hong Kong were satisfied with this proposal; but Pakistan had rejected both alternatives. It was essential to begin formalnegotiations with all our supplying countries forthwith; and for thispurpose the proposals which had already been put to theGovernments of India, Pakistan and Hong Kong should be tabledas the basis for the initial discussions. It might emerge thatmodifications of these proposals would be necessary in order tosecure general agreement; and it might at that time be possible tomove towards an arrangement more acceptable to Pakistan. But toamend our original proposals at the outset in order to conciliatePakistan would be regarded as a serious breach of faith by Indiaand Hong Kong. Moreover, there was no justification on merits foroffering Pakistan more favourable treatment, particularly since thecountry quota for Pakistan would be 6 per cent of their productionwhereas the Indian quota would be only 4 per cent.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, if we ignored the viewsof the Government of Pakistan by putting forward as a basis for formal negotiations proposals which we knew that they would not accept, there was a risk that their reactions would be seriouslydetrimental to United Kingdom, and indeed to Western, interests. Itwas unlikely in any case to be possible to negotiate a quota schemewhich gave India and Hong Kong 100 per cent of their presentcountry quota. It would therefore be a mistake to start on this basis;and it would be preferable that our proposals should incorporatesome concession to Pakistan from the beginning of the negotiations.The Colonial Secretary said that the suggested quota for HongKong had already been published in the Colony; and anycurtailment of it, as proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary,would be regarded as a serious breach of faith.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There would be some advantage in delaying the circulation of formal proposals until our attempts to relieve the present tension between the United States Government and Pakistan on the questionof aid had made further progress.(b) All possible combinations of country and global quotas hadbeen considered; and further informal discussions with India,Pakistan and Hong Kong could not be expected to result in any solution agreeable to all three countries.(c) The interests of Pakistan in increasing their exports to thiscountry should not be satisfied by raising the total of import quotasat the expense of textile manufacturers in the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet endorsed the proposals in C (65) 122. Themanner in which these proposals should be put forward should bediscussed by the President of the Board of Trade and theCommonwealth Secretary in order to reduce as far as possiblethe unfavourable reaction which might be expected from theGovernment of Pakistan.
The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C (65) 122, about import quotas for cotton textiles, subject to further consideration by theCommonwealth Secretary and the President of the Boardof Trade of the manner in which they should be tabled in negotiation.Industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour said that the frequency of industrial disputes disputes in the motor industry gave serious cause for concern.Motor industry Already in 1965 thcre had been 112 stoppages, of which only fivehad been official strikes. It was privately acknowledged by the leadersof the unions concerned that they no longer had adequate controlover the actions of their members in the industry. It was desirable for the Government to consider whether any action could be takento improve the situation in this important section of the economy.One possibility would be a general inquiry into the structure of theindustry, in relation to both the trade unions and the employers.Such an inquiry, however, would need to comprise a very wide range of firms and would be a lengthy and complicated process.Alternatively it might be possible to establish fact-finding teamswhich could be sent by the Minister of Labour to investigateunofficial stoppages as soon as they occurred. But this concept hadbeen opposed in the past by both trade unions and employers onthe grounds that it would confer a quasi-official status onirresponsible action. Legislation to deal with the situation represented a third possible course of action; but it would require very carefulconsideration in view of the obvious difficulties which would be involved.The Prime Minister and he had therefore arranged to seerepresentatives of the employers and the trade unions involved on 3rd September in order to review the situation and to ascertain whether the industry had any other suggestions for remedial action.Even if the industry could not offer any proposals, it might still bedesirable for action to be taken by the Government.The Prime Minister said that he would review the position withthe Minister of Labour in the light of the forthcoming discussionwith the industry and would subsequently arrange for the Cabinetto discuss any proposals for action by the Government which mightbe thought desirable.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd September, 1965.
