toTSR-2 orF-111A(previous reference:CC(65) 20thConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion and considered afurther memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence (C (65) 58)on the TSR-2 and F-111A (TFX) to which was attached the draft ofa public announcement.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, in order to secure an option to acquire the TFX at the fixed price offered by the UnitedStates authorities, we should previously have had to undertake to buy a minimum of 10 TFX Mark I. He had been in touch with theUnited States authorities since the Cabinets previous discussion andthis condition had now been withdrawn. The United StatesGovernment would now accept an option agreement which wouldnot commit us to the purchase of any aircraft. If, however, we wishedto exercise the option we should have to place a firm order for10 aircraft by 1st January, 1966. We should then have the option topurchase up to 100 more aircraft, but firm orders need not be placeduntil 1967. The fixed price, excluding the cost of the improvedavionics for the TFX Mark II, would apply to such orders if the total numbers were between 100 and 70. If the number were below 70 weshould have to negotiate about the research and development element in the fixed price and this might involve some relatively small price increase. The United States authorities would still be prepared to announce the waiver of the 50 per cent preference rule when the option was signed, though they would not give effect to thisadministratively, by placing any order for United Kingdomequipment, until we had placed an order for a purchase of TFX. the option would thus give us an assurance that we could acquire theTFX at a very favourable price if we wished to do so, but we shouldnot need to take any decision until 1st January, 1966, by which time we should have completed the review of our oversea commitments.In discussion it was argued that the cancellation of the TSR-2would do grave damage to the United Kingdom aircraft industry andwould prejudice the prospects of exporting civil aircraft such as the bac-111 and the VC-10. It would also make us unduly dependenton the United States if we were subsequently obliged to acquire theTFX. A large purchase would add a burden on our balance ofpayments which would outweigh the advantage of budgetary saving.As against this it was maintained that unless the TSR-2 were cancelledthere would be no possibility of achieving the required economies in defence expenditure. A courageous decision to cut expenditure in the context of the Budget would be an important factor in the reaction toit of opinion overseas. Moreover, the present weakness of our economy resulted in a dependence on other countries, and in particular on the United States, even more damaging than that which wouldresult from the purchase of United States aircraft. Skilled resourcesmust be redeployed from the aircraft industry if we were to securethe necessary increase in productive investment and the consequentstrengthening of our economy. It was also important that the dollarcost of any TFX purchase would only have to be met in the period from 5-10 years hence when the Governments policy could be
expected to have had effect in improving the competitive efficiency ofUnited Kingdom industry.In further discussion it was suggested that the requirement foran aircraft of the TSR-2/TFX type could be met by the developmentof existing aircraft such as the Buccaneer. It should not therefore benecessary, by securing the option, to give any implied commitmentat this stage to the purchase of any TFX. It was however pointed outthat even a developed version of the Buccaneer would be much inferiorin range and payload to the TSR-2 or TFX. It might be possible tomeet part of the requirement for TSR-2/TFX by the increased use ofcarrier-borne Buccaneers, but until the conclusion of the review of oversea commitments it could not be assumed that no aircraft of theTSR-2/TFX type would be required if we were to be able to carryout our defence role. However, under the terms of the optionagreement as now proposed a decision on this point need not betaken until 1st January, 1966.Summing up the discussion to this point, The Prime ministers aid that two possibilities could be excluded, namely a decision tocomplete the TSR-2 programme or to cancel the TSR-2 and replaceit with an immediate order for 110 TFX. The choice therefore laybetween three courses:(i) To cancel the TSR-2 and take no action over a replacement.(ii) To cancel the TSR-2 and secure an option on the TFX onthe lines described by the Secretary of State for Defence.(iii) To postpone any decision until the review of our overseacommitments showed whether we should have a requirement for this type of aircraft.In discussion of these alternatives it was argued in favour ofcourse (iii) that the position should be kept open until our requirementswere known; to cancel the TSR-2 at this stage would mean that if wesubsequently needed an aircraft of this type we should be forced to buy the TFX and thus become unduly dependent on the United Statesand incur unacceptably heavy dollar expenditure. As against this itwas maintained that the Government could not afford what might prove to be nugatory expenditure on the TSR-2 at a rate of  1 million a week or the impression of indecision which would be caused by further postponement.As between courses (i) and (ii) it was argued that the option topurchase TFX, even though it involved no commitment, would be generally taken to mean that the TSR-2 had been cancelled in favourof the United States aircraft. Until however our oversea commitmentswere reduced, we must, if the TSR-2 were cancelled, be able to showthat a comparable aircraft would be available at a fixed price if itwere needed to enable our forces to carry out their defence role.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thebalance of opinion was in favour of course (ii), namely to cancel theTSR-2 and to secure an option on the TFX, on the lines suggested bythe Secretary of State for Defence. Before a final decision could be
Space PolicyEuropeanLauncherDevelopmentOrganisation2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (65) 54) to which were attached memoranda by theMinister of Aviation and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, about UnitedKingdom participation in the European Launcher development organisation (ELDO).CC 21 (65)taken in this sense it would be necessary that the terms of the optionagreement should be confirmed by the United States authorities,particularly that it involved no commitment at this stage to purchaseany TFX. Subject to this condition the Governments decision to cancel the TSR-2 might be announced by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his Budget Speech on 6th April. Later in the same day the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister of Aviation mighthold a Press conference at which the decision could be explainedmore fully and a prepared statement issued. The draft announcementannexed to C (65) 58 should be amended in order to avoid the implication that the TSR-2 was being cancelled in favour of the TFX;it should be made clear that the requirement for an aircraft of this type and the possibility of meeting such a requirement in other wayswere being kept open pending the outcome of the current review;the purchase of the TFX was only of these possibilities and the optionhad been concluded as a form of insurance.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of aviation, formally to confirm with the United states authorities the terms which they had conveyed orally forthe option to purchase the TFX and in particular to confirm that this involved no commitment at this stage topurchase any aircraft.(2) Agreed that subject to Conclusion (1) the TSR-2 should be cancelled and an agreement signed with the United StatesGovernment for an option to buy the TFX in the terms proposed by the Secretary of State for Defence.(3) Agreed that the decision should be announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget Speech on 6th April.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of aviation, to revise the announcement of the government&apos;s decision on the lines agreed in discussion and to submitit to the Prime Minister for approval.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Minister of Aviation, to hold a Press conferenceon 6th April in accordance with the Prime Ministetssumming up.
The Minister of A aviation said that the ELDO Conference wouldbe reconvened in Paris on 7th April. At the previous meeting theFrench delegation had proposed the abandonment of the present programme and an immediate start on the development of a more advanced launcher (ELDO B). This proposal had been referred to aninternational Working Group which had now reported that the french proposal was unacceptable and that the original programme wastechnically preferable. If this were also unacceptable they recommended a compromise programme involving the developmentof a two-stage instead of a three-stage launcher. There was no economic case for further participation in ELDO programmes, but our withdrawal at this stage would have unfortunate political consequences in Europe, might involve the closing down of theWoomera base and would involve reliance upon the United States for heavy launchers. At the reconvened conference our delegation should therefore be authorised to participate in a future ELDO programmebased on the Working Group&apos;s recommendation. We should,however, seek to reduce our share of the expenditure to 25 per cent and we should regard 30 per cent as the maximum that we could accept in negotiation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in all thecircumstances he did not press at this stage that we should withdraw from ELDO, having regard to the political implications of such acourse both in Europe and in relation to our own technology. Since,however, participation was economically disadvantageous, since itdiverted resources from more profitable employment and since eventhe advanced launcher now envisaged could not be expected to be technically or financially competitive with United States launchers,we must seek to limit our commitment. In these circumstances thebest course would be for our delegation to agree in principle to a continuation of the ELDO programme in the immediate future andto accept participation until the end of 1965. In this period thereshould be a stringent review of the cost of the programme whichshould then be further considered.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that a telegram had just been received reporting that the French Government might adopta more flexible attitude towards the future programme of theOrganisation. There was general agreement that this development should be further investigated before instructions were given to our delegation. While it was politically important that we should not beheld responsible for bringing the Organisation to an end, it would,in the absence of any economic or scientific justification for the continuation of its projected programme, be desirable that we should consider whether its agreed termination might not in the event provenegotiable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on his visit to Paris on the following day he would seek to clarify the attitudeof the French Government. The matter should then be further considered by the Cabinet.
The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (65) 54.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would, on his visit to Paris,seek to clarify the attitude of the French government towards the future of ELDO.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion on Tuesday, 6th April.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd April, 1965.
