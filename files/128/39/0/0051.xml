1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that, owing to the time occupied bydebates on the Finance Bill, it would almost certainly be necessaryfor Parliament to sit during the first week in August. It was hoped soto arrange the business, however, that divisions on matters ofimportance would be avoided and there was no intention ofprolonging the sitting into the second week of August. It should bepossible to complete Government business by sitting for eight days in October, but this would mean that certain Bills would not receiveRoyal Assent until the autumn. These would probably be the race relations, Redundancy Payments, and Rent Bills, and possibly theTrade Disputes Bill. It was proposed to take the remaining stages of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill after 7 p.m. on13th July, but there was no possibility of finding further time if theBill failed to secure Third Reading on that occasion.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Government were liable to be embarrassed if the TradeDisputes Bill and the Control of Office and Industrial DevelopmentBill were not passed until October, and arrangements should ifpossible be made to secure their passage before the Recess.(b) It was desirable also to secure the passage of the race relations Bill, but, while the remaining stages of the Bill in the Houseof Commons were likely to be completed before the Recess,particularly if the Governments supporters refrained from movingamendments on Report, there could be no certainty of finding timefor the consideration of Lords&apos; amendments.(c) Delay in passing the Rent Bill would not be inconvenient,since there would be advantage in bringing the Bill into operationsoon after Royal Assent and some time was required to make thenecessary administrative arrangements.(d) It would be difficult for the House of Lords to sit longeror resume earlier than the House of Commons, but it should bepossible for them to complete their business by sitting until 4th or5th August and for a short period in October.(e) On the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, half a day should be sufficient to dispose of the amendments relating to the penalty for murder and, if the Speaker were prepared to accept the closure, to secure Third Reading by a reasonable hour; but therewould be a serious risk of losing the Bill if time were spent on an amendment put down by the sponsor, Mr. Sidney Silverman, toremove the clause (clause 3) limiting the operation of the Bill to five years. Mr. Silverman should accordingly be informed that, whilethe Government were willing to provide a half day for the remaining stages of the Bill, they were not prepared to jeopardise their ownlegislation in order to secure its passage, and that this time wouldbe made available only on condition that he withdrew hisamendment. It should be impressed on the sponsors of the Bill that
they should confine their own speeches to the minimum, andrepresentations might be made to the Speaker on the question of the closure.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the arrangements which the Lord Presidentproposed to make for securing the completion of theGovernments business during the remainder of the session.(2) Invited the Lord President (a) to inform the sponsors of the Murder (Abolitionof Death Penalty) Bill that the Governmentwere prepared to provide a half day for thediscussion of the remaining stages of the Bill inthe House of Commons, provided that theiramendment to delete clause 3 were withdrawn;and(b) to consider the advisability of making representa-tions to the Speaker on the acceptance of the closure in the debate on the Report stage of theBill.Oversea AffairsAlgeria(previous reference:CC(65) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)WesternEuropeanUnion(previous reference:CC(65) 15thConclusions,Minute 5)Vietnam(previous reference:CC(65) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the regime under ColonelBoumedienne, which had assumed power in Algiers after theGovernment of President Ben Bella had been overthrown in therecent coup d&apos;etat, appeared to have established effective controlover the country. It would therefore be appropriate that we shouldcontinue to maintain normal diplomatic relations with Algeria; butthere should be no need at this stage to extend formal recognition tothe new Government.The Foreign Secretary said that at the recent meeting of western European Union (WEU) which he had attended, the other member countries had responded favourably to the initiative whichwe had taken at the recent meeting of the Ministerial Council of theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) to seek to establishcloser links between EFTA and the European Economic Community.It was clear, however, that they would expect to be given more detailed information at the next quarterly meeting of WEU and thatthey would watch developments closely.The Prime Minister said that the project for a CommonwealthMission on Vietnam which had emerged from the recent Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers had met with a varied receptionfrom the countries concerned. The Governments of the United Statesand South Vietnam had expressed their willingness to receive theMission; the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China had rejected it without qualification; the Government of the Soviet union had evaded a direct response by suggesting that the effective decisionlay with the Government of North Vietnam; and the latter, who
Anglo-GermanOffsetAgreement(previous reference:CC(65) 15thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that his recent discussions with the Federal German Government in Bonn about thefuture of the German Offset Agreement had reached a reasonably satisfactory conclusion. The Agreement currently in force, whichwould expire in March 1966 had bound the Federal Government todo no more than to offset &quot; as far as possible &quot; the foreign exchangecosts of maintaining United Kingdom Forces in Germany. our expenditure on this account was likely to run at the rate of 85 million a year; and, during the first 15 months of the period ofthe Agreement, the Federal Government had contributed no morethan  30 million by way of offset. His objective in the discussions had therefore been, in effect, to negotiate payments of some 50- 60 million a year.The new Agreement which had been finally concluded envisaged that the period in question would be extended for a further year to31st March, 1967, in respect of which the Federal Government had accepted a reasonably firm commitment to contribute about 54 million. Moreover, they had undertaken to pay  42 million onaccount by the end of July which would increase the payment inrespect of the second year of the three-year period as a whole to 50 million. This would be sufficient to enable the Frozen ArmsAccount, which was at present blocked, to be released; and it hadbeen agreed that this account should provide finance, amounting tosome  23 million, together with a similar sum from german merchant bankers, for additional United Kingdom exports.In sum, therefore, we might hope that, if the new agreement were honoured, we should receive about  170 million over thethree-year period as a whole by way of offset to the foreign exchangecosts of our Forces in Germany. This was not far short of our original objective; and the fact that the settlement had been reachedeither without any threats about removing our troops in GermanyCC 35 (65)were clearly subject to conflicting pressures from the Chinese and soviet Governments, had so far maintained an ambiguous attitude.There had recently been some indication, however, that, although they might refuse to receive the Mission as a whole, they might be disposed to accept its Ghanaian and Nigerian members. A suggestion of this kind would probably be unacceptable to the Mission whichhad decided, before the end of the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters, that, the Mission should seek to act in unity in all its activities; and it would therefore be necessary to maintain the pressure which was now being exerted on the Government of north vietnam to receive the Mission as a whole.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
or on the other hand giving any commitment to maintain them thereafter the end of the three-year period was an additional reason forsatisfaction.In discussion it was noted that there would be discussion between the Treasury, the Ministry of Overseas Development andother Ministries concerned on the manner in which German finance for additional United Kingdom exports to developing countries might be utilised under the new Agreement.The Cabinet Took note, with approval of this statement andcongratulated the Chief Secretary, Treasury, on thesuccessful outcome of his negotiations about the Anglo-German Offset Agreement.1965-66Legislative 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordProgramme,     president of the Council (C (65) 85) to which was annexed a provisional legislative programme for 1965-66.The Lord President said that the proposed main programme forthe next Session was devoted largely to Bills to implement theGovernments social policies, but time must also be allowed for bills which it had not been possible to pass in the present Session andfor others which might become necessary either for economic reasonsor as policy in other fields developed. Some Bills at present includedin the programme might not in the event come forward and othersmight be delayed, in which case it would be convenient to draw onthe Bills which had been placed in the reserve list (List C). It was proposed that a small number of uncontentious Bills should beintroduced with a view to being referred to the Second reading committee which the House of Commons was expected to establishfollowing the report of the Select Committee on Procedure, but thiswould be on the understanding that if objection were taken to the reference of a particular Bill to the Second Reading Committee theGovernment would not necessarily find time for it in their main programme.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Additional Bills might be required on The Gambia (onbecoming a Republic); on the Constitution of Canada (to deal withthe problem of Quebec); on Government Contracts (arising out ofSir John Lang&apos;s report); and, if current negotiations were brought toa successful conclusion, to establish a free trade area with the irish republic. Time should also be found, if possible, for a short Billenabling the Crown to dissolve Convocations otherwise than on the dissolution of Parliament.(b) If it were decided to reorganise the Army and Air ForceReserves, the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill would have to bebrought into the main programme. It would be necessary tocontinue the Army and Air Force Acts by legislation before31st December, 1966.
Coal IndustryFinancialPosition5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (65) 87) and by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (C (65) 89)on proposals for improving the financial position of the national coal Board (NCB) and in particular for a capital reorganisation.The First Secretary of State said that the financial position ofthe NCB was deteriorating seriously, largely because it had plannedduring the 1950s for an annual production of at least 220 million tons whereas demand was now down to 190 million tons and would undoubtedly decline still further in the next few years. Their deficit for 1965-66 was likely to be of the order of  50 million and urgentaction was required. The Ministerial Committee on economic development had agreed that a substantial part of the NCB&apos;sliabilities should be written off at least to the extent of  250 million,CC 35 (65)(c) It would be important, in view of the Governments pledges,to introduce early in the Session the Agriculture Bill; and measureson Leasehold Enfranchisement, Commonwealth Immigration,Commonwealth Secretariat and Slum Clearance (Compensation).The Bill on Local Government Finance should at least receive its second Reading before Christmas in order that local authorities might take its provisions into account in fixing their rate demands for the succeeding year. The Government should hesitate, however,before committing themselves to a measure on Pirate Broadcasting.(d) It would also be desirable to provide time for a Law reform bill arising from the work of the Law Commission.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposed programme was a balanced and attractive one and had theadditional merit of being composed in the main of Bills which wouldhave fairly wide support so that the intensity of debate might bereduced in the next Session, ft would be necessary to consider theprogramme again in the autumn, but meanwhile the ministers concerned should press forward with the preparation of the bills in the main lists. Priority, both in seeking approval of policy and in drafting, should be given to Steel; Land Commission; LocalGovernment Finance and Housing (Financial Provisions) includingthe corresponding Scottish Bills; Income Guarantee (subject to the outcome of the review of public expenditure); and Earnings-related benefits.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, theprovisional legislative programme for 1965-66.(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to proceed as a matter of urgency with the preparation of Bills included inLists A.1 and B, giving priority to those mentioned bythe Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.
representing about  90 million of accumulated losses and some 150 million representing assets which are no longer of any economic value to the Board. It was also clear that further assets of the orderof  150 million would become valueless over the next few years.With the exception of the Treasury, the Committee had consideredthat it would be better to write off this amount immediately ratherthan at later intervals.The Committee had also considered the possibility of giving tothe NCB a specihc subsidy for a limited period to cover the costs of operating and ultimately closing uneconomic pits, provided thatthe National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) were prepared to commit themselves to a definite scheme for speeding up closures ofsuch pits. The subsidy might begin at  15 million a year and betapered off to nothing by 1970 when the run-down was completed.It was important to maintain the willingness of the NUM toco-operate. in closures, and such a subsidy would also avoid thenecessity for a price increase this year of more than 1 per centoverall. Such an increase might also be selective in its incidence, soreducing its general impact in the context of the prices and incomes policy.The Minister of Power said that it would be desirable to make some distinction between the write off of the first  250 million andthat of  150 million in view of the fact that the latter representedassets still of some economic value to the Board. He was, however,opposed to a policy involving subsidies. There could be no guarantee that these would in practice be gradually reduced; on the contrarythere would be great pressure on the Government by the mine-workers to maintain them and to use them to prolong the life of uneconomic pits. The NCB themselves did not want subsidies. the run down in the labour force in mining was now so fast that theproblem was really one of regrouping the available labour force andof providing of alternative employment in certain areas. A price increase was necessary this year and even with a write off of 400 million it would need to be of the order of 2 to 3 per cent.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that there were objectionsto writing off assets which were still of economic value to the NCB.Nevertheless, it seemed realistic to assume that such assets, to a value of some  150 million, would soon become worthless; and on balance it would be preferable to write off the whole sum now ratherthan do so by instalments. He was, however, strongly opposed to theintroduction of subsidies which would distort the pattern of theindustry, lead to pressure to keep pits open rather than facilitateearlier closure and were not in any case wanted by the NCB.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There would be great difficulty in persuading the mine-workers to accept a reduction in coal output to 175 million tons ayear and the NCB were most anxious not to publicise a long-termclosure programme because of its effect in the industry.
b(b) The introduction of subsidies would in effect transfer fromthe NCB to the Government responsibility for phasing the closureprogramme.(c) Farther financial assistance was required to provide additional employment in the mining areas concerned in Scotland,Wales and the North-East. The capital reorganisation might wellbe criticised as merely the acceptance of a failure by a nationalised industry to direct its investment properly, and the statement on government policy should include some positive measure.(d) The regional price surcharge should be reconsideredwhatever decision was taken about the introduction of subsidies.(e) If coal prices were increased substantially this wouldaccelerate the fall in demand and increase the difficulties of theindustry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the proposal to write off this year 400 million of the NCB&apos;s liabilities and to announce thisimmediately. There was, however, considerable objection to seeking to facilitate earlier closures by the provision of subsidies and itwould be preferable to provide assistance for alternative means ofemployment in the areas concerned. The Minister of Power should therefore include in his statement an indication that the Governmentwas prepared to enter into discussions with the industry about theestablishment of a coal industry fund to deal with the social andeconomic problems caused by the need to speed up the closure of uneconomic pits. The main expenditure from such a fund would beon expanding new industrial development in certain areas by theBoard of Trade, although it might also be possible to meet otherdirect social costs of the closure programme from the fund. its establishment must be conditional on the acceptance by the coalindustry, including the mineworkers, of the need for a rapid furtherclosure programme. This would be a positive proposal even thoughit would not assist in keeping down the price of coal. The Ministerof Power should agree the text of his statement in the Houseof Commons with the First Secretary of State and the chief secretary, Treasury and with himself. The question of the regionalsurcharge should be further considered by the Minister of Power,with the Secretary of State for Scotland and other ministers concerned, as a separate issue.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a capital reorganisation of the National coal board, involving the immediate writing off of  400 million to cover liabilities, should be undertaken.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Power should offer to discuss with the coal industry the establishment of a coal industryfund ;on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up.
(3) Invited the Minister of Power to announce these decisions in the House of Commons later that day and to seek theagreement of the Prime Minister, the First Secretary ofState and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to the terms ofthe statement.(4) Invited the Minister of Power to arrange for a review of the regional surcharge.Home Defence 6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Homeand the Secretary (C (65) 86) about home defence and the Territorial Army.TerritorialArmy The Home Secretary said that in their review of the homedefence measures required up to 1971-72 the Ministerial Committeeon Civil Defence had reviewed the usefulness of the reserve army for home defence. The Ministry of Defence were considering in parallel their future requirement for reserve forces. The reserve army would provide about 161,000 men for home defence on mobilisation,including 84,000 reservists, who under the Army Reserves Act, 1964,would only be available until 1969. Of this total, about 152,000 werein units at the disposal of the civil authorities, but not earmarked for specific tasks. Their primary role would be to help the police in maintaining public order in circumstances which might involve a widespread breakdown of civil authority. The Territorial Army(TA) cost about  35 million a year and the Army Emergency Reservea further  3 million. If the reserve army were reorganised on thebasis that no units were retained for home defence purposes, therewould be a saving of about  20 million a year.Under present plans about 150,000 personnel from the regular forces would be available to support the civil authorities after anattack, although home defence would not be their primary role andthere were large areas of the United Kingdom where none werelocated. Having regard to the reduced threat of attack, the HomeDefence Review Committee considered that while the reserve forces could give much valuable assistance to the civil authorities after anattack, the expenditure of a large annual sum on an organisation which did not appear to them to be of first importance for nationalsurvival could not be supported on home defence grounds. Therewas considerable support for this view in the Ministerial Committeeon Civil Defence and it had been suggested that if further steps were necessary for the preservation of order in an emergency, the best course might be to put further emphasis on police plans and perhaps to procure the support of other regular peace time services, includingthe assumption by the Post Office of the duties of 1,000 Territorialsallocated to signals work. The Ministry of Defence supported theconclusion of the Home Defence Review Committee and was considering a reorganisation of the reserve army for military dutiesoverseas on the assumption that no units were retained for homedefence. The maintenance of a home defence role for the reservearmy would require the recasting of these plans with a substantial
reduction of the saving involved to about  8- 10 million. more over it would be difficult to secure the primary advantage of militaryforces for home defence purposes, namely discipline in a cohesiveorganisation, if reserve units were raised solely for assistance to thecivil defence services and the Ministry of Defence would see serious objection to raising a force of this nature since it might adversely affect volunteering for the reserve army units required for purely military duties. Nevertheless, some members of the ministerial committee urged that the TA should be retained primarily for homedefence purposes on the ground that the preservation of order afternuclear attack would be seriously imperilled if it were disbanded.The alternative courses were thus either:(i) to accept that expenditure on the reserve forces could notbe justified solely on home defence grounds and toexamine other arrangements for assisting the police inthe event of nuclear attack; or(ii) to retain the home defence role of the reserve forces witha consequent loss of saving of up to  20 million a yeardepending on the scale of forces to be provided.His own view was that the requirements of civil defence made itnecessary to retain the home defence role. Other issues of policyrelating to our future home defence policy were being considered separately and would be brought before the Cabinet at a later stage.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the requirements forthe maintenance of government after nuclear attack must necessarily be speculative. It was impossible to be sure what forces would beavailable in case of need, or whether there would have been time tocall up the TA before the attack was made. The Government couldnot prepare for every contingency and the present risk of nuclearwar was not such as to justify an expenditure of  20 million a year on the civil defence role of the TA. Moreover, the TA had never been informed that its main function would be to aid the police inthe maintenance of order after attack. Such an announcement would seriously damage recruitment and would hamper the reorganisation of the reserve forces for their military role. Nor would it be practicable to recruit a force exclusively for a civil defence role. Adecision was urgently required, since it would be necessary to putproposals to Ministers on the reorganisation of the reserve forces and make a statement in Parliament before the Recess if consultations with the Territorial Associations were to be completed in time fora Bill introduced in the next Session.In discussion there was some support for the view that the homedefence role of the TA should be retained. Without such forces itwould be impracticable for the police to maintain order, or safeguardstocks of food, particularly in substantial areas of Great Britainsuch as Scotland and Wales, where no Regular Forces were normallystationed. The balance of view was, however, that the saving thatwould be obtained by the reorganisation of the reserve forces to
exclude a home defence role was essential if the necessary economies in defence expenditure were to be obtained. Moreover, on defencegrounds alone some reorganisation of these forces was required andthis could not satisfactorily be carried out if the TA were to retain their present role. In addition, there might, even from the homedefence view, be advantage in considering alternative means more directly associated with the local authorities for preserving public order after attack, since it was doubtful whether in the event it wouldbe practicable to call out the TA in time to enable it to assume itscivil defence function.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion was that expenditure on the reserve forces couldnot be justified solely on home defence grounds. The Secretary ofState for Defence should consider the reorganisatoin of the forcesaccordingly and circulate proposals to the Ministers concerned fortheir consideration. It would also be necessary to examine other arrangements for assisting the police to maintain order in the eventof nuclear attack. The implications of this decision for our futurecivil defence policy would in the first instance be the task of theHome Defence Review Committee and subsequently for considera-tion by the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence. Meanwhile, itwas of great importance that secrecy should be maintained on theconclusions which had been reached on the future of the reserve forces until such time as a public statement could be made.The Cabinet (1) Approved alternative (a) in paragraph 12 of C (65) 86.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to circulate to theMinisters concerned his proposals for the consequentialreorganisation of the reserve forces.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in the light of the PrimeMinisters summing up, to arrange for the ministerial committee on Civil Defence to consider the possibilityof making other arrangements for assisting the police inthe preservation of order in the event of nuclear attack.Sunday 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeObservance     Secretary (C (65) 84) on Sunday Observance.The Home Secretary said that the report of the departmentalcommittee on the Law on Sunday Observance had been published in December and subsequently debated in both Houses of Parliament.In debate, speedy action on the report had been urged and assurances given that it would not be disregarded. The Committee&apos;srecommendations fell under three heads, relating respectively toentertainment and sport, trading and conditions of employment.Those on trading were being considered in conjunction with apossible amendment of the law relating to week-day shop closing hours. It would be appropriate to have a separate Bill on Sundayentertainment and sport and his proposals related solely to these aspects.
Some of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, relating to thehours of opening public places of entertainment and to the arrange-ments for sports matches had in debate attracted some criticism.There was also strong feeling, particularly in Wales, against theremoval of restrictions. Nevertheless, the Government would besubject to criticism if they failed to introduce legislation. The HomeAffairs Committee had concluded that the best course would befor the Government to introduce a Bill to give full effect tothe Committee&apos;s recommendations on entertainment and sport, butin doing so to make it clear that the Government were not putting forward their own conclusions, but merely giving Parliament anopportunity to pronounce upon them. All decisions would be left toa free vote. Recommendation 31 of the Committee&apos;s reportproposed restrictions on the employment of persons on Sundays inconnection with certain entertainments. While this was essentially amatter of the protection of workers&apos; interests it seemed clear thatany legislation on Sunday observance would be expected to include provisions on this subject and he proposed to consult the Ministerof Labour on this recommendation and include appropriate provision in the proposed Bill. It would be desirable for him to make an early announcement of the Governments intentions.The Secretary of State for Wales said that while he didnot oppose a statement on the lines advocated by the HomeSecretary it would be preferable that this should follow rather thanprecede an announcement of the Governments decision on theintroduction of a Bill for Leasehold Enfranchisement.In discussion there was some support for the view that it wouldbe inadvisable for the Government to give any indication at thepresent time that it would take action on the lines proposed by theHome Secretary. Government sponsorship of a Bill, even in themanner proposed, would be productive of political embarrassmentand would also reduce the Parliamentary time available for thepassage of the Governments own measures. On the other hand itwas argued that since there had been public and Parliamentarypressure for the appointment of the Committee, and since debate in both Houses had shown Parliamentary support for early action to betaken, it was the duty of the Government of the day to provideParliamentary opportunity for this to be done.In further discussion on the manner in which such opportunitymight best be provided, it was suggested that as an alternative tothe Home Secretary&apos;s proposal, Parliamentary time might beprovided for a motion by a Private Member proposing that a Bill beintroduced to carry out the recommendations of the Report. If the motion were carried the Government could then provide assistancein drafting the Bill, but still maintain an attitude of neutrality tothe Committee&apos;s recommendations. If the motion were lost, the issue would not then arise. Alternatively, it might be preferable for theBill to be introduced by a Private Member in Private Members&apos; time.In any event, it would be important to the Governments legislative
programme that no commitment should be made by the Governmentto finding Parliamentary time for the introduction of such a Bill inthe next Session.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion was that some facilities should be provided bythe Government to enable Parliament to take a decision on therecommendations of the Committee&apos;s report, and that this could best be achieved by arranging for the Bill to be introduced in private members&apos; time by a Member successful in the Ballot. In that event,the Government could offer facilities for the drafting of the Bill while maintaining its attitude of neutrality to the Committee&apos;srecommendations. In any event there should be no suggestion thatthe Government would be able to provide Parliamentary time forsuch a Bill in the next Session. The Home Secretary might make astatement in Parliament accordingly on the next convenient opportunity.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to make a parliamentary statement on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister inhis summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st July, 1965.
