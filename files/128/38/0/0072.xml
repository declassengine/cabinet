TOP  SECRET *copy No...LAND VALUES(previous preference:C^I.(64) 34thConclusions,Minute 7)cabinet confidential annex cm. (64) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 4Tuesday. 28th July, 1964 at 10. 30 a,m.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (CP,(64) 145) on land values.THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTrecalled that the Cabinet had decided at their earlier discussion that, while it might prove desirable to introduce a tax on profitsarising from the sale or development of land, it would be unwise to make any immediate announcement on the subject and that further consideration should be given by the Ministers concerned to the form in which the Governments intentions might be announced at a later stage.    There were now indications, however,that the issue might assume considerable prominence in the nearfuturej and Ministers might therefore be embarrassed if theywere unable to disclose the Governments intentions.    There wasno doubt that public opinion was disturbed by the high profitsaccruing as the result of public decisions relating to planning anddevelopment;  and it had become apparent that some of theGovernments supporters, together with reputable firms engagedin large-scale development, would welcome a form of tax on landvalues, possibly at a higher level than the Government themselves would contemplate.    The release of more land for development,even in the extreme and unacceptable form of the sacrifice of the green Belt, would reduce prices only marginally; but the public might be willing to accept the fact that the price of a scarcecommodity would remain high if they could be assured that theGovernment intended to levy a charge on profits which would yielda useful revenue while not prejudicing the supply of land.    Thechange of policy could be defended by reference to the new situation created by the much steeper rise in land prices in recent years which had resulted from the Governments own success in stimulating house-building and other forms of development.In discussion it was suggested that to announce in the nearfuture a proposal to introduce a new tax on land values would be liable to be interpreted as an admission that the Government hadbeen mistaken in their policies during the previous twelve years;and it would be difficult to reconcile a decision to sponsor such a tax at this stage with the Governments failure to introduce it inthe Finance Bill which had only been enacted in the last few weeks.-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................... ............. -       4436
The public would find it difficult to understand why the conservative party, which had given such prominence in 1951 to their intentionto abolish the development charge, were now proposing to introduce a similar levy, albeit at a lower level;  and those who were infavour of a charge might well think that a levy as low as theGovernment had in mind would be inadequate as a means ofobtaining for the community an equitable share of the high profitswhich were now being made.    Moreover, a tax on profits derivedfrom the development of land might be regarded as merely theprelude to a full-scale tax on capital gains.    It could not be distinguished from the latter solely on the ground that profitsderived from the development of land were attributable to decisionsof public authorities, since other forms of capital gain mightsimilarly be argued to derive largely from the policies adopted bythe Government in the management of the economy.    The better course, therefore, might be to develop the Government^ existing policies in two main directions.    First, it should be publiclyemphasised that the community already shared in the enhancedvalue of land through the taxation of profits (including the short-term gains tax introduced in 1962) and through the enhancement ofrateable values.    Second, renewed efforts should be made toincrease the supply of land and, in particular, to acquire land in areas expected to be developed through public agencies, which wouldprovide opportunities for development by private enterprise as wellas by public authorities.On the other hand the ptiblic conscience was rightly disturbed by the spectacle of high profits being made merely as a result ofthe selection of a particular area for development; and theGovernment ought to be seen to be taking some part of the profit forthe benefit of the community.    The Government might otherwisesuffer from the resentment generated in the minds of the public bya comparison between the incidence of taxation and of the Government1incomes policy on the ordinary wage and salary earner and the enjoyment of large and apparently untaxed profits by owners anddevelopers of land.    The change of policy could be convincinglydefended on the ground that prices of land had only recentlyincreased steeply, that new sources of revenue were known to benecessary and that informed opinion, including that of somedevelopers, now supported some form of taxation of land values.Public opinion would be more favourably impressed by a change ofpolicy which indicated recognition of the reality of the problemthan by the sophisticated arguments which would have to be deployedin order to justify the maintenance of the existing policy.    Theadministration of a new tax, however, would not be simple; and any announcement of the Governments intention to introduce it should be expressed, at this stage, in general terms.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatit would help the Cabinet to reach a decision if they could consider thedraft of a statement indicating the terms in which the government might announce a decision to introduce a new tax on land values inthe next Parliament and, as an alternative, the draft of a statementindicating the terms in which they might defend a decision to adhere to the existing policies,
The Cabinet -(1)    Invited the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment to circulate alternative drafts of possible statements of policy oh the subjectof land values on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing up.(Z)     Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.bCabinet Office, S.W. 1.28th July, 1964
THE LANGREPORT ONTHE FERRANTICONTRACT3.       The Cabinet had before them:-  (I) a memorandum bythe Minister of Aviation (CP. (64) 15 7) to which was appendedan interim report by Sir John Lang on certain contractsbetween the Ministry of Aviation and Ferranti Limited for theproduction of equipment connected with the Mark I BLOODHOUNDguided weapon systemj  (ii) a Note by the Minister of Aviation(CP. (64) 158) to which were annexed the texts of lettex*sexchanged with Mr. Ferranti, and the draft of a parliamentary statement, on this subject.THE MINISTER OF AVIATION said that the Lang E.eport,which would be published that afternoon, revealed that FerrantiLimited had made a profit of nearly  5f million on fortycontracts, for which the total value of the agreed prices was just over  12, 800, 000.    This represented a return of 82 percent on costs and 45 per cent on selling prices.    The reportcriticised both the Ministry of Aviation in respect of theircontract procedures and Ferranti Limited for submitting quota-tions and agreeing prices which they knew were likely to yieldprofits which could not be regarded as fair and reasonable.    in subsequent discussions the firm had agreed to make a refundof  4tj million in respect of the contracts in question.    Thisagreement had been confirmed in an exchange of lettersbetween Mr. Ferranti and the Permanent Secretary of theMinistry of Aviation, in which the former had been assured that the Ministry had confidence in him, his company and its technical ability and that there would be no discrimination against the company so far as future contracts were concerned.Discussion showed general agreement that, although theGovernment might properly express continuing confidence in the firm&apos;s technical competence and could certainly undertake toexercise no discrimination against them in future, it would be inconsistent with the findings of the Lang Report to expressunreserved confidence in Mr. Ferranti and his company.    Inaddition the reference in the exchange of letters to a refund of 4jj million might be held to be misleading in so far as it implied that the whole of this sum would be paid at once.    In fact, thepayment would be discharged by a number of instalments,extending over several years; and the initial instalment would,in effect, be offset against the refund of tax to which the company would be entitled.    For these reasons it would be desirable forthe letters to be modified in certain respects.    They shouldTOP  SECRET   -1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................................TOP SECRET 1tCopy No.............cabinet confidential annex cm.

HIconfine themselves to stating that it had been agreed that thecompany would refund  4^ million and that arrangements for thedischarge of this liability would be the subject of further dis-cussion.    They should also go no further than assuringMr. Ferranti that there would be no discrimination against thecompany in the allocation of future contracts although this mightbe coupled, if he so wished, with an assurance of theGovernment^ confidence in the firm&apos;s technical ability.    the text of these letters should be circulated in the Official Report,immediately after the statement which the Minister of Aviationwould make that afternoon on the publication of the Lang Report.In further discussion the following points were made -(a) It would be necessary to review, in the light of the LangReport, the procedures in the Ministry of Aviation for the placing of contracts, together with the related question of the adequacy of departmental staffs in general for the supervision of very large contracts involving a high degree of technicalexpertise.(b) The Press had prematurely obtained information aboutthe proposed refund by Ferranti Limited.     Enquiries suggestedthat these disclosures had probably originated not from any official source but from the firm themselves.    It might benecessary to make this clear in public, particularly if mr. Ferranti were willing to confirm it.The Cabinet -(1)     Took note of CP. (64) 157 and 158.(2)    Invited the Minister of Aviation, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor andthe Chancellor of the JSxchequer, to arrangefor the modification of the letters exchangedwith Mr. Ferranti on the lines indicated intheir discussion.(3)    Invited the Minister of Aviation to ascertain whether Mr. Ferranti would confirm that thepremature disclosure to the Press abo\&apos;.t therefund to be made by the company hadoriginated with the company themselves.(4)    Agreed to resume, at a subsequent meeting,their discussion of various issues arisingfrom the Lang Report.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.28th July, 1964-2-
