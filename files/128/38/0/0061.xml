The GeneralElection1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he proposedto advise The Queen that Parliament should be dissolved by proclamation without Prorogation, with a view to the GeneralElection taking place on Thursday, 15th October. Subject to the queen&apos;s consent, an announcement to this effect would be made on tuesday, 15th September.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CM. (64) 47thConclusions)2. The Prime Minister said that further discussion with thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, had revealedmore clearly the difficulties in the way of agreement. It appeared thatMr. Smith wished on his return to Southern Rhodesia to be able tosecure the consent of the African population to independence on thebasis of the present constitution and franchise by means of a seriesof meetings or indabas conducted by the tribal chiefs. We could not accept such a procedure as being an adequate test of African opinion and we must furthermore maintain our insistence on the need forsufficiently representative institutions as a condition of independence.This latter aspect was covered by the first paragraph of the revised draft communique attached to these conclusions, which recordedthat the Prime Ministers had re-stated and explained the respectivepositions of their Governments as already stated in their Parliaments.We must now consider whether the revised draft, to which Mr. smith had not yet agreed, adequately preserved our commitments and reserved our position in respect of the action which we would take in response to any steps by Mr. Smith to seek majority support in southern Rhodesia for independence on the basis of the presentfranchise.In discussion there was general agreement that it was essentialto maintain the insistence of the United Kingdom Government onthe need for sufficiently representative institutions. On the other hand,since the existing constitution and franchise would inevitably leadover a period of years to majority rule, due account would have to betaken of any genuine indication that independence on that basis wouldbe acceptable to the people of Southern Rhodesia as a whole. It wasalso suggested that the present wording of the draft communique,which stated that the people should be given a full opportunity toexpress themselves on the issues involved, might be interpreted ascommitting the United Kingdom Government to the view that a referendum was an indispensable condition of independence and thatthis might be embarrassing either in relation to discussions with anylater Government in Southern Rhodesia or in relation to discussions on independence for other dependent territories. On the other hand the wording would be in accord with the policy adopted throughoutby the United Kingdom Government in such discussions, where the acceptability of a constitution was normally ascertained by meansof a widely representative Constitutional Conference.In further discussion there was general agreement that in thecircumstances in Southern Rhodesia a simple majority, even in anadequately conducted referendum, would not sufficiently representthe agreement of the people of the country as a whole and that dueaccount must be taken of the position of important minority groups,such as the politically-minded urban Africans. Moreover, noreferendum could be acceptable if at the time the opposition Press4957-3a 2
was suppressed and the main African political leaders were in detention. For these reasons it would be necessary for the UnitedKingdom Government fully to reserve their position as regards theaction which they might take even after a referendum the outcome of which was widely favourable to Mr. Smith.Various drafting amendments to the communique were also proposed.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor, to re-draft the proposedcommunique in the light of the points made in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would be guided by their discussion in his further negotiations with Mr. Smith.JOINT COMMUNIQUE TO BE ISSUED AFTER THE talks between THE PRIME MINISTER AND MR. IANSMITH, PRIME MINISTER OF SOUTHERN RHODESIADraft including, in square brackets, variants tabled at the endof the fourth meeting with Mr. Smith on Wednesday, 9th September.There was a full discussion of all aspects of the problem of independence for Southern Rhodesia. The two Prime Ministersre-stated and explained the respective positions of their Governments,as already stated in their Parliaments.The British Prime Minister conveyed to the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia the views expressed at the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers in July as set out in their finalcommunique. The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia for his partmade it clear that he did not feel bound by any of the statements madeat the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting to which he had notbeen invited.The British Prime Minister told the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia that the British Government looked forward to the day when Southern Rhodesia would take her place as an independentSovereign State within the Commonwealth. For their part they were anxious that this should come about as soon as practicable.The British Prime Minister said that the basis on which britain would be prepared to grant independence must be acceptable to thepeople of the country as a whole, who should be given a full opportunity to express themselves on the issues involved &quot;[The BritishGovernment would consider their position in the light of the results.]The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia accepted that independencemust be based on general consent. He stated that he was convincedthat the majority of the population supported his request for independence on the basis of the present constitution and franchise.The British Prime Minister took note of this statement but said thatthe British Government [would require to be satisfied] [had no evidence] that this was the case. The Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia recognised that the British Government were entitled to besatisfied about this and said that he would consider how it could best be demonstrated [so that independence could be granted]. [The british prime Minister said that the British Government must reserve their position until further information was available about the wishes ofthe people of Southern Rhodesia.]
commonwealth immigration(Previous.Reference:CM. (64) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (64) 165) on Commonwealth Immigration.The Home Secretary said that in the 12 months ended 30th June,1964, net immigration from the Commonwealth had totalled 83,000persons, of whom 68,000 were coloured. The country could not continue to absorb coloured immigrants at this rate. But if the ratewere to be substantially reduced it would be necessary for theGovernment to free themselves from some of the pledges given toParliament about the issue of employment vouchers and to take more effective powers by legislation against the evasion of the immigration control. The number of vouchers issued had been reduced from theoriginal figure of 40,000 a year to 21,000 a year and might be further reduced to some 13,000 by confining vouchers to those who eitherpossessed a special scarce skill or were needed in some under-mannedservice, such as public transport, and had a firm prospect ofemployment. Evasion could be reduced by imposing conditions as tothe length of stay on persons claiming to come in as visitors orstudents of whose bona fides the Immigration Officer was in doubt.But this could be effective only if the Home Secretary were given thepower, which he exercised in relation to aliens, to deport those whodisregarded their landing conditions. Even so, the police doubted whether enforcement could be effective without vexatiousrequirements as to photographing and fingerprinting, which wouldnot be acceptable; and it would be necessary to enlist the help ofthe Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Pensions and national insurance in tracing persons who had over-stayed the permitted time.If these proposals were approved, it would be desirable to state the government&apos;s intentions in broad terms before the General Election,on the lines of the draft statement annexed to CP. (64) 365.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be desirable for the present to continue to grantadmission freely to visitors, students and the wives and young children of immigrants. But, in order not to limit the Governmenfs discretionunnecessarily, the words in paragraph 2 of the draft, which committedthe Government to continue to maintain free admission for these classes, should be omitted.(b) It was arguable that men who sought employment in thiscountry might reasonably be expected to maintain their families athome and to return to them in due course, instead of establishingthemselves permanently in this country. On the other hand it wouldbe difficult to justify separating families; and to do so might aggravatesocial problems in areas frequented by coloured workers. In theory itmight be preferable to encourage European immigrants to work in under-manned services; but, since most countries of Europe were themselves short of labour, no considerable relief for our ownshortages could be found by this means.(c) It would be desirable in any public statement to distinguish between the treatment accorded to coloured immigrants in thiscountry and the right to control entry to it. Those already admittedmust be treated without discrimination in accordance with our liberaltraditions. But we were entitled to limit the numbers admitted inorder to prevent the influx of greater numbers than we could absorbwithout creating insoluble social problems; and it was in the interestsof immigrants themselves that measures should be taken to this end.This point should be made at the beginning of the statement in orderthat the necessity for limiting the issue of vouchers and introducingmeasures to prevent evasion could be seen to flow from it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposed statement should be revised in the light of their discussion and held in reserve as a brief for dealing with the questions on this issue which were certain to be put to Ministers at an early stage ofthe Election campaign.
6. SECRET. 0The Cabinet- -Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,to revise the draft statement annexed to CP. (64) 165 in thelight of their discussion.4. The Foreign Secretary said that there were two issues inrespect of Indonesia of which he should inform the Cabinet. The first was that the Security Council had met to discuss the Malaysiancomplaint of Indonesian aggression, particularly through the dropping of parachutists on the mainland of Malaya. The Indonesian government was seeking to counter this with allegations of Britishand Malaysian aggression. The second was that the aircraft carrierH.M.S. Victorious was shortly due, on her return from Australia, topass through the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. although there was a right of innocent passage through the Strait, the indonesian Government were seeking to prevent her passage on theexcuse of Indonesian naval manoeuvres in the area.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, independently ofthe difficulty which might arise over the passage of H.M.S. Victorious,reinforcements were being sent to Malaysia in consequence of the pledges which had been given to the Malaysian Government thatsuch help would be provided if further attacks were made on the mainland of Malaya. As regards H.M.S. Victorious, there would bea substantial gain in prestige for President Sukarno if he wereeffectively to deny to our naval forces the right of passage throughthe Sunda Strait; and this might be a prelude to his seeking to closeother waters in the neighbourhood of Indonesia to ships of the royal navy. His own first inclination had been to propose that the aircraft carrier should therefore pass through the Strait as originally planned.This would, however, involve a substantial risk to a major naval unit.A passage through the Strait involved traversing Indonesian territorial waters for a stretch of some 30 miles, during which the carrier, bynormal convention, neither flew its aircraft nor maintained them ondeck. The narrowness of the waters would hinder the freedom of theship to manoeuvre, while its radar would be blinded by the hills on either side of the Strait. Although it was probable that in that eventno offensive action would be taken against her by Indonesian forces,both the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, and the British HighCommissioner in Kuala Lumpur had advised against this course. he therefore proposed that after the end of the present debate in theSecurity Council H.M. Ambassador in Djakarta should inform the indonesian authorities that, in view of the Indonesian naval exercises,it was recognised that it might be inconvenient for H.M.S. Victoriousto pass through the Strait and that she would therefore return by aroute passing north of Sumatra. On the other hand we should maintain the right of innocent passage by sending two of the escortdestroyers through the Strait on their return to Singapore. H.M.S.Victorious would be escorted on her own journey by a missile ship and would station herself south of the Sunda Strait, where she couldcover the passage of the destroyers. We must recognise that, if these were attacked, it would be an act of war and that we should haveto retaliate in force, not merely against the attacking forces but alsoagainst the bases from which they came, including the airfield atDjakarta.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Indonesianauthorities had announced their intention of holding naval exerciseson both sides of the Sunda Strait. The proposal to station H.M.S.Victorious about a hundred miles south of the Strait would not,however, interfere with them. There would be no means of ensuring that her aircraft would be available for the defence of the destroyersForeignAffairsIndonesia(previous reference:CM. (64) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)
Cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 45thConclusions,Minute 1)in the Strait before any attack was launched; but they would beavailable to assist in their defence, though this could not guarantee in all circumstances that the destroyers might not be sunk.Nevertheless, in view of the substantial gain to President Sukarnoif he were to be successful in denying us the right of passage throughthe Strait and in view of the danger of his then denying to our ships the use of other waters, there was general agreement with the proposal of the Secretary of State for Defence. It was recognised that, in viewof their other preoccupations, we could not expect assistance from united States forces if this resulted in hostilities.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Defence should arrangefor H.M.S. Victorious, on her return from Australia, topass north of Sumatra and for two of her escort destroyersto pass through the Sunda Strait.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to reviewConclusion (1) above in consultation with the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary, in the light of thecurrent situation, before the destroyers actually passed through the Strait.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for defence, to inform the United States, Australian and NewZealand Governments of Conclusion (1) above.(4) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary might, at his discretion,arrange for an appropriate warning to be conveyed toBritish subjects in Indonesia that they should be readyto be evacuated.The Foreign Secretary said that the Cyprus Government had agreed unconditionally to the continuation of the United nations force in Cyprus and had not sought the withdrawal from it of the United Kingdom unit. It appeared that some other nationsparticipating in the force, in particular the Canadian Government,might be unwilling to continue unless the United Kingdom unit wereto remain. We had made it clear that we were not very willing tocontinue and could therefore readily withdraw later if we were askedto do so. In these circumstances he considered that the balance ofadvantage lay in maintaining our contribution to the force.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Anglo-French 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofMissile Aviation (CP. (64) 168) on the air-to-surface tactical strike weaponAgreement       A.J.168.The Minister of Aviation said that for some two and a half years there had been a requirement for an air-to-surface stand-off tacticalstrike weapon, to be carried by the TSR.2, the Buccaneer and possiblyother aircraft. It had originally been estimated that the cost ofdevelopment might be as much as  50 million; and it had therefore been agreed to seek joint production with the French Government,with whom a Memorandum of Understanding for this purpose had now been signed. The arrangements provided for the equal sharingof the development cost and work. The weapon was primarily foruse in limited war and would carry high explosive warheads; butthe United Kingdom requirement called for the design to be such
as to permit subsequent nuclear application if required. This aspecthad not been discussed with the French, nor was it referred to in theMemorandum of Understanding. The French would no doubt seekalso to provide for subsequent nuclear application; but it was doubtful if at this stage they would technically be in a position to achieve this.Approval had been given for the project in correspondence betweenthe Secretary of State for Defence and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.The confidential policy estimate of cost to the United Kingdom was 20-24 million, which included a large contingency item disclosedneither to the French nor to United Kingdom industry. It was unfortunate that Mr. Cronin, M.P., who had had a misleading accountof this development in France, had, despite being given the true factsby the Ministers Private Secretary, referred in a public speech to theweapon costing  100 million and carrying a nuclear warhead. this had immediately been corrected by the Minister in a Press conference.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (64) 168.6. The Minister of Aviation said that the Chairman of british overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) was proposing to providevery generous severance terms for B.O.A.C. staff who were redundantbecause of reorganisation. This would have unfortunate repercussions on other nationalised industries. In the absence of the Chairmanoverseas, the Deputy Chairman had arranged to hold a meeting inthe near future with the unions concerned for the discussion of these terms.The Minister of Transport said that the terms proposed were far more generous than those provided by British Railways for redundantstaff under their recent scheme of reorganisation and would havewidespread repercussions not only on nationalised industries but also on private industry.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, while there wasno statutory power to prevent B.O.A.C. paying such terms, the cost would, in view of the current deficit of the Corporation, come from public funds. It was therefore desirable that the implications of theproposals, both in terms of cost to the Exchequer and in terms ofindustrial repercussions, should be fully considered by Ministersbefore any statement was made by the Corporation to the unions concerned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Aviation to seek the agreement of the deputy Chairman of B.O.A.C. to the postponement ofthe meeting between the Corporation and the unions untilthe issues had been further considered by Ministers.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to give urgent consideration tothe measures proposed by B.O.A.C and to submit theirviews to the Prime Minister.SeveranceTerras for.O.A.C. StaffContinental 7.   The Minister of Power said that  a large number  ofShelf: applications had been received from both United Kingdom andLicences foreign oil companies for licences under the Continental Shelf Actfor exploration and exploitation in the United Kingdom part of theNorth Sea. Letters of intent had been sent to a number of these
incomes 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChiefPolicy Secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 166), proposing a new initiative on incomes policy.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while recent economicevents had underlined the necessity for our costs and prices to remaincompetitive, progress in securing an agreed incomes policy, whichwas essential for this purpose, had been disappointingly slow. It wouldbe essential after the Election for the Government to engage in discussions to this end with both sides of industry, not through theNational Economic Development Council, whose members did notserve as representatives, but with individuals who were in a positionto give undertakings on behalf of the employers and unionsrespectively. It was therefore proposed that after the Election bothsides of industry should be asked to join the Government in aconference to discuss incomes policy. If this were agreed, it was forconsideration whether the Governments intention to take such an initiative should be announced before the Election. In the absence ofsome such announcement the presentation of the Government^economic policies was undoubtedly incomplete; and they might beopen to criticism subsequently if they had failed to draw attention,before the Election, to an important step which they had known itwould be necessary to take after their return. On the other hand to4957-3bCM. 47 (64)companies setting out the conditions (already agreed in discussion)on which the Minister would be prepared to grant a licence. Formalacceptances had either been received or were expected shortly. Inthe upshot, approximately one-third of the United Kingdom part ofthe North Sea would be allocated, some 30 per cent of the areagoing to United Kingdom companies and 10 per cent to Canadiancompanies. In the particularly favoured area, approximately 40 percent would be allocated to United Kingdom-controlled companies.All the companies concerned were required to be registered in theUnited Kingdom and would be subject to United Kingdom tax.They would be committed to spending a sum of  80 million onexploration and drilling; and orders for equipment to the value of 14 million had already been placed with British industry. Theroyalty rate would be 12Jr per cent; but, in view of the liability to united Kingdom tax, the total return to the United KingdomGovernment would be marginally higher than the return at presentreceived by Middle Eastern Governments from the oil companies operating in that area. He proposed to make an announcement of the allocations shortly in order to enable work to be carried out in thecourse of the next two months.In discussion it was suggested that, valuable though this development might be, it would be undesirable at this stage torepresent it as a major long-term strengthening of the UnitedKingdom economic position, since the oil companies concerned were at present sceptical of the likelihood of oil or natural gas being foundin large quantities.In further discussion it was agreed that the announcement of the allocations could best be made in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Power aboutapplications for licences under the Continental Shelf Act.(2) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to announce theallocation of the licences on Thursday, 17th September.
make known their intentions at present might cause the trade unions to adopt a negative attitude from which it would be difficult for themto move later on. Nevertheless, the balance of advantage seemed to lie in giving an indication of what was in the Governments mind,perhaps in the course of a speech by the Prime Minister or theChancellor of the Exchequer (who was in agreement with theseproposals), shortly after the date of the Election had been announced.In discussion it was suggested that a statement on the lines suggested in the Annex to CP. (64) 166 might not make an impression on the public at large but might have the disadvantage of attractingthe hostility of the trade unions and of sharpening the criticism ofthe Governments policy on land values and on rents. On the otherhand the topic was one on which Ministers were certain to be questioned; and it therefore seemed preferable that the Governmentshould take the initiative in making their intentions known. this might be done relatively inconspicuously in the course of a speechby the Chancellor of the Exchequer shortly before he was due to holda Press conference in London, in order that he might take theopportunity on that occasion to give a further explanation of theGovernments views.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be unwise to commit the Government at the present stage to calling a conferenceon the lines proposed, since it might be found more profitable to engage in discussions with the two sides of industry separately.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that it would on balance be wise to volunteera statement of the Governments intention to take a new initiativetowards the achievement of an effective incomes policy but that theyshould not commit themselves to any particular form of discussionwith the two sides of industry. A statement might be made shortly after the dissolution of Parliament in the course of a speech by theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to. the terms in which the Governments intention to consult both sides of industry on incomes policy could be announced.Industrial 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the disputes Minister of Labour (CP. (64) 167) about the negotiations on the docks: Wages   current claim for an increase in dockers1 wages.(Previous The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the presentReference: position of the negotiations on a wages claim put forward in theC.C. (62) 33rd spring by the dockers&apos; unions. The unions had asked originally for conclusions, an increase of 10s. a day in the time rate (later reduced to 5s.) and a minute 3) 5 per cent increase in piece rates. The employers&apos; side of the national joint Council for the Port Transport Industry had eventually putforward as their final offer an increase of 2s. 6d. a day in the timerate and 3i per cent on piece rates, together with an increase in theminimum guaranteed wage from  7 16s. 9d. to  9. They had alsoundertaken to improve later in the year, as part of a general reviewof the wage structure, the wages of the small percentage of dockerswith the lowest earnings. These proposals, together with increases in pay resulting from the introduction of the 40-hour week in July1964 gave an average increase of 3 - 9 per cent per annum since August1962. They had, however, been rejected at a delegate conference on 3rd September; and the negotiators had been instructed to seekauthority from the union executives for strike action. The constitutionof the National Joint Council required the unions to give four weeks&apos;m
notice to terminate an agreement and the parties to meet immediately on such notice being given to discuss the position. Failing agreementduring the four weeks, the unions must give a further two weeks&apos;notice to strike. The unions had asked for a meeting of the national joint Council in the week beginning 14th September, which suggestedthat they were anxious to prevent the matter coming to an issue until after the General Election. There was some risk, however, of unofficial strikes resulting from the rivalry between the two principal unions in the industry. It would not be appropriate for the Ministry ofLabour to intervene while the constitutional procedure took itscourse; but the position would be reviewed following the meeting ofthe National Joint Council.In discussion it was pointed out that the dispute in the docksmight present the first occasion after the Election on which theGovernment, if returned to office, would be called upon to demonstrate their determination to pursue an effective incomes policy.In view of this, and of the risk of unofficial strikes, it would be prudent to make, during the interval, any preparations which might benecessary to deal with a withdrawal of labour.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, as Chairman of the emergencies committee, to ensure that any necessary preparations fordealing with a dock strike were put in hand.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th September, 1964.
